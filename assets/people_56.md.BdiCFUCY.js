I suppose there are two possible interpretations of the plot: a slightly magical interpretation and a mundane one.In either case, the book follows the reminiscences of Billy Pilgrim, who was a hapless young recruit to the US Army in WW2, swiftly becoming a hapless young prisoner of war in Dresden, surviving the firebombing of the city by sheer luck, going home, training as dentist, getting middle aged, and surviving a head injury in a plane crash. From his daughter's viewpoint his head injury unhinges him slightly and makes him have worrying hallucinations about travelling through time. From his viewpoint they aren't hallucinations, and he has always had them: throughout his life he has sometimes, without warning, jumped through time to a different point in his own existence, and then jumped back. Not only that but he has been kidnapped by aliens and kept in a zoo on their home planet. Is Billy right, or is he a damaged and deluded individual? We'll never know."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I love this book; Vonnegut even places my small town on the map within the first pages of &#34;The Children's Crusade&#34; (AKA &#34;Slaughterhouse-Five&#34;).

Billy Pilgrim gets lost in this quintessential Vonnegut story, trying to make sense of the irrational and the horrific. The contrast between crazy (as in psychotic) war and banal (as in stultifying) life at home is too much for the poor man's mind, and he wanders through time and place.If you want to understand what makes Vonnegut a cult hero, and what makes Vonnegut worth the read, this is a good place to start. You will meet strange creatures, and wonder what side they are on. You will meet two dimensional characters, and wonder how they capture so many sides of us. You will be disoriented. You will be surprised. You will be dismayingly unsurprised. People will die horribly, and you will find yourself smiling ironically. And so it goes."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I wanted to read this book simply because it was one of the classics I'd always heard about but somehow missed reading in school. (Catch-22 and To Kill a Mockingbird are on that list too.) Once I started reading it, I had a hard time putting it down. It's an easy read, and a difficult one all at once: well-written but confusing. The time-traveling that Billy Pilgrim does is however not at all confusing, and I can't express how impressive that is; his story is all over the place but always makes sense. And knowing that the author really experienced parts of this story makes it even more powerful. It gets confusing though when some characters seem both real and caricatured at the same time, or when Pilgrim's belief in alien abduction and time travel start melding with sci-fi books he's read, or events that have happened to him, and it's never clear if he's truly experiencing time travel or if it's all some kind of post-traumatic stress after his experiences in World War II. I have a feeling that, for the point Vonnegut was trying to make, it doesn't really matter.I have to agree with those who say this isn't just an anti-war novel. It is anti-war, but it doesn't brow-beat, and it seems to me to be more about the absurdity and cruelty of people in general, not just during wartime. To take the Tralfamadorians as an extension of humanity, they refuse to observe anything that upsets them; they only pay attention to times that are beautiful and happy. And in doing so, they refuse to stop the destruction of the universe, which is caused by one of their own. They know it will happen, and how; but they don't want to think about it. This idea can certainly be applied to war, and especially to World War II in more ways than one; but it can also be easily applied to anyone in everyday life.I wish I'd read this book in high school, but I'm glad I read it now. There are some cases of swearing and sexuality, so I wouldn't recommend it to a younger audience. But otherwise, I recommend it."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"The book itself is really good. The condition wasn't the best, but it was advertised that way.

He is kept in Slaughterhouse number 5 where he and other prisoners and even the guards hide during the bombing of Dresden.Billy has another real problem though, he is unstuck in time and he travels back and forth randomly between past and future events. He sees his future life, death and struggles. He even knows how and when he will die. He is even captured by aliens and kept in a zoo for their amusement.....This is one of Kurt Vonnegut's classic novels and it was made into a movie. The storyline jumps so much in time that the protagonist can jump 20 of more years back and forth in pages. The book is just a story of one man's life and experiences along the way but told in a very random manner. There is no real plot to the story except about the tragedy of war and human nature and how people interact.In many ways the book is about Kurt Vonnegut's experiences during WWII and trying to describe the horror of war and the useless loss of life. He obviously abhorred what he had seen and he wanted to present his thoughts in a story. The story moves all around and changes times and themes so many times you may get lost. I believe that this was Kurt Vonnegut's way of depicting that war makes no sense.This book is an interesting milestone is Kurt Vonnegut's career and it has been proclaimed by many to be one of the best novels of 20th century American literature. I believe you should read this and make your own decisions about it, (and so it goes!)"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"It's hard to say whether I liked this book. It was paced well, and had a lot of deep insights into the horrors of war. On the other hand, the horrors of war are depressing, and so was this book.I was never sure if I liked the main character. He was almost like two different characters. Possibly three. I think if I had liked the protagonist more, I would have liked the book better.Even though it is sci-fi, it also had a strongly literary bent. Possibly not my style. I'm less interested in people living in the real world, and with one small change, this story would not be sci-fi at all. It was about real people living in real history doing real things, with some weird stuff going on in order to tell the story in a weird order. There were no amazing new ideas about the possibilities of technology, no twists. This book was about war, pure and simple.But it is a story that needs to be told, about the bombing of Dresden, about WWII, about how crappy it all is. There were many deep political and philosophical insights, and this was done very well, thematically and symbolically, as well as through the prose."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I love Vonnegut and this is my favorite Vonnegut book. I'm sure there's nothing I can say about his work that hasn't already been said but I'll try anyway. Like previous Vonnegut books, the plot involves a pseudo sci-fi premise but the novel is really about Vonnegut's observations regarding human behavior in the face of a chaotic universe over which we have no control. His protagonist encounters cruelty and hatred everywhere he goes, but also kindness and the chance for a little dignity in the most unexpected places. Nobody can describe the absurdity (and sheer horror) of the human condition with a liberal dose of black humor and manage to sneak in the slightest hint of optimism like Kurt Vonnegut.James Pratt, author of 'When Dead Gods Dream: A Collection of Lovecraftian Short Stories'"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"One of the most brilliant books of all time.

I would recommend \\"Cat's Cradle\\" as it is told in a more linear fashion, but introduces a lot of Vonnegut's thematic elements well.Vonnegut has several themes in all of his books. Time and the nature of time is a frequent theme. He also explores the concept of monogamous ecstasy, the twining of two people physically, intellectually, emotionally into a 'nation of two' that is a bond nothing can break. He also shows contempt for the wealthy and the poor in equal portions, finding fault with both conditions with occasional saving graces. He is anti-war, anti-conflict, but, as is the moral in \\"Mother Night\\" most of his books are cautionary tales that remind us all that we are who we pretend to be, so we need to be very careful who we pretend to be. In most books his narrator or his 'hero' is buffeted by events rather than being a mover, shaker, influential, important. They are all almost always observers and commentators whose lives are overshadowed by what is happening around them rather then by the choices they make. One exception being \\"Mother Night\\".Slaughter House Five is one of my favorites because Billy, though being unstuck in time, learns to accept his life as a series of events that he controls at some times and that is pummeled by forces so large and so small that the end result is little control over anything. This ranges from his wife's never ending battle of the bulge to the fire bombing at Dresden. While an anti-war novel, it is also an anti-apathy novel. Billy accepts all things because he has come to see his life, not a series of events in which he is the prime mover, but as a millipede, ordained, foredoomed, without purpose.He is not an example, he is a cautionary tale. He does nothing to save or help or change, he goes along for the ride and blames being unstuck in time for his apathy. How sad. His constant returning to important and deeply tragic events, like the bombing, instead of staying constantly within his time with Dallas is the picture of regret and shame.Do something, is my personal take away from the novel. You do have choices, you must make your choices based not only on your personal comforts and well being, but as a part of a larger whole, as a player in a vast cosmos in which you may not matter, but you probably do."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"If you haven't read it read it.

There, Billy is placed in what would be akin to a zoo in America, where the Tralfamadadorians are privy to watch his every move. But Billy doesn't always stay there. He finds himself going back and forward in time, returning to his childhood, jumping forward to when he was a prisoner of war during WWII and kept in a slaughterhouse (Slaughterhouse-Five) in Dresden until its destruction by bombs, and even as far into the future as his own death, then back to Tralfamadore where he is mated with a porn star from America. And all over again.This classic is part fact and part fiction, the factual portion taken from Vonnegut's own experiences as a prisoner of war in Dresden before and after its firebombing. And in its telling, one wonders if this is the only way Vonnegut could relay his experiences as a soldier and subsequent prisoner of war by implanting small bits and pieces among the other experiences of Billy Pilgram. After all, Vonnegut states at the beginning that he had been planning on writing about the war but could never actually get it finished."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Mr. Vonnegut is one of my favorite authors. He had a different way of viewing life and can make me laugh out loud on a bus while reading his work. Slaughterhouse is trying to reason with the devastation of war. Why this and why that.

I saw:That war destroys everyone involved.People have become a small unenlightened race of beings.We are all in a galactic zoo.And More"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This book is full of marvelous phrases. You could quote it forever. But the thing that stands out most of this quite-short book, is the voice of the narrator. Vonnegut shrewdly stands aside from the main narrative, even though ostensibly this is based on his experience of being a POW and the bombing of Dresden. But he just appears at the beginning and the end, kind of framing the narrative in which he uses an absurd character as his protagonist, only implying here and there that he, too, was standing next to him and living much of the same experiences.The amazing thing is how he manages to make such an anti-war manifesto from a narrative that is so humane and touching, without feeling sorry for himself or pontifying. He uses the absurd to remark on the absurdity of it all, and focuses on both awful and beautiful moments to make it all the more poignant.Another high point is his use of flashbacks and flashforwards as an actual plot point, making his character go back and forth in time, illuminating different aspects of his story so as not to focus solely on 'the bad parts'.It's a solid, solid little book, one which leaves you thinking and feeling different while establishing a voice that makes it a very personal affair."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Many of the bad reviews seem to be from disappointed customers who heard this book lauded as an anti-war novel and, after reading, felt cheated because that was not the case. And to this I say, yes. You are correct.To understand this book, you have to read the first chapter, which (though unrelated to the plot of the rest of the story) explains why the novel was written. Vonnegut wrote the story because he was sick of hearing \\"war novels\\" that romanticized, overglorified, or hyperbolized war. He was trying to show how boring, nonsensical, and pointless war is, and he did that through a book that is (in the best way) boring, nonsensical, and pointless.If you're reading this book for the plot, I'll concede, it can be a little bland at times, and if you read it with the wrong expectations it seems juvenile, but overall I thought it was an impressive, well executed, and unique piece of literature."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"A lot of people say that this book is a very simple and easy read. And that's true, to an extent. But don't let that fool you, as it is one of the most layered, intertwined complicated books I've ever read. I've never read a book that flows so easily, and manages to parallel its own self as the plot is revealed piece-by-piece. I have to give a little *spoiler* to make my next point. At one point in the novel, the main character learns about literature that is written by this alien species that abducts him, the Tralfamadorians. Their books, they explain, are not written like Earth books. Instead of moving from beginning to middle to end, with causality peppered throughout, their books are instead printed on a single page. The reader reads all these different events, emotions, and ideas simultaneously, in order to get the full experience.I would argue that Vonnegut's book is an attempt to be \\"Tralfamadorian' in its style. If you are patient, and are open-minded to reading such a non-linear storyline, the reward in the end, I think, is something similar to what the Tralfamadorians would experience when they read their literature. It's an absolutely amazing book that'll make you cry in one sentence, lose all hope in humanity in the next two, and laugh in the sentence after."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Love this line...\\"The gun made a ripping sound like the opening of the zipper on the fly of God Almighty.\\"...Describing the aftermath of a car crash...\\"...the rear end of the Cadillac was a body-and-fender man's wet dream.\\"The novel as a whole, to me, was the perfect description of PTSD.

I read the first several pages in the store and found it the most interesting of the books I was considering buying. That being said I was glad it was short and I could finish it quickly. I can see the reasons why it's considered a classic, but I just didn't find it very interesting. The irony and fatalistic spirit are indeed darkly humorous. For three quarters of the book, I couldn't help but chuckle at the line \\"So it goes\\", but I did get tired of that too by the end. There were some absolutely brilliant sentences. Some of the vignettes held absolutely amazing ideas that would be fun to develop into a full novel."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Like with Margaret Atwood's books, there's really nothing I can add to the torrents of praise for Kurt Vonnegut's work, including his seminal, funny, wry, unsparing, wicked, tragic, moral tale \\"Slaughterhouse 5.\\" [I read it a million years ago and thought I should reread it.]\\"Yo, yo,\\" said one, nodding dreamily. \\"Yo, yo.\\"The narrative keeps circling towards the firebombing of Dresden, in between visits to the alien planet of Tralfamadore, the last harrowing days of World War II, and suburban living in the years following.\\"They were catatonic with disgust.\\"We see most of these events through the eyes of the hapless and wretched Billy Pilgrim, a man as foolish as he is utterly human.\\"I hope that we'll meet again in a world of peace and freedom in the taxi cab if the accident will.\\"Mr. Vonnegut's unpitying prose is often luminous, always lancing. I'll leave you with this fabulous line:\\"Well, here we are, Mr. Pilgrim, trapped in the amber of this moment. There is no why.\\""},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"There are two words to describe this book: weird and wonderful. You could substitute \\"quirky\\" for weird if you want, because that's what \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" is: a very quirky, oddball adventure through time and space. And it contains a valuable message if you decide to believe in the Tralfamadore view of things. I rather like their perspective that because someone was alive at some point then they are ALWAYS living, at least somewhere. (Though I suppose it's only comforting when you apply that to good people, because that definition also means that Hitler and other evildoers are always living somewhere too.)The novel begins with the author struggling to find a way to tell the story of his experience in World War II as a prisoner of war and witness to the firebombing of Dresden, which took more lives (at least immediately) than the atomic bomb. He visits a friend and finally turns in a jumbled-up mess to the publisher.This jumbled-up mess is the story of Billy Pilgrim who is (or thinks he is) unstuck in time. Because of this, his life is in shuffle mode, so to speak, where he randomly shifts from one point in time to another. At one point he might be standing in a field in Germany during the war, at another he's talking to the Lions club in upstate New York, and at another he's a baby in his mother's arms. Told chronologically, Billy enters the war near the end, gets captured, witnesses the bombing of Dresden, gets repatriated after the war, marries a large, rich woman named Valencia, has a couple kids, runs a successful optometry business, and gets taken to the Tralfamadore homeworld to be put in a zoo with a porn star. Billy even sees how he is going to die.If the book were related chronologically and if Vonnegut didn't have such a way with language--his sentences lack poetic prose, but have the same quirky, seemingly random rhythm as the plot--then this book wouldn't have been nearly as interesting. The way it's jumbled up forces the reader to keep putting the pieces together, although Vonnegut has a tendency to over-foreshadow some things like the teapot incident. And the style makes reading a breeze because it's very relatable for the average vocabulary--no big words to confuse people.The only real flaw is the overuse of the expression \\"so it goes\\" to mark anytime a person, place, or thing dies. Wikipedia's article on the book says there are 106 references. It seemed like many more. I understand what Vonnegut was going for, but it did get irritating before long.I should warn you, though, that even if the sentences are easy to read, you do need to be the type of reader who can put up with the quirky nature of the book to read it. So it's not recommended to everyone. If you're up to putting together a puzzle and like a little sci-fi with your literature, then you'll be fine. Maybe you won't agree with Vonnegut and the Tralfamadore's view of the universe--maybe you like to believe in free will--but you should still be able to appreciate what a creative feat this book was and what a great author wrote it.That is all."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Wow - little nervous about the flaming I might receive for giving this less than the full 5 stars. It's a good book, and is a 'compelling work of art,' but we're not talking Crime and Punishment here. The art of the book, I guess, is that Vonnegut created a fun to read (albeit bizarre) fatalistic world that somehow, in the midst of the sci-fi and light humor, portrays the horror of Dresden (but not with the force of a traditional straightforward delivery, in my view). If read aloud, one senses that a dull monotone is appropriate. The world of this book is fatalistic, ironic, and ultimately without point. Like 'Groundhog Day,' reality is on an endless loop, and Billy Pilgrim glides in and out of the planes of time without control or pain. I have to admit that I didn't really get all of the nonsense about aliens and time travel and all that, but I did see that Pilgrim is portrayed as (I think) the only human in the world who really understood what was going on, and everyone else was a tragic actor in a stupid and violent play. For me, I could not get over-the-top gaga about the book - there is too much absurdity for that to happen. And while it is not an endorsement of war, certainly, its message of anti-war is lost a bit in the clutter. Give Vonnegut some leeway; he was probably stoned out of his mind while he wrote this. Anyway, KV had a nice conversational style and this is an enjoyable book. 4 Stars."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"In my \\"old age\\", I've taken up listening to audio books on my MP3 player while doing brain dead activities. Because 2007 is the Year of Vonnegut in central Indiana and because of his recent passing, I'm revisiting Vonnegut's books that I had read while in college. Slaughterhouse Five may be better now than it was then. However, that's a chicken and egg arguement. And it's an opinion based on a lifetime of experience. Nevertheless, Vonnegut's writings are just as timely now as they were when he first penned them.Unfortunately, only a few of KV's books have been burned on CD's. Hopefully more will show up soon.After the end of the reading, there's an interview with KV where he explains that Billy Pilgrim is NOT him, but was based on someone else he knew while in WWII."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I greatly enjoyed this book and thought it posited an interesting theme; that time, at least the way most of us conceptualize it, does not actually exist.Vonnegut presents this idea through the experiences of the main character, Billy Pilgrim, who is said to have become \\"unstuck in time.\\" Throughout the book, Billy's present surroundings constantly fluctuate between his past, present, and future self (or selves). He also spends time on the planet Tralfamadore, where the inhabitants see time in four dimensions, accept their futures as unchangeable (because they've already seen them), and are aghast when Billy questions them about free will.Consequently, Billy develops a fatalistic irreverence towards life and shrugs off seemingly catastrophic events with an attitude wholly captured by Vonnegut's go-to phrase \\"so it goes.\\" To the reader, his attitude is often very humorous, particularly when it's juxtaposed against the worrywort nature of other characters.Initially, one assumes this form of nihilism is a shot against religion; however, to Christians adhering to a Lutheran, and to a greater extent Calvinistic, interpretation of predestination and free will, Vonnegut's them isn't so bizarre. In fact, it may even be a challenge to those Christians to live like the Tralfamadorians, free of worry and anxiety because they too already know their fate.Cool book. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This book does not have as much comic relief as Vonnegut's wonderfully entertaining Cat's Cradle or Breakfast of Champions - after all the story tries to explain the awful effect of war on the human condition as his main character, Billy Pilgrim, survives the bombing of Dresden during World War II. Yet, his clever way of giving the reader the perspective of his characters and of injecting his own insight, will keep you turning the pages. There is no doubt in my mind that reading all of Vonnegut's works will make you laugh, cry, and most importantly - think."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"The book seemed very interesting. The only problem I had was understanding what was going on. There were too many time jumps for me. The characters in the book were really cool but the way that Kurt Vonnegut wrote the book stunk. My teacher told me that he wrote this book to make our minds have twisted thougths like the soldiers have after they go through something like Billy did. Overall the book wasn't that great."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"There were many bright ideas in here. The Tralfamadorian ability to see all points of life, which made death a nonissue; Billy Pilgrim's ability to time travel; his abduction and placement in a controlled environment, suggesting our vulnerability to distorted or incomplete information; war commentary from the mouth of a vet- the confused notion of \\"meaning\\" in life when war unwincingly slaughters little girls in pigtails. I also read \\"Timequake\\" and I'm intrigued by Vonnegut's recurrent use of time travel. There is much to be said about experience and memory as related to time, and I enjoy reading Vonnegut's plain, witty, cigarette style. I basically just went along for the ride on this read, but I intend on reading again later to extract a deeper brilliance."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Every time I read this it gets better. This time around it was for a course I took called \\"Modern Novel\\". I love this book, but if you aren't into abstract thinking and are easily confused by alien philosophy, and social commentary it's probably not for you. For the true Kurt Vonnegut or Douglas Adams fan it is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"kurt vonnegut's book slaughterhouse five is a great piece of literary work in itself. his unique style of black humor, combined with his vivid imagination is second to none. this book was exciting and unpredictable as i continued to read! its main purpose involved the struggle of a man with his grip on reality. is he, or is he not crazy?the imagery in this book was another great element, and many regard this as one of the greatest anti-war books of the century. this book is definitely worth reading and will not disappoint! you can't go wrong with kurt vonnegut's slaughterhouse five!"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughterhouse-Five is more relevant than ever. Kurt Vonnegut's is such a magnificent writer you're immobilized by his description of the horrific firebombing of Dresden. His talent weaving the war, time travel and aliens is inspiring."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"The hero, or antihero, of Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five is Billy Pilgrim, a time traveling idiot savant. The central event in Billy's life is the firebombing of Dresden, Germany, an event he witnesses with little emotion. Billy has the sense to cry when he sees a pair of horses suffering but he is unnaturally passive in war, in his marriage, in raising his son, in being kidnapped and taken to the planet of Tralfamadore, and so on. From his experiences on Tralfamadore, Billy comes to perceive time in a different way that is very comforting to him and perhaps to Vonnegut as well.First published in 1969, Slaughterhouse-Five has an experimental feel to it. Billy's time travel leads to some unconventional juxtaposition of scenes, and Vonnegut makes frequent use of asides to the reader to tell us about himself and why he wrote the book. Tragic events are described in flat, emotionless terms.Slaughterhouse-Five is a quick and entertaining read, and it educates the reader about the horrors of bombing directed against civilians. Because of the flat tone, though, and because the characters are so unattractive, there doesn't seem to be much of a message here except to say that men are fools."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This is impossible not to like. You'll probably like it, even if you don't like to read. It's just that good."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut is not one of my favorite books. This is the only book by Kurt that I have read. Slaughterhouse Five was very confusing and hard to follow. The structure of the novel is totally unconventional and does not really have a clear beginning, middle and end. The main character in this book is Billy Pilgrim, who is able to time travel. One minute you are in present time and the next you are back in World War Two with no notice at all. Besides that total lack of a time unity, there is no unity of place. The setting jumps rapidly and repeatedly between war and the planet Trafalmadore. These are reasons that the book was hard to follow. Also, the fact he was abducted by aliens seem ridiculous to me. A large part of this book is in third person; there is also first person narration in the first chapter when Vonnegut enters the novel as commentator/character. He is present in the first and tenth chapter. This switch of narration further adds to the confusion.The one thing I liked about this book was the fact it didn't glorify war. It told what I think are true stores from World War Two. It told the sad truth of war, the things that go on and never are talked about. A major focus of the book is on the horror of the bombing of Dresden. This event is first described in the opening chapter, although details are found throughout the book. This book is truly an anti-war book."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"The more Kurt Vonnegut I read, the more I begin to think his skills as a writer are somewhat limited and his writing itself sophomoric. However, \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\" is certainly the best of what I've read of him, and unlike some of his other books (\\"Breakfast of Champions,\\" for instance) holds up well to multiple readings.\\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\" is typical Vonnegut in many ways, but it works better than the majority of his novels due to an emotional element that is usually lacking. I felt for Billy Pigrim as a person and really cared whether or not he was able to pick up the pieces of his life and recover from the hell-on-earth atmosphere of World War II. One scene stands out clearly in my mind---Billy at the window of a factory that manufactures (maple syrup I think? Anyway, something sweet) and crying as he licks a spoon---crying because of the utter simplicity and unqualified pleasure something like maple syrup can give him. It's as if the intensity of the horror he experiences during the fire-storming of Dresden increases the intensity of all other experiences as well, so that for this one moment, his whole world has come down to the taste of maple syrup on a spoon. Wow, what a great scene.This novel inevitably gets compared to \\"Catch-22\\" because of its subject matter and quirky tone, but really the two books aren't very similar. I like \\"Catch-22\\" better, but would still recommend \\"Slaughterhouse-Five.\\""},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"If there is a single book I believe everyone in the world should read, for some reason, that would be this one. The Tralfamadorians are the epitome of intellectual thought, and Vonnegut forces the reader to examine his own beliefs on the nature of time, death, and what it means to be a human. Vonnegut is my hero!"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This was a book I bought after hearing about several of my english teachers and peers rave about it. They claimed it was wonderfully written, excellent satire, and funny, so that is what I expected. The problem was that as with many overly hyped things they can not live up to your expectation. There was good news with this book, however, it was very intriguing and unique. The style of writing, the story itself, and the characters are all quirky and engaging. It is a very quick read and a book that once you get started you will not want to put down. The problems I had with it, however, were that it was very disjointed (which as you read it you will understand the importance of it, though you may not like reading it)and after I was done I didn't really care about any of the characters or the story--it is behind me down and I will not be going to all of my friends telling them that this is a must read. All in all, I think this book is one you should get from the library, read in an afternoon and return. It is not one that you will need to have around your house because you will never have to reference it again and while it is enjoyable it would be one that would have made me happier to have borrowed that purchased."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"As a reader, I enjoy a novel that spins a vast plot and investigates characters. Slaughterhouse-Five fails to do that. The book lacks the infra-structure that supports great writing.The book does, though, carry some philosophical meaning. The character's experiences with the aliens did shine a light on some of my own practices and beliefs.All in all, the book is difficult to follow and hard to define. However, it should continue to be read and studied. Perhaps I just didn't get it."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"\\"This one is a failure...\\" Not my words. Vonnegut himself wrote that in the book's into to describe this book. I think Vonnegut was aware of the fact that this book sucked and made no secret of it... the joke is that people persist in praising it in spite of the fact that it sucks.I had this book on my reading list for a long time. However, I always chose something else because the critical acclaim for this novel made me nervous. Do you want a good recipe? Here it goes. Critical acclaim = suck 90% of the time.The more the academics and book snobs love it, the more certain you can be that it sucks.Now... Now... Now... I can see you waiving your pinky in the air and yelling that this is a \\"deep\\" book and the message is this or the message is that. This represents that or this thing represents that thing. Yeah, I get all that. But the beauty of it is that I don't care.I don't care.I found the constant use of the phrase \\"so it goes\\" to be particularly poor. Yeah... yeah... yeah... Vonnegut uses the phrase very time someone dies or there is some sort of reference to death. Ohhhhhhh... so deep, right? What masterful thinking, right?Sorry. No. It's just dumb. I've got an idea, how about I write a book and use the phrase \\"so it goes\\" every time the main character takes a dump. Would that be just as deep and enlightening? Then some fool literary critic years from now will praise my book as a juxtaposition of the meaningless nature of crapping with the meaningless nature of war. Perhaps I will win some awards for my work and for my gritty brilliance.Wait a minute... wait just a minute here.... Hey - there is a part in Slaughterhouse 5 when the main character finds his son sitting on a toilet! Oh my gosh!!! I think I just unlocked the true meaning of this book! War is crap! I'm so smart that I just come up with brilliant analysis at random that takes others a lifetime of study! Oh... and then there is that part about the latrine at the prison camp! Of course... of course... I see it all now!!! And then there is that other part about the excrement being emptied out in buckets from the train... the main character even spends some time with the turd bucket!I figured it out! I've unlocked the secret of Slaughterhouse 5! To commemorate this occasion, I hereby write a masterful poem for posterity. I call it \\"Ode to the Time I Read Slaughterhouse 5\\"I read Slaughterhouse 5The Bee Gees sang Stayin' AliveThey made Billy shovel poop out of a trainIn my arm I can see a blue veinBilly went back and forth in timeHey give me my pencil back, it's mineBilly's son plays guitar on the toiletIf my engine gets stuck I oil itYou may print that poem out and share its awesomeness with your friends and family.It is a 1st edition all-time classic. Perhaps even write it on your Christmas cards this year.Still, I give the book 2 stars."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This book is excellent, and I reccomend it heartily as a novel. However, the figure of 135,000 to 250,000 killed in the bombing of Dresden is a gross exageration of the true numbers, which were at most 50,000, but probably something like 30,000. The range 135,00 0 to 250,000 comes from proven Nazi-sympathizer David Irving. For an account of how he fabricated his information read Lying About Hitler, by Richard Evans. During the bombing, Vonnegut was housed in an underground facility outside of the city so didn't see the bombing and was involved in the recovery of bodies, so all of his information on the death toll is second hand, which has since he wrote the book been proven false.Nevertheless, quite worth a read."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It was my first Vonnegut, so I wasn't really sure what to expect. Perhaps there was more to it, but I just took the book for its face value, without over analyzing every grey little detail. To me, it was just like watching an episode of Seinfeld. It was short (ie sitcom in length), had a main character who conjured images of Kramer, and made liberal use of a catch phrase. So it went."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"A great metaphor of middle class america, world war two, and a fictional land of tralfamado. Billy Pilgrim the Optometrist will help you see the truth about world war two and the bombing of dresden. You follow his pilgrimage as he is unstuck in time by plunjer shaped tralfamadorian aliens. War really is completely different world deadly to humans. Look into the fourth dimension."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I read this book on a recommendation from my history teacher. I was kind of hesitant at first, but the story just grabbed me. I personally think Vonnegut is trying to say three things. 1) Humanity in whole doesn't change, so war is inevitable 2) You have to do the best you can to prevent war 3) Even during war, morals still exist One of the premises of the book, is that history, past and future is fixed. We are like little bugs trapped in amber, we can't escape. But I don't think Vonnegut is really saying we have no free will, I think he is talking about society and what society does and it drags us along, however unwilling, and we just have to do the best we can. For those of you who haven't read it, the story goes as follows. Billy Pilgrim, an ill-prepared chaplains assistant, becomes a POW for the germans and witnesses the bombing of Dresden. Several years later, he is kindapped by aliens from the Planet Tralfamadore, who live in four dimensions. It also tells about his life twenty five years later. the three strories are wovwn together, becasue supposedly, the Tralfamadorians taught Billy how to time travel and he does so. I won;t spoil the rest, for those of you who haven't read the book."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This is my third Vonnegut book. The first I read was Cat's Cradle, which to this day is my second favorite book (after Catch-22). I then tried Breakfast of Champions, which I strongly disliked. I was hoping this book would be more like Cat's Cradle, but I'm now halfway through and it reads exactly like Breakfast of Champions (although thankfully, there are no drawings). If you enjoyed Breakfast of Champions you will probably also enjoy Slaughterhouse Five."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"A friend of mine refused to read this book because she thought it was a glorification of slaughterhouses. I don't know where she got this impression, but once I assured her (and promised to give her $250 if she was right) she read the book and declared that her life was changed. She disappeared and I haven't seen her in ten years, so I can't be any more specific about precisely what about the book changed her life.Anyhow, this book is not about slaughterhouses, per se. I think that any prospective reader should know that. Of course, a slaughterhouse (specifically, number 5) does figure into the narrative, but no cows actually get slaughtered. Come to think of it, this book deals with themes a bit more disturbing than cows getting slaughtered: war, death, man's inhumanity, etc. I have also translated this book into French, mostly for my own enjoyment. It's titled Abbatoire Cinq.I recommmend this book, and I hope that you, whoever is reading this review, will buy or borrow it, and spend an afternoon or two reading it. It's really quite good."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Vonnegut has written an anti-war book, but he has done it with somestyle. It is perhaps hard to find humor when you are being blown tohell and back, but through characters in this novel he manages to doso. Darkly amusing, I suppose is what you would call it at times. Oneway to view the Allied bombing of Dresden, anyway."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"My favorite Vonnegut novel is \\"Cat's Cradle\\", but \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" is a close second. He is unquestionably of one of the greatest creative literary geniuses of all time and is the \\"canary in the coal mine\\" for our generation.\\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" is written so expertly that it gives me the feeling that Vonnegut is in the room talking to me. There are moments in the book when it seems as if Vonnegut is paused, waiting for me to comment.\\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" is a novel of raw and refined cynicism, optimism, philosophy, and hypothetical realism. The book is filled with phrases that free fall through my mind long after the book is closed. It is a book worthy of reading and rereading; it is as if Vonnegut planned the novel to expose new gifts to the reader as s/he changes.I recommend the reading of any and all of Vonnegut's books, including commentaries and speeches."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"\\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\" is the only novel written by Kurt Vonnegut which I have enjoyed immensely, reading it several times over the course of a couple of decades. Vonnegut's journey from being a mediocre science fiction writer to one of the leading lights of American literature is surely among the most fascinating I have read of (I suppose this means that if you choose to deny your origins as a writer of dreadful science fiction - which Vonnegut has stated repeatedly in public - then you'll receive an automatic passing grade from your peers in \\"serious\\" mainstream literature; for denying both his origins and for writing some of the most abysmal plots in the annals of science fiction, Kurt Vonnegut is number one on my list of most overrated and artistically inept authors of modern fiction.). But, inspite of my lengthy digression, I will have to confess that at least in \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\", Vonnegut has crafted a fine novel which works more as a fictionalized memoir than as an amazing tale of a man, Billy Pilgrim, who becomes \\"unstuck in time\\".Most of my favorite scenes in the novel are set in the span of time just before the fire bombing of Dresden, Germany and its immediate aftermath. It is some of the most viscerally moving pieces of fiction written by a former POW held by Nazi Germany. Less sucessfully, I think, Vonnegut describes Pilgrim's sojourn on the planet Tralfamadore. His descriptions of the planet and its inhabitants lack the vivid imagination or lyrical poetry of a Samuel Delany, Ursula K. Le Guin, or Norman Spinrad, among others. And yet, there is still much in Vonnegut's usage of English prose and in his creation of his protagonist Billy Pilgrim, which warrants high praise from this reviewer."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"There really isn't much to say that has not been said about this book before on Amazon. It is simply one of the greatest works by an American author, and that is all there is to it. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"\\"The cattle are lowing/ The Baby awakes/ But the little Lord Jesus/ No crying He makes.\\" This is how the Jewish Kurt Vonnegut starts his satire Slaughter House Five by asking if Jesus cried when lives were obliterated with fire? Thus, he hides an intricate attack against war within the story using simple language that allows readers to flow through the novel. Throughout the plot, Vonnegut explores the horrible effects of war, brings new light to the plight of soldiers, and readjusts the focus of the reader's world view.Slaughter House Five focuses on the horrific effects of war by describing the destruction wreaked upon Dresden in its infamous firebombing by the Allies, its destruction symbolizing the loss of a peaceful and important cultural center in Germany during World War II. With this being the focus of the satire, Vonnegut is able to weave in numerous additional ideas concerning loss and suffering with Dresden as the symbol embodying it all. But, with the focus of the reader on the mental wanderings of protagonist Billy Pilgrim, another horror is brought to light. The shock put upon a person who has to undergo such a terrible ordeal.The problems thrust on Billy Pilgrim by the trauma of the Dresden firebombing are quickly evident as the reader follows his schizophrenic mental journey through war, an alien zoo, and his life as an optometrist after the war. During the scenes of war, Billy detachedly views his horrifying experiences with frighteningly calm amusement; the scenes in the alien zoo portrays the protagonist's ideal life; and the scenes of his abnormal behavior in life after the war all lead the reader to see the effects of post-traumatic stress syndrome created by the war; thus, creating more reasons to have peace.Billy Pilgrim's wanderings through memory caused by the trauma of war bring a fresh new perspective of war and its consequences into focus like a new pair of lenses from an optometrist. In many respects Vonnegut's use of humor to make a statement against war is very much like that of Larry Gelbart creator of M*A*S*H. With elegant and simple language keeping readers focused on the issue, Slaughter House Five certainly makes a persuasive argument against war."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"So it goes. Billy Pilgrim is unstuck in time, hopping from one of his life's moments to another at random. He is an old man, then he is a young man. He welcomes his son home from Vietnam right before he goes off to fight his own battle in World War II. Billy Pilgrim is dead but then he is alive again.Billy Pilgrim has seen and done it all. He has fought in a war, he has had a family, he has befriended the reclusive Kilgore Trout. Billy Pilgrim has been to New York. He's been all over Europe. He's even been to the planet Tralfamadore where he and a beautiful Hollywood starlet were exhibits in the Tralfamadorian zoo.Through it all Billy Pilgrim remains the same humble, mild, and good natured man he has always been. Billy Pilgrim is many things. Sometimes strong, sometimes week. Sometimes clever, sometimes as dull witted as a box of rocks. Only one thing remains constant with Billy Pilgrim. He is always likeable."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"It's hard to accurately convey the plot of \\"Slaughter House-Five\\" without taking several pages to explain the layers and depth and abstraction with which Kurt Vonnegut handles the gruesome nature. The best I can do is offer enough to hook potential readers in order to encourage them to take the journey themselves.Vonnegut tells the story of the non-hero, the less than average soldier who bumbled through World War II surviving purely on good luck and the good will of others. Billy Pilgrim is a Chaplain's Assistant that really has no interest in the war, in life, or anything for that matter. He's blessed with some extraordinary ability to experience as a non-linear concept... an ability which he maintains no control of. His life becomes a series of incongruent instances later relayed by two war veterans aptly named \\"The Children's Crusade\\". Billy becomes an unsuspecting illustration of the uncertainties of war.So admittedly, the plot sounds confusing in a summary, but Vonnegut delivers a power and almost psychedelic tale which vividly reflects on both the humanity and inanity of human warfare. The story is woven together quite well the chaos of both war and Billy's inability to hold himself within time. Vonnegut writes masterfully delivering powerful questions for the reader and portraying the story of the non-hero."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"There are good and bad points to this book... overall I found it a bit overrated and the prose throughout the book was mediocre not my favorite voice or way to read a story.The story telling was disjointed and a little boring in the beginning. The voice was detached which helps the reader feel nothing about all the bad things happening in the story. Which could be a good thing. What I particularly disliked is the author making fun of prayer and the Bible. It is always in bad taste to poke fun at what other people hold sacred. So this was a big turn off. Also, the phrase \\"and so it goes\\" was so overused I felt like throwing up everytime I read it and thinking to myself... \\"please please dont make me read this damned phrase again.\\"This book presented some interesting ideas and ways of looking at things. For one, I got to learn about the Dresden bombing which prior to this I had never even heard of. Looking at time as a whole instead of in chunks like we are trained to do and thinking about the fourth dimension... that was all interesting stuff. But the idea I found most useful to take away from this book would have to be \\"Vy me? Vy me? Vy anybody?\\" that was said by a German soldier. I now know what to answer when someone asks \\"Why Me?\\" LOL.I probably wouldn't recommend this book to a friend, but it was an easy read and quite informative. Also, it seems the author is depressed and finds life pointless.... which is nothing new or worth writing about. :) I think its a stretch to call this a classic or a must read.

Awesome. Just in time for school assignment. Thanks."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"The book was not in the greatest shape. A better description of the condition would have been helpful"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Have you ever gone to a movie and within a few minutes you just know it's not going to be \\"your type\\" of movie? That's how this book struck me--it's just not my type. From nearly page one, this book simply didn't grab me. In the least. Because it's a short book, though, I did finish it. I kept thinking it must have a great ending or some kind of great over-arching message due to its fame and esteem, but it didn't have either.It's the only Vonnegut book I've read so I don't know if this is how his style always is, but I did not care for the scattered back-and-forth in time approach--it wasn't that it was hard to follow, because it really wasn't, but I didn't feel like it added anything to the book. Then again I thought the characters and events in the book were boring enough that if it hadn't had the time-jumping-around, maybe I would've not liked the book even more? I guess at least the time-jumping kept me on my toes.Largely I thought that the book was unemotional. I didn't a lick about any character in the book. Billy was just a sad sap, but I never empathized with him--and I don't feel the author ever tried to get me to empathize with him. The other characters that came and went were pretty transitory and usually didn't stick around long enough to learn much about them. There are glimpses into Billy's wife and family, and some of his soldier-mates, but they are mostly just glimpses. I'm not even sure I know what BILLY'S character was really like--there just wasn't a ton of character development in my opinion. Also the book struck me as one attempt at dry humor after another, and maybe that's just not my style of humor? The \\"So it goes\\" and \\"Poo-too-tweet\\" repetition just annoyed me.One unfair aspect to my reading of Slaughterhouse is it came directly after my first read of Catcher in the Rye. I could not put Catcher in the Rye down--I connected with Catcher in every way that I did not connect with Slaughterhouse. I thought Catcher was absolutely hilarious--I was literally laughing out loud on almost every page. I wasn't expecting Slaughterhouse to be as good as Catcher, but I didn't expect Slaughterhouse to be so uninteresting and random. I think Catcher was just more my style if you will. (They're very different books--I'm not directly comparing them, just directly comparing my interest in them.)Because I'm clearly in the minority in not enjoying Slaughterhouse, I'll assume \\"it's me and not you (the book)\\". Nonetheless, I would never recommend this book to anyone--I would just tell them that most of the world seems to love it, but for me it wasn't the right fit."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Vonnegut's Novel Noir, which revolves around the devastating effects of the 1945 bombardment of Dresden, depicts the disturbed mental existence of Billy Pilgrim---a pathetic anti-hero with whom we soon sympathize. Readers are jerked through multiple time warps in each chapter of these 215 pages of stream-of-consciousness memories. To further compound literary comprehension portions of chapters one and ten are related by a first-person narrator whose goal is to comment on Billy's story. In short: his fluctuating inner life deposits him without warning into pieces of temporal amber, trapping him like a bug, where he is helpless to return to the present. The choice of the protagonist's name is indicative of his plight: BILLY implies not a fully grown man but an impotent youth; PILGRIM hints at his psychological journeys in search of sanity--or even his attempts to escape it.Requiring some literary flexibility on the part of readers this story is engaging; we see Billy in a variety of ages and settings (not the least bit chronological). Flashbacks are not sufficient; the author includes flash forwards as well. No wonder poor Billy is often confused. We see him as a baby, a boy, a fianc&eacute;, then a rich optometrist, a devoted husband, and a wretched chaplain's assistant during WW2. The poor fellow permits himself to be acted upon, rather than commit himself to deliberate action, which results in needless suffering for him--not to mention the dismayed concern of his adult offspring. Meekly accepting of his fate and the prolonged unfairness of life, he calmly allows the world to consider him a crackpot by insisting that he was abducted by aliens and displayed in a an Earthling cage on a planet called Tralfamadore.Besides spoofing the sci fi craze of the 1960's the author indulges in two private agendas: to educate the American public about the atrocity of Dresden and to titillate the masses with countless examples of lewd language and crass behavior. He assumes that intelligent Americans will revel in his indulgence of low morality and crudity--cleverly passed off as literature. We must wade through a morass of filth (of all kinds) in order to empathize with the trials of a nave innocent like Billy, whose pilgrim journey of self-discovery and human acceptance may never be fully achieved. An interesting read for those who can separate the trash from the kernels of human truth."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Somewhere in the first chapter (or maybe the second, if you are convinced that the first chapter is a foreword), it dawns on you: this is not normal. The main character is not dynamic. There is no real, driving conflict. There is no escalation, nor any other conventional literary mechanism used to move the story. That would probably be the best word to describe Vonnegut: anticonventional.What follows is a masterful tale the likes of which we may never see again. The sublime tones combine with a graceful, immersive imagery and characters that are bare and gaunt while also full of fervor. The themes are beautiful and horrible to watch, but Billy Pilgrim's journey is one you won't be able to avoid. It'll call to you whenever this book is not in your hands. At any given moment, you'll find yourself murmuring to no one in particular, \\"So it goes.\\"I am not sure how this novel is assigned to high school literature classes, because the book is so subtle and layered: I would think that teaching this book to teenagers would be like describing Newton's theories to a family of Dachshunds. I guess that's why they (high school English teachers, not the dogs) descend to the level of Ethan Frome, or other such toys, to pass the time. Purely put, Vonngeut doesn't deserve to be put on your bookcase; the proximity to so many inferior works might lead someone to believe that Slaughterhouse-Five is comparable. I'd suggest framing the book and mounting it on your dining room wall, but that might prevent you from reading it again. Which you should. Immediately."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut ****Long concidered to be Vonnegut's classic and best work as an author...I strongly disagree. This is far from his worst work but it doesn't hold a candle toBreakfast of ChampionsorCat's Cradle.The satire here is great. The commentary on War and what it does to those involved and those around them. Written about his own service in World War II and his own tribulations of being there and what it caused him afterward only done Kerouac style through fiction. It doesn't always work however.Often times the plot falters and feels boring. Readers will have trouble finishing the book if not familiar with Vonneguts work, but what saves it from being average is his over the top since of humour.What it offers a look into is brilliant but it doesn't always deliver, and for that it can never be a five star read."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This is a book I'd always put off reading because of the title. I couldn't figure out what it meant, and it sounded too weird for me. In fact it is more literal than I imagined: it refers to five army personnel who survive the bombing of Dresden by taking shelter in a slaughterhouse.It must have seemed a very clever book back when it was written, some 40 years ago now, but all the time-travel and general avant-garde story-telling is so mainstream today that it hardly registers.In other words, the impact has lessened, and it's probably even dated a little. I don't want to be too harsh, though. This is a very powerful work, and once you know for sure that the author's own experiences were the catalyst, you can't fail to be moved as the novel moves towards its astonishing climax. It's also very witty and laugh-out-loud funny in many places."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This book is overrated. Although it is interesting and I couldn't put it down, I found that its standing as a perennial anti-war book is undeserved.

It is extremely well-written and very accessible both for reading and discussion. It touches on important subjects such as war, time, family, and mental illness (supposed I guess!).Everytime I read this book I am reminded why Vonnegut has deserved all the praise he has recieved...he tells stories in uniquely intriguing ways. While this book might seem random and confusing, it really simply tells the story of a man tramatized by war.Perhaps the most interesting thing about the book though is the introduction, in which the reader is given a glance into the author's mind. What an honor and how enlightening! Every aspiring author should read this first chapter and understand that their struggles and hopes are legitimate!"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Kurt Vonnegut is, I'm told, a pacifist. While there are elements of pacifism that make terrific sense to me, I'm not sure I completely join him in this particular conviction. In Slaughterhouse Five, however, he makes a brilliant case for his position.Slaughterhouse Five is about war. And tragedy. And laughter. And aliens. It's not really a true story, but it's set in a true piece of history... the infamous firebombing of Dresden in the final months of World War II. Vonnegut draws on his own, true experiences as a soldier in Dresden to inform the fiction.While Vonnegut is famous for his sense of humor, that wasn't what was most impressive to me about this particular work. I appreciated this book because it has a conscience. While many authors are content to woo or shock or report, Vonnegut feels a deep sense of responsibility to his audience to not only tell the story... but to wrestle with the questions of time and mortality with his readers."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"The novel Slaughter House Five is a great story. It describes Billy Pilgrim's time travel and adventures throughout the whole book. The writer kept me going and I could not put this book down. It is definitely a reread and I look forward to reading more of Kurt Vonnegut's writing pieces. Though, the reason I am giving this a four star, is because of the introduction.

The first time I read it, I was an undergraduate at Colorado State University and since that time, I've made it a point to re-read it every year hence. It's like those Airplane movies from eighties: everytime I read it I see something new. Vonnegut successfully weaves the comic with the tragic and makes a sobering case for determinism. The Tralfamadorians have a little saying...&quot;there are three things you can't change, the past, the present and the future.&quot; The book is constantly catching the reader off-guard, for one minute he might describe the suffering of an American POW in WWII, and then take the time to illustrate that Billy Pilgrim, &quot;had a tremendous wang. You never know who'll get them.&quot; Many have refered to it as an anti-war book, but I think it, much like Dr. Strangelove, illustarates the absurdity of war and further, the absurdity of life in general. At times it comes dangerously close to being nihilistic, with it's moral relativism, but it's too damn funny to be considered a truly existential work. Anyway, the book speaks to me, and I recommend it to anyone I meet who wants to understand me better. 5-Stars"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughterhouse-Five is a novel about two things, the horrors of war, and the interesting concept of time and fate. Vonnegut scores in several sentences with clever wit sprinkled about effective and dazzling prose, and fails in about as many: sort, amateur bits of writing with imcomplete sentences and basic, undescriptive language. Vonnegut's writing as a whole is not amateur, don't get me wrong, but he fails at some of his experimental attempts, or as he says (and i'm paraphrasing, \\"I'm going to write this book for fun\\".Example: \\"So it goes\\" proves to be more annoying than effective, and some things are sad just to be repeated later, rather than have any relivance.

The war left the protagonist, Billy, as a shell shocked victom whose imagination will take the reader on a joy ride through time and space. He displays many symptoms of an individual with mental issues, but the realistic interpretations of his time traveling and the adoption of new alienistic beliefs leave the reader with constant questions regarding his mental state. \\"Possibly, he may not be insane, maybe he is absolutely correct\\", are some of the things you may ask yourself when reading Kurt Vonneguts interesting novel. This book has facts throughout but, most of the book is Sci-fi and wierdly interpreted. Its a great book to just sit back and let your mind be open too...."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I must say the book does not work for me. It is funny in spots, and the prose has a Hemingwayesque terseness and sparsity, and so on. Or so it goes.I don't understand the sci-fi part, or how it relates to the anti-war theme. Bill Pilgrim had the time-travel talent _before_ he witnessed the Dresden inferno; so it could not have been a post-combat stress syndrome. (Or maybe he acquired afterwards, which in turn allowed him to travel back in time. I wasn't clear, but give that possibility. Even that being the case, I don't feel it is as directly a protest on organized violence, as what are shown in Catch 22). Because of this incomprehension, my reading was jarred by the distraction, and that might have prevented me from appreciating the book more.Also the alien part, read in its own right, is mediocre, neither funny nor relevant nor conducive to fantasy."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Have you ever felt you could stop a glacier? Harrison Star, from the book Slaughterhouse-Five, told Billy Pilgrim that glaciers would be as easy to stop as wars. Billy, the main character, was considering writing an anti-war book. Billy is an interesting fellow. He believes in aliens, thinks he has visited their planet, and furthermore, believes the reason humans are such a sad race is because they can't see the fourth dimension. Billy is different, Billy can see in the fourth dimension. Or, at least more than any other human can. Throughout the book Billy travels to different times in his life, this way seeing the fourth-dimension like no other human.Kurt Vonnegut, the author of the book, has a vivid imagination and a sense of humor like no other. Vonnegut blends humor throughout the book in a perfectly hilarious manner. For example: Billy learns from the Tralfamadorians that when people die, they keep on living in the past. Because of this, there are no funerals on Tralfamadoria, and whenever one of their friends die they say, \\"So it goes.\\" Every single paragraph that includes the death of someone ends with the same sentence. So it goes. Reading over this, it doesn't seem very funny, but while I was reading the book it just started to hit me and I began laughing. Maybe most of Vonnegut's jokes require you to spend some time reading his books, but that's fine because this book is certainly worth reading. And I recommend it to anybody who feels they are up to a nice challenge. This book requires some thinking, actually a lot of thinking. Some of which I didn't do, and still thought it was a great book. So, read this book, think a little."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Kurt Vonnegut is an author whom I became intimately familiar with for a few years. I read, literally, every single work of fiction that he has had published, and generally enjoyed them, as well. However, it seems that Vonnegut is also the type of author that one outgrows: I re-read Slaughterhouse Five in its entirety some two months ago, and have not been more frustrated (and tired) by a book in quite a while. The biggest issue with Vonnegut is, no matter what else is to be said: He is formulaic. After a while, all of his stories bleed together, his cynicism is tiresome, and his misanthropy becomes cliche.Period.Slaughterhouse Five is often hailed as Vonnegut's piece de resistane, though I sincerely doubt it was written as such. It deals primarily with a man, Billy Pilgrim, who continually experiences changes and &quot;jumps&quot; in time: He does not experience a linear sense of time. Pilgrim fought in World War II, and is subsequently kidnapped by Trafalmadorians, an alien race who also do not experience linear time.This book has been championed as an anti-war novel, though to be honest, I never quite saw this. Does Vonnegut speak down on war? Most assuredly. But I think this book extends far, far past simply being an anti-war novel: In fact, I think the theme of &quot;anti-war&quot; is perhaps the one theme which is least prominant in the book.Truth be told, perhaps to others the literary merits of this novel shine through, but I personally believe there are far more intriguing, thought provoking, and funny books by Vonnegut out there. Mother Night and The Sirens of Titan, to name two. Slaughterhouse Five is worth reading for its supposed literary merit, but it seems to me that it is a sophomoric work of Vonnegut's: Its ideas are there, and they are far, far below the surface."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Billy Pilgrim is unstuck in time, and so the novel is also unstuck from the shackles of linear time progression. Throughout the work, Vonnegut explores the modern world, World War II Dresden as a prisoner of the Germans, and the planet Tralfamador where Billy is displayed like a zoo animal. Everything is happening at once, so we get snippets from various points of time and the plot lines are disconnected.Through this narrative, Vonnegut works his themes like a virtuoso. He shows that war can do nothing but destroy, that nothing flowers from the remains of war except a shell of what could've been if there'd been no massive deaths, no societal collapse, no degradations and dehumanizations. He lives through Billy Pilgrim as a witness to the firebombing of Dresden, through the lives lost to a greater degree than Hiroshima or Nagasaki. He shows that horror so vividly that it's the very horror of that experience that tosses him about time and space like a pinball in a game.He rips through the concept of free will, when Billy decides he can just change history and prevent war. He shows the futility, illustrating it with this great line, \\"writing an anti-war book is like writing an anti-glacier book.\\" Billy can't simply ignore war, and his sanity erodes as a consequence. Everyone should just ignore war is the advice of the Tralfamadorians, who have their own history of wars, once even destroying the whole universe. But Billy is human and can't understand the circular nature of time.Vonnegut doesn't so much write a novel as have a heart-felt conversation with the reader, throwing in some fiction, some religion, some politics, and a laugh or two. After reading this book, you'll have new understandings, and a great new friend.- CV Rick"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughterhouse Five has been my frist experience reading Kurt Vonnegut and fortunently it was a pleasent one. I chose to read Slaughterhouse Five for an assignment in my English III AP class and was not looking foward to it. However, I decided to give the book a chance so I read some of its reviews (another positive experience), after the reviews I read a summary of the book (this was a somewhat less positive experience). The summary told of a soldier who comes back from World War Two and is abducted by space aliens. Upon reading this I had to laugh, as my teacher expressly told us that this book was one of the best ever written. Again to be fair, I bought the book and began reading (I allowed myself ample time - I wasn't planning on enjoying it) andc finished four hours later. I was expecting to take at least a few days, but once I started, I couldn't stop! Vonnegut's writing style and structure is very similar to another fantastic sci-fi writer, Douglas Adams. Slaughterhouse Five reminded me very much of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Both Vonnegut and Adams use similar humor and have habits of repeating phrases (So it goes). An overall great book, I highly reccomend that everybody read it."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"In SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE, Vonnegut examines the emotionally flat life of Billy Pilgrim, an optometrist and a rare survivor of the Allied bombing of Dresden during World War II. Using a style that is jokey yet deadpan, Vonnegut shows Billy, a boyish soldier in the war, prone to weepy breakdown in his money-grubbing forties. Then, he survives a plane crash, probably with brain trauma, and his wife dies suddenly and Billy starts to believe he has been kidnapped by aliens who experience time in the fourth dimension. Long story short, Billy, in Vonnegut's phrase, becomes unstuck in time, living a moment here... a moment there. Among these moments are loving experiences on the thinly imagined planet of Tralfamadore, where he domiciles in a zoo with a Hollywood starlet and starts a family.Undoubtedly, these aliens enable Vonnegut to pronounce a few BIG THOUGHTS--there is no why; only on earth is there any talk of free will. Further, Billy's belief in these aliens and his acceptance of their four-dimensional perspective ultimately allows him to cope, albeit pathetically, with the immense scale of death in his life. \\"Everything is all right, and everybody has to do exactly what he does,\\" is what these aliens teach the helpless and passive Billy, who seems unable to reach and express any anger. Not to ruin the fun: but the Tralfamadorians exist, IMHO, to enable Billy to rationalize the ghastly traumas in his existence.Vonnegut writes SF in highly gimmicky style. Whenever he mentions a death, he recites the phrase, \\"So it goes.\\" Initially, the use of this phrase--basically, a slightly flip acquiescence--seems intended to tick the ubiquitous presence of death near Billy. (My count is 98 SIGs in this novella.) But the use of this phrase also serves to pace Vonnegut's fiction. When it's used, the reader has to stop momentarily, since the phrase is a blip in the flow. This is okay, I guess, although this mannerism helped unleash an absolute tsunami of whimsical stylists and Vonnegut wannabes, who think cute is okay.But then, this reader began to realize that Vonnegut's use of gimmicky pacing in SF is relentless. Here, I arbitrarily turn to a page in Chapter 9 and I see three separate clumps of paragraphs. I turn to Chapter 5 and, voila! ...another page with three separate paragraph clusters. But a close reader can look at these clusters and see that the narrative usually flows without real break from cluster to cluster. IMO, what Vonnegut has done is to insert these divisions in order to pace his text, which otherwise scans normally. Somehow, this endows what are usually the most ORDINARY observations with tiny ineffable tweaks of melancholy significance. Kurt, in other words, shows a genius for manipulating his reader via the wonders of spacing.SF published in 1969 when literature was--certainly more than today--in the hands of high-brows and tasteful gatekeepers. In that environment, readers, especially counterculture collegians, probably enjoyed Vonnegut's references to popular American culture, which showed he was not a stuffed-shirt. And this, as much as his great mop of curly hair, probably helped to make him a celebrity novelist. But I read SF today and these references make the book seem second-rate and even lazy. At one point, for example, Billy awakens in a hospital and notices an ominous presence monitoring him. I, for one, wonder what Nabokov, DeLillo, Roth, or Pynchon would do with this moment, when the boyish Billy experiences terror. But Vonnegut? He dips into popular culture and Billy associates this sinister presence with a VAMPIRE! I mean, come on! Isn't a good writer supposed to do more with his material than that?A final point: Do the drawings show any real talent? And if they don't, are they necessary?"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Vonnegut, in his introduction to this novel, explains that he thought he would be able to write about the atrocious firebombing of Dresden by allied aeroplanes on February 13 1945 (killing more people in a single night than Hiroshima) soon after he had returned from action as a young man having survived the event by being incarcerated in an underground slaughterhouse. Things didn't work out, and it was only much later 'living in easy circumstances in Cape Cod' that Vonnegut came across the ingenious presentation for the theme - show up the absurdity of war by invoking science fiction, time travel, and a phlegmatic attitude to death and the cycle of everything that goes on in this mad, loosely wired world - 'so it goes'. An anti war satire to rank alongside Catch 22, Slaughterhouse 5 is written in a plain, frank style that may not have the stylistic subtelties of great literary fiction, but brings home the truths about war, started by men, fought by babies, in a powerful and blackly comic way."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Vonnegut's &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; is a curiosity. It concerns a man named Billy Pilgrim who becomes &quot;unstuck in time,&quot; meaning he involuntarily travels back and forth between various episodes in his lifetime, something like temporal schizophrenia. The conventional notion of time is disregarded in this book, so our familiar structure of past, present, and future is in discord with the chronology of the events.As a young man, Billy serves in World War II as a chaplain's assistant. He ends up behind enemy lines with a morbid creep named Roland Weary who educates him about the sickest torture methods known to man. They're captured by German soldiers and taken to a prison camp where Billy is stalked by another creep named Paul Lazzaro. Soon Billy and the other prisoners are shipped into Dresden to be laborers, and for living quarters they are put into an old slaughterhouse marked with the number five. A visiting American-turned-Nazi dignitary attempts to proselytize them just before they are forced to cower in an underground meat locker while Allied aircraft bomb and decimate the city.After the war, Billy becomes an optometrist, marries, raises a family, and lives every semblance of a normal life except, of course, for the time travel. His imagination is fueled by the science fiction novels of a writer named Kilgore Trout, who is no stranger to the concept of time travel.Later, Billy is kidnapped by aliens from a planet called Tralfamadore and exhibited in a zoo on their planet, in an Earthling-accommodating habitat furnished by merchandise the aliens stole from a Sears warehouse in Iowa City. The Tralfamadorians have also kidnapped an Earthling woman, a movie star named Montana Wildhack, to provide Billy with a mate.Keep in mind that these events are not related in chronological order, but rather are intertwined with each other as Billy zaps back and forth between milieus.It's difficult to decipher all of this, but Vonnegut makes it clear in the first chapter that this is an anti-war novel, comparing the Children's Crusade of the Middle Ages to sending teenagers off to fight modern wars. He satirizes the pro-war mentality that rationalizes brutality in the name of dubious ideals, the slaughtering of some to save others. The consequences of war are acceptable only if, like the Tralfamadorians, you have no past, present, or future to account for."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five tells the story of Billy Pilgrim, a World War II vertan who has become &quot;unstuck in time.&quot; Set partly in war-ravaged Europe, post-war America, and the alien planet of Tralfamadore, Vonnegut creates a modern novel unlike any I have ever read. One of the many creative aspects of this novel is the style in which it was written. Vonnegut writes the story in a series of flashbacks and sporadically jumps from one point in Billy's life to another. He also writes in an easy-to-read manner that allows the reader to understand the story. Billy Pilgrim is Vonnegut's anti-hero, described as a &quot;filthy flamingo,&quot; and as Cinderella. Billy struggles to deal with himself and the absolute tragedy of the world around him. Billy finds solace on the planet of Tralfamadore. Tralfamadore is obviously a figment of Billy's imagination that he created to escape reality. Tralfamadore is Billy's Garden of Eden; Billy is Adam, and Montana Wildhack, a motion picture star also brought to Tralfamadore, is his Eve. Vonnegut successfully makes his point that &quot;there is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre&quot; by repeating simple phrases like &quot;poor old Edgar Derby&quot; and &quot;so it goes&quot; to make powerful statements. The black humor of the novel also lightens the subject matter and allows the reader to truly appreciate its sadness. Its thought-provoking themes and clever approach at writing make Vonnegut's &quot;famous book about Dresden&quot; one of the great modern novels that won't die as other attempts have. So it goes."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"No author's passing has ever affected me as profoundly as that of Kurt Vonnegut (1922-2007). Slaughterhouse Five is the most beautifully written and meaningful anti-war book I have ever experienced. I write \\"experienced\\" because this is a book you experience rather than just read. I have re-experienced the book several times since first picking it up in high school, and its powerful ideas are more compelling and moving every time. Vonnegut's message about the horror and futility of war is so stirring because of the gentle sincerity and quiet simplicity with which he conveys it. Sadly, it seems the world has been in a constant state of violence and conflict in one region or another since Vonnegut wrote his book so many decades ago. We need to re-experience his message now more than ever.Thank you Mr. Vonnegut, and may you finally rest in peace."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Kurt Vonnegut has written another masterpiece. The captivating story of Billy Pilgrim, a fictional character who is modeled after Vonnegut himself, and his experience during the fire bombing of Dresden in World War II. Vonnegut takes a satirical look at the atrocities of war and the ill-effects war has on a persons mind. Vonnegut makes a comedy of a serious matter while sticking to the subject and getting his point across. The vanity of life is examined through the eyes of Billy Pilgrim, who pictures memories as events that should not be forgotten. Death in this novel is not seen as a loss because the deceased will always remain in your mind and a memory is just as good as your being in the presence of this person. The novel is centered on the meaningless of life, but not that life shouldn't be enojoyed. In my opinion, this book is a must for anyone who has ever wondered what the meaning of life is, or why a person is saddened by personal loss. So, if you are literate I recommend that you partake in this delightful piece of literature."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I was thumbing through the Modern Library panel's list of the 100 greatest novels of the century the other day. It starts with (of course) Joyce's *Ulysses* and contains mostly classics your high school English teacher had on his book list.*Slaughterhouse-Five* was #18.Since the Modern Library is filled mostly with pretentious jerks, this one surprised me. Vonnegut is post-modern, tinged with sci-fi, unpretentious, fairly easy to read, and funny. This isn't a knock at poor old James Joyce--I love him too--or the great literary classics of the world (I read more of them than I do Vonnegut novels), but you don't expect to see a writer as purely *fun* as Vonnegut in the top 20 novels of the 20th century.Maybe we should. This is the book most closely linked to Vonnegut's name, and it's definitely representative of his best work, if not the best of the best. It's not your typical literary classic and does have some fantastic elements to it, but judging by most of the reader comments below me, that's not a problem. And yes, it is anti-war, written by a veteran, and if you're a die-hard American patriot like our friend/reviewer Rich down there (what are you doing reading an author with a German name like Vonnegut anyway, flyboy?), then you'll not be happy.For you non-militants out there, it's hard to go wrong with Vonnegut, especially *Slaughterhouse-five.* Even if you can't see why it's on the top 20 list, it's still a fun ride.(The iron grip of Britian, Rich?

Neither description does this story justice. Billy Pilgrim journeys through World War Two, life, and time. Vonnegut's chronicle encompasses far more than aliens and battles. In an original, genre-bending way, this best-selling author spins a tale that effectively comments on most aspects of life and society.Kurt Vonnegut is a veteran of World War Two. He was captured by the Germans and help as a prisoner of war in Dresden, Germany. Dresden is a city that was known for its fantastic architecture and genuine beauty. Vonnegut was present in the city when it was bombed by the Americans and reduced to craters and rubble. As a witness of the devastation, Vonnegut returned years later to tell the story of what he had seen and experienced. What he produced was Slaughterhouse-5. Vonnegut's story follows Billy Pilgrim, a man who says he has become unstuck in time. Billy will blink, snooze, enter a door, and end up in another decade. Billy has \\"seen his birth and death many times, he says, and pays random visits to all the events in between\\" (page 29). Slaughterhouse-5 follows Billy's random visits to those events.Most of Billy's random visits take him back behind enemy lines during World War Two, to a zoo on the alien planet Tralfamadore, and to his life after the war. He learns many important lessons, but they are not what one would expect. Billy says that \\"the most important thing that I learned on Tralfamadore was that when a person dies he only appears to die. He is still very much alive in the past, so it is very silly for people to cry at his funeral. All moments, past, present, and future, always have existed, always will exist. ... When a Tralfamadorian sees a corpse, all he thinks is that the dead person is in bad condition at that particular moment, but that same person is just fine in plenty of other moments. Now, when I hear that somebody is dead, I simply shrug and say... \`So it goes'\\" (33-34). Billy learns from the aliens that death is unimportant. He also finds out the date, time, and manner of his own death. He experiences it and is far from distraught. He is shot, and \\"in the next moment, Billy Pilgrim is dead. So it goes\\" (182). Another time-jump follows. People live and die all around him, but Billy does not care; he knows they are still alive in the past.A second main point in this book is, predictably, an anti-war message. A woman named Mary tries to prevent the author from writing this book because she fears he will glorify war and cause more wars to be fought. The author agrees that World War Two was fought by babies, \\"right at the end of childhood\\" (18) and says he will call it \\"the Children's Crusade.\\" In actuality, the full name of Vonnegut's novel is Slaughterhouse-5 or the Children's Crusade: A Duty Dance with Death. This novel truly is a dance with death, for nearly every character dies, from Billy's fellow soldiers to his wife to a bum on the train. This abundance of death, combined with the destruction of Dresden (a city described as a \\"picture of Heaven\\" (189)) produces a depressed, negative tone that hovers over the entire plot. In this way Vonnegut condemns warfare in all respects without explicitly saying anything for one side or another.Kurt Vonnegut set out to write an \\"anti-war book\\" (4). He undoubtedly accomplished this. What makes this particular novel unique is not the fact that he told a story that is clearly against warfare, but that he did so without preaching, without politicking, with no suspense, and without a climax! Vonnegut's masterful use of tone and fractured plot lines accomplishes the task in a truly original way. In the process, he introduced some interesting ideas, as well.Vonnegut's perspective on death is one-of-a-kind. He also introduces exceptional thoughts on time and the futility of war prevention. The Tralfamadorians see time \\"the way we can look at a stretch of the Rocky Mountains... They can see how permanent all the moments are, and they can look at any moment that interests them\\" (34). In contrast, humans see time as one moment following another moment, \\"like beads on a string\\" (34). The Tralfamadorians tell Billy that human perceptions are restricted and we cannot see time for what it really is. This idea of non-sequential, uncontrolled perception of time is very interesting. His second notion was that trying to stop wars from happening was like trying to stop glaciers from moving. One character says \\"that there would always be wars, that they were as easy to stop as glaciers\\" (4). This idea is backed up by the Tralfamadorians, too. Billy expects them to be shocked with the violence on Earth, but is surprised to learn that the aliens \\"have wars as horrible as any you've seen or read about\\" (150). Also, although the Tralfamadorians can see into the future, they say that \\"There isn't anything we can do about [the wars], so we simply don't look at them. We ignore them\\" (150). It appears that although Vonnegut is against wars, he realizes that there will always be something to fight about. It is as easy to stop wars as it is to stop a glacier's movement. Vonnegut brought up some very intriguing points, but refrained from speaking of others that would seem obvious.Oddly enough, though this novel focuses on World War Two, yet the issues of the Holocaust and Nazism are completely left out. Almost any other book dealing with period of history will mention both of those topics, but this story mentions neither. It does not mention the Pacific theater of war or nuclear weapons. This decision was made by the author to allow more emphasis to be placed on this story. The reader can take in this story by itself and not be distracted by other topics.Certain points discussed in this story seem very believable, while others are outright ridiculous. For instance, the idea that dead people are still alive in the past makes sense. However, Rosewater's statement that \\"Absolutely everyone gets a little something [from war]\\" (141) has no logic behind it. Vonnegut supports the anti-war side of the book in a clever way; everyone that supports the war is perceived as crazy, while those who dislike war are seen as logical people. For instance, a colonel infected with double pneumonia and near death tries to give a speech \\"to his beloved troops for the last time\\" (85) to inspire them to stay strong, as he sways and loses control of his body. He soon dies. On the other hand, Mary O'Hare verbally assaults the author about making \\"war look wonderful, so we'll have more of them [and they'll kill] babies\\" (18). Later, they had a discussion and \\"she was my friend after that\\" (19). The believable points are anti-war comments or unrelated to war, while the implausible remarks are made war-supporting characters.Vonnegut's control over literary tools reveals a deeper understanding of the text. He keeps the diction and syntax simple and direct, which allows the reader to easily understand the text. If the prose is easily understood, the reader can spend more time thinking about the story itself, especially the structure of the plot. Early in the novel, the narrator tells the reader that the book \\"is so short and jumbled and jangled... because there is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre\\" (24). This statement reveals that the author feels the bombing of Dresden was a massacre and that the plot will be short and jumbled. The tone for the rest of the story has also been set by that sentence. The reader knows that the story will be about a great loss of life. A dark tone hanging over a plot full of death and war will produce an anti-war sentiment. No persuasion from the characters or author will be necessary to convince readers that war is terrible.Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-5 is a science fiction, anti-war novel that fits neatly into neither category. The story is not focused on science fiction, nor is the plot blatantly against war. However, through expert manipulation of literary tools, plot structure, and implementation of original ideas, Vonnegut creates a masterpiece that becomes anti-war with a unique twist of science fiction. This was a thoroughly good read that everyone should experience at least once. In the spirit of Billy Pilgrim, \\"Farewell, hello, farewell, hello!\\" (181)."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Billy Pilgrim is born in 1922 and grows up in Ilium, New York. He does pretty good in high school, and enrolls in night classes at the Ilium School of Optometry, and is drafted into the army during World War II. He trains as a chaplain's helper in South Carolina, where an umpire officiates during practice battles and announces who survives and who dies. Billy's father dies in a hunting accident shortly before Billy ships overseas to join an infantry regiment in Luxembourg. Billy is thrown into the Battle of the Bulge in Belgium and is immediately taken prisoner behind German lines. Just before his capture, he experiences his first incident of time shifting. He sees the entirety of his life, from beginning to end, in one sweep.Billy is transported in a crowded railway boxcar to a POW camp in Germany. Upon his arrival, he and the other privates are treated to a feast by a group of fellow prisoners, who are English officers who were captured earlier in the war. Billy suffers a breakdown and gets a shot of morphine that sends him time-tripping again. Soon he and the other Americans travel onward to the beautiful city of Dresden, still fairly untouched by wartime privation. Here the prisoners must work for their keep at various jobs, including the creation of a nutritional malt syrup. Their camp is where a former slaughterhouse used to be. One night, Allied forces carpet bomb the city, then drop incendiary bombs to create a firestorm that sucks most of the oxygen into the fire, killing or burning roughly 130,000 people. Billy and his fellow POWs survive in an airtight meat locker. They emerge to find a land of destruction, where they are forced to move corpses from the rubble. Several days later, Russian forces capture the city, and Billy's involvement in the war ends.Billy returns to Ilium and finishes optometry school. He gets engaged to Valencia Merble, the obese daughter of the school's founder. After a nervous breakdown, Billy commits himself to a veterans' hospital and receives shock treatments. During his stay in the mental ward, a fellow patient introduces Billy to the science fiction novels of a writer named Kilgore Trout. After his recovery, Billy gets married. His wealthy father-in-law sets him up in the optometry business, and Billy and Valencia raise two children and grow rich. At his eighteenth wedding anniversary party the sight of a barbershop quartet makes him break down because, he realizes, it triggers a memory of Dresden.The night after his daughter's wedding in 1967, as he later reveals on a radio talk show, Billy is kidnapped by two-foot-high aliens who resemble upside-down toilet plungers, who he says are called Tralfamadorians. They take him in their flying saucer to the planet Tralfamadore, where they mate him with a movie actress named Montana Wildhack. She, like Billy, has been brought from Earth to live under a transparent geodesic dome in a zoo where Tralfamadorians can observe extraterrestrial curiosities. The Tralfamadorians explain to Billy their perception of time, how its entire sweep exists for them simultaneously in the fourth dimension. When someone dies, that person is simply dead at a particular time. Somewhere else and at a different time he or she is alive and well. Tralfamadorians prefer to look at life's nicer moments.When he returns to Earth, Billy initially says nothing of his experiences. In 1968, he gets on a chartered plane to go to an optometry conference in Montreal. The plane crashes into a mountain, and, among the optometrists, only Billy survives. A brain surgeon operates on him in a Vermont hospital. On her way to visit him there, Valencia dies of accidental carbon monoxide poisoning after crashing her car. Billy's daughter places him under the care of a nurse back home in Ilium. But he feels that the time is ripe to tell the world what he has learned. Billy has foreseen this moment while time-tripping, and he knows that his message will eventually be accepted. He sneaks off to New York City, where he goes on a radio talk show. Shortly thereafter, he writes a letter to the local paper. His daughter is at her wit's end and does not know what to do with him. Billy makes a tape recording of his account of his death, which he predicts will occur in 1976 after Chicago has been hydrogen-bombed by the Chinese. He knows exactly how it will happen. An unforgiving man he knew in the war will hire someone to shoot him. Billy adds that he will experience the violet hum of death and then will skip back to some other point in his life. He has seen it all many times."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Kurt Vonnuget is one of the most unique writers to emerge in the 2nd half of the 20th century. All of his novels contain a blend of sarcasm, dark humor satire, criticism of society's many hypocricies, and the exposure of human foibles/shortcomings, enhanced by greed and resource mongering. In Slaughter-House Five Vonnuget uses the perspective of a time-traveling WWII veteran, Billy Pilgrim, who like Vonnuget witnessed the Dresden firebombings, as the medium to expose his view of the short-comings of human conflict. The novel is a tremendous exposure and criticism on the brutality and mind-numbing savagery of war. Even for survivors, life becomes a tale of shell-shocked incongruencies that plague the psycho-somatic foundation of a person, as illustrated in our protoganist, Billy Pilgrim. This is one of the great anti-war novels written in a completely unique format and structure."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Poor Billy and his torn life. War is never pretty, and Vonnegut does wonderfully to depict a human being and what happens after war has shattered his mind. In this wonderfully simply written yet complex plot we get to tour through Billy's mind and discover who he is and where he has come from.With it all starting at war he broke down from the stress and eventually went to a hospital where he read sci-fi books at a critical moment of recovery. It is at this time that his imagination, or should I say insanity from the war, takes over and begins to create a more comfortable world for him to live in.I enjoyed this book a lot. It is always fun to see an author depict a person's mind and show you how they came to be who they are. What makes it even more fun is the fact that the mind we are seeing is insane from the war, which makes it all the better. I would recommend to anyone. Not a difficult read, but it sure is a fun one."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughterhouse-Five, by Kurt Vonnegut, reveals the world of delusional war veteran, Billy Pilgrim. Written as an anti-war novel, Vonnegut demonstrates how war can have harrowing effects on the mentality of survivors of war. A survivor of the Dresden fire-bombing, Pilgrim becomes \\"unstuck in time\\" as the novel relates a series of non-chronological events in Billy Pilgrim's life. The novel incorporates the protagonists' time travel through the different stages of his life, which Billy is unable to control. Another aspect of the novel is Billy's abduction by the Tralfamadorians, who relate their view of time. They believe that time is not linear, but exists as a forth dimension. The philosophy of the Tralfamadorians overshadows the idea of free-will, as they believe that each moment in time happens in the only way that that moment could occur, and they learn to accept their destiny. Billy Pilgrim learns to accept their philosophy, and thus accepts his life and death. Slaughterhouse-Five forces the reader to question the sanity of Billy Pilgrim; and in turn it leaves the reader to his or her own conclusions. Overall, this book is a great read, giving insight to Vonneguts' life, the structure of time, and the traumatic effects of war."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"It is rare for me to read a book in one sitting, I normally like to allow a night of sleep for full absorption, but this one got away from me.Billy was abducted by aliens, the tralfamadorians, who taught him that life could be viewed on a fourth dimension. The forth dimension allowed you to move through your life, past or future and see yourself in different circumstances. It's an interesting concept and is also the outlay of the book. What it really helped deliver was a picture of Billy in all his complexity. Since each of the main events in his life were introduced in pieces and gradually added to - by the end of the book the appreciation I had for the whole life of this man was immense.This is my first Vonnegut. I was blown away by some of his theories, and whether he was quoting real people or invented them on his own I found him brilliant. In particular there is an American, by the name of Campbell that I won't quote, but summarize:Americans (I'm adding Canadians, trust me it applies) are raised to believe that anyone can make money. Money, in actuality, is not that easy to come upon. What this theory has created a mass of poor people who live with the shame of being poor. To them, it is not sociological or economical, but personal failure that has landed them in this state. Above this, the ideal of anyone being able to make money has diminished the good will of the wealthy. It has also decreased the brethren that exist among the poor in other nations, where you do not have to be wealthy to be knowledgeable or good.It's inspired. Bravo."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Superficially, this book is a simple story about an American, Billy Pilgrim, who is captured by German forces and housed in a slaughterhouse in Dresden. There, he witnesses the horrible firebombing of the city by Allied forces. Eventually he returns home and marries and takes over the family optometry business.A secondary stream flows underneath this basic story. Billy Pilgrim is purportedly able to travel through time. He is also abducted by aliens and kept in their zoo with a young starlet as his \\"mate\\".Vonnegut's prose is simple, clear, and powerful. It is all plain English, and he doesn't make any effort to dress up the story with anything pretensions. Reading his work is refreshing because he never talks down to the reader, he just tells the story. (In this sense, he is a lot like Nabokov but with a smidgen less zest.)Delve deeper into the meaning of the story, though, and you will find that the story is as deep as you want to go. Billy Pilgrim is obviously \\"shell-shocked\\" and suffering internally, though from all outward appearances he seems to be fine. In his own mind he thinks himself fine, though his frequent flashbacks to his past and his imaginary alien abduction tell otherwise. So what exactly is going on with Billy?If all this is happening to Billy, what is Vonnegut trying to say? What are the demons that haunt him, the author? Vonnegut, too, was at the Dresden firebombing, and in a very real sense this book is his attempt at self-therapy. How much of Vonnegut is reflected in Billy?The aliens are presented not as time travelers, but as beings that simply \\"are\\". They, as well as Billy, see time as a solid mass which can be examined in any order. Therefore, to them, wars are inevitable, as too are happy times. The key, they tell Billy, is to look at the happy times rather than dwell on the sad times. However, the realness of the aliens is certainly in doubt. Perhaps Billy created the aliens, or picked up the idea from a book, in order to help him cope with his internal pain.The book has a strong anti-war message, but it doesn't beat you over the head with it. The most repeated phrase is \\"So it goes\\" which is a way to accept a preordained fate as it comes, but perhaps we don't have to accept that fate is preordained, that we have free-will to choose our fate. The aliens would scoff at this, but if Vonnegut meant for this to be an anti-war novel, then he must believe that we can control our fate enough to avoid war.The book is a great read. It is easy enough for young students and meaningful enough for older folks. 5 stars, easily."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I wonder whether this book would be published today. It is funny without being cynical or sarcastic. It is an anti-war novel that manages to avoid being preachy or heavy-handed. It is like a perfectly balanced house of cards or souffle, any more or any less would bring the whole thing crashing down. It is one of those books that makes you feel like the author is a close, personal friend.By now, you probably know the plot. Billy Pilgrim lives his life in out-of-sequence snippets that include alien abductions, marriage and career, and a naughty picture of a woman with a horse. But, of course, all roads lead to Dresden. This is ultimately, a book about the author's experiences as a POW during the Allied fire bombing of the German city (I'm not sure, but I suspect that the term \\"fire bombing\\" was coined for this particular massacre).There are two ways to read this book. You can read it literally so that Billy was really unstuck in time, kidnapped by aliens, and displayed in an inter-planetary zoo. Or the book can be intrepreted as the attempts of an unhinged man to cope with his experience in one of the most horrific (but ignored) events in human history. Either way, the story will both break your heart and make you smile.One of the key themes is perspective. The truth and the way one feels about the truth can change depending on the angle at which things are viewed. Particularly if one is a Tralfamadorian.One of the best things about this book is the writing style. Vonnegut's easy-going, straight-ahead style is the key to this book. Both the author and the protagonist manage to avoid inserting their opinions about the unfolding events. Instead, they let the facts of the story speak for themselves. The horrors of Dresden are all the more horrific when stated matter-of-factly. Billy Pilgrim is a very passive character. He seldom initiates action, but, instead, responds to events as they unfold. This is the role that just about all us are stuck with when it comes to global events like war, time, and fate.In a way, this book reminded me of Steinbeck's Monterey trilogy. The plot, characters, and themes of the Slaughterhouse Five have nothing in common with those of Cannary Row. But in each case, there is an unapologetic love of humanity that bubbles through the pages. That is something that one finds only in the work of the best author's and the best people."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"An aspect of SLAUGHTERHOUSE-FIVE that's not often discussed is its focus on writing about trauma. The novel is about Billy Pilgrim, but it is also about the narrator who is trying to find a way of coping with the absurdity of war. In this sense, SLAUGHTERHOUSE-FIVE is similar to J. D. Salinger's short story \\"For Esme With Love and Squalor\\" and Tim O'Brien's THE THINGS THEY CARRIED. Writing about trauma objectifies it and it helps the writer to heal. Thus the narrator of SLAUGHTERHOUSE-FIVE can say by the end of the book that he's now going to write something happy. Therefore, not only is this an important book for its grand themes dealing with war, it's a handbook for writers. John Gardner, the great guru of creative writing, said that one creates from a \\"psychic wound.\\" SLAUGHTERHOUSE-FIVE instructs us in how this may be accomplished. Quite possibly, this novel can help writers more than 100 How-to books on the subject, and this is why I make it required reading for my university creative writing students."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Ethan Hawke is a wonderful reader who captures the dreamlike quality of this novel.

Is this guy like Tarantino's father or what? They are like the Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader of time. It was entertaining, but the majority of the time, I could not place the scenes in the correct order. It truly was like seeing Pulp Fiction for the first time. It was so bizarre that you end up watching it again. Only to find yourself questioning why you watched it the first time.If Mr. Vonnegut wanted to hold my attention, he should have started the story on Tralfamadore. The beginning was so rough that my eyes had to be tied open with fishing line. The author paints a very gray picture of his own life only to dramatically spice up Billy's. When I first started to read it, I thought to myself, \\"This guy is ripping off every movie I have ever seen about time travel.\\" Then I realized that this book was written a little bit before my time. Maybe all of those writers were fans, or maybe Vonnegut traveled through time and became a fan of theirs. After reading this book, I also began to question my own sanity.Billy Pilgrim, what a name. Billy, your, \\"average Joe,\\" embarking on a pilgrimage through the years of his life in what ever order he chooses. And Montana? Come on, only two things could be as big as the state of Montana on a porn star and neither of those two are ever her imagination. Mr. Vonnegut's, on the other hand is truly unbelievable. I am sure that in a caf&eacute; in heaven, gentlemen like Rod Sterling and Leonard Nimoy are holding their breath and waiting to share a cup of holy coffee with him.I suppose the best way to describe this book without offending any war veterans or stepping on the toes of any Klingons. Is to say if M*A*S*H and Star Trek could somehow have a baby, it would be Slaughterhouse-five."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I had heard this book mentioned many times by many people in literary circles, and thus I bought it to read, just for the experience. It is without a doubt one of the classic anti-war novels, deserving a place right beside Heller's \\"Catch-22\\". It discusses the personal affects of the war on the children that are forced to carry it. Theough Vonnegut's eyes you see that it is not all heroic like the movies would have you believe. And of course it has Vonnegut's classic touch of humor. A fantastic book, everyone should read it at least once. The reason it got four stars is because out of all of Vonnegut's novels, I feel this is one of his worst. But saying worst makes it sound as if its bad. Its not, its fantastic, just not as good as his others."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Sorry, I always have to put lame titles for my reviews.

I knew it was going to be strange. I knew that I would enjoy the experience of reading it. But the question for each of those was \\"how much so?\\" Anyways, once I was done, I knew that I'd be reading more Vonnegut.This was one of those books where you can't immediately decide if you liked it or not. I thought, \\"I THINK I like it...err...maybe?\\" One of my friends, who is also a Vonnegut fan, let me borrow Breakfast of Champions, which I had no doubts about whether I liked it or not. I definately enjoyed Breakfast of Champions better. Slaughterhouse Five is great it its own right, for sure.

Haha."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I read this book over a short period of time so I don't think I got as much out of it as most people would. When I read this book I can honestly say that it was not the best book I have ever read and that is why I gave it 4 it is a completely new type of writing compared to the normal form of prose writing. The story of Billy Pilgrim's crazy time travel if you will is a very outrageous story and shows how Kurt is quite a crazy author and he maybe a little screwed up in the head. Something that I found interesting was at the beginning of the book how it is a autobiography of how Vonnegurt was trying to write abook about Dresden but he could not get the book started so he starts to tell us about Billy and how \\"Billy Pilgrim has become unstuck in Time\\" It is crazy because he goes from being himself back to his childhood and then he goes into the POW camps and then to a mysterious planet called Tralfamadore which is inhabited by the Tralfamadorians where he stays in a zoo for months in theie time but on earth it is not even a second it is moment in time. The obvious theme is time travel which Billy does seemlessly because he is unstuck in time. Another theme which is part of Billy's personality is the way that whenever something bad happens he seems to let it pass when any other person would cry he lets it go \\"So it goes\\" asit says. This book positively contributed to literature because it is a different type of writing and it is a new and fantastic way of writing and it is a cool story a little crazy but cool. This book was banned because it used vulgar language in places and there is a scene when he has sex and there are some references that are some phrases of blasphamy which would mean banning the book in religious schools."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Vonnegut's writing has always defied traditional classification and Slaughterhouse-Five is a prime example of this as it combines a mix of social satire, science fiction, anti-war sentiment as well as great deal of autobiographical detail. The full title-page of Slaughterhouse Five is perhaps the most revealing and apt description of the book in addition to giving us some insight into the author's mind-set behind its creation.Slaughterhouse-Five or The Children's Crusade - A Duty-Dance with Death By Kurt VonnegutA fourth-generation German-American now living in easy circumstances on Cape Cod [and smoking too much], who, as an American Infantry Scout Hors De Combat, As a prisoner of war, witnessed the fire-bombing of Dresden, Germany, \\"The Florence of the Elbe,\\" a long time ago, and survived to tell the tale. This is a novel somewhat in the telegraphic schizophrenic manner of tales of the planet Tralfamadore, where the flying saucers come from.Billy Pilgrim's \\"telegraphic schizophrenic\\" shifts from one period of his life to another is his own defence mechanism in dealing with (or avoiding dealing with) the traumatic experiences in his life. Vonnegut has acknowledged that the only way in which he could tell his story of surviving the fire-bombing of Dresden was in this fragmented manner and that it refused to come out as a linear story when he attempted to tell it as such.What is amazing to me about Slaughterhouse Five is that Vonnegut manages to fit so much into one story. While writing a brilliant satire on the absurdity of war on par with Joseph Heller's Catch-22, Vonnegut also manages to put a human face on the tragedy at Dresden and expose one of World War II's darker moments to the general public in an accessible form.While the fragmented nature of time in the novel is largely a thematic device used by Vonnegut to contrast the different events in Billy Pilgrim's life, Vonnegut also contemplates the nature of time and fate in the book.After Billy meets with the Tralfamadorian's and they explain the nature of time from their own perception, Billy is able to accept his wanderings in time. Having visited his own death on numerous times he is no longer frightened by it and has come to accept it. With regard to fate, Vonnegut seems to argue that life is easier to live if we, like Billy Pilgrim accept that what will happen has already happened and that we are not in control of our own destiny. This absence of responsibility for our actions could in itself spark an entirely separate philosophical and religious debate that I don't intend to entertain in the space provided here. Suffice it to say that it's an interesting proposition and one that can be seen as a recurring theme in time travel literature.With regard to time travel and the nature of time my argument of late has been that if the past is immutable and cannot be changed by the time traveller, then it tends to suggest that fate exists. My logic being that assuming time is linear (which it may not be), our present is the future's past so if we can't change our past the future cannot change its own past (our present). Confused yet? Anyhow, its just an aside that I thought I would mention in light of the themes raised in Slaughterhouse Five."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This was the first Vonnegut I've read and so far it's my favorite.

At the surface it seems he is just suffering from delusions from his war experiences.

This book comes in a time of Vonnegut's writing career where he was both a great teacher and a great artist. This is a culmination of those teachings, put together in a uniquely artistic manner.The story is an anti-war exploration of the meaning of life. Rather, as the back covers proclaims, it is an odyssey through time. The main character, Billy Pilgrim, hops back and forth among his memories (in time) in an effort to put together the fractured reality which exists there. Along the way, Vonnegut creates resonances which make for superb reading. I don't think I overstate the case when I call it brilliant.Pilgrim, in this odyssey, finds that time does not proceed linearly, as we perceive it. Time merely is. If an event exists, it always exists since there is no past, present, nor future. Pilgrim learns this when he is abducted by aliens and taken to the planet Tralfamadore. Another tidbit he learns is that war is unavoidable. However, war doesn't exist in every moment in time, so the Tralfamadorians choose to visit those moments when there is no war.On one hand, this is an absurd statement for an anti-war book. If Pilgrim finds that war is inevitable, how are we to believe we can avoid situations like Dresden? I don't think this is Vonnegut's message, exactly. Tralfamadorians choose to spend their conscious time in moments when war isn't. Since we live linearly, we should likewise choose to exist in moments when there is no war. If we could, most of us would choose to spend our time in moments of peace. So perhaps war is inevitable, but we don't need to live through it right now.It's hard for me to imagine anyone who wouldn't like this book. I suppose if you were too young to understand, it may be unthrilling. Aside from that, you can assume that war hawks will dismiss it as gibberish, since Vonnegut does not portray war as glorious. As strange as it sounds, Vonnegut would probably call it gibberish too.An excellent book, even if it is gibberish."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Ah, a Classic, in all literary senses of the term. Highly sophisticated thinking turned very entertaing novel. From start to finish this book had me entranced. The heavy philosophical and physical conundrums are uniquely paralleled by the comical and satirical. Innovative in its writing, Vonnegut brings to you a hearty helping of shear genius. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"\\"God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom always to tell the difference.\\" People throughout life struggle to understand who they really are, and where they belong in this world. By reading Slaughterhouse-5 one will come closer to accepting the \\"reality\\" about life. The story tells the journey of Billy Pilgrim. From the infamous fire bombings of Dresden during his army days in WWII and through his life in the planet Tralfamadore, the reader will learn how Billy Pilgrim views today's world. His \\"so it goes\\" attitude, his beliefs of manipulating time, and his other quirky characteristics will compel you to admire him. Mainly considered one of world's great anti-war books, it is not written in the usual war book style. Kurt Voneggut evades all the grueling details about war; instead completely focus on Billy's reflection of war and his world. The story is told to the reader by random flashbacks, which makes the book appear as puzzle pieces. All these pieces fall into place to give us a complete picture only in the end, a technique similar to one that is used in \\"Cat's Cradle\\" another Voneggut classic. Voneggut uses his usual black humor, sarcastic tone and unique imagination to deliver a story that warms our hearts but yet makes us aware of the ugly truth of our own existence that we do not want to know. This is as good as it gets folks! So it goes."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This book was my first experience with Vonnegut, but it certainly will not be my last. Kurt's writing style amazed me; he has done in this book one of the hardest things to do in literature, which is to take a serious subject (and what is more serious than war?) and manage to make it funny. Mind you, this is not a comedy, but a very entertaining satire. The wit is overflowing, from the clever way in which the first chapter sets up the book, to the introduction of the character Kilgore Trout (&quot;if only he could WRITE!&quot;), to the various amusing ancedotes throughout the book. It all marks a masterpiece. Vonnegut's prose is masterful, and keeps you reading. I finished the book in two settings (nearly one) and could not hardly put it down. On the surface, his prose seems very simple, naive, and even childlike. It is told, for the most part, in an &quot;ordinary Joe&quot; sort of way, almost as if the author was sitting there with you sharing the story over a drink. This may seem unsophisticated, or not relevant to this type of subject matter, but as anyone who has actually tried to write that way knows, it is a far more difficult thing to do than writing in a customary style. When you're blazing through reading this book it may seem like merely a funny book (very black humor) with a few morals thrown in for good measure. However, when you step away from the book and look at the big picture, this is very clearly not the case. This books has some very deep meanings and themes, and is satrical to boot. War might be inevitable... but maybe death isn't as bad as we think... things happen for a reason and maybe we can't change them... whatever happens, happens for a reason, and whatever must be, must be. And so on.So it goes."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Not only is this gem of a novel a good introduction to Vonnegut, it is, as well, a great way to get back into the habit of reading again. This book is an effortless read. The sentences fall of the page as meat from the spare rib (when they're cooked just right). Vonnegut's genious lies in his apparent simplicity, yet without realizing it, he invigorates your intellect. It is fair to dub Slaughterhouse Five an &quot;anti-war&quot; novel, but unfair to pigeonhole-it as such. Progressive in its structure and style, it is a refreshing journey with no beginning and no end; fragmented and focused at the same time. Vonnegut is a master humorist with tremendous style, not depending on boring explanations or lofty prose but simply throwing beautiful, original, yet simple phrases and sentences at us and relying on his acute sarcasm. Fans of writers from Bradbury to Heller to John Irving will love Slaughterhouse Five."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I read this book in a little over a week. It was an easy read, with my greatest difficulty being trying to follow as it jumped from time period to time period. I was a little thrown back when I first heard about the Tralfamadore part before I read it, but it is an important segment of the novel. I thouroughly enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This is a great book both if you are looking for entertaining reading or if you enjoy reflecting on the more serious implications of the book. It is very funny and is slightly silly, but then the fire bombing fits perfectly, being in itself extremely silly. It is a great anti-war novel and shows us that if looked upon from the outside, our world is a strange place. Read it."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughter House Five was the first Vonnegut book I read back in high school. He had a knack for maintaining a readers attention while leaping to new characters and scenes without warning. It's been a while since I've picked up a Vonnegut book. Like countless others, his passing has brought him back to the forefront of my mind and I will be revisiting his work. Jack Gorfien MS, L.Ac., author ofDancing with Dragonflies"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This book is strange, very strange. Death permeates this book and, each time it is brought up the author pops his head above the waters and tells us, \\"So it goes.\\" There are an awful lot of times we see the phrase, \\"So it goes.\\" in this book.Is this an anti-war book, then? If there is a central episode in the book, and that's not exactly clear, it's the firebombing of Dresden on the 13th February, 1945 - an undefended civilian town. Although it's impossible to know how many people were killed, Kurt Vonnegut uses the high estimates in the book. Whatever the number it's clear that this was one of the most disturbing episodes in World War II and one that obviously effected Kurt immensely.The telling of this tale, then, could be considered anti-war. Indeed in chapter one, which is really an extended author's note, Kurt talks about this. He is cautioned against writing an anti-war book - it's like writing an anti-glacier book, he is told, because there is no way to prevent it. And I think that Kurt realizes this. And he tells us they'll always be death anyway. So it goes.\\"The Children's Crusade\\", the sub-title of the book, reveals the truth about the second world war - that it is fought by young, inexperienced unprepared men fighting for a country they don't really believe in. A character appears in the book, an American who has turned traitor and is working for the Nazis, who details how the American poor are so downtrodden that they have no sense of loyalty or proprietary - compared, we have to assume, with the salt-of-the-earth European poor. On this level, this book stands with \\"Catch-22\\" and \\"The Naked and the Dead\\" in giving a brutal, damning account of the ridiculousness of those who actually fought WW II. \\"All the real soldiers are dead.\\" So it goes.But this novel isn't a war story at all. It permeates it but the substance is quite different (by the way, the sample pages are from chapter one which, as I have said, is more of an author's note, so they don't really capture the heart of the book).The majority of the book is much stranger and is told in the third person (with wonderful interjections by the author as he is heard in the background on a troup train or in the prison camp!). We follow the life adventures of Billy Pilgrim (A Pilgrim's Progress of course), a sad delusioned man who believes he can journey back and forth in time.And that's the way the story is presented - snapshots of time. Click. We're seeing him thrown into the deep end of the pool by his father to see if he'll sink or swim. Click. He's in a prisoner of war camp watching Cinderella performed by British Officers. Click. He's been transported by the Tramalfadorians - an extra-planetary race who see in four dimensions and provide Billy with all of his extraordinary insights. Click. He's in a mental hospital shortly after the war.The mental health of Billy Pilgrim is something we have to contend with throughout the book. Strangely all of his insights provided by the Tramalfadorians have already been written by a fourth rate Sci-Fi author he is introduced to in a mental hospital. At one point he is put on display by the Tramalfadorians in a zoo and has to live on public display - eventually with an adult filmstar who has also been captured. Strangely the science fiction author has already written about such a zoo.So, is Billy Pilgrim just living these books in his deranged mind? Is everything happening as he is recovering from massive head injuries sustained in a plane crash? Is the author a fictional invention of his too, someone visible to him only? This is part of the brilliance of this book. Kurt Vonnegut skillfully weaves what appear to be (and I'm sure are) real-life experiences of his time in Germany during the war with a brilliant but fractured mind.The Tramalfadorians don't read books like we do. They have a set of experiences that are all read in parallel. The great authors are not those who can tell wonderful tales, not those who can define great characters but those who can make the overall feel of all of these simultaneous experiences be emotionally fulfilling. Of course what Kurt is doing with this book is precisely the same thing - we get this small snapshots that seem to come at us from all directions and leave us with an experience that is definitely more than the sum of it's parts.My review really cannot do justice to this book. It is an astonishing work and well worth reading."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Billy Pilgrim is unstuck in time. He can flip around randomly throughout his life whereever he wants to go. He serves as a chaplain's assistant in World War II, is captured by Germans, survives the largest massacre in European history, the fire bombing of dresden. It's so ironically funny at times. It was interesting, finding out how billy came up with his delusions."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Vonnegut at the top of his form, which is a fresh style compared to most of the tired writers of this century."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This was a fun indoctrination to Vonnegut's work. Much to think about in this one: the meaning behind &quot;So it goes,&quot; whether Billy Pilgrim is sane or insane, and how literal was the story in its idea of Billy's time travelling? The movie changes some parts, and leaves some other good points out, but both are worth checking out to complement each other. Great novel about a forgotten event in the history of World War II."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"While most people tend to categorize this book as sci-fi with a purpose, I think it should be lended the legitimacy it deserves. Science-fiction carries a connotation of being less than top-notch, but more importantly, this book has few of the charateristics of a sci-fi novel. The main character, Billy Pilgrim, while an advid proponet of the Jim Marr's-type &quot;Aliens Are Among Us&quot; routine, is merely dabbling in the device used to tell the story. These mysterious and all-knowing Tralfamadorians scatter Billy through his life in a very vivid staccato space jump. However, the importance is not these creatures, but the metaphor. These aliens are merely the device that makes Billy see--for the first time--the insanity of this so-called life of ours. While the novel has these conspicuous sci-fi tendencies, the rest of the book is more a story of very human encounters with everyday run-of-the-mill psychopaths, perverts, obese better-halfs, et cetera. And while the moral lesson is a heavy one, this is one of the most entertaining anit-war books ever written. Certainly one of the best books of the second half of the 20th century."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Vonnegut is a true master. Slaughterhouse Five is Vonnegutshowing us just how excellent he can be. If you pick up this book,don't plan on being able to do anything else until you finish it. It really is that good. It will pull you in, hold you there, and make you laugh outloud, all while delivering a strong anti-war message. Only Vonnegut could pull this off so well."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I plan to read more books by Vonnegut, this was a fantastic book! The main character travels through time, has a new outlook on life, and lives all of his life out of sequence.

I don't know. This book made me snicker at times, but I didn't really laugh. I think it is in Vonnegut's delivery, the scenes are not visual enough. This, ironicaly, works well with the tragic elements though. The only other problem is there is no sense of closer because of the fragmented style, but this same style works very well when you are in the middle of the book. If you like this, I'd think you'd also like Canticle for Leibowits by Walter Miller. It is somewhat more optimistic, but just as poignant."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I felt this was a great book.

However, when I began reading I realized that Vonnegut used time travel and alien abduction as if it were the regular thing, not something futuristic or high-tech. Still, even though the book is not true SciFi I still enjoyed it. Billy Pilgrim, the main charictor, was in WWII and survived the bombing of Dresden. Later in life he was abducted by aliens who see time in a very unusual way. It is &quot;structured&quot;, so that, while they can see everything happening at the same time, they can do nothing to prevent it. The experiences and knowledge Billy gains from these two events are what make up the plot. You travel with him troughout his life to see how he learns and deals with these and other events. Slaughterhouse-Five is suppost to be an anti-war book, but I do not see it as such. Vonnegut says throughout the book that war cannot be prevented, but instead that people should learn to deal with it. This is good advice that helps people cope with many events, not just war. Another thing that makes the book interesting is how Vonnegut puts himself into it. Vonnegut, like Billy, was a prisoner of war and survived the bombing of Dresden. The entire first and part of the last chapter are about him and he even mentions himself in the story line. This allows you to see how he feels about the war and also provides wisdom from someone who has gotton a lot out of live. The last thing that I enjoyed about the book was the historical information. Before reading it I had never heard of Dresden. I was upset to learn that 135,000 Germans, mostly civilians, were killed there by Allied planes, which is almost twice as many killed in Hiroshima by the atom bomb. This type of information seems like something everyone should know. This book would be good for people who like to look at things differently. The ideas in Slaughterhouse-Five are strange, but could possibly help you deal with your own life. The time travel and aliens serve only to promote Vonnegut's view and people considering this book should understand that it is not really science fiction. I do recommend this book, however, there is some vulgar language and situations. I could not see Slaughterhouse-Five as required reading for school."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Good and great to have it.

Excellent !"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Joel Witt and co.AP LIT Group Book Review: Evaluate the WorkThe overall purpose of Slaughterhouse Five was to write about antiwar sentiments, covering the fire bombing of Dresden in Germany during World War II. Vonnegut himself said that writing an antiwar book would do as much about war as writing a book about glaciers would to stop their motion. With that said his overall writing style was different and at times unfamiliar. He would talk about the event and then fast forward or rewind in time about stories with a particular character and he maintained that style throughout the book. In the end his writing style helped make his point effective on why war is bad. It might have been easier to understand if perhaps he had spoken directly about the story the entire time with pre exposition and character build up like books we're familiar with, but his point was made and he did his job. His overall writing format was odd but when looking at the diction and sentence make up, the plot was easy to follow. He was able to be effective because his thoughts were simple.Vonnegut created a pattern when dealing with death, always closing his thoughts with \\"so it goes.\\" This was a somewhat humorous and effective way to talk about an idea as serious as death. It essentially goes back to the theme of the story with the bombing of Dresden and the civilian deaths that occurred. His overall writing style, although different, was effective for making a statement. Vonnegut is able to portray the destructiveness of war through Billy who constantly switches from past, present, and future.Although it was written in an abstract manner Slaughterhouse Five magnifies the pointlessness of war and the atrocities that go along with it. His final quote with the bird \\"Poo-tee-weet\\" essentially was used as an analogy to war and that it solves nothing, which connects back to the antiwar theme. Vonnegut was able to make his abstract writing style effective in proving his point."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"One of the best books I have ever read.

It's clear why this book has become a classic. In one sense it breaks all the rules of writing and sets itself apart. The author has been true to his own vision and shows the reader the fluidity of the mind of a person who has endured shellshock and has post traumatic stress disorder -- the moving in and out of time in what appear to be alternately flashbacks (the war) and hallucinations (abduction by aliens). It further addresses the horror of the Allied bombing of Dresden, Germany, in World War II -- to our shame. I told my grandson to imagine that someone had just knocked on the door and ordered him to go to war. How would he feel? That's the point of view of this book. A young man is conscripted and sent to war. What does he fear? How does he view the daily life of war? Because Kurt Vonnegut was himself a prisoner in the slaughterhouse converted into a prison, his writing is that more realistic about what he witnessed in Dresden through the eyes of his protagonist. Because of the slipping in and out of time, it can be a bit confusing, especially for a young reader, but one adapts to share this amazing journey of memories and discoveries."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect but was taken with the way Vonnegut could weave together such a wonderful story.

I read it in college, but had forgotten much of the book and, unfortunately, better remembered the badly scripted 1975 movie. Most of our club members had read the book in college. We thoroughly enjoyed the trip back to the late 60's, especially since we are all graduates of Vonnegut's Alma Mater and residents of his home town.It is an anti-war book, which describes the Allied fire bombings of Dresden. Vonnegut relates that 135,000 were killed in the bombing, but more recent scholarship has shown that the actual death toll was 25,000 to 45,000 people killed. \\"All of this happened, more or less...\\" is the opening line of the book. The narrator tells us that he is Vonnegut and he was there in Dresden as a POW during the bombing. Several items of Vonnegut's personal history and war experiences are related int the book. And he makes it clear that his war experience taught him this lesson about war: Stop doing it!The protagonist is not the narrator. Billy Pilgrim is a weak, clownish, anti-hero, who is either insane or a time-traveler who resides (in a way) on another planet. Members or our club responded to Billy quite differently. Some found him to be a pathetic imbecile, and others a winsome anti-war prophet and philosopher.The style and substance of the book is mostly light, wry, and satirical with several pearls of wisdom. Vonnegut is a post-modern in his meta-commenting on the book within the book. His commentary on American society, politics, and religion are deeply insightful and funny. He anticipates sociopolitical issues well in advance of their currency. E.g., this 1969 book references gun control, which was not in the headlines back then, as it is now.The most interesting (to our book club and me) philosophical issue Vonnegut takes on is Time (not the magazine). Time works for the Trafalmadorians and Billy like memory. The mind can move forward and backward and land on any moment for a time. Of course, our memories do not let us move into the future. But, if existence/life is a never-ending looping circle, then there is no beginning or end. One could experience any moment within the loop through memory as past and future would just be constructs of convenience. Billy Pilgrim learns from the Trafalmadorians how to become a \\"timeless being\\" and to transcend death through the ability to continue experiencing his life again and again.Vonnegut, through Billy and the Trafalmadorians, seems to be a fatalist. That is, it seems to us that we have free will, but we really don't. The most powerful presentation of fatalism is the coming end of Trafalmadore and the acceptance by the Trafalmadorians that, though they know how it will happen, they will do nothing to change it. Because, as time is an eternal loop that does not change, the \\"future\\" will not be changed.Vonnegut's narrative style is quirky and loopy and endearing. However, the repetition of \\"So it goes\\" began to feel like finger nails on a chalk board to me. That is my one criticism. Although, I understand that he had a point to make, which is his own fatalism about death.MONSTERS OF THE MIDWAY The Death, Resurrection, and Redemption of Chicago Football"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"My first experience with Kurt Vonnegut.

This one took me a few chapters to get into, but by the end I can honestly say it's one of my favorites. The way into the story for me was to see the world as the protagonist, Billy Pilgrim, sees it. Which is to say Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time and bounces around his own life more as an indifferent observer rather than one living it. He still feels pain and experiences joy, but Billy is detached about what comes next. Stuff happens, so it goes.Slaughterhouse-Five is part science fiction, part anti-war apologetic and part unconventional narrative. For most readers, if you give the tone of the book a chance, you're sure to discover something revelatory in Billy Pilgrim's story that relates to you."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughterhouse Five is a book that defies a clear and coherent summary, it is hard to pin it on any one thing. On one level it is a book about the fire bombing of Dresden during the climax of the second world war - which the author witnessed first hand during his military service - but on a much larger level it is a twisted science fiction/psychological cross breed about time travel, aliens, philosophy, war, perspective, life and of course death. So it goes. The book easily scores a 5 out of 5 for it's unique writing style, story and approach: it is very readable, and though it's short, it leaves a long lasting impression. I would also say it's a book you could read twice - which is always a good thing - as there is a lot of depth scattered throughout its pages for the readers who like to highlight, take notes and dwell on the book's themes and messages.Kurt Vonnegut employs a very economical writing style, and relies heavily on symbolism, colours and motifs, but delivers them with short and direct sentences. The author has popularised the saying \`So it goes' through Slaughterhouse Five's layers upon layers of (well executed) repetition; these three words hold a certain power in the context of the story, and will no doubt conjure in the reader's mind a fascinating philosophy that underlines the whole book.The story centers around a time traveling man called Billy Pilgrim who served in the Second World War, witnessed the fire bombing at Dresden, and was abducted by aliens who helped him to understand his time traveling experiences. He also ends up at some point in the novel as a POW in a slaughterhouse - numbered 5, obviously. These are all minor details that I will not expand upon, as you will have to read it for yourself, but rest easy in the comforting knowledge that I am not spoiling the book for you. The story is not written in chronological order and allows you to glimpse at all these occurrences and more very early on in the book. The author, even tells the reader how the book will end at the very beginning.And so on.All in all I thoroughly enjoyed reading Slaughterhouse Five. I strongly recommend it to anyone who has not read it before and I will always hold a special place for it in my bookshelf. :)"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Vonnegut marries science fiction and war in Slaughterhouse-Five, creating a world where unimaginable suffering coexists with infinite life. Billy Pilgrim is the clownish, unlikely hero who surmounts death not through extraordinary physical prowess but through madness. His enlightenment on Tralfamadore may be a figment of his imagination, but it is crucial to creating a sense of purpose in his life. It is both a blessing and a curse, giving him the wherewithal to endure trauma, but also ostracizing him from others. As the self-professed sole human being with the key to understanding the secrets of space-time, Billy Pilgrim can finally cope with the tremendous loss he endured in Dresden, but at the expense of his humanity. Though Billy Pilgrim has in reality lost his sanity, his discovery of Tralfamadorian fatalism is his salvation from suicide. With his new view of life comes a rationalization of suffering, pain, and death.Billy Pilgrim's becoming unstuck in time is a triumphant, albeit imaginary, feat. He is the runt of a survivor turned glorious man. Billy's madness takes him to a magical place where captivity is safe, the universe has already ended, and time warping is possible. Though it leads him to being estranged by society, his insanity saves his life. Had he not found a way to rationalize his memories of suffering, he may as well have given up hope to live. His fatalistic philosophy lets him cope with absurdity, making him a hero who can see the beauty of existence despite being aware of its meaninglessness. He has seen corpses being disintegrated by flame throwers and lived through a plane crash, yet he can make peace with death simply by believing, \\"so it goes.\\""},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughterhouse Five is now one of my favorite books upon finishing it. The book's narrative is very unique as it frequently jumps from one event to another as it chronicles the events of Billy Pilgrim's life before and after his experience in Dresden in WW2. The book is very entertaining and funny yet also sad and thought provoking all at the same time.Some readers may get confused with the non-linear storytelling but the book isn't very long and the events are very detailed and unforgettable.I also admire how Vonnegut described wartime conditions, soldiers did not always have adequate equipment and weapons and being a prisoner of war and forced into labor for you're enemies is not fun and serves as a good anti-war story.i recommend this to anyone especially now when America is at war in the middle east and some people may change their minds about the perceptions of war as it changed mine."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This was not what I was expecting at all, but it was so good! I couldn't put it down and ended up reading it in one sitting. Slaughterhouse 5 is a deeply moving story about the bombing of Dresden with an important message told from the remnants of Billy Pilgrim's tortured mind that can seem absurd, but which really makes it all the more poignant. Definitely worth reading!"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughterhouse Five is, in effect, an autobiography of Kurt Vonnegut's time during the World War Two. However, Vonnegut tries to put his own satirical spin on his life by creating the awkward, little soldier, Billy Pilgrim. Here's the real twist: Billy is unstuck in time. That is, he is able to perceive every moment of his life from any point in time. As if that's not confusing enough, Billy has no control over his visions. This creates a story that goes back and forth through flashbacks and flashforewards, creating a story so knotted up within itself that even the reader will lose all sense of what time it's supposed to be in the book.The book seems to be intended to bring to light the Fire-Bombing of Dresden, an event many Americans would rather leave forgotten. However, the Fire-bombing, while hinted at throughout the book, only occurs near the very end, and even then, it seems that Billy's own emotions and stresses resulting from excessive time travel take the main focus of the book.If you're into dark humor, confusing and intricate storylines, and rather depressing events, then this is the book for you! If, however, you'd rather turn your frown upside down, I suggest reading something else. For the tragic, yet grimly humorous and ironic tale of Billy Pilgrim and the Fire-bombing of Dresden doesn't exactly make for a giddy and gleeful read."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Maybe YOU will, too! Kurt Vonnegut is one of my favorite authors, and I consider this to be one of his finest works."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Well, true to my word I gave Vonnegut a second try with \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" after being unimpressed with \\"Sirens of Titan\\" and I'm very glad I did. I found \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" very enjoyable and actually plan to read it again. His look at war through the eyes of the unlikely Billy Pilgrim was great and took me by surprise as we've come to expect the hero in a war (or anti-war) tale to be filled with machismo. After finishing \\"S5\\" I was glad I'd chose to read \\"Sirens\\" first. Although the two do not have much in common I felt I had a little more understanding of Vonneguts views of time and space and spirituality.I also felt I had a better understanding of Tralfamadorian teaching and I also enjoyed the nod to the Rumsfoord family.Great book.I'm now looking forward to Cat's Cradle."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This book has it all, love, war, and of course, aliens. These are the three essential pieces to any great novel. Throughout this book, the main character, Billy, takes the reader through his own life in a series of un-sequenced events. He relives his life, and the reader gets to be a part of it. This is a quick, but complex read and I would recommend it to anyone interested in quirky books, unique styles of writing, or aliens. Vonnegut will be sure to keep you chuckling with his satirical sense of humor."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"The Allied bombing of Dresden Germany is THE singular event which dominates this rightful classic by Kurt Vonnegut.According to Vonnegut the bombing claimed over 135000 lives and left the city of Dresden looking like a jagged moonscape.For his part it no doubt left part's of Vonnegut's soul just as ravaged and because the scene was such a horror, Vonnegut has to struggle to even find a way to look at the event.His mundane way of looking at the event of course is in the person of Billy Pilgram, a ne'er do well soldier who wasn't even carrying a weapon when he was captured by the Germans during the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944. In Pilgram we see a less than average soldier surviving against horrible odds in spite of himself and not because of any great merit on his part. After the war, we see Pilgram propser again not because of himself but rather more in spite of the odds.In a less mundane way, Vonnegut uses science fiction as a vehicle for obliquely viewing inhumanity. After a head injury Pilgram reports that he's spent his life being \\"unstuck in time\\" which Vonnegut uses effectively as a device for having Pilgram relive different portions of his life.As part of his \\"unstuck in time\\" travels Pilgram meets Tralfamadorians, or creatures from Tralfamadore who resemble plumbers helpers with a hand located at the top of the helper with an eye where the palm would otherwise be.In dialogues with the Tralfamadorians, Pilgram learns that human notions of time are different than the way time really is. In this part of the book, Vonnegut provides a spot on description of so called block time where all events that ever happened are still happening now...albeit on a different chronological date. So Julius Caesar remains alive and well but you'd have to go back to PRIOR to March 14 48 BCE to meet him. Because it turns out that this is something Tralfamadorians can do they help Pilgram flush out his \\"unstuck in time\\" issues.In reading about Pilgram and the Tralfamadorians and all that I couldn't help but be impressed with the range of Vonnegut's imagination. However I also couldn't help seeing it for what it ultimately was...a smokescreen for the real issue of why he or Pilgram yet survived that bombing when so many others did not.Like all survivor guilt, there's ultimately no right explanation. And whether those who precede us yet remain alive somewhere in time they nonetheless remain separated from us humans by an impenetrable wall.This book of course does not tear down that wall. Maybe nothing can. But it certainly takes us inside Vonnegut's horror over its existence which I guess is why this book is such a rightful classic in the first place."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"There are thousands of war-diaries in the world today. There are big books, small books, boring books, intense books, and diary books, all on the subject of war. When was the last time you read a war book? And liked it? Maybe you've never been interested to pick up a book about war. Personally, I've never finished a war book, usually because they're horribly boring. I could do without endless details about battles and strategy; it takes more than that to keep me interested. Well, in a world of thousands of dull war-books, Slaughterhouse-Five rises above the rest as a breath of fresh air. It is a book that I will read and re-read throughout my life. Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. wrote Slaughterhouse-Five to be serious, hysterically funny, and very creative all at the same time, all of which he succeeds at doing. Slaughterhouse-Five tells the tale of the life of Billy Pilgrim, a nave young scout* who is captured in the Battle of Dresden of WWII. Billy is then employed in a slaughterhouse manufacturing vitamins for pregnant women. While Vonnugut is telling the story about the life Billy Pilgrim, he is actually telling the story of himself*, precisely when he witnessed the firebombing of Dresden, Germany. The aspect of the book that makes it so special is the style in which it was written. Vonnegut writes the book about Billy Pilgrim in a series of flashbacks throughout his life, like in a series of cycles. * In one paragraph, for example, the reader will find Billy Pilgrim sitting in his office pondering his twisted life. However, in the next paragraph, the reader may find Billy being held hostage by German soldiers or kidnapped by aliens. \\"Overhead he heard the cry of what might have been a melodious owl, but it wasn't a melodious owl. It was flying saucer, from Tralfamadore, navigating in both space and time, therefore seeming Billy Pilgrim to have come from nowhere all at once. Somewhere a big dog barked,\\" (p. 75) After each death in the book, the phrase \\"so it goes\\" appears, telling us that life just moves on. \\"One of them singled out Billy's face for a moment, then focused at infinite again. There was a tiny plume of smoke at infinity. There was a battle there. People were dying there. So it goes.\\" (p.65) Growing up in times of war and poverty (2), Vonnegut has a unique outlook on life and society. In spite of this, the novel deals with many social and ecological problems that were surfacing in the sixties. \\"And Hitler turned into a baby, and all humanity, without exception, conspired biologically to produce two perfect people named Adam and Eve, he supposed.\\" (p. 75) Slaughterhouse-Five beautifully blends humor, critique, and thought-inspiring themes in this recount of WWII events. Vonnegut's unique, fresh style can't be resisted and becomes very charismatic as the book progresses. Slaughterhouse-Five is timeless."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This is the second Vonnegut book I've read, the first being The Sirens of Titan. Sirens disappointed me overall mainly because it sorely lacked a compelling plot. S5 in my opinion is superior to Sirens in every way. Vonnegut delivers a strong message about the senselessness of war by narrating the story of Billy Pilgrim. Pilgrim is a generally clueless American who takes part in the final offensive actions against Germany in World War 2. In a POW camp in Dresden he survives the fire-bombing of the city which stupefies him further. He learns new perspectives on time from aliens who abduct him for no apparent reason. Vonnegut never makes clear whether the science fiction elements of the novel (aliens, time travel) are all in Billy's mind or if they really happened. The title page states that schizophrenia is involved, so Billy may simply be re-living his memories instead of actually traveling back in time. And perhaps he's imagining the aliens. If you saw the recent movie A Beautiful Mind about the brilliant but schizophrenic mathematician John Nash, you'll be able to relate a bit better to poor Billy.Anyhow, the strange structure of the novel works well for its purpose, which is to convince you that modern warfare has little to do with honor and glory. A great number of soldiers who fight and die for their country are basically kids of high school age or a bit older. That's bad enough. But when thousands of civilians are killed senselessly in order to encourage a country to surrender, the whole thing becomes meaningless. Vonnegut's satiric style fits this theme like hand and glove. Characterization isn't too great but the humorous and witty dialogue makes up for it. The novel moves quickly and is somewhat difficult to put down. Some sex and quite a bit of violence.Not quite as grand as Joseph Heller's brilliant Catch-22, but shorter and easier to digest. Recommended!"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut is a great anti-war masterpiece. Vonnegut takes readers on a journey of life both pre-war and post-war as experienced by Billy Pilgrim. The psychological characteristics that define Billy are a direct result of his war experience and eye witness account of the bombing of Dresden.Billy's 'ability' to travel through time allows him to view the dramatic events of Dresden several times, it also allows him to view his own birth, death, and everything in between. Some discredit Vonneguts writing as containing little to no focus; however, he wrote in such a jumbled fashion for a reason. Vonnegut is quoted as saying &quot; it is jumbled and jambled, moves all around, it doesn't make sense, nor does war.&quot;After reading Slaughterhouse Five I re-evaluated my personal opinion on war; Vonnegut paints a vivid picture of the traumatic effects of war on the individual in combat that war no longer seems justifiable by any means.I began reading this book at an ironic time, immediately before the events of September 11. As I continued to read and gain an understanding for the novel, the devastation that the United States is currently dealing with can in no way compare with the devastation as a result of the bombing of Dresden. In both events the side taking action effectively made a point; however, they did not do so without claiming the lives of several innocent civilians. The bombing of Dresden is a part of American history that cannot be erased and puts a damper on American pride."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Having heard about how great this book was several times, I must say I was let down by it in the end. After all the time travel and visits to Tramalfador, I was expecting a big finish in this book, but nothing ever developed. The plot never resolved.Although I found it to be a let down, I was still happy to have read this. Vonnegut provided many laughs throughout, and maybe if I was paying closer attention the whole way I would have gotten more out of this.The key message does seem to be to not fret about the petty things in life. Billy Pilgrim is a crusader when it comes to not letting things get under his skin, in fact, other people actually get upset with his insane ability to not give a hoot.With that being said, I'm sure this book does offer a lot of things to learn from, but overall, I was let down. Still, if you like time travel and space and World War II stories, check this book out."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Vonnegut's wit as a writer is hard to match. He casts out a story and reels it in a bit at a time. Great read!"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Love this book only Vonnegut could mix a bombing with time travel and aliens. Great read, so vivid, like you are there."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I love love love love love love this book so so so so so so so so so much it hurts"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Billy Pilgrim, the protagonist of novel, became a sort of cult figure in American popular culture, and it's not difficult to see why. Slaughterhouse-five is a war novel with a twist. It rather cleverly, and in a deliberately obvious, self-conscious manner, disguises itself as a science-fiction piece about time travel and aliens. Framed by a narrator who is a war veteran, he embarks on writing an account of his experiences in WW2 when he was a POW in Dresden, Germany.The novel that he writes turns out to be about Billy Pilgrim, a war vet like himself, but Dresden becomes just an episode within his narrative about his experiences as a time-traveller. The shift of focus suggests that the brutality of the war experience is too harsh and horrific to be addressed head-on and that it needs to be looked at sideways, mediated by a layered narrative.Seemingly farcical, born-loser Billy is something of a joke in the army, and his position is non-combat and perfunctory. Death recurs in the novel, and as a way of cushioning the blow, the narrator always appends any mention of it with \\"and so it goes\\".Vonnegut has a distinctive style of writing that is disjointed and episodic, which is filmic in quality, akin to the way a scene fades out to the next. Perhaps this style is also in keeping with the story of a man who becomes \\"unstuck in time\\" and begins to view life not as a continuum, and death not as an end, but rather as moments which, when chronology is taken away, causes the finality of circumstances to lose their significance, which also takes away the sting of hopeless events in one's life.Humorous despite the gravity of the issues dealt with in the novel, Vonnegut manages to adopt an authorial perspective that is neither prescriptive nor heavy-handed, allowing him to speak truthfully about the pain of human suffering without the melodrama."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I knew that you would read this review. It is inevitable. The moment is just structured that way. It is happening, always has happened, and always will happen. The Tralfamadorians taught me that.And since this is the case, it is probably also inevitable that you are tentatively considering buying this book (which's name and description appears above for your convenience). At least, I sincerely HOPE you are considering, as I can honestly say from experience that buying this novel is totally worth the mere dollars that Amazon has generously decided to offer it for. Of course, this book is not for everybody, and it definitely contains what many consider downfalls. Without any frame of reference, if you are expecting a specific kind of majesty from this, you may well miss out on another.Therefore let me give you a little idea of what to expect.Now, Vonnegut was not attempting to write this book as any sort of captivating sequential plot. In fact, every few pages the narration does a time jump to a completely different scene with all new characters unique to it. Therefore there is barely any conflict, tension, or any kind of real blood- pumping climax whatsoever. But don't let that deter you! This novel's brilliance lies within its other aspects, of tone, humor, and content. If you are able to open your mind to the possibilities and fun of its non- conventional approach, you will without a doubt find this novel incredibly rewarding.Kurt's blackly satirical voice is similar to that of Mark Twain in this book, though I find that Vonnegut's is juicier with its variety of bizarre, modern approaches. Unlike Twain he is not bound by the traditionalism of the nineteenth century. The comedy in this book will not only enthrall you, but will reach you on a more than personal level, as it delves into the very core of human life in a way undeniable in its poignancy. All the while, consistent running jokes and literary tactics will keep you laughing the whole way. Of course, there are definitely those moments of horror which, told in the same detached, casual tone as the jokes, will be even more impacting (it is a war book, after all). In fact, sometimes in this book, the line between comedic satire and dark commentary is blurred, making it all the more powerful.And then of course there is the Sci-fi element. While not always present, it is unavoidable, and therefore should be taken for what it is. If you are a fan of Sci-fi, especially psychological Sci-fi, then this is just one extra little treat for you. If you happen to find it completely uninviting, you may want to reconsider this book, though it shouldn't be too hard to look past it, especially in the way it is presented. In fact, this book never fails to find more and more interesting ways to present its themes. It is truly the epitome of experimental fiction.... Or should I call it \\"non- fiction\\"? It is, of course, a book based on Vonnegut's own experiences in WWII, and therefore does not lose content over flair. In fact, most of the time, the experimental touch actually succeeds beautifully in portraying Vonnegut's messages. In the end, we are left with a sense of fulfillment, awareness, and speculation, as we contemplate the meaning of death and hurt in our own lives, and find a new desire to appreciate the inevitable happy moments mixed up in there. But I'll let you experience that for yourself. Good luck!"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Good read, has a few weird ideas but overall very interesting and well structured. Nothing else to say but I needed to make this enough words."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughterhouse Five is a staple in American Literature. Widely considered Kurt Vonnegut's greatest work, it tells the story of Billy Pilgrim, a WWII soldier who was abducted by Tralfamadorian aliens and subsequently jumps through time. The reader goes along for the ride, jumping through different parts of Pilgrim's life on a nearly page by page basis.The novel has two prevailing themes. At its core this is an antiwar book. Vonnegut says as much in the first chapter, but his second theme is both more original and more exciting. Vonnegut presents an interesting take on the concept of time. In his story events do not unfold in a linear fashion. According to the aliens of Tralfamador, all moments coexist at once, and our fates are all predetermined.I realize that the science fiction genre does not appeal to everyone, but try not to get scared off by the aliens and time travel. This is not your typical science fiction novel. Vonnegut accomplishes a remarkable feat. He seamlessly blends historical events with fictitious and real characters all under the umbrella of a science fiction storyline. But the novel manages to avoid the sci-fi label, and it is taken seriously as a famed literary work that will appeal to almost anyone.The writing is first-class, and Vonnegut is at once comical and dark. The somewhat simple language only serves to enhance his voice. The story is told from both a first and third person prospective with Vonnegut serving primarily as a narrator but often showing up as a character, leaving readers to wonder just how much of this story is actually true. Best of all this is an easy read and very quick. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a unique and rewarding reading experience."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I re-read this friend after twenty-five years or so, and it's as wonderful and terrible today as it was then. Vonnegut's style is original without trying to be different; it's a natural voice that is as easy to read as it must have been fiendishly difficult to write. Of all the book's wonderful qualities, perhaps its finest asset is its brevity. You will rush from beginning to end in a flash, and at the conclusion will be surprised that so much could have been packed into so few pages.Although the book's comparison between Dresden and Hiroshima/Nagasaki is oblique, it nonetheless hits with great force. Vonnegut's derision towards the official Air Force history, and his portrayal of the military's discomfort with this act of terror against an unarmed city contrast with the self-righteous justifications of those who trumpet the use of atomic weapons on Japan in 1945.This book was, and remains, one of the seminal English language antiwar novels."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughterhouse-Five is a great stepping stone into the work of profoundly wise writer-philosopher. Although some may not identify with the bleakness and postmodernity of the work, if you enter this novel with an open mind, you will leave it with Vonnegut in your heart. It's tempting to say that this book is about absurdity, existentialism, quietism. War, meaning, peace. But I think the most poignant take-home from this brilliant satire is simple and resounding.Don't cry about death and chaos defining our fragile lives. Laugh about it. It'll get you through.Those three little words will get you through."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slush entombs his feet / Billy Pilgrim driven mad / It had to be doneI recently replaced a lost copy of Slaughterhouse Five, gave it a quick read, and wondered what all the fuss was about. It didn't have the same punch that it had when I first read it nearly 40 years ago. Then I gave it a close read, and another and found things that weren't there, for me, even that first time long ago.The central structural feature of S5 is the time travel of Billy Pilgrim and, given its importance, it's puzzling how readers remember the details so differently. Billy first encounters the 'time window' when escaping from the Germans during the Battle of the Bulge, in Luxembourg. He was 'bleakly ready for death' and stopped to lean against a tree to await his fate. He could not escape by going forward, going backward, or remaining still. He was in a double bind as R.D. Laing has described and his only escape was through time, his madness the 'perfectly rational adjustment to an insane world.' Vonnegut describes Billy in this moment as 'like a poet in the Parthenon.'The poet reference puts me in mind of John Keats, also called a poet in the Parthenon, writing his 'Ode on a Grecian Urn' after viewing the Elgin Marbles taken from the Parthenon. The vignettes of Billy's time travels are much like the verses of the Ode, much like the sculptures from the Parthenon. Vonnegut's Tralfamadorians 'can look at all the different moments [of time] just as we can look at a stretch of the Rocky Mountains . . . can look at any moment that interests them.' Just as Keats could look at all the moments captured in the marble frieze.One moment, or verse, that is particularly apt is this: 'Who are these coming to the sacrifice? / . . . What little town by river or seashore / . . . Is emptied of this folk, this pious morn? / And, little town, thy streets for evermore / Will silent be; and not a soul to tell / Why thou art desolate, can e'er return.' An eyewitness, thinking back to Dresden on the Elbe, might very well dwell on this verse, on this urn.'It had to be done.' Not because the Tralfamadorians say so, but because that's who we are. Billy Pilgrim survives the war, sires a son who goes off to his own war. Robert Kennedy, Martin Luther King, Vietnam. If not war, 'there would still be plain old death,' the human condition, from which there is no escape. As Camus would have it, 'But the point is to live' and 'Live to the point of tears.'"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughterhouse Five was the first Vonnegut book I read. I really enjoyed it. Love Vonnegut's way of writing and his characters."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"One of the best things I learned in college was the name Kurt Vonnegut. His voice is uniquely his own and always worthy of the investment in the time to listen to. Slaughterhouse Five definitely is a work that all should invest the time to read. Personally, I think it should be read a couple of times over one's life to understand the collective and individual ravages of war.A favorite scene of mine in the movie Back to School is when Rodney Dangerfield tells Vonnegut in a cameo appearance that he doesn't know a thing about Vonnegut. This is why I love Slaughterhouse Five. There are so many concepts presented here that everyone will interpret the elements of the book differently.- Does Billy Pilgrim time travel or is he trapped in his mind from the horrors he has experienced?- Is his time travel a copping mechanism from the dismay of being a POW?- Is war just to be accepted as a natural event that should be ignored as the Tralfamadorians do or should we not accepted it and fight against it because as humans with free will we have the inherent capabilities to stop it?- Do we have free will?- Are we a more dangerous a people with atomic weapons when we proved capable of killing 135,000 people in Dresden and 84,000 in Tokyo with fire-bombing while killing only 71,000 in Hiroshima with an atomic bomb?- Who is worse, the soldiers who killed innocent people and turned their body fat into candles or those who boiled the soldiers innocent children in the fire-bombing of a safe-city? Is revenge sweet as Lazzaro implies? If so, why did he not revel in the bombing of Dresden?- Why do we allow children to fight our wars?The list of questions to contemplate from this book can go on and on.Again, to me Slaughterhouse Five definitely is worth reading a few times over one's life. Billy Pilgrim, unremarkable Billy Pilgrim, is a character worthy of note in the annals of literature. The seamless presentation of a timeless, though disjointed, story of Billy's life is exceptional. Everyone will have their own interpretation of the themes. To paraphrase from the book, here is light opera being played by crippled human beings, more fools like ourselves.[One quick negative point, I read the smaller sized Dell paperback, which had terrible typesetting.]"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"What's wonderful about this book is how Vonnegut launches a head-on assault on the mythology of the 20th century's one Good War. History has decreed World War II a Noble Fight Against the Enemies of Civilization, but Vonnegut says it was a freezing firestorm that made a mockery of our very existence. My late grandfather was also a WWII vet. He never read any Vonnegut that I'm aware of, but he spoke of the war in the same way. I think it had something to with actually being there. Both Vonnegut and my grandfather were grunts sent out to do a dirty goddamn job. Neither of them crowed about a minute of it ever after. That doesn't surprise me. What surprises me is that they both carried on with dignity the rest of their lives, when they'd both seen the beating black heart of the worst horrors man can render upon man. I've always doubted my ability to do the same, and remain thankful to this day that I've never had to find out.Vonnegut's anti-war screed has, if anything, only gained in prescience over time. (See Iraq, War in.) Makes you wish the Decider-in-Chief read books. At least this one.The strange advice (albeit dished out by aliens who see Time akin to a Rocky Mountain panorama) to ignore what's bad in order to focus on what's good smacks of the reasoning of a man who has reached the end of all reasoning. Who can no longer compose a rationale for man's behavior. The sort of conclusion you might come to, say, if you had survived the firebombing of Dresden.As literature, per se, Vonnegut's light-hearted dalliance with both the English language and the strictures of plot structure cause you to wonder why you spend any time reading books less fun than this. Then you realize that such an ephemeral style washes over you so quickly very little is left when the book is done, other than the sour taste of a moral lesson unwittingly learned. I suspect that was Vonnegut's very point. As a general rule, I loathe literature that attempts to teach me a lesson. But I'll make an exception for Slaughterhouse-Five.Oddly, among all the carnage and contempt, the scene that stood out most in my mind comes near the novel's beginning. The narrator is at an old war buddy's house to discuss plans for his war novel. Old war buddy's wife stomps angrily around the house. Turns out she thinks the narrator is going to write a book about John Wayne fighting the war, when in fact World War II, like all wars, was fought by children. The narrator assures her John Wayne will not be making an appearance in his book. Vonnegut dedicated the book to her.I originally read this in high school. Promptly forgot it. (Ah, youth.) I'm very glad to publicly rectify that oversight right here."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"In my opinion, the greatest novel ever written. Slaughterhouse-Five examines war, free will, and time. Vonnegut had the ability to send chills down your spine. R.I.P. (So it goes.)"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughterhouse Five is the sad tale of Allied firebombing of Dresden, Germany during the Second World War. The Dresden bombing caused nearly the same number of deaths as the atomic bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima.This novel is based on Kurt Vonnegut's own war experience and took him over two decades to finish it. Vonnegut is actually present as one of the characters; he was the constant cynical narrator who makes all deaths equivalent with his comment:\\" so it goes\\".Interestingly, the novel was published during the Vietnam War, a war where technology was again used against nonmilitary targets in an unjust war.Through the protagonist Billy Pilgrim, we are taken on a sad journey through the scarring traumatic horrors that war inflicts on both sides for generations to follow.Sarcastically, Vonnegut used the Tralfamadorians, who are aliens shaped as toilet plungers, to demonstrate the linear progression of time as opposed to all moments existing simultaneously. Through the Tralfamadorians, free will is also presented as the ultimate illusion; Beginning with Billy's childhood, free will is a repeated theme throughout the novel.Slaughterhouse-five, a remarkable novel that condemns war along with any bureaucratic attitudes that attempt to glorify war and its heroes, while ignoring its destructiveness and horrors."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Set during World War II, Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five is a humorous antiwar book. Billy Pilgrim is a war veteran who becomes \\"unstuck in time.\\" He seems to be obsessed with the aliens, called the Tralfamadorians, that supposedly abducted him and could see in the fourth dimension. Right off the bat, Slaughterhouse-Five has caught our attention. As we read through the novel, the way we experience it is the same as Billy sees time, disconnected and random. The book keeps jumping from time period to time period, thoroughly confusing the reader. In some places, Vonnegut makes himself a character in his own novel. It is confusing to the point that the reader has no idea if Billy or Vonnegut is talking.The novel makes us slightly disillusioned in the fact that we don't know the difference between real and fake. We are convinced (as is his family) that Billy is crazy and what he tells us about the Tralfamadorians is obviously untrue. But how are we to know if everything else he tells us of the war is true? The satire and irony in this book add comic relief to what would usually be a depressing scene, to our enjoyment.The genius of Slaughterhouse-Five is that Vonnegut seems so apathetic about war in places that we wonder why this is even considered an antiwar book. But the reality is that his use of understatement and reverse psychology arouses feelings in us. When he says war cannot be stopped, we think (more passionately than if he was agreeing with us) that yes, it can. When he says there is no such thing as free will, we say yes, there is. All in all, Slaughterhouse-Five is an enjoyable way to use one's time."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This book probably wont be a mandatory lesson in most peoples english classes because technicaly it's a sience fiction novel, and most english teachers hate them. So I would strongly advise reading this book for personal pleasure or for a book report. If your in the mood for a head-scraching book that has an interesting idea or two than this is the book for you, but if your to lazy to give thought to what the writer says and not question what he or she writes then you might as well just look for another book. The reason this book is so hard to understand is because it has not real setting or time at which events in the book take place. The only certain thing in the whole book is the main character Billy Pilgrim. If your still confused about this book, which you should be, just remember that the rest of the readers of this book that reviewed it online, like me, were once where you are right now. Completley baffeled. The ones who &quot;got it&quot;,(the theme), gave it good ratings. The ones who didn't critisized it and didn't enjoy it.

Closing the book at end, I did not feel as if I had read anything profound, or worthy of much contemplation. I think it is intentended by writer Vonnegut to be a wise/witty anti-war piece, and at the same time comedic. (I concede that war can be unnecessary, evil, and stupidly waged). I found Slaughterhouse to be a kind of melding of a weak Catch-22, a Mad magazine, and an inferior attempt by Hunter Thompson.The herds' herd mentality has talked themselves into herdedly fawning over this piece as one of The Great Books. It's not. It's mildly funny at times, and at times reveals insights/observations into the human animal that we approvingly recognize. On the other hand, I found the writer to be annoyingly irreverent, gratuitously poking fun at people and institutions in which he has had no experience or stake. It's easy to do. Teenagers are wont to do it.There is some deep thinking morsels here, unfortunately they are covered over with excessive easy sarcasm, and told in Vonnegut's esoteric distracting construction. The morsels make this a 4 star rating rather than the 3 I was tempted to give it.Good, but not great. Generally overrated by the masses."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"\\"The Things They Carried\\" is a plethora of experiences that leaves the reader to truly grasp the nefariousness of war. Tim O'Brien's book is a plane to travel readers to places and feelings that they would normally not be capable of arriving at. Vietnam is not a place that many high school students get the opportunity to visit, nor is war an experience that many go through at this age. O'Brien corrects this privation by transporting readers into the lives of fictional soldiers like Rat Kiley or Curt Lemon, neither of which survive the horrors in Nam. Their fear becomes tangible, their fear becomes the readers fear, their fear becomes imbued with importance as O'Brien attempts to guide readers through his disapprobation of war. O'Brien writes with a profundity that can only come with personal experience, he wrote \\"The Things They Carried\\" as a memoir of his bellicose days and to promote his anti-war sentiment. The irony in the story lies, however, in that none of the characters are real, although certain parts of the story may be true, O'Brien expounds the soldiers so that he can almost control the reader's emotions. The soldiers experiences and feelings are such that the reader can feel the gush of wind as a bullet narrowly misses or become lugubrious at the loss of a close friend. The readers' journey leaves them in lassitude at the effort put forth in fighting the war alongside the soldiers.Vietnam breathes, although some may doubt that this is possible, for the soldiers Vietnam is a living entity. What I find truly meaningful is the things the soldiers carried, not only did they have to carry their unit and their equipment they had to carry fear, love, and hope. Fear that is constantly ruminated upon only becomes heavier and O'Brien does an excellent job of expressing this to the readers. He also shows the unfairness in war, the men do not want to be in Vietnam, they do not want to fight, they do not want to be so far away from home. And when the soldiers do fight as is expected of them, they come home, but life can never be the same after such an unmitigated experience as war. Men can be left vacuous after a war they did not fight of their own volition, and because the US did not win the war in Vietnam, the soldiers did not get the respect they deserved when they returned home because the general public blamed them for fighting the war, even though they did not want to fight it in the first place. But, as the saying goes, it's a rich man's war and a poor man's fight.This book provides the impetus to make people realize the error of war, a necessary cathartic act that could possibly make this world a better place. I therefore can say with perfect perspicuity and aplomb that this book deserves five stars because it is a truly heart-wrenching and enlightening story."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Okay--so the juxtaposition of war, time travel, and alien abduction was certainly inventive, and Vonnegut's deadpan frankness in dealing with the book's subject matter would have been fairly revolutionary for the time. The book is also brilliantly structured--jumping from fragment to fragment of Billy Pilgrim's life with masterful control and timing--all without a boring or confusing moment. I can see why the book is considered a classic, and it's probably deserving of that label. I still didn't like it.A label of which the book isn't deserving is \\"anti-war.\\" I was surprised to see several reviews rhapsodize about Vonnegut's \\"screaming rage\\" against the absurdity and tragedy of war, so much so that I began to wonder if I had indeed read \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\" and not some other acclaimed novel involving the Dresden firebombing and Tralfamadorians. If anything, the book is about accepting war and tragedy as part of life and trying to deal with it. The book is depressingly (and, after a while, rather annoyingly) blas&eacute; about death, no matter how horrible or unjust. Death by assassination? So it goes. Death by gangrene? So it goes. Death by torture? So it goes. Thousands killed in the firebombing of Dresden? So it goes. I realize that Vonnegut experienced the firebombing firsthand and that the subject is probably one of great personal importance to him--which only makes me wonder why the event isn't given any more emotional weight. The novel almost feels like an attempt by Vonnegut to ameliorate the tragedy, rather than to make any meaningful statement about it. Or maybe the amelioration is his statement. At any rate, I also missed the apparently abundant black humor. There is an almost overwhelming amount of tragedy within the novel's slim frame, with the only ray of \\"hope\\" being that, in the big picture, the life of the individual doesn't really matter anyway. If you find that notion funny, you'll probably pick up on the humor. And like the book.As a side note, I found \\"The Wind-up Bird Chronicle\\" by Haruki Murakami, while wildly different in many aspects, to be oddly similar to \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\" in both subject matter and in its juxtaposition of war brutality and fantasy. While Kurt Vonnegut undoubtedly displays a finer control of lanuage, I found Haruki Murakami's approach funnier, more affecting, more emotionally satisfying--and, if possible, even weirder."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Well, I'm hooked on a new author. Vonnegut's writing style is addictive and quick witted. A dry, ironic humor is laced into almost every page of this book. The cold realism of war is always hidden just behind the smoked glass of this humor, but never feels like he's pounding you with it.Very simply, it's a non-linear story about a man who's mind cracks, and who bares witness to an event which is an all but non-existant footnote of WWII to my generation (80's baby). So it goes."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"The author's recent death caused me to explore this remarkably well written novela, an outcry against the atrocities of human life and particularly war. The matter-of-fact, low key narration of the life of a common man, Billy Pilgrim, swept up in peresonal and societal upheavals utterly beyond his control is painted as utterly ordinary but wholly unbelievable by Billy's claim of alien abduction in flying saucers, and the simple literary device of punctuating the frequent deaths of people associated with Billy with the phrae, \\"So it goes.\\"With the advent of the current mindless brutality of crusaders and jihadists in that hot bed of stupidity, the Middle East, we can once again sigh, \\"So it goes.\\" Sadly, the immolation of the open city of Dresden without cause may well be repeated in Tehran as well as Fallujah."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"First Vonnegut book I've ever read, and it was amazing. Just the sort of think I love. Deep morbid humor."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"The Children's Crusades was, by far the most, boring and slow progressing book I have ever endured. When I first decided to read this novel I believed it would be interesting and exciting and after having done so I realize that it is as far from that as possible.While in he process of reading Slaughterhouse 5, I could hardly keep my focus. I, very begrudgingly, finished the novel, due to the fact that I later had to hand in a paper showing that I had actually finished the novel.Although I did not like the book, its plot or the way it flowed, I did however enjoy some aspects of the author's writing style. His ability to show the characters emotions in each situation and such was, for lack of better wording, amazing. The main character was struggling through his ability to be \\"unstuck\\" in time, and the way the author emulates to the audience how he is breaking down from the emotional roller-coaster ride that he has been forced to endure.All in all, I would recommend this book to someone who enjoys something of the more \\"far-out\\", science-fiction nature. It is not however for those who enjoy fast- paced or clearly written books.Even thought it is true that I did not enjoy this long and slow novel, I will however try to read other books by the same author due to the fact that his writing style is somewhat intriguing.My review may not agree with that of other readers of Slaughterhouse 5, this is my personal opnion. I would suggest to read, by one's self to form a different personal opinion than that of mine."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Although Slaughterhouse-Five was somewhat graphic, it was well written. Throughout the story, three different time periods were going on all at one time, but the story still flowed well. You were able to get inside the mind of the author, which was not a place I would like to be very long. The book was different than any I've ever read, but we all need variety on our bookshelves, don't we?"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Kurt Vonnegut skillfully employs a cunning rhetorical strategy along with the clever utilization of repitition to create poignant anit-war statements and a dark humor which overshadow his novel, Slaughterhouse Five. While reading the sporatic plot structure, one ponders at the point of the unique rhetorical strategy. Along with the simple diction and the intorduction of aliens from a distant planet, the reader begins to discredit the protagonist, Billy Pilrgim. Throughout the course of the novel, the reader must piece together small segments of the novel seperated by time in order to achieve the intended message. This carefully plotted strategy brings about the thought that the novel seems slightly insipid and silly. However, one later realizes that this was Vonnegut's intent. By adding the sporatic rhetorical strategy, the reader realizes the pointlessness and stupidity of war, much as he realizes the complexity of the rhetorical strategy. The incessant repitition of phrases such as &quot;so it goes&quot; along with countless other brief statements also contributes to the novel's message as a whole. As people inevitable die in the war, the phrase &quot;so it goes&quot; is continually associated with their death. The nonchalant attitude towards the death of another being is incorporated on the planet Tralfamadore, Billy's fantasy world. While reading, a dark humor is aroused though the inept actions of Billy and through the almost humerous rhetorical strategy. In conclusion, the novel utilizes rhetorical strategy and repitition rather than a decisive plot, to bring about its powerful conclusion that war is pointless."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I didn't like this book at all. First of all, I beleive Vonnegut is a sicko. He writes about things that are so outrageous. The flashbacks did bother me some, and Billy Pilgrim, in my opinion is a loony. I had to read this in my English class and I would not recommend this book to anyone. I despise books about war and the loss of the mind, while people travel in time to the planet of Tralmafadore...very strange novel...I would have given it a one, but I have to admit that it wasn't too boring and was not slow at all."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I started &quot;Slaughterhouse Five&quot; three times before I finally got going. Then, I finished. Then, I read it again. Three reads later, I can only conclude: this book is brilliant. It is easily one of the Top 10 books of fiction written this century. It is my favorite Vonnegut book (although &quot;Player Piano&quot; is perhaps more ambitious) and one of my top two or three I've ever read. So it goes. It took so many tries because it is difficult to get a grasp on his story. At first, I got bogged down in the fact he was writing a war story of sorts, which can prove tedious. But once I got the &quot;unstuck in time&quot; concept, it became rewarding. And what a reward! Reading this book can give you a fresh philosophy of life (and time, of course) at the very least. The theory that the Tralfamorians (the aliens in the story) have about time gives a new perspective on how we view events, cause and effect, living and all sorts of other stuff. So it goes. &quot;Five&quot; wasn't the first Vonnegut work I read; new Vonnegut readers may not want to start with it. Or maybe they do. I could write on and on about the story, but let's just cut to the chase: read it, and draw your own conclusions. So it goes."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughterhouse Five is one of the, if not the, best book I have read in my short 16 years of life. Vonnegut tells the story of a man, unstruck in time, who travels spasmodically back and forth through time, reliving past experiences. It is enjoyable by fans of all genre: the bombing of dresden for you historical buffs, an alien abduction for you sci fi nuts, and hilarious dialogue and actions for the comedy fans.As well as telling an incredably good story, it also informs the reader of an event in history that few know about, despite it's impact on the war, and the amount of casulties it caused. So not only are you reading a fine example of writing, you're also learning history too, now you just can't beat that with a stick. All in all, Slaughterhouse Five is a modern masterpiece, and rightfully deserves it's spot on the &quot;Modern Library's 100 Best Books of the Century&quot; (#18) as well as more. I whole heartedly recommend next time you are shopping for books at your local bookstore, you check this one out, it won't disappoint."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Once again Kurt Vonnegut wrote easy but deep book.

I read it because someone had told me the lead character was an optometrist, which is what i do. The book on its own which tries to portray the horror that was the bombing of Dresden actually witnessed by the author seems strangely included in this science fiction time story including an alien planet called Tralfalmadore. It just seems weird to me that the important truth of the horrific firebombing of people and the incredible loss of life should be juxtaposed to twilight zone science fiction of man in a zoo on the Tralfalmadore planet. Odd mix but for some reason i do revisit the images from the book. Quite honestly, if it weren't considered a classic I'd probably be more apt to give it 3 stars."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This is a beautifully printed and bound edition of Kurt Vonnegut's masterpiece, with a nice second introduction written on the 25th anniversary of the original publication.I often give young teenagers this book as a coming-of-age or b'nai mitzvah present, and this edition presents it as a worthy keepsake.Regarding the text of the book; I'm sure better reviews have been written than I could ever write. I'll just point out that Vonnegut was likely the most articulate of the 200 or so people who witnessed the firebombing of Dresden as closely as he did. I think he became a writer partly out of a sense of obligation to bear witness to the event. It took him what, 25 years, to get the book out of his mind and onto paper?It must have been quite a relief."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This book is wonderful.

It always gave me that effect, but now, moreso.This breakthrough novel of the late 1960s holds up incredibly well. One reason--out of many--is that Vonnegut's honesty and his very real sense of the loss of a once-great city (Dresden) rings through every page. I will resist discussing the plot, tempted as I may be. But what must be discussed is Vonnegut's tempering of dark satire with his very forgiving, human tone. Just when things get bleak, Vonnegut injects just the right amount of humor which has the added effect of heightening the tragedy, too.I can type until my fingers fall off about how marvelous and joyous this book is.

I don't know exactly what drew me to this book but I think the title was a big part of it.. it just sounds like a really cool book.. This is the first book that I have read by Kurt Vonnegut and since he just passed away recently I thought there was no better time then to read something by him.. and I had Slaughterhouse Five on my shelf..Slaughterhouse Five well what can I say.. Honestly I didn't really understand alot of this book.. not alot of it clicked.. it seemed like it was scattered all over the place to where it was very hard to follow exactly what was going on.. The whole idea that I picked up in this book is a mind that is unstable in the state of war.. it's hard to think clearly and be straight in a time when war breaks loose.. and maybe that was the intent on why it was written in this type of way.. so you can see what happens to the human mind when war occurs..\\"The most important thing I learned on Tralfamadore was when a person dies he only appears to die. He is still very much alive in the past, so it is very silly for people to cry at his funeral. All moments, past, present, and future, always have existed, always will exist. The Tralfamodorians can look at all the different moments just the way we can look at a stretch of the Rocky Mountains, for instance. They can see how permanent all the moments are, and they can look at any moment that interests them. It is just an illusion we have here on Earth that one moment follows another one, like beads on a string, and that once a moment is gone it is gone forever.\\"\\"When a Tralfamadorian sees a corpse, all he thinks is that the dead person is in bad conidition in that particular moment, but that the same person is just fine in plenty of other moments, Now, when I myself hear that somebody is dead, I simply shrug and say what the Tralfamadorians says about dead people, which is 'So it goes.'\\"I'm pretty sure this is the type of book that needs to be reread in order to really sink it in.. and since I have just read it once.. maybe that's a reason why it just didn't do much for me..

For me, it doesn't get any better than this. It's dramatic but not histrionic. Some people do get confused when reading it (students) but for the trained eye it can be a real pleasure. I've taught this book to both eleventh and twelth graders and each class, more or less, has loved it. Also it picks on Trout just a smidge (a minor-major character throughout his work), which only heightens the novel for me. Then there is Dresden. Enough said."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Sandwiched between two of the \\"boomer\\" generation's biggest hit movies, \\"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\\" and \\"The Sting,\\" the director of those, George Roy Hill, found time to make the film version of \\"Slaughterhouse Five.\\" It became one of my favorite films over time. Yet I had never read anything by Vonnegut. With the advent of his death, I figured it was finally time. I enjoyed the book but am happy I saw the movie first.The story revolves around a man who does not live his life in a normal aging sequence but instead, thanks in part to some strange extraterrestrials, lives by being \\"unstuck in time;\\" he jumps randomly from time period to time period. So, like the movie \\"Pulp Fiction,\\" we get a current event and go into the past to undertstand how he got there or we see the past and eventually it ties into the present.I believe the film captures the spirit of the book very well yet there are enough differences between the two for me to be very satisfied with both. The parts that differ from the movie really added to my enjoyment. The novel also alerts you to the fact that some of the action may have been taken directly from Vonnegut's life and the message Vonnegut was trying to get across is maybe a bit clearer than the movie can make it.Funny, I am not sure I would have enjoyed the book without seeing the movie. Why? Well, I am not a big fantasy/sci-fi reader so it is quite possible the subject would have been difficult for me to embrace. I am not sure I would have \\"gotten it\\" without the film to provide the framework. I could also visualize the characters and their predicaments with the film to fall back on.So my overall point is that this is a book you should enjoy immensely if you have seen the movie. Of course, I can't tell you otherwise."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughterhouse Five is not what I expected it to be... then again, in the first chapter, the author tells the readers exactly what to expect. Or at least an idea but even after being told the first and last sentence or two and the climax I wasn't prepared for what I got.Slaughterhouse Five is one of the most unique books I've ever read. Nothing happens. Let me correct that: people die, Billy Pilgrim (the main character) is abducted by aliens, he is part of the most horrendous bombing that took place in the second world war, and he becomes a common image on the TV. But none of it matters because none of it ever takes any precedence. A climax is impossible, a beginning and end are impossible for that matter. This book does not start or finish it is endless and rambling.Kurt Vonnegut is writing of Billy Pilgrim, a man that has become \\"unstuck in time\\". This means that he travels to the future and the past, although that statement isn't entirely correct. All moments coexist universally, thus there is no possibility for a future and a past. The problem is describing the book means to enter into the book's world, which is impossible if you don't know what that world is: paradox.The book supplied me with a lot of thought. My mind was always screwing itself up in reading it. The book makes you trip over the guidelines you lay out to understand it. I realize that much more powerfully in describing it now. The peculiarity and tendency to perplex however does not make it a bad book, it's very good on the other hand.Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five brought up interesting issues although what it brought up is not what it's famous for in my opinion. They say it's an anti-war novel but I would say it's more like an anti-human mind novel. Oddly enough it says to us that humanity has no control whatsoever over what happens but it also says that there is nothing else that is in control but just what exists. What exists is there and is unalterable. Everything is laid out carefully, a perfect law that appears to be extreme chaos.I don't necessarily agree with all that Kurt Vonnegut brings up in this famous novel but I do admit that I enjoyed the book for bringing these things up. I felt a new perspective stated clearly and without baggage. I could read this book without applying a philosophical label to it. All in all Slaughterhouse Five is a good discussion novel. It's great for its themes and the conversation that I'm sure will come out of it. The book though well written has very little to it without its ideas though. I would suggest it but only if you leave time for discussion and debate afterwards."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This book is mostly inspire by Vonnegut himself and his experiences in Dresden in the 1940s. The bombing, the friends he lost, the confusion and mental turmoil he experienced after the war.. the whole book was very crystal clear. It's very personal and moving for a story written in the third person. It was unusual for Vonnegut to do that because most of his books I have read were written in the first person. Billy Pilgrim's transition from reality to imagination are very adequate and plausible, and gave a very real, yet isolated take of life during such a terrible war. It also documents the dehumanization of the atrocities of war, since death doesn't seem to have an effect on Pilgrim, but you can tell that he does have feelings, but the war kind of took away all the feelings that really mattered to him. I've always been a pacifist and had a strong anti-military stance, but this only enhances my perspective. Most war novels and movies usually glorify the fighting the the atrocities done to both soldiers and civilians, only adding to the concept of dehumanization, but the sensitivity of its characters, especially Pilgrim, the protagonist (though not lucid, but still evident) makes it a very different military novel from a very different writer."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This book should only be read in softcover, and if possible one that has been dogeared and has a slightly torn cover. Slaughterhouse Five at one time had me feeling that I knew the answer to all of mankinds problems and at other times asking myself \\"what the hell did that paragraph mean?\\" Is Vonnegut Billy? Am I Billy? Are you? Who knows? Who cares? Maybe we all are a little piece of Billy in our own little ways. But, this is not a literary critic to analyze characters and plots and subplots and symbolism. They are all there but you only have to find them if you feel it is important to you. I felt that Vonnegut's style of short paragraphs and catchy tag lines kept me reading the next page and then the next and all of a sudden I was closing in page 205, 206, 207... And I started reading more slowly because, like all books I enjoy, I didn't want it to end. I enjoyed the ride. I didn't catch all the sites along the way, but I can take that trip again and again. And, I plan on it. I recommend you invest the time to read this book. If you hate it, you hate it and you can sell it at a garage sale. But, if after you finished it you said \\"did I miss something or is the auther insane?\\" then reread it at another time in another mood in another setting. This was my first book by Vonnegut that I have read. I will read more of his work, but he has to be taken in stages. Go for it. Read it."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Those who have read any of Vonneguts other books will recognize teh light humor and unique way in which he writes them, although in this book parts are funny but its like your almost afraid to laugh. Slaughter house five is about an ordinary man although some expraordinary things happen to him, and his experiences. How he daels with his experience with the fire bombing at Dresdon, his wife, daughter and some other some what normal happenings. Although it is not only about his encounters on earth but also when he travled to another planet. The real reason why this book is unique is because of something that Vonnegut explains early on in the book which is that the main character is &quot;unstuck in time&quot;. That is all it says and after you read more it becomes more clear exactly what that sentence means."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Kurt Vonnegut, writer of famous and unique books like \\"Gal&aacute;pagos\\", \\"Cat's cradle\\" and \\"Bluebeard\\" has to be seen as one of the most important modern writers. Working with his own impressions of the firebombing of Dresden which he witnessed as a POW, he wrote an impressive anti-war-book.Like Joseph Heller, who deals with roughly the same topic (war) in his book \\"Catch 22\\", another very impressive anti-war-book, Vonnegut's \\"Slaughterhouse five\\" is for me a little, but very strong cry for humanity and peace, more than ever important in a time where war-mongers seem to dominate!Vonnegut's protagonist Billy Pilgrim, unable and unwilling to struggle with the woes of war, witnesses the total destruction of Dresden by a firestorm, created by an allied air raid, experiences time-travel and contact with exterrestrian life forms.In plain and simple words and phrases the writer tells the story of an innocent hero, a hero who never fired a shot, who never tried to do all the hero-business like killing and destroying, who barely tried to survive."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"The description of Slaughtehouse Five as either an anti-war or science-fiction novel isn't necessarily a negative, or even incorrect label, but, let's say instead, a restrictive one. It would be similar to calling \\"Beowolf\\" a poem or \\"Dr. Strangelove\\" a black comedy. It is a truthful assesment, it just doesn't do the work justice.Slaughterhouse is a brilliant satire/black comedy of not just war and science-fiction, but humanity, love, death, friendship, and any other ideals that we as a race hold dear. It is this that causes the biggest problem with Vonnegut's appreciation by mass audiences, \\"How can he make fun of that?\\" Simple, he just brings in a space-craft.My favorite character of not only Slaughterhouse, but all of Vonnegut's collective work is by far and away Kilgore Trout. The essential paperback writer, and perhaps an insight to what might have been with Vonnegut (consider what would have happened to him had his work been released at a less tolerable time-period during the history of American Literature and you will see what I mean) Trout is a pat on the back for any independent artist, regardless of the genre, that the effect your work has on a small group is not lessened by the size of your audience, but, instead, confirmed by the reaction of the few. He is also hilarious and brilliant.Other then Trout, however, the story revolves around the life of Billy Pilgram. Not the life as you or I, or a lesser writer even would see it, but as according to the view of Tralfamadorians, an alien race who has a greater understanding of the view-point of time then humans ever will. So it is through their eyes that we witness the fascinating life of Pilgrim. From his days in captivity by the German army during World War II leading up to the fire-bombing of Dresden, to his abduction by aliens and use as a museum piece as he \\"mates\\" with porn-star Montana Wildhack, through marriage, plane crashes, insanity, and death we not only watch his fascinating life, but find ourselves laughing at our own ridiculous society. If you enjoy satire, black comedy, and poking fun of all that you hold dear, then Slaughterhouse is defenitely for you. If not... then read it anyway."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This is another incredible book delivered by Kurt Vonnegut. It, as the rest of his books, takes a satiracle look at the world and mocks society. Vonnegut manages to combine those elements with strange sci-fi. ideas that somehow mix to create an excellent book. In this novel, Vonnegut manages to combine time travel, alien abductions, and world war II; it sounds like an odd combination,huh. However, Vonnegut does an excellent job, as always, to bring relevance to each angle. Billy Pilgrim, the main character,has become unstuck in time. He does not move in chronological order through life. Instead, he jumps from structured moment to structured moment. He cannot control where he will go next, whether he is going to arrive in spaceship on its way to Tralfamadore, in a meat locker in Dresden, hiding from the firebombings, or sitting at a party with his wife. Billy leaps from moment to moment slowly telling the story of his life and the horror of world war II. This book is tremendous; though it is slightly toned down compared to most Vonnegut novels with respect to hidden sarcasm, it still has a wonderful theme that will make you want to read it again and again."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"It is in my belief that Slaughterhouse was a book that gets the mind active, and I enjoyed this book very much. At first the story seemed a little awkward, Vonnegut actually devoted the first chapter to telling how he thought his book to be a failure and how he could not bring himself to write a book about his experience in Dresden. He goes to a friend who cannot remember the bombing. The next chapter seemed to be a little more exciting. What isn't mentioned until about halfway through the chapter is the war, and then instantly jumps in and out of Billy Pilgrim's military experience. I see this as maybe a message that Vonnegut is trying to say. War isn't talked about much, because war is senseless and there isn't much to say about it. Billy seems to be unfetered by death when he is in the war. This is shown when his group is being shot at, and Billy is narrowly missed by a bullet and stands still as to give the shooter another chance at killing him. Billy does not see death as a thing to fear, so this means he must not think of war as anything. From Billy's point of view, all that war brings is death. After the bombing of Dresden, Billy doesn't seem to notice that he is cleaning away dead bodies, but focuses on other, more minute details. For example, Billy says that the best moment of his life was laying out on the horse cart under the sun in Dresden. As most people couldn't be able to enjoy any moment in Dresden after the bombing, seeing as how 135,000 people died, and the bodies are lying all around. This sense of not giving a damn gave Billy a comical aura. There is much, much more dark humor spread throught the book that is like this. It's the unique humor that makes this book very enjoyable, and I recommend that everyone reads this selection."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I first picked up this book in a [retail store] as a freshman in high school. This book was on my AP English class, and I had a good friend who was a sophomore who read and recommended it to me.So one day a month or so after bying this book I pick it up and start reading it.Vonnegut has a style that reminds me of a seven year old who has been eating sugar cubes, which is a good thing, because it keeps you from being bored.Along with this impressive writing style, Vonnegut adds a thought provoking plot.Well worth the money."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This is the first book I've read by Mr. Vonnegut and if all his books are like this one I think I'm in for a special treat.

In my point of view this is the perfect book to get started on: it introduces Vonnegut's writing style and it peaks one's interest for more. However, this is by no means his best. Probably the most interesting part of the book is not the humor, which is usually the most interesting, but instead the factual basis of the novel: the bombing of Dresden.What also interested me in this book was Vonnegut's way of telling stories outside of time.

Still, they are hysterically, brilliantly weird, and that is something I can stand by. I dont want to give away specific details of this weird book, because that ruins something, but believe me, it is great.

I liked the way time swiches, you constantly change from one high point to another. At first, I wasn't so used to it, but as the book progressed, I loved the time travel more and more. Our teacher told us this was a very significant book in the 60th, it was a book for the hippy generation. We discussed the anti-war, free love, and acceptance aspects of the book, but because there wasn't anything that's really hard to understand, not much things were discussed. It was a Spring Break reading, and all my classmates who actually read the book had a lot of fun with it. (When your teacher askes you to read something, you better read it!) I was expecting more war scenes, but the book didn't have much.

We meet Billy Pilgrim, a U.S. soldier who survives the horrific 1945 Allied bombing of Dresden Germany as a prisoner of war (as did Vonnegut), and then returns to American success as a suburban optometrist. Pilgrim secretly rebels against the hollow values of suburbia, time traveling between various stages of his life, and eventually submitting to capture by UFO's. I liked the author's attacks on cruelty, praise for kindness amidst chaos, and his repetition of expressions (\\"poor old Edgar Derby,\\" \\"So it goes\\") to make powerful statements. Some suspect that Vonnegut's pen was guided by post-traumatic stress dating from his wartime experiences. \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" is technically science fiction, but it's a winner in any genre."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"There are thousands of war-diaries in the world today. There are big books, small books, boring books, intense books, and diary books, all on the subject of war. When was the last time you read a war book? And liked it? Maybe you've never been interested to pick up a book about war. Personally, I've never finished a war book, usually because they're horribly boring. I could do without endless details about battles and strategy; it takes more than that to keep me interested. Well, in a world of thousands of dull war-books, Slaughterhouse-Five rises above the rest as a breath of fresh air. It is a book that I will read and re-read throughout my life. Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. wrote Slaughterhouse-Five to be serious, hysterically funny, and very creative all at the same time, all of which he succeeds at doing. Slaughterhouse-Five tells the tale of the life of Billy Pilgrim, a nave young scout* who is captured in the Battle of Dresden of WWII. Billy is then employed in a slaughterhouse manufacturing vitamins for pregnant women. While Vonnugut is telling the story about the life Billy Pilgrim, he is actually telling the story of himself*, precisely when he witnessed the firebombing of Dresden, Germany. The aspect of the book that makes it so special is the style in which it was written. Vonnegut writes the book about Billy Pilgrim in a series of flashbacks throughout his life, like in a series of cycles. * In one paragraph, for example, the reader will find Billy Pilgrim sitting in his office pondering his twisted life. However, in the next paragraph, the reader may find Billy being held hostage by German soldiers or kidnapped by aliens. \\"Overhead he heard the cry of what might have been a melodious owl, but it wasn't a melodious owl. It was flying saucer, from Tralfamadore, navigating in both space and time, therefore seeming Billy Pilgrim to have come from nowhere all at once. Somewhere a big dog barked,\\" (p. 75) After each death in the book, the phrase \\"so it goes\\" appears, telling us that life just moves on. \\"One of them singled out Billy's face for a moment, then focused at infinite again. There was a tiny plume of smoke at infinity. There was a battle there. People were dying there. So it goes.\\" (p.65) Growing up in times of war and poverty (2), Vonnegut has a unique outlook on life and society. In spite of this, the novel deals with many social and ecological problems that were surfacing in the sixties. \\"And Hitler turned into a baby, and all humanity, without exception, conspired biologically to produce two perfect people named Adam and Eve, he supposed.\\" (p. 75) Slaughterhouse-Five beautifully blends humor, critique, and thought-inspiring themes in this recount of WWII events. Vonnegut's unique, fresh style can't be resisted and becomes very charismatic as the book progresses.

It really blows my mind that people from TN and high school students did not enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Every Vonnegut book I've read has been an adventure into the mind of one of America's best writers and into the essence of the American experience. Some of the books are true classics. Slaughterhouse Five is one of them.This book has no plot. Neither does life. It has no character development. Human character is shaped by events, not by revelation. If you like Stories (with a capital &quot;S&quot;), you may not like this book. If you're looking for an easy read, you definitely won't like this book. But if you've ever marveled at how life can seem so &quot;unravelled&quot; at the edges, then READ THIS BOOK!Vonnegut intentionally makes the plot and characterization of his novels difficult to analyze on the surface, because he's got a lot more important things to do with portraying the perplexing unfolding of human experience that is the substance of his work (and our lives).Slaughterhouse Five exemplifies Vonnegut's mastery of the Art of resolving the tension between our need to create order out of what we experience and the inevitable unpredictability of human nature and life events.How does he resolve this tension? And why should we care? Step out into your backyard on a warm Summer's night, take a long look up into the heavens, and think about what the Tralfamadorians are getting out of this experience."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Rarely is there more madness than when humans go to war and the most appropriate way to write about war is in a mode of madness.Consider \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\" a book written by a sane writer in a mode of madness. Meet a protagonist on a pilgrimage through various stages of insanity. Experience that his insanity feels quite sane sometimes. Think about a world where a slaughterhouse becomes a sanctuary. Ask yourself if you would not choose to live in the fourth dimension where time is timeless and death has no dominion if you had seen the senseless slaughter of war. The planet Tralfamadore may be the sane alternative to the planet Earth.\\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\" is a fine novel in the tradition of satire and unconventional, innovative writing, best represented by classics like Jonathan Swift's \\"Gulliver's Travels\\" and Laurence Sterne's \\"Tristram Shandy\\". The book can be hilariously funny, but it is deadly serious about dying. In my opinion, the recurrent comment \\"so it goes\\" is just one of the ways in which the anti-hero and the narrator of the book deal with the horror and absurdity of dying.Vonnegut's style is fluid, and the short paragraphs of the book make for easy reading. It is really very enjoyable from a pure \\"reading experience\\" view, despite the non-linear structure and the parts that read like a weird fairy-tale.Of course, there is no moral in the book. What is the morality in war? Violent death makes no sense. Violent death is as absurd as life gets. And absurdity invites laughter. It's the only way to deal with it short of going insane or joining a cult that has All The Answers.And Dresden, this doomed city - how neatly Vonnegut's description of its deceptive, dreamlike splendor summarizes his book: \\"The Americans arrived in Dresden at five in the afternoon. The boxcar doors were opened, and the doorways framed the loveliest city that most of the Americans had ever seen. The skyline was intricate and voluptuous and enchanted and absurd.\\""},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughterhouse FiveIn &quot;Slaughterhouse Five,&quot; Kurt Vonnegut is trying to present how life is precious and how any form of war, no matter for what reason, is inhuman. Even though this book is antiwar, it was not its purpose to stop soldiers from fighting but end violence against innocent civilians. In his introduction, he says:&quot;The drama of any raid on a civilian population, a gesture in diplomacy to a man like Henry Kissinger, is about the inhumanity of many of man's inventions to man.&quot; In this antiwar book I think that the most interesting idea is how Vonnegut brings aliens to this story to give it a taste of science fiction. The Trafalmadorians taught this character, a representative of the human race, how to travel through time and how to live and see one more dimension than he could see now. In one of his talks to Trafalmadorians, the alien says:&quot;We Trafalmadorians read all at once, not one after another. There isn't any particular relationship between all the messages, except that when seen all at once, they produce an image of life that is beautiful and surprising and deep.&quot; He taught Billy to look deeper into each moment and see the profound meaning of life. And the profound meaning of life would be to live it and to enjoy it, rather than dying in some little stupid worthless war. Billy time travels in his mind but relives each moment in his imagination as if it is always happening. Each new sentence of the book Billy could be in a complete different place and when remembering he would relize that everything he did then was of no importnace to him now or then. He reminds us that life is to live and all of its ideas are not to be set aside because we have only one shot at life so why waste it. If you're interested in finding out how Vonnegut portrays soldiers in an anti-war book and how he puts civilians in the fight interweaving all of their experiences through the genre of science fiction, this is a book to read."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"&quot;Slaughterhouse Five&quot; is a work of literary fiction that combines historical, psychological, sociological, and science fiction elements. Unlike your everyday novel, Vonnegut does not express a clear plot, conflict, or climax, instead he offers us a multi-dimensional view of fantasy and reality. Slaughterhouse Five grew out of Vonnegut's own personal experiences during W.W.II, particularly the horrors of the Dresden air raids. Everything Vonegut writes related to the bombing of Dresden is meant to be felt as senseless to the reader. The story is mostly seen through the eyes of the main character Billy Pilgrim, a tall, skinny, sort of senseless man. He becomes &quot;unstuck&quot; in time and travels to different places and times during his life. An interesting yet somewhat confusing element in the story is Vonnegut's use of alien beings called Tralfamadorians to install his multi-dimensional concept of time. Billy is kidnapped by the Tralfamadorians and kept on their spacecraft. There he learns the Tralfamadorian concepts of time, predestination, and the absurdities of the human world. Vonnegut, also present in the novel, includes a telegraphic narrative explaining who he is and where he has been. Vonnegut displays many horrific events constituted with death by means of black humor. When a person dies the term &quot;so it goes&quot; immediately follows as if death were just some careless event. His use of black humor is meant to make the readers laugh in situations of absolute tragedy, such as death. If you're interested in warped SCI-FI with a bit of humor mixed with some hard-rock reality that reads smoothly, I would suggest &quot;Slaughterhouse Five&quot; as an excellent novel in its class. Slaughterhouse Five broadened my perspective of time and whether or not predestination exists. Vonnegut, through &quot;Slaughterhouse Five&quot;, opens the reader's mind to his own a different, twisted, world of interesting thought, concepts, and experiences."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Kurt Vonnegut's death made me think about Slaughterhouse-Five, and I read it again for the first time since the early '70s, not long after it was published. I discovered that it's now a much better book, or maybe I'm now a much better reader...This book is often called an \\"absurdest classic,\\" and it is both of those things. It relates the life of Billy Pilgrim, who's become \\"unstuck\\" in time, by describing what is happening-- and what has and will happen-- to him simultaneously. The focal point for all of this is the shattering experience of Billy's life, his presence as a prisoner of war in Dresden when it was destroyed by the allies in World War II.Of course, Vonnegut himself actually experienced the events he creates for Billy, surviving only because the Germans housed their prisoners in concrete slaughterhouses, and it had a similarly shattering effect on him. He says the book is his attempt to deal with the experience.The book could have been impossibly confusing or just annoying, but it's not. That's because of Vonnegut's style. His central thesis-- that the survivors of the horrors of war are sick because they realize that they are \\"...the listless playthings of enormous forces\\"-- is developed with both humor and humanity. The book is a condemnation of savagery committed as a service to authority; it's also warm and deeply funny. That might seem like an unlikely or even impossible combination, but Vonnegut pulls it off. That's why the book is regarded as a classic.This book is easy, quick reading, but it's most certainly not an easy or quick task to forget it. It's often compared to Joseph Heller's Catch- 22, probably because they are both appreciations-- celebrations, really-- of the absurdity that can be found in the tragedies of life, particularly the tragedy of war."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This is a very funny novel that- in retrospect- breaks your heart; it's the blackest black humor you will ever read.It must have taken great courage for Vonnegut- as talented as he is- to take the Allied bombing of Dresden Germany during WWII and make it the main stage for this theater of the absurd tale, particularly since he witnessed firsthand what happened to Dresden. Fail, and you risk being pummeled by the critics for trivializing a horrific, nearly unimaginable event. (For those who don't know, Dresden wasn't \\"just\\" bombed; it was turned into a raging firestorm, with hurricane-force winds dragging thousands of victims into the flames to be cremated, and depleting the oxygen in the underground shelters, leaving thousands more asphyxiated.) But Vonnegut didn't fail; he succeeded brilliantly in conveying the absurdity of war by not embellishing events, the tone of the book remarkably matter-of-fact as his main character- Billy Pilgrim- jumps through time and space, gaining a unique perspective on the follies of mankind.The name of his main character is especially telling of Vonnegut's intentions. Perhaps the most famous Billy in literature is Melville's Billy Budd, an innocent soul whose fate is an unjust death that suggests life is predetermined. And Pilgrim brings to mind John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, an allegorical tale of the escape from the City of Destruction (Dresden) to the Celestial City of enlightenment (the home world of the superior Tralfamadorians, who explain human existence to Billy.)Perhaps by writing Slaughterhouse Five, Vonnegut gained some measure of catharsis, found a way to deal with his memories of Dresden and its aftermath. Like many veterans whose refuse to discuss their war experiences, a more direct, \\"realistic\\" approach to the firebombing might have been too painful. By taking an indirect approach, however, he was able to open a door that otherwise would have remained locked. That's fortunate for us, since Slaughterhouse Five rises above the historical account of that terrible event to address the larger issue of what it means to be human in a world where what humans do doesn't always make sense.This is an insightful, important book, and one of Vonnegut's best.-Mark Wakely, author of An Audience for Einstein"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Fellow reviewer, Reinhold Strnat, you gave only one star to one of the greatest authors this country has ever produced.

Probably not. Pick it up again in a few years, perhaps when you're in college when abstraction may come more naturally. Then release any concrete expectations you may have as to how a point is to be made. Let the humor, the absurdity, and the humanity take you right to the point that really is there.

Not the worst book I ever read but certainly one of my least favorite books."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This book is not quite like anything else I've read. I guess I could call it a fatalist's account of the firebombing of Dresden, but I don't think this does it justice.I enjoyed it for the style of its writing and its recurring themes (death, sex, fatalism, and time, among others), and not so much for the plot or the characters -- which I agree aren't that interesting, except for Kilgore Trout and the Tralfamadorians. The style of writing is humorously matter-of-fact throughout, though the issues Vonnegut brings up are serious. As for the plot, there's not much to say, but I don't think I should give it away in this review. In short, if you like thoughtfully-written fiction, read this book.Now, in response to some other reviews I've read on this site: I'm a bit puzzled by those who characterize this as an anti-war book. Yes, Vonnegut does seem to be implying that war is absurd, but he seems to think that almost everything about modern life is absurd. I didn't like this book because it showed me the horrors of war (I already knew that war is horrible); I liked it because it showed the war from a perspective I had never seen before. I enjoyed seeing things from Billy Pilgrim's reflective and supremely fatalistic point of view.In fact, I got the impression that Vonnegut was parodying Billy's anti-war sentiments, such as when he pleas to the Trafalmadorians, \\"How can a planet live at peace?\\" Or, in one of my favorite passages, when Billy watches the war movie backwards and sees factories dismantling bombs, \\"separating the dangerous contents into minerals. Touchingly, it was mainly women who did this work. The minerals were then shipped to specialists in remote areas. It was their business to put them into the ground, to hide them cleverly, so they would never hurt anybody ever again. The American fliers turned in their uniforms, became high school kids. And Hitler turned into a baby... \\" I think that Vonnegut was smart enough to realize that he could no sooner stop wars than glaciers.I also doubt that we are supposed to take the \\"philosophy\\" of the Tralfamadorians seriously. To those of you who do: do you really think that Vonnegut wrote this book because he believed that we should all \\"ignore the awful times, and concentrate on the good ones\\"? C'mon, give him more credit than that!"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Kurt Vonnegut's &quot;Slaughterhouse Five&quot; is one of the finest books I've ever read. I want to extend my deepest thanks to my girl Meredith for placing it in my borrowing hands. It's a fabulous reading experience that when explained verbally makes no sense. I'm sure that my breakdown of the plot structure didn't make anyone want to read it, but my neverending enthusiasm for the brilliance of the writer and all he accomplished in the 200+ pages of text probably did. Vonnegut is a genius of prose, and he handles a story that jumps back and forth through time and space like a kangaroo with a porcupine in its pouch with a delicate touch of dark humor that treads the boundary of the nearly ludicrous, but always stays this side of believable. It's an astonishing piece of anti-war sentiment that examines the life of Billy Pilgrim through the 4-dimensional eyes of time, seeing time and events therein as something that have always happened, is happening, and will always happen. This sets the time-hopping structure of the book.The book is rooted in Billy Pilgrim's situation as a prisoner of war, held captive first in a run down little camp that is pretty much headed by the distinguished Englishmen who have come to know the Nazi soldiers as comrades in arms, and then he is moved to Dresden, Germany; the site of a massacre that the combined destructive power of which took more lives than the Hiroshima bomb. We find out that Billy Pilgrim also became a optometrist, married a rich woman, and may or may not have been taken to a planet called Tralfamadore to be put on display in a zoo for the interest of the planet's inhabitants, who teach Billy about the true nature of time.I couldn't explain how or why this book drew me in with such power, but there is no doubt in my mind of its greatness. Vonnegut uses his characters to the anti-war angle splendidly, gives us some new perspectives about time to think about, and he sort of makes us feel guilty for wanting to chuckle at the snide moments of obscure humor he throws at us like eggs, and we're all the dumb football jock's car. It's a wonderful balancing act of psychological profiling, satire, theory, and love. This is a true timeless masterpiece."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This book is a true masterpiece. It is the best thing Kurt Vonnegut ever wrote, in terms of classic literature. Some of his other stuff is more meaningful to me, but Slaughterhouse Five is the best put together, most literarily valuable book that he wrote. It's also his first book.It was years after I read this book that I realized that this book may not be science fiction at all. It may just be a depiction of post-traumatic stress disorder. Slaughterhouse Five stands up very well as either an interesting book on time travel or a book on how the horrors of war can ravage the mind of an innocent man. Billy Pilgrim, the main character, did get \\"unstuck in time in 1944.\\"I really like the part in the book where Billy Pilgrim is first married to his wife Valencia.Now he rolled off his huge wife...He was rich now. He had been rewarded for marrying a girl nobody in his right mind would have married...\\"I never thought anyone would marry me.\\"\\"Um,\\" said Billy Pilgrim\\"I'm going to lose weight for you,\\" she said.\\"What?\\"\\"I'm going to go on a diet. I'm going to become beautiful for you.\\"\\"I like you just the way you are.\\"\\"Do you really?\\"\\"Really,\\" said Billy Pilgrim. He had already seen a lot of their marriage, thanks to time travel, knew that it was at least going to be bearable all of the way."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"one of the best authors of his time. everyone in america should read this book, especially in our current times. Kurt had a real idea of what the world is like and puts it to page so beautifully and with such a great wittiness that it makes you want to laugh and cry at the same time, but you don't do either because it has so much truth to it. please read all his other works as well, they make you a better person."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This classic anti-war novel will open your eyes to the horrors of warfare and how seemingly unnecessary it is."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"In this twisted and psychotic Billy Pilgrim....an average american you might say....NOT!! throughout Billy's life he has experienced so pretty screwed up stuff and lots of it. First he was abducted by aliens which called themselves Trafalmadorians. They put him in a dome and made him the main attraction in a zoo. Billy travels through time in his mind and he can see his present, past, and future. he was held prisoner in war in a german camp and there he saw some crazy things. A confusisizing hobo dyed in his eyes. He had some psysho friends like Weary and Paul Lazzaro who were both very violent and wanted revenge on Billy. Much Much more twisted stuff goes on in this novel.. I highly recommend it"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Is this book a classic? Undoubtedly. It shines, cuts and weaves its way through a wonderfully intriguing plot. Vonnegut's use of imagery is superb, his economical way with words unparelled; he richly deserved all his accolades.The only positive to come out of Kurt's passing is the renewed interest in his work. Hopefully this will inspire other authors to dare reach for the greatness that was Vonnegut.But is this Vonnegut's best work? No. If you're only checking out Vonnegut because he was recently in the news, because he died, I'd buy \\"Cat's Cradle\\" instead. That's Kurt's best work.Now I still feel Slaughterhouse Five was one of the 20 best books ever written. I'd rank it around number 18; Cat's Cradle would be in the top three.Cat's Cradle"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I have always loved this author. Vonnegut's originality and humorous approach (deadpan., satirical, et al) to the absurd things humans do proves that there really isn't much new under the sun.Same old world. So we have better toys today than back in the 1960's? Are we any wiser?I recently re-read this splendid novel(eerie given the news today) only about a month or two ago. It still stands. After all these decades,it still stands. Billy Pilgrim is the modern, wounded-male archetype par excellence. We could easily transpose WWII for Iraq. Apt in any age but maybe even more so right now.You don't want to pass this one up, along with this author's more humorous works (BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS). I enjoyed re-reading this so much, I rank it as a favorite in the past year."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Admittedly I'm not a fan of sci-fi but this book caught my eye in a used book store. It is completely different from anything else I've read before or since. Vonnegut is truly a master writer. It has been said a great book will reach out from the pages and grab you. A perfect description for this book."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughterhouse five is by far a great pies of work by Kurt Vonnegut. The story's plot focuses on the life of the protagonist named Billy. The story can be a little complicated being that it is a story in a story of the author's who is a character in the book.The book more or less has no structure in it. The plot structure cannot be described as linear, but rather it is more spatial in its organization. the style of the story to me was almost bleak and depressing, with a subtle mention of science-fiction in it."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughterhouse-Five is a satisfying novel by Kurt Vonnegut.what happens in this story is a boy named Billy Pilgrim gets abducted by aliens from the planet Tralfamadore who send him in the past of world war 2.When billy goes into the past he becomes a prisoner of war and he talks about life in the concetration camps.Some of the parts in this boook are sad and some are funny.And the characters are mostley violent but some are not.If you like to read novels about war or sci-fi this would be a good beook to read.overall the book was good and it had a message about how he took his life in the past day by day.and how to live in such harsh conditions in the camps.I was vaery surprised on the theme of this book.From the title called Slaughterhouse-Five.I thought it would of been on animals at a butcher shop.I did not expect to read about World War 2 or about concentration camps.All of the other books that this author has written must be good if this book was."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughterhouse-Five was, to say the least, one of the most interesting literary works I have ever read. The way Vonnegut presents the life of Billy Pilgrim is amazingly symbolic - everything has another meaning aside from its literal representation. The prose of the book is fantastic, it really fits the content of the book really well.This is definitely Vonnegut's best work, and one of the greatest books written in the 20th Century. I can't get over how fun this book was to read. It wasn't as confusing as one would thing: you have to think like the Tralfamadorians, taking in everything on the whole, and not just piece-by-piece as one would probably do.So, in conclusion, I suggest this book to everyone who enjoys reading books of any sort."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Read this book. Full of humor, existential spinning, quantum leaps, horror, absurdity and other life defining delirium. A favorite passage is from page 76:Billy licked his lips, thought a while, inquired at last: \\"Why me?\\"\\"That is a very Earthling question to ask, Mr. Pilgrim. Why you? Why us for that matter? Why anything? Because this moment simply is. Have you ever seen bugs trapped in amber?\\"\\"Yes.\\" Billy, in fact had a paperweight in his office which was a blob of polished amber with three lady-bugs embedded in it.\\"Well, here we are Mr. Pilgrim, trapped in the amber of this moment. There is no why.This is a book that can be read quickly and frequently. The writing is easy and to the point. The imagery is active too. Passing from different times in time, from an office in 1967 to a hospital in a POW camp in 1944 for example, all I had to hold me in place was Billy Pilgrim. Pilgrim is the fortunate or unfortunate, I suppose there could be an argument either way, hero of the novel. Slashed at by existence and spun into a universal adventure that gives him two \\"wives,\\" three children, lots of dead friends, a sense of peace amidst the most heinous and hilarious circumstances, and synchronicity with himself through time and space, among other things, that moved me with its elemental truth. So it goes. So it goes.I hope that this book is read and read over and over, especially by school kids, who have English teachers who keep seeing this on lists of \\"challenged\\" books. I think there is an attitude similar to the scenes toward the end of the book when Pilgrim shares and hospital room with Rumfoord, historian of the Air Force. Rumfoord sees Pilgrim as a moron, and despite Pilgrim's eventual admission that he was in Dresden during the firebombing, to Rumfoord he still has no understanding of what war is. Such is Vonnegut to so many \\"patriots\\" and die-hard industrialists who perpetuate advocacy for such horrors. So it goes.This is a book that brings out many emotions, and evokes a sense of experience that has no apparent reasoning. A true classic."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This is Kurt Vonnegut's finest book in my opinion. The writing is just perfect. Slaughter House Five was Vonnegut's way of dealing with the bombing of Dresden, which he was present at. He takes the complicated, but excellent aproach of telling the story in fragments, broken up over the course of history. We follow Billy Pilgrim, who is \\"unstuck in time\\" as he relives the events of his life. Billy is a passive protagonist and is not meant to be liked by the reader. We do not know whether what he is experiencing is real or not, but Billy always leaves a difficult situation to one of more comfort, rather than dealing with it, the opposite of what Vonnegut does while writing this book. Lastly, this book is anti-war. The question put forth is, even during World War II, did the people of Dresden deserve to be incinerated? Is destruction like this, no matter what the reason ever justified? Vonnegut leaves that for the reader to decide. There is a reason why this book is considered to be one of the greatest American novels of all time."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This is a very interesting book. I found it to be deeply thought provoking. Billy Pilgrim is someone you can see and understand. The entire basis of the book is about a man who lives outside the boundaries of out three dimensional world. He can become \\"unstuck\\" in time.The book is very difficult to explain because of Mr. Vonnegut's writing technique. Billy Pilgrim's adventures jump around, but the entire book's setting is World War II. It is historical facts mixed with the authors crazy plot structure. Billy's adventures include an alien encounter, on the night of his honey moon he is whisked away by an alien race called the Tralfamadores. These aliens teach Billy how to become \\"unstuck\\" in time. By using this concept Billy knows every detail to his life, something most living people would love to have.All in all this book makes you think. Mr. Vonnegut dosen't go overboard and confuse you. He makes sure you know exactly where you are and he then points you in the directions he wants to take you. He throws in his feelings since he lived through World War II and the historical events are true. The bombing of Dresden is what the author seems to want to focus on considering the prologue and any event that occurs to Billy refers to Dresden. When the author acutally gets to that point in the book he seems to have forgotten that he builds the readers up for that event. He gives a few details and goes to a Billy Pilgrim adventure. Maybe, because he lived the event, he does not want to think about those vivid memories. I have not read a book quiet like this one, and I don't think I ever will. To realize what our futures hold and having the self restraint to let the bad things happen could not be done. Maybe this is why I can see Billy being a hero. He doesn't do anything that you would call heroic. When he is running away from the Germans he dosen't have a weapon and someone else is forced to look after him. He is the main reason why his group is captured. Most peole won't call that a heroic act, but you have to read the book to find his acts of courage.Just a side note, this book reminds me of the short story \\" The Secret Life of Walter Mitty\\"."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This novel reminded me of a bizarre abstract painting. Vonnegut is perhaps the Picasso of literature. Billy Pilgrim's bizarre story is told in pieces, jumbled and out of order, but the novel is still put together ingeniously. Vonnegut brilliantly adds in his touch of science fiction, toying with such matters as time travel and alien abduction, but these are only the backdrop for Billy's real story of sacrifice, tragedy, and the pains of violence and combat. Billy is a tortured hero, pathetic but still likeable. His story is a sad one and you feel as if you must like him or else. The review on the book says it well; it is a book &quot;at which you are not permitted to laugh.&quot; One of my favorites of all time."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"When the movie based on the book was presented in Italian cinemas, I was in my pre-teens and, being it rated NC-14, all I was allowed to look at was its trailer. Even it, alone, left me a strange impression, as a result of an usual mix of war, science fiction and sex (very few, however, but then considered enough for rating). The book has been a full confirmation of that boyhood memory: strict language, dark humour, plenty of references (The Execution of Private Slovik is an interesting historical note), an underlying structure uncorrelated events are attached over, build up an environment logical and confused at the same time. All books by Vonnegut I have read so far are someway related to previous references or boyhood memories, so I sensed a hint of completion of old knowledge by their reading. So considering him as the best author in science fiction may be an exaggeration, but I am glad I have read this book now: I think I could have not appreciated the random jumps in the thread when I was used to the \\"fairy tale\\" SF."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time. One of my new favorite books ever! Truly one of Vonnegut's best works of art. Deep and profound with many allusions to keep you guessing. So it goes..."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I wish I could tell you what a masterpiece this book is. I would tell you of Vonnegut's simple, but masterful use of language and the book's utterly honest humanity and screaming rage against mass death and destruction will leave any reader who undertakes this book profoundly moved and perhaps even changed.There are other reviews here that state it far more eloquently than I have. All I can say is that if you have not read this book, I strongly urge you to do so right away. If you have read it, well then you know how brilliant it already is. This immortal work will make Vonnegut's name forever large in the pantheon of great writers."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This was the first book of Kurt Vonnegut's that I read and it got me hooked on him. He has a very simple and honest style of writing that I find very alluring. His books have simple messages and have both broad and finite subjects. Slaughterhouse Five is mainly an anti-war book but it touches on religion and science and free will or destiny also. Throughout the whole book the message of the meaninglessness and atrociousness of war is prevelent and foremost in his theme. Here and there though he touches other themes. He brings Christianity into it a few times and the way that he describes time as always occuring and no such thing as a past, present or future, goes against the human notion of free will which everyone would like to believe and he establishes a minor theme of everything being destined. He also brings a solution to the depression of the realization that we can't avoid bad times and war by saying to focus on the good times. Also the plain fact that the main character, Billy Pilgrim, survives the war, being as scrawny as he is, is a slap in the face to the theory of 'survival of the fittest.' Vonnegut's breadth of subjects along with his witty and simple writing style make this book a treasure."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"If you haven't read this you should. It is amazing and Vonnegut is an incredible writer. If you have read it, reread it. I have read it three times. Also if you are a student, it is a great book to chose to read for an assignment or summer reading."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Beautiful, beautiful. In words, ideas, in character, sad, pensive, beautiful. Billy Pilgrim is the aloof soundboard through which the readers uniquely experience (and Vonnegut expresses) the firebombing of Dresden and the comical tragedies of war.I repeated the word \\"beautiful\\" because Vonnegut's diction is so simple and transparent like a clear crystal. He has a gift for depicting the fantastic with what is fantastic. For instance, the implicit tragedy of horrendous Dresden burning is counterbalanced by the preceding hilarity of English prisoners of war, and the fantastical abduction of Billy by aliens. Yet, uses the resulting mental jolts to emphasize the tragedy of the war, rather than debase the topic into a light farce."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Billy Pilgrim is a man who witnessed the firebombing of Dresden during World War II where he was a POW. Later in life he believes he was abducted by aliens and taken to the planet Tralfamadore. Sometime after this he became unstuck in time, constantly shifting from one time period of his life to another. One minute he is in the POW camp, and the next he is on Tralfamadore and the next at home with his wife. Slaughterhouse Five is filled with absurd images and people and speaks to how we handle traumatizing events in our lives. It is an oddly structured book in that there is no real beginning, middle or end and constantly jumps around in time and place. It is worthwhile to read this book for its absurd humor and deft characterization of Billy Pilgrim, but it does not strike me as the iconic classic it is made out to be."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"&quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; was my first introduction to Kurt Vonnegut in the novel form. I had read a few of his short stories and was already impressed with his status as a writer. I would've never expected what I experienced when I read &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five.&quot; It's hard to put into words that'll actually do this masterpiece the justice it deserves, but I will try.Listen: Billy Pilgrim has become unstuck in time. This meaning that he relives certain moments of his life in random order like a scrambled movie. He has absolutely no control over it whatsoever and he never knows what part of his life he'll have to reenact. The majority of the moments that we witness take place during his involvement in WW2 as a POW and also when he is taken aboard an alien spaceship with creatures known as &quot;Tralfamadorians.&quot; There is no ending for Billy Pilgrim. He witnesses his beginning as well as death... and then the show starts all over again in a continuous loop throwing Pilgrim into random segments of his life.Reading this novel was a completely new experience to me. I had never read anything like it, and now I know that I will never again read anything like it, as there is no way the book can be successfully duplicated by others. Vonnegut is able to take a serious matter (such as war) and still throw in a balanced sense of humor that will take you by surprise. The book pokes fun at just about anything you can imagine while still showing respect and care to the main subject matter. The story is outrageously subtle and unpredictable. This novel is a very easy read and once you begin it, you won't want to put it down until you have finished it. Vonnegut is one talented writer with a very unique sense of style that I have never witnessed in any other book.One thing that people will probably dislike about the book is how confusing it can be at times. Since the book jumps around and is not in order, you have to always be thinking and paying attention to every detail. It's very easy to forget what has already happened and what has yet to happen since it is in scrambled order. However, this is what really makes the book that much more special. You'll want to reread it again for this very reason, as you'll most likely miss a few things with the first read. It wasn't very hard for me to keep track of what was going on since I found the book to be so involving.While this is indeed a classic, because of the strange manner that the book is written in, it will most likely not appeal to everybody. This is a risk-taking work of literature that is bound to not have everybody loving it. Still, I think it's worth anybody's time to pick it up and give it a chance. &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; is a rare find that will keep you on your toes throughout the entire time. You'll never know what to expect next. A very touching, funny, sad and dark story about a flawed entity known as &quot;human-beings.&quot; This has very quickly become a new favorite of mine, without question. -Michael Crane"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"On February 13-14, in the year of 1945, 65,000 incendiary explosives were dropped upon the peaceful and beautiful German city of Dresden by British and American forces, burning 135,000 men, women, and children to death (15,000 more than the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima). So it goes.The author of Slaughterhouse-Five, Kurt Vonnegut, was one of the 100 people to survive the bombing, and then only because he was deep under the ground in a slaughterhouse being held as a prisoner of war. For the main character of the story, Kurt Vonnegut invented Billy Pilgrim, the imaginary protagonist of Slaughterhouse-Five, to also witness the somewhat unknown firebombing of Dresden. The damage that the event inflicted upon Billy's mind becomes apparent throughout the course of the book, beginning with the fact that he experiences time by jumping from event to event in his life, similar to a severely shell-shocked individual.The story is presented in a calm and informative manner, with absurd, disturbing, and often unexpected events mixed with the often mundane and uneventful story of Billy's life. It is through these bizarre events that many of the book's main points are presented; for instance, aliens known as the Tralfamadorians (who view the universe through the fourth-dimension) kidnapped Billy Pilgrim in his warped mind and showed him that the true way to view the universe was to see it all at once, as a huge picture, and then to focus only on the times that were pleasant.In my opinion, Slaughterhouse-Five is a book that should be read by every human being on the planet. Who knows, maybe people might realize that destroying people's lives and minds over issues they don't have anything to do with won't make the world a better place."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughterhouse Five is one of the most interesting books I have ever read. With this incredible book, Kurt Vonnegut broke the rules of the traditional novel. He wrote it in such a way that the reader is hurled through time both forward and backward. The protagonist, Billy Pilgrim, has a strange affliction. He often loses consciousness only to come to in another time in his life. This ability gives the book a very circular timeline as opposed to the more traditional linear format. Slaughterhouse Five is an anti-war book. Vonnegut showed the insignificance of a single life in wartime by adding the phrase \\"So it goes.\\" after every death in the book. The book does have a positive outlook on death however, which Billy learns through his encounters with the Tralfmadorians, an alien race which for whatever reason is interested in him. Slaughterhouse Five is unfortunately a bit dry in some parts, but the attentive reader can draw out some very positive messages from the story. The characters in the book lack depth, which allows them to be more expendable. This can either be good or bad. Their expendability can once again prove the insignificance of human life, or their lack of depth may just fail to capture the reader's attention. I would recommend Slaughterhouse Five to anyone that is bored with the average novel. I think you will be pleased with this interesting novel."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"The first pages of the book introduce Vonnegut himself speaking to a friend about the difficulty of writing a book about the bombing of Dresden. Indeed, this is commonly considered Vonnegut's \\"Dresden book.\\" For the life of me, I cannot understand why, as events relating to the firebombing of Dresden comprise about four pages total. Vonnegut the character apologizes to the reader for the difficulty of telling a story about war and instead offers a lame science fiction story about a man named Billy Pilgrim who becomes \\"unstuck in time\\" and experiences the events of his life out of order.It seems to me that Vonnegut was afraid to embrace a story focusing on his experience during the firebombing. He was afraid to attempt to capture the confusion, disillusionment, and otherwise intense emotions caused by war, as Hemingway so astutely did in A Farewell to Arms and For Whom the Bell Tolls. He was afraid to try and fail, and so he skirted around the actual bombing and immediate aftermath. Those events should have been the primary focus of the book, but were instead buried beneath hundreds of pages describing life in an alien zoo, adventures in optometry, and a sham marriage to an obese woman. Hemingway spent hundreds of pages describing battles and bombings; Vonnegut could have spent more than four describing an afternoon where a city's population all but completely burned to death.It's not as if the book is tensely building up to those four pages. Most of the novel is spent describing the mundane life of Billy Pilgrim, a character who, in defiance of most concepts of good characterization, does not grow or mature in any way. The reader receives virtually no insight as to his motivations. When he does speak, his interactions with other characters suggest that he is mentally retarded. Billy's inept actions and dialogue are so absurd that many times the novel left me feeling slightly ashamed, as if I was reading a Tucker Max story about a slutty midget and expected to share a derisory laugh with the author. In general, Billy simply drifts through life as things happen around him. Somehow, I doubt that this is a postmodern metaphor for the disillusionment of soldiers that is lost on me. More likely, it is simply uninspired writing.Vonnegut's irreverent prose did make me chuckle, but it was marred by one very odd stylistic choice. The author chose to insert the mantra \\"So it goes,\\" after each mention of death in the book as a sardonic expression of fatalism. Used 106 times in 190 pages, the wit quickly turns to obnoxiousness. By the end of the book, I felt that I was listening to a child who repeats a single phrase over and over solely to irritate.Slaughterhouse-Five is a mediocre novel and does not deserve the acclaim it has received. I theorize that the novel's popularity resulted from a combination of Vonnegut's personal popularity and the postmodern and anti-war movements that were prevalent at the book's publishing."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Though I love it, I can understand how it would be easy to dislike this book. I view it as a piece of art when taken as a whole, though individual sections of it can be confusing. I love being confused by Vonnegut. He can take your mind places through the chaos and surrealism of his books.Understand that Vonnegut was a POW in Dresden when it was firebombed - a horrible experience. I think this must be in one's thoughts when approaching this bookMy takeaway from the book was that Kurt sat down to write a book about his experiences and was unable to have a sane thought about the war, so he decided not to write a sane book. I've had some truly awful times of my life, things that 99.999% of people just cannot imagine. I understand what it is like to try to tell people with more ordinary experiences about the horrible things I've been through - It's tough to tell people, especially because they can't respond or react because they don't know how (And others are just trying not to vomit). I understand what it's like to personally grapple with memories of this sort, how difficult it can be to feel sane when thinking back to those times, sifting through memories that can only be described as a horror story. I often tell my story as some sort of crazy joke that most people cannot laugh at, because I don't know how else to talk about it. I think this is exactly what he was doing.It's beautiful. Take it as art, not a narrative. This book is at it's most enjoyable when you turn the last page and just sit there for 30 minutes, thinking and connecting.It's also okay to hate it - It's pretty weird."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I first read Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five as a very young man. At the time, I was an avid fan of science fiction, especially those books featuring time travel, and that is what drew me to Slaughterhouse-Five. As a science fiction novel, I thought it was pretty good, especially considering the amount of random time travel its main character, Billy Pilgrim, experiences in this relatively short novel. The problem with my early assessment of Slaughterhouse-Five, however, is that this is not simply a science fiction novel - and it should not be judged by the standards of that genre. Even worse, I managed to ignore the novel's message.Vonnegut's deceptively simple masterpiece is about life itself; it is about the futility and utter waste of warfare; it is about time, and the way that we perceive it; it is about fate and whether any of us really has any control over what happens to us next. Poor Billy Pilgrim certainly had little to say about the course of his own life. Swept up into World War II, where he is captured by the Germans almost as soon as he arrives, Billy will be held prisoner in Dresden's Slaughterhouse-Five, from where he will survive the Allied firebombing that destroys the entire city. He will be abducted by a crew of aliens from the planet Tralfamador and displayed in a zoo there along with the former porn star chosen as his mate. He will become a successful optometrist, popular and respected in his community. The only problem is that it all happens at the same time.Billy Pilgrim has become \\"unstuck in time\\" and he never knows, from one instant to the next, when he will flash forward or backward to a different part of his lifetime. It is all real, and it is always happening - all of it at the same time.Slaughterhouse-Five is generally considered to be a classic anti-war novel. Even with that reputation, its message is subtle enough that it is possible to get so caught up in the rest of the story and its mechanics that the novel's serious theme is only recognized some time after turning its final page. This book is funny, even to the point of being absurd, but it is a serious piece of writing by an author with something serious to say about the foolishness of killing \\"enemies\\" by the thousands/millions at the behest of politicians who have failed at their own jobs.The effectiveness of Slaughterhouse-Five is compounded by the ease with which it can be read; Vonnegut has disguised a complex novel, one filled with thoughtful points, as some kind of comedic science fiction piece. And, he makes it all look so easy."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"For years my only association with Kurt Vonnegut was from the Rodney Dangerfield movie Back to School. In case your husband hasn't forced you to watch it numerous times (help me!), I'll give you a quick synopsis. Dangerfield plays the part of a successful and rich business owner who goes back to college to help support his wimpy and struggling son. Only, Dangerfield discovers that he prefers college-style partying to studying so he pays Vonnegut (playing himself in the movie) to come and write a paper about himself for his English course. He fails the assignment because as the professor (and love interest) claims, obviously Dangerfield didn't write the paper himself and whoever did write the paper didn't understand the first thing about Vonnegut.My long-distance book club that I maintain with former college roommates added Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five to our reading list last summer, but we fizzled out and didn't get to it. So we decided to try it again this year. I didn't know what to expect. Honestly, because of the title, I have confused it with Sinclair's The Jungle for years. Surely it has something to do with our meat industry. Right?It's not like that. At all.Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five is funny and irreverent and shocking and hysterical and moving and poignant and seriously disturbing. I enjoyed every minute.And just so you know, Vonnegut is a creative genius nutcase. Oh and he swears. A lot."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I'll start off by saying that I've read all but 2 of Kurt Vonnegut's works. This was one of the first that I read and to this day it remains my favorite. As a matter of fact, it's probably one of my \\"all time top 3.\\" In \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" Vonnegut somehow manages to tell a story that is simultaneously quasi-sci-fi, psychological, funny, and a deep study of human morals. It's a book that will have you laughing most of the time while you read it, then somber when you think back on it as a whole. It manages to get across the anti-war morals that Vonnegut feels, but NEVER gets preachy or heavy-handed.I don't want to ruin any of plot (and you can see descriptions anyway) so I'm not going to bother to delve into it. I'll just say that this is a once-in-a-generation type of book and it's a quick read too, so you owe it to yourself to give it a shot"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"It's probably been over a decade since I last read Slaughterhouse Five, but after recommending it to a student who's been excitedly reading through it, I got the urge to dive back into Vonnegut's world again. There are few who don't know what Slaughterhouse Five is about, but for the unaware, it's the tale of Billy Pilgrim, a WWII veteran who was present at the fire-bombing of Dresden and now finds himself \\"unstuck\\" in time, catapulting around through his life. Of course, it's also the story of Vonnegut himself, as he deals with his memories of Dresden and tries to find some meaning behind it all. There's so much beauty and honesty in Slaughterhouse Five that it's hard to know where to start. Vonnegut's rambling, train-of-thought style isn't for all tastes, but for those who lose themselves in his world, it allows for marvelous asides and powerful moments, as well as Vonnegut's typically cynical optimism. As much of a contradiction as that sounds, it's the only way I know how to describe Vonnegut's work - there's no doubt that he's deeply cynical about the world and humankind, but he nonetheless hopes for better, hopes for improvement and wishes that people could learn from the past. And there are moments of stunning beauty and hope here - for instance, the quiet and profoundly moving sequence when Pilgrim watches a war film unfold backwards, watching as American and German planes slowly suck wounds and shrapnel from the cities and soldiers before delivering the bombs home to be dismantled and taken away where they will never be used again, or the overwhelming pain of the Dresden bombing itself. As much as Slaughterhouse Five is known for its humor, it's a quiet, dark humor, more of a bemusement at the world around it as a satire. But what lingers is not the humor; it's Vonnegut's inimitable, wonderful world view, one that I miss as the world continues to change on a daily basis. But, as the man himself wrote: So it goes."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This book stunned me from start to finish...this was my introduction to Vonnegut and probably my favirote book that ive read by him.I love how Vonnegut can blend the two concepts of WW2 and the Aliens produced by Billy Pilgrims Schizophrenic mind.With those kind of ideas alot of times books are confusing and hard to follow but somehow Vonnegut makes everything seem like perfect sense.I would highly recommend this to anyone that is looking for a book to read...read this book!!!"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Somehow I missed the point of why this book is catalogued as anti-war, yes it indicated that the bombing of Dresden lacked any military logic. Although hate for the enemy is not exactly an absurd feeling and it can not be denied that in 1945 the German civilians were not considered an innocent party in the confrontation.Furthermore, it can also be argued that the end everything that we do lacks a real sense of purpose, basically because the reasons we believe are ours have been acquired from someone else (our culture) and that includes giving up our life in a war, choosing a profession, or electing the next weekend movie.For me this book superficially remind us that we spend our life sleeping while simultaneously being awake, but that if at some point we take the time to look at our thoughts we might be able to get unstuck from the situation in which we are living and really be an independent person.On the other hand this books makes you smile once in a while but is not hilarious."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I was an English major in university, but I was never required to read Vonnegut and many other \\"classic\\" authors you hear the intellectuals talk about so much. I've decided to remedy that so I know what people are talking about.I had heard people speak of Vonnegut's great humor. I suppose he is a great humorist in the dark humor genre, sitting alongside Thurber in that respect. However, I felt his humor was bland and a little too blase. It wasn't to my tastes. Perhaps some of Vonnegut's other works are a bit better.As far as the themes of this book go, I don't see them as ground-breaking as others have. War is bad, yes. The Serenity Prayer is a good philosophy, but by no means unknown. Dresden was a horrible incident in time.Vonnegut's downplay of war came across less as humor to me as it came across as apathy. So it goes. While I didn't hate the book, I didn't love it either. Just another author to add to my list of reading accomplishments."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This was an interesting book that I would not have choosen if it had not been for a recommendation from my english teacher. Although I though it was a very confusing book I never felt board. The crazieness of it made me want to turn each page cause you never know whats going to come next. Unless you are an extreamly analitical person I would recommend reading this book with an english teacher or somebody would could help you to understand the &quot;deeper meanings&quot;."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"\\"The cattle are lowing, the Baby awakes. But the little Lord Jesus no crying he makes.\\" This poem has great significance to Slaughterhouse-Five. The main character in the book is Billy Pilgrim and the journeys and everything he experienced. The poem has to do with Billy because when something bad happens in his life he does not cry over it, he just kind of has an acceptance of this horrifying event. Billy can travel to the past and to the future in a blink of an eye. That is why I believe that Billy has an understanding towards a tragic event. He is able to see the bad events in his life before it really happens to him. Therefore he knows it will happen and there is nothing he can do about it accept to accept it and move on. Billy can travel from World War II to when he is an optometrist in 1967. He travels to the past and future many times throughout the book, when he was a child, when he was in the war, or after the war. He has also seen his death many times.Kurt Vonnegut, JR. creates this alien world where Billy is transported after he gets kidnapped by the aliens. This world was called Tralfadore. I believe that this world that Kurt Vonnegut, JR. creates is a replica of Billy's mind. I believe this because the people on Tralfadore have a great acceptance towards events that happened. The only concept Billy doesn't have is that everything and every event was structured to be and you cannot change that.I believe that Slaughterhouse-Five is a great book and it states its moral well. I would recommend this book to people who want to learn good and interesting concepts and lessons in life."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Sorry folks. not a big deal here. 3 star on yet another so called brilliant &quot;classic&quot;. Thematic parts are good but the main character &quot;billy pilgrim&quot; is boring and this book doesnt seem to be going anywhere even when giving respect to the story and those who perished in Dresden..then it ends. Nothing earth shaking happens in this book in theme, style or story."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughterhouse Five is one of many novels we have from the World War II period, joining such other bestsellers as Jones' The Thin Red Line and Mailer's The Naked and the Dead. Like these, Slaughterhouse Five makes a contrarian, rather stupid implication: that is, World War II was useless, senseless and ignoble. Younger readers and undergrads especially will buy into the subtext. Nevertheless, to Vonnegut's credit, he has created an intriguing and lively absurdist tale with Billy Pilgrim.Unfortunately, the reality of World War II was quite the opposite of the themes in Slaughterhouse Five. Pearl Harbor, the Holocaust and Nazism are words that come to mind when I think of why World War II was fought. Like Jones and Mailer, Vonnegut has discovered that if one takes any human act and removes all historical context, it will then seem senseless and absurd. Vonnegut himself must have realized that at some point in the writing, and those omissions are what make Slaughterhouse Five spurious. Hence the two stars. It is 'pretty' to think war is useless, but in the real world war is sometimes a necessity. Consult the track record. Take 'poo-tee-weet' with a grain of salt.With that said, the book mixes up an interesting concoction of science fiction, humor, autobiography, history (however narrowed the scope), and clear writing. Millions of high schoolers read Slaughterhouse Five annually, but that probably owes more to our mainstream counterculture attitudes than any literary merit. It probably will not endure past the next century or so, but in the meantime Slaughterhouse Five is worth the read. For World War II readers, I recommend Erich Maria Remarque's A Time To Love And A Time To Die...a superior novel."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"At my age (60) I have outgrown this type of stream of conscience anti-war pulp.

Now that I have summers off I thought I would go back and read a classic. And so it goes. Well, I will tell you that I was disappointed. I mean how could it be that I just did not see why others have so cherished about this book. I guess it was that its anti-war theme was so pedestrian that it was rather boring. Truly, boring. Maybe he was the first to do this without the over the top deep thinking, but at this point it was plain boring. It is easy to read and understand, but the aliens and flashbacks, ruined it for me.

Kurt's casual style of writing appeals to college students like me. His time-travel, interweaving-plots style of writing makes you want to keep on reading. It's just like a Star Wars movie (by the way, I think this novel would make a pretty good movie, too)!

I have been a teacher now for the last five years and needless to say every year Slaughterhouse Five has been the book my pupils have had to read? Why, simply because to me it is the best book to come out of the second World War. It has the grotesqueness of Kozinski's The Painted Bird and the way in which the narrative is conveyed is absolutely brilliant and the story never gets boring.

I picked it up mostly because it was there, and I had vaguely heard of it before. Normally, I don't like stuff that talks about aliens and other planets and such. But I managed to overcome that prejudice here (really only a fraction of this book is science fiction anyway). While so much science fiction is an escape to a false reality, this book speaks the truth about the real world. This book is full of truths. But you should discover them yourself. Vonnegut has something important to say, and he says it well. Can't ask for much more than that."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"A very original book.

I believe that a good part of the book was written with Vonegut's emotional memories as an eyewitness. At a recent speech Vonegut was asked by a member of the crowd, &quot; what benefited you most from the bombings of Dresdon?&quot; His reply was, &quot; I made about 500,000 dollars, thats about two dollars for every person killed&quot;.

NO, we are not just pawns. We do have some control over our lives and our fates are not pre-known (we do not jump around in time so we have no idea what is going to happen to us in the future).

THIS BOOK RULES AND I RECOMEND ALL HIS OTHER BOOKS AS WELL."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"The book that I read was &quot;Slaughter-House-Five&quot; by Kurt Vonnegut. It is a fictional story about a man named Billy Pilgrim. Billy experiences many interesting things throughout his life. They range from being a husband and a father of two children, to being a prisner of war. Throughout the book he meets many people from all over the world. He also believes that he had lived on the planet Tralfamadore.&quot;Slaughter-House-Five&quot; was a real attention grabber. I had no problems getting into the story. On the other hand, this was not my favorite book to read. Throughout the book you feel lost in Billy's time travles. Different events or people that he meets, would spark his memory and the book's setting would change. For example, Billy would be talking about the war with someone and all of the sudden, he is back on his honey moon with his wife. In another Billy fell asleep and he would be back on the train in the war. These are just a few of the plot's twists. I found this organizational structure difficult to follow.Secondly, the grusome details and language that was used to describe Billy Pilgrim's life in the book,was not only un-necessary but very explicit. For example, when Billy was on Tralfamadore with Montana Wildgack,Kurt Vonnegut explained what happened between them in great detail. To many details were also given when the book described Billy's wedding night. With less detail and language the story would have been just as effective. It also would appeal to more readers of different ages.Even though the book was not my favorite, it had some great aspects. The description and personality anyalisis of the characters were amazing. It made the reader feel as thoughthey knew the character. Such as Edgar Derby. He was a high school teacher. when you first meet him, he does not seem very brave but, as you read on , you realize that he is not as cowderly as first suspected.I think that Kurt Vonnegut had something big going for him with this book. &quot;Slaughter-House-Five&quot; would appeal to an older and mature audience. This is not a book for everyone. I guess it is just on of those thing that you either love or hate. This book opened my eyes to the events in my own life. It also made me realize no matter how bad my life is, it can always get worse."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This book was required reading for my teen. Although the book may have literary merit I found references to bestiality, torture and gore inappropriate for a required book."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"\\"Slaughter House five\\" by Kurt Vonnegut a story about a Writer attempting to write a story about his experience as a prisoner of war at Slaughter house # 5 and the bombing of Dresden during World War 2. By page 29 or so He finishes his book and from this point you read his book. It is about Billy Pilgrim who was also in a POW in Dresden but Billy believes that he was abducted by aliens who experience life in the fourth dimension, translation, they experience time like a photo album, hence they feel all points of time are always in existence, time doesn't really pass, they can live at any point in their existence at any time. Billy learns to view time in this way and is constantly waking up at different points of his life. Of course he may just be going crazy. Many of his \\"Time traveling\\" and \\"alien abduction \\"ideas are quite similar to stories from a Sci-Fi novelist who he befriends after returning from Dresden.The Good: The book is well written, making it easy to read. Not a lot to expand upon, it was easy to read, wasn't boring even when a lot wasn't going on in the story.The Bad: Vonnegut (or his characters in this story) is a little left of center for me and this view came across in the book. Not that it ruined it but it was noticeable to me (which is to be expected as it is considered to be an anti war book). Lines like \\"I have also told them (his sons) not to work for companies which make massacre machinery, (Military equipment) and to express contempt for people who think we need machinery like that.\\" I noticed that the horror of Dresden was constantly mentioned. How they couldn't understand why the Amreicans had bombed it, but very little mentioned of how bad the German's and their concentration camps were. The story was a little sporadic as it bounces around from time to time but it didn't confuse as it explains what's going on.Overall not a bad read with the exception of its political standing (may be down your alley though). Was enjoyable and worth reading though I wasn't inspired to run out and read more of Vonnegut."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This book has been on my TBR list for a while, but I just recently got around to reading it. Now I'm wondering what all the hype is about.Slaughterhouse is marketed as an anti-war novel. Honestly, I don't see the point. The book is basically a disjointed narrative that follows Billy Pilgrim, a man unstuck in time.Much like The Time-Traveler's Wife, this book follows the main character as he hops through time. The problem with this book however is that there is nothing to tie the time lines together. There is no stability, just a jump from one time to another, to another, to another, and so it goes.Then the narrative \\"jumps the shark\\" by sending Billy not just through time, but space- to an alien planet in outer space.I can't see where the anti-war theme emerged or made a prominent statement. To me it just seems like an ad ploy to sell another book"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This is supposed to be a classic, and I finally got to around to reading it. I did not find it to be good satire, good science fiction or good anything. Not even a good read. Not particularly profound. It is graphic and profane at times. It is too cynical and defeatist for my taste. The point I got is: no sense in trying to change anything, things are going to happen the way they're going to happen and nothing is going to change them. The \\"war is bad\\" message in chapter one is lost in the confusion of the remaining chapters. I might have liked it better in college when being cynical and blase was cool.WARNING: SPOILERS AHEADThe story is mostly narrated from the point of view of Billy Pilgrim. The storyline goes something like this: Billy is drafted into service during WWII. His father dies while he is in training. He loses his mind less than a month after being put in the warzone (during the Battle of the Bulge), is taken prisoner, and is sent to Dresden as a prisoner of war a month before it is firebombed. He survives the firebombing, is put to work in the corpse mines in its aftermath, and is a prisoner there until the end of the war.The narrative is disjointed because it jumps to other points in Billy's life before and (mostly) after the war. A six page summary of his life at the beginning of chapter two helps the reader keep it straight. The rest of the story, as near as I could put it together, follows. Billy resumes his college education after his discharge from the army. He is briefly committed to an insane asylum near the end of college (the doctors attribute the breakdown to a couple instances of childhood trauma, not the war), and a fellow patient introduces him to the work of an obscure science fiction writer whose works influence his future delusions. He finishes school, gets married, becomes a successful and wealthy optometrist, and has two children. In 1964 he meets the obscure science fiction writer working in newspaper circulation (bullying paper boys and girl), and invites him to his 18th wedding anniversary. In 1968 he survives a plane crash that kills his father-in-law, and his wife dies of carbon monoxide poisoning when she reaches the hospital. That seems to be when the time traveling, alien abduction delusions begin and are interwoven into his memories; his daughter said he'd never mentioned alien abduction and time travelling before the crash. After he is released from the hospital, he sneaks off to New York City determined to tell his alien abduction story on TV. He picks up an article on a missing porn star whom he works into his delusion. He also picks up a couple books by the science fiction writer, which he works into his delusion. He gets on a radio program for a while but is kicked off during a commercial break when he starts talking about aliens. His daughter goes to New York and takes him home. Then he starts sending news article about aliens to New York. His daughter starts taking over his practice and his life because she assumes, probably correctly, that brain damage from the plane crash is making him delusional."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"...\\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" has it all. It's great. Ignore the handful of Amazon reviewers who dismiss the book as unserious. They must be nitwits or authority-groupies. The fact is that \\"Slaugtherhouse Five\\" has incredible moral force: if anyone earned the right to write a black comedy about the destruction of Dresden, it was Vonnegut, who lived through it as a POW. The book made a big impression on me at age 17 because it was so funny and irreverent. Now that I'm 50, I'm mainly blown away by the pain and sadness of the story. I finished \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" several days ago, but the memory of the cryptic opening words -- \\"Listen: Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time...\\" -- still makes the hair on my neck stand up. This is daring, essential 20th century fiction. Six stars."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Where to begin? I feel that many of the reviewers have already captured the essence of this novel, but I also feel compelled to add to it.. after all, how can one not?Typically, I have not been a fan of science fiction/fantasy books, but let me assure those of you who have not yet read this due to its label, it is far beyond and separated from novels in such a genre. I had heard of Kurt Vonnegut, but much to my present dismay, had distanced my literary choices from his work. That has forever changed.\\"Billy Pilgram\\" has left an impression on me that I may not be able to properly describe. He is painted to be such a simple and almost uneventful character, that you'd imagine this person to bore you to tears. However, you will learn that his life is far from simplicity and holds the burdens of heartbreak, insanity (or perhaps, just an overactive imagination that bleeds into his human character?), tolerance of negativities, and nonchalanticity (if I may create a word here), that entices the reader to feel those emotions as if their own. Billy Pilgram does not ever seem to be confused, regardless of his travels through time and the experiences he is driven to live. He is comfortable with what he is presented with, most likely due to the fact that he learns about fate and its inevitability. You'll find yourself questioning your previous interpretation on time, war, imagination/dreams, love...Although, coined into an anti-war mindset, it is not a novel that attempts to draw you into any specific stance. That aspect alone, is masterfully done. I wish authors of current affairs would be able to so delicately yet so simply describe their feelings without judgment, persuasion, or controversy.This tale will make you smile, laugh, frown, scratch your head.. The Works. You'll be pulled into another planet, a war, a marriage... and may come to the conclusion that time is what we make of it. It's an entity that we both take for granted and still ponder upon what to do with it. Fate, destiny, they are much larger than our ability to control, and often times, fighting it or attempting to counteract it, will only yield the same result in the end, after all. And so it goes. ;-)"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I saw this book on several different \`must read' lists and decided to see what the hype was all about. Vonnegut has a unique style of writing which keeps the reader on their toes. At first, his jumping around annoyed me until I got used to it. He has a vivid imagination which makes this book, and apparently all his books, that much more interesting. Many reviewers said that got a different perspective of World War II from this book, but I don't see how. It provides the slimmest of previews, but his description is insightful none the less. Apparently this is an anti-war book, but I feel his protests are too mild. I see him making points, especially with the Tralfamadores, but he could have voiced his opinion louder.I understand why it was on the banned list or why people object to it, but their protests are weak and unintelligent.With that said, I believe this is a necessary book for all to read and look forward to another Vonnegut book."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This wonderful snack of a book does so many things right. First, it is clear and concise. Second, the limited narrator is used excellently. Billy is nuts, as all of the talk about the Tralfamadorians demonstrates. But in telling us what these aliens believe and what they believe about humans, Billy is telling us quite a lot about how he has come to see humanity. Thus, we see ourselves in a new way. The atrocity at Dresden shocks but is handled without sentimentality. And so it goes becomes a little tedious and this very tedium is a metaphor, no that's not exactly right. The tedium is actually an example of how jaded and desensitized humans have become to the horror of war. The fact that most Americans don't even know that more died in Dresden than Hiroshima is another example of how jaded we've become. The book is great art with both content and style and it's packaged so that a public school 9th grader should be able to access it."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughterhouse-Five by Kurt Vonnegut was nominated for a best-novel Nebula Award and for a best-novel Hugo Award. Time magazine considers it one of the 100 all-time best English-language novels written since 1923. It is."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Adding my drop in the bucket of reviews:I enjoyed the book. It is insane at times, a little hard to follow, and leaves certain questions unanswered. But to me, these were all a part of the fun. It has an anti-war sentiment to it that doesn't leave the bitter taste of being preached at in your mouth. It mixes the grimmest of realities with outright science fiction in a way that makes it nearly believable.The book follows the life of Billy Pilgrim, a tall, odd, mentally unstable un-hero, as he jumps from one part of his life to the next. He spends time in a mental hospital, on his honeymoon, on another planet, drowning in a pool, but mostly, he spends it in Germany in WWII. As a chaplain's assistant, he is taken prisoner by the Germans and witnesses the bombing of Dresden.Billy is not brave. He is not strong. He is not particularly compassionate or kind. In some parts of the book, I outright hated him for his apathy. In others, I pitied him for his insanity. Overall, his story is just a narrative with no real emotion involved... But, I suppose, that was the intention.The story made me think. Made me consider everything from old wars to new ones, to time travel*, to family relations... And that is the most important thing to me in a book. I docked it one star because (though there's a reason for it) all of the violence and death made me uncomfortable. So it goes.*I might add that I like nearly every story involving time travel of some sort or another, and this makes me a little bit biased. It's the nerd in me coming out."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Time-travel and war: two concepts only the ingenious Kurt Vonnegut would incorporate into the same story. Although he introduces the book as a war story, Vonnegut has, in true postmodern style, managed to almost completely obfuscate the point by diverting the inattentive reader's attention to time travel and the fourth dimension. Albeit, the truly sagacious reader can pick up not only Vonnegut's alien-inspired theories about time, but also his earthling-motivated opinions about war. The self-proclaimed pacifist adheres to the tradition of using the pen to conquer the sword by equipping Slaughterhouse Five, the plaintive story of a soldier that was in Dresden during the firebombing of World War II, with heaping spoonfuls of philosophy and humor to help the realities go down.Vonnegut tells the life story of Billy Pilgrim the same way clouds cry and drop their tears: in so specific order whatsoever as to vivify our consciousness. That's where the time-travel and alien abduction comes in. No hyperbole. What else would you expect from \\"a master of contemporary American literature?\\" I wouldn't want to give too much away, but Pilgrim's pilgrimage through the iniquities of time, space, love and war leave him surprisingly without vehemence, despite seemingly endless exposure to contagion that often leaves the feckless hero lurid and not pristine. His indifference, surprisingly, induces in the reader a stronger aversion to war than an outright repugnance would have. Billy's ignominious war experience and illusory extra-terrestrial encounter leaves the reader with an overwhelming influx of information from which he or she has the opportunity to withdraw any of many possible interpretations of war and life thereafter.These interpretations, as well as the one to five star ratings, depend on the amount and quality of erudition possessed by the reader. For myself, Slaughterhouse earns four stars. As a fairly intelligent and advanced high school student, I can appreciate Vonnegut's literary creativity in writing style in plot, but some of his finer and more profound statements on war and life that everyone raves about go right over my head, even though I know it's there somewhere! For a truly scholarly adult or college student, Slaughterhouse probably holds one more star for greater meaning and clarity. A less intelligent or perceptive adult or student may only award three stars. Yet I refuse to believe that even the dullest intellect could award less than that. Vonnegut's most obvious statements are delivered with inescapable hilarity and wit, even if the more subtle hints between the lines are almost evanescent. There will be a moment for every and any reader, no matter the intellect or age, between finishing the book and reflecting on its meanings, when all that resounds in their minds is all they really need to take from Slaughterhouse Five: the unique feeling that accompanies the completion of any great work of art: \\"po-tee-weet?\\""},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Kurt Vonnegut's picaresque prose lacks parity with any mainstream literature. His unique style is inundated with seemingly random circumstances that are simply dripping with deeper meaning. Slaughter House Five is most closely identified as an anti-war novel because of its intimate descriptions of the Dresden fire-bombings. Much like critically acclaimed novel, The Things They Carried, Vonnegut takes a more personal approach to his overall work of fiction. Vonnegut devotes numerous pages to the back story of his decision to write what he calls his, \\"Dresden novel\\" which is told in the first person, yet the other side to the novel is the narrative of the life of Billy Pilgrim presumably the fictional representation of the author. Changing perspective and the clever fusion of reality with blatantly fictional additions to the storyline make slaughter-House five a work of literary genius.Vonnegut breaks the monotony of literary single-point perspective and uses the change from a more personal account of events to a narration of the more ethereal plot progressions to make his novel both personal and at the same time intensely metaphorical. The start of the novel is primarily a first person account of Vonnegut's struggle to come to terms with his experiences in Dresden and finally sit down and write a novel that adequately addressed his experiences. The outcome of his decade long struggle was his ground-breaking novel, Slaughterhouse Five and the extra time that was taken is apparent in the refined nature of the novel. Vonnegut uses the majority of the novel to develop the story of his literary incarnation, Billy Pilgrim from the third person. The story of Billy Pilgrim presumably follows the story of Vonnegut's experiences in WWII however; the story of Billy Pilgrim has some important fictional qualities which make up the largest part of the novels metaphorical quality. As one reviewer aptly stated, \\"Billy Pilgrim's odyssey through time reflects the mythic journey of our own fractured lives as we search for meaning in what we are afraid to know.\\" The story of Billy Pilgrim reflects not only our own voyages through time but more importantly, Vonnegut's and it is this infusion of the narration of Vonnegut's personal struggle to come to terms with Dresden that makes this novel one for the ages.Slaughterhouse Five open's the eyes to the unseen atrocities of war and allows for even the most distant reader to become sympathetic to the effects of war on the body, soul, and mind. This novel challenges the reader to take a journey into the depths of their own mind and to find those things that they struggle to understand. Vonnegut's challenge to the reader has more sway because of the way he demonstrates his personal struggle with understanding the Dresden massacre. Without Vonnegut's narration of his own struggle with Dresden, Slaughterhouse Five would remain significant as an anti-war novel, but with his personal account this novel touches the heart and mind of any who are willing to let the novel challenge their way of thinking."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"At first it is difficult to imagine that a story about a phlegmatic man who experiences a horrific firestorm attack in Dresden, while a POW, and communes with aliens can have any literary significance. Its value is even more questionable by the seemingly haphazard lack of sequencing of the protagonist's, Billy Pilgrim, experiences and encounters. Part way through the story, there is a sense that Billy and the aliens colluded to confuse the reader, and that the author's errant mind wandered to the point of grouping a series of chaotic, non-sequential events for the purpose of filling up the pages. However, the vigilant reader will observe and glean that the author has an intended message delivered by a circuitous route. Therefore, this book merits a five star rating for literary importance.Through the somewhat quixotic life of Billy Pilgrim, the author addresses the fundamental notion of survival - whether it is physical or mental continued existence. Billy Pilgrim from the beginning is thrown into a world in which he senses and is aware of people's disapprobation of him. He is painted as a weakling, who is ill-fitting, unprepared, nave and hardly an errant hero. However, Billy Pilgrim has unwittingly learned a profound and valuable ability; he has mastered a coping mechanism that is essential to his survival.There is a certain degree of irony in the story, because Billy Pilgrim's life is convoluted and bizarre, yet this outrageous crazy-like behavior gives him a sense of sanity. One can't help but to laugh aloud when reading about Billy Pilgrim's encounter with the aliens, his sexual mating at the aliens' zoo with a movie star, and his insightful understanding of the Tralfamadorians' concept and belief in a fourth dimension. However, a sense of pride is developed for Billy Pilgrim as he uses this new understanding of time, believing that events repeatedly occur at a different time and place, in order to accept the difficult, sad and horrific events in his life; he is coping. Occasionally, he struggles with the overwhelming impact of his life experiences and he has a nervous breakdown. However, those breakdowns are used to illustrate the value of the belief in the fourth dimension and his acute sense of survival.The author's seemingly jumbled delivery of Billy Pilgrim's experiences and significant life events serves to illustrate the insanity that provoks the protagonist to give up. Throughout the story there are snapshots of both the author's and Billy Pilgrim's lives. They are like small swatches of fabric, with different patterns, and no connections. However, when pieced together they create a purposeful quilt that recounts difficult events in both Billy Pilgrim's and the author's lives, their apparent struggles, and their resolve to cope and survive."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five was written in 1969, in the middle of the Vietnam War. However, his story is not directly about Vietnam, but about his own war experience during World War II. Although it is an anti-war book its purpose is not to stop war, but to expose it and its terrible effects. His style both aids and hinders in creating the effects of frustration and understanding he wants from his readers.Vonnegut always wanted to write a book about his experience of the Dresden bombings. He was finally able to write this story during the Vietnam War. Vonnegut was always frustrated with the fact that people named World War II the \\"Good War\\" and he makes this point in his sardonic account of the war. His purpose is not to try and stop the war in Vietnam; he simply wants people to understand that no war is good. As Tim O'Brien says, \\"war is just another name for death\\". Obvious right? Not always. Some people's perceptions of war are that it is a glamorous experience full of brave, strong, and morally driven soldiers.Vonnegut stabs all common war misconceptions through the heart as he reveals the ridiculous nature of war. He introduces his main character Billy Pilgrim as a ribald. Before the war he studies to be an optometrist and is then shipped off to war and proves useless. He is opiated by his war experiences and is ready to die, but his fellow soldier, Roland Weary, will not give up on this pathetic excuse for a soldier. They are then captured by Germans and ironically Weary dies, but Pilgrim lives. When Billy returns home after the war he says that he is abducted by Tralfamdorians (a group of aliens) and he begins to be able to travel fluidly throughout time. The book is comprised of flashes forward and backward in time in no apparent pattern. Billy is obviously experiencing the effects of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, which was and is a huge problem for anyone who experiences the atrocities of war. This ridiculous person that Billy becomes shows the terrible effects war can have. Other such examples of the ludicrous nature of war are seen throughout the book and with the characterization of the soldiers. Vonnegut depicts the Germans as the most sophisticated and \\"good\\" group out of all the other soldiers from different nations. The Allies are either depicted as weak and diffident(Americans) or pompous(British). Ironically, the one American soldier who is consistently seen as a good and strong man is shot by a firing squad in Dresden for taking an abandoned teapot in the middle of all the destruction. You can almost hear Vonnegut saying something along the lines of, \\"That's war for you!\\"This shockingly blas&eacute; style is one of the ways that Vonnegut makes his readers understand the preposterous tendencies of war. Vonnegut constantly repeats certain key phrases throughout the book. The most striking one is, \\"so it goes\\". This is a phrase and idea that Billy Pilgrim learned from the Trafalmadorians. Whenever someone dies this phrase is repeated, which turns out to be quite a lot in a war story. By the end of the book the reader just wants to yell \\"No! People dying matters! It is not a \\"so it goes\\" kind of thing\\". Vonnegut's purposeful use of litotes in order to get the reader angry is very effective, while some of his other strategies are not. The constant time travel that Billy Pilgrim experiences throughout the book is very distracting. Although it is supposed to exemplify the confusion and PTSD of the soldiers, it often makes the reader feel nonplussed. Vonnegut is also very anticlimactic. This whole story is leading up to the bombing of Dresden and it really only takes up a very short portion of the book, like a side note to the real story. His purpose here is to again make the reader understand that nothing can really be said about tragedy. However he tends to lose his message along the way."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This is typically the first novel of Vonnegut's that most people are exposed to, mainly due to required reading lists. I revisited this novel years later (now at age 32) and I must say that I found the novel even more enjoyable today than I did before.Basically the novel centers around this idea: what is crazier - the incredible and tragic bombing of a largely civilian population in Dresden in World War 2, or the belief of being abducted by aliens and put in a human 'zoo'? As you read on, often you start thinking that the alien abduction seems the less far fetched event. A testament to the futility and horror of war.Amazing! If you haven't read it in years you should revisit this book."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I love this book!Slaughterhouse Five is brilliantly written. Vonnegut is a master, distorting the format and genre of the novel into something baroque and complex while charismatically keeping the experience light and readable. Although you can tell the author is a bit curmudgeonly, it is his outstanding sense of humanity that raises this book from casual entertainment to a profound and important focal point for the introspection of our entire species.This quote in particular filled me with hope:\\"I have told my sons that they are not under any circumstances to take part in massacres, and that the news of massacres of enemies is not to fill them with satisfaction or glee. I have also told them not to work for companies which make massacre machinery, and to express contempt for people who think we need machinery like that.\\""},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"War is squalid, mocks our humanity, and is as tragic as it is senseless. Sometimes, it is most senseless to those who are asked to fight it. Little more than children, those who survive carry the horrid memories of it for the rest of their lives. Only those who can approach life with a short-term perspective that revels in moment can endure the threat of its impending presence. Enter the Tralfamadorians.Such are the many themes in Vonnegut's renowned novel about a man losing his grip on reality while trying to reconcile his memories of war. Forced to march through Germany dressed like a clown, Billy Pilgrim (whose first name \\"Billy\\" makes him easier to relate to and whose surname \\"Pilgrim\\" is apparently a play on Bunyan's famous allegory) is the vehicle for Vonnegut's fatalistic viewpoint, which is amplified by the more than a hundred repetitions of his quip \\"so it goes.\\" As a reluctant participant in its cruelties, Pilgrim endures what the war throws at him only to have it get him in the end. So it goes.Compact but deceptively deep, one need not agree with the book's messages to appreciate it. With only this simple aim in mind when stepping into this book a few hours ago, I step away seeing how it became an American classic. For that, though not persuaded by Vonnegut's fatalistic notions, I'm satisfied."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This book was so hard to put down. It is definitely a must read for any and everyone. I loved it!"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I'm not sure how I missed reading Vonnegut churning through the educational system and several English courses and years later but here I am in mid-life reading the guy for the first time. Joseph Heller's Catch-22 happens to be one of my favorite novels of all times in the history of ever, which \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" is often compared to. Their similarities lie in being unconventional non-linear plots, absurdism throughout, and both making a strong case to the futility and unavoidability of war. Great stuff.\\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" is short, very readable and poignant. Billy Pilgrim, the main character, threads throughout his life to major and minor events with the help of an alien abduction of sorts to allow him to begin to make some sense of it all. The sense he gains after experiencing many things like surviving the fire bombing of Dresden from the ground as a prisoner of war, the death of a wife, the imprisonment with an actress/supermodel in an alien zoo of sorts is two things, after death and destruction birds still sing and the best we can hope for is offered in the serenity prayer. \\"God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to always tell the difference.\\"Vonnegut has a way of drawing the reader in and proved through the living of his life that he was a humanist above all else, one who resisted the inaneness of certain parts of warfare while acknowledging it's unavoidability. I finally got to \\"Slaughterhouse Five,\\" through the dead and dying on the vine DFW Rogue Book Club. It's a great book club read but you'll just have to find some folks who actually read it and discuss it.

(ie. alien abductions are so cliche these days)- As with other notable humans in the past, Vonnegut seems to be mistaken by his followers as being a god."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"As one of the most acknowledged anti-war novels of the modern day, Kurt Vonnegut's novel Slaughterhouse-Five lives up to the recognition that it receives. The compelling anti-war story, published in 1969, is portrayed through Billy Pilgrim and his assortment of stories he reminisces upon throughout the novel. Vonnegut uses the zany Pilgrim to illustrate aspects such as life and death, time travel, and his supposed journey to the planet of Tralfamador. The story is based around Billy Pilgrim, a World War II veteran who survived the Dresden bombing. Vonnegut sporadically takes the reader through different parts of Pilgrim's life, leaping between time periods and events. Pilgrim's inability to control his own mind creates an extremely nonlinear plotline split up into small groups of flashbacks in his life. His flashback consist of his recollection of his schooling at University of Chicago, his occupation as an optometrist, his voyage to the far away planet of Tralfamador, his daily life as a father of two and an average man, and his memories of war, most importantly his time as a prisoner of war.Vonnegut uses these events to make deep statements about the destruction caused by war. During the chaos created by the erratic nature of the book, Pilgrim never fails to return to a common situation that he suffered during World War II. He often finds himself in a meat refrigerator, attempting to stay alive while the city above is suffering the fiery storm brought upon by the famous fire bombings at Dresden. This frequent recollection refers to the never ending destruction caused by war.Pilgrim also finds himself being kidnapped by aliens native to the planet of Tralfamador. He is influenced greatly by the Tralfamadorians, and takes on their indifferent opinion about death. The aliens believe in the moment rather than the lifetime, creating this indifference, and they also make the reader doubt the truth about free will, and its nonexistence in life. Pilgrim's attitude transformation finds his own free will taken away many times throughout the book. The exotic planet's overall attitude towards life also gives reason for the episodic structure of the book.Embedded in the deep statements made by Vonnegut about war and life in general, there is a considerable amount of comedic irony, making the book an enjoyable experience to read. Vonnegut's messages throughout the book pertain to human nature and should not be ones which are passed over by anyone.In my opinion, this novel will be read for many years to come because of Vonnegut's powerful messages about life. Slaughterhouse-Five was the first book that I have read by him, and I plan to read many more in the future. The novel is similar to Joseph Heller's Catch-22, so if you are into well used comedic irony in war stories, Slaughterhouse-Five will surely be one of your favorites (as well as Catch-22)."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Vonnegut's story of Billy Pilgrims struggle with his post-war life really shows the reader how much someone can be effected by the evils waged on both sides of the war.Vonnegut captures the psychological effect of World War Two with Billy Pilgrims life."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Kurt Vonnegut's SLAUGHTERHOUSE-FIVE is an anti-war novel mixed with outlandish ideas and lots of satire.

Reading this book was sort of like becoming re-acquainted with an old friend. Although I had remembered how inventive, creative and simultaneously sweet and cynical Vonnegut's books were, I had forgotten how much fun they were to read. Similar themes tend to pop up in Vonnegut's novels: the twisted ridiculousness of war, religion and human nature being the most persistent. However, at his best he seems to rise above cynicism and actually offer somewhat optimistic insight into the human condition, although it's often so concealed in humor and fantasy that you might not even realize that you've been hit with something profound. In \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\", the aliens who kidnap Billy Pilgrim can see all of time as clearly as we can see the horizon. Since the future is so clear and fixed to them, they advise Billy simply to \\"look at the things you like and don't look at the things you don't.\\" For an American Science Fiction writer, it's a curiously Eastern way of thinking."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This was my first read of Vonnegut. I had heard much about this novel, and finally got around to reading it. His book seems to go out of its way to display the fractured and dissembled nature that war brings to individuals. Billy Pilgrim's chaotic and disorganized state of going from one place to the next is a testament to how control is seriously lacking in war times. Billy experiences this in many different times and transformations, as he travels back in time to the war, then reverts even further back, and then finally to his time after the bombing of Dresden. The insanity of war is akin to Billy's losing touch at many points; the horrific massacre at Dresden is the reference point for this madness. Still, as we look at the book from the point of view of Billy, by novel's end, we realize that he is just one example.As many others have alluded to, Slaughter House Five takes a very serious subject, with disturbing images and negative aspects, and seems to make them matter-of-fact and nondescript. The understated tone, such as using the phrase \\"So it goes\\" every time death is mentioned, makes for black humor. In a way the entire book can be considered an oxymoron, as much of what Billy experiences (comrades dying, his wife's accident, being taken prisoner by aliens from Tralfamadore, having to dig through corpses) is written in a comically tragic way.There also seems to be a point made about humanity's lack of control in events. Lack of control is a constant theme in the novel. At one point, Billy questions one of the Tralfamadorians about the violent ways of humans; their response is to imply that it is a silly question because there is nothing anyone can do about it, even if it is a future event. Billy seems to also become frustrated with the various haphazard leaps in time, to which he has no control. Ironically, much of what is taking place in the \\"real world\\" is also uncontrollable. Fate seems to rule all, even though this seems to be an illogical excuse for events. Free will becomes an illusion.In this way, appearance and reality are mixed up. Perhaps this is why Vonnegut begins the novel, \\"All this happened, more or less. The war parts, anyway, are pretty much true.\\" There is an understated explanation for the course of events, despite the fact that many of them are true and seem real. Despite what we think of whether Billy is completely crazy, there is much reality to what he goes through. Vonnegut is a master at making a satire of these experiences. Clearly his intent was to make a statement about the effects war has on individuals.As far as reading goes, this was a quick read because it is quite original and unique. At times, it can be strangely disjointed, which may make it hard to follow; I found myself wanting to go back and try to figure out where he was going. Still, it is entertaining. I'm not sure I'd just recommend this to anyone, but if you like dark humor, then this is probably the way to go."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"A colorful exposition, and to some point biographical in nature, offering a glimpse of WWII, aliens, and time travel."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I picked this up recently on sale at the local bookstore after hearing the named buzzed around a bit lately. I dived into the book not quite sure to expect, thinking I might be ending up with a war novel that might be a little to much John Wayne. As the book clearly points out in the begining, in this novel about war, and many, many other things, there is no room for John Wayne or Dean Martin when the movie version comes around. However, there is a very, dare I say unique storyline? Alot of inventiveness in style and in ideas. The author is clearly the rightful owner of more cleverness than the ordinary person could ever hope to handle.I obviously loved it, I thought about it while walking around at night, while talking about other things to people, while sleeping and at work. Because the world of moments Vonnegut creates is just so damn interesting. I had to pinch myself 100 times afterwards to remind myself i'm broke and that I can't go and buy any more of the authors work right now.Buy it, read it, love it, irritate your friends by suggesting it, then re-read it."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five is a fantastic book. The author's delicate sense of satirical humor and suave writing makes the book very readable. It's truly a masterpiece as Vonnegut managed to take a very serious topic--the bombing of Dresden--and make it accessible to the general reading public.As I enjoyed the book immensely, I only have one complaint: it wasn't long enough! I would have gladly enjoyed reading another hundred pages and possibly a little more about Dresden."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Well-read in the Vonnegut oeuvre, I somehow had missed SLAUGHTERHOUSE-FIVE and, put in the mood for an anti-war book by the relentless news from Iraq, I remedied that this week. Unfortunately, readers the world over recently lost Kurt Vonnegut (and so it goes); reading this book makes me miss him more than ever.What's most amazing is how the book slides through time and space effortlessly and without distracting the reader. No one's about to condemn it for its \\"episodic\\" nature, in other words. Beyond Billy Pilgrim, there are no important characters... just this looming presence of unstoppable, unexplainable, unethical authority. That can be government, the military, or a single person (a whole cavalcade of them come and go in Billy's life). For instance, how powerful is it that few Americans -- even among the most educated -- realize that the bombing of Dresden, Germany, killed more people than the bombing of Hiroshima, Japan. The German civilians were torched with \\"conventional\\" weapons. The Japanese, of course, with an atomic bomb (\\"unconventional\\" weaponry?).And so it goes.Included in this classic-for-a-reason anti-war book is the high arc of Vonnegut's signature humor and creativity. Billy Pilgrim is kidnapped by extraterrestrials from Tralfamadore. They know a thing or two about life (it goes on) and death (it doesn't). Somehow the mix of horrifying history, science fiction, and pitifully funny (humorously pitiful?) morality tale come together like a symphonic orchestra made up of disparate parts. Only Vonnegut, it would seem, could pull it off.Inspired by World War II, given momentum by Vietnam, and kept aflame by Iraq, SLAUGHTERHOUSE-FIVE will never lose relevance because it hinges on the absurdity that is man and his addiction to power and war. Like Billy Pilgrim, it will slide through time and space effortlessly and forever."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Great story. If you're one of those people who has a hard time understanding books that are out of the ordinary, don't buy this book because the storyline is a bit odd. Wonderful read though."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"If anyone ever set out to write a comic, anti-war, Sci-Fi modern classic I am pretty certain they would have failed miserably. But this is what Vonnegut has done, and he has succeeded.This is a short and powerful book. Vonnegut introduces it with a chapter about how he came to write the book, and then tells us how it begins and how it ends. In doing so he establishes an important point. The events in the book are to be viewed from a Tralfamadorian perspective. These aliens see all time in a single moment. Death is immaterial to them because existence is not linear, so you always exist, even after your temporal death.So the events in the novel follow no chronology. They leap from 1960's America to the planet of Tralfamadore at any time, and back to the war in 1944, and back earlier, and forward later. The hero of the piecel, if he can be called that, is Billy Pilgrim, an american soldier in the Second World War, an optometrist after the war who is rich because he marries the fat daughter of a wealthy Optometrist. She marries him despite the fact that he is a psychiatric patient suffering a nervous breakdown because of the war, or because of college stress, or because his father threw him in the deep end of the pool.Their son is a troublesome boy, who straightens himself out, joins the Green Berets, goes to Vietnam and contributes to the good of society by killing Vietnamese.Vonnegut finds the absurd and the funny in the most mundane of normality. And because of this he constantly surprises the reader. The items Pilgrim finds in the coat in the war are a case in point. A diamond (that goes into his engagement ring) and a denture, which he keeps. One is as arbitrary as the other in value terms. Whereas his companion is shot by firing squad for &quot;looting&quot; a teapot in Dresden.This is a short and easy read, but do not be deceived. It is a terse and concentrated work of art, that will yield returns to the careful reader long after you put it down."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughterhouse Five is Vonnegut's magnum opus. At his best his strange worlds contains deeply humanistic themes and even at his worst Vonnegut is a very readable writer weaving higher themes in a deceptively simplistic style.Written as a reflection of the horror he witnessed while a POW during the bombing of Dresden, Vonnegut viewed this novel as a cathardic artistic release. Like most of his novels on the surface it seems a cartoonlike simplistic story. And as with most of his books beneath this exterior lay common Vonnegut themes. It's only at the end when we realize how the main character's experience at Dresden is the cause of his \\"alien visitations\\".Vonnegut's message is clear, at least for Billy: One person is pwerless to change things in this world and the best one can dois to focus on the good things. It's a deeply pessemistic view, adn Vonnegut has always acknowledged this viewpoint. But read on another level it's about the effect of war on the human psyche. One either faces its stupidity, acknowledges the pain and sufering or one becomes life Billy and finds other means to cope.Slaughterhouse Five is a great read and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This book is not a typical book I would read. I wish I could say I gave it a try in order to expand my horizons and sample something different, but I started reading it out of boredom. At first I thought whoever wrote this book must have been on some major drugs, but as I started to get more into it, I realize that the book has a deeper message.The book describes the events during the Dresden bombing through the eyes of Billy Pilgrim, a simple man, who invents a very differnt way of dealing with things. Billy Pilgrim struck me as one of the happiest people on earth. I realize that this might not be the conventinal view, but who wouldn't want to be able to escape troubles of this life by travelling through time to better, more peacefull days? I was suprised that this book made me think (given it's weird events and almmost sci-fi feel, which is usualy not my thing) and that's really all that matters. I might forget the story one day, but this book's alternative views on war, life and death will definitelly stick with me."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This is an excellent book that examines the nature of war, its horrors, both psychological and physical, and about Time Travel and Tralfamadore. Whether or not Billy's experiences there are real or not is open to interpretation, it is just an extension of showing his isolation.This book follows no plot and is continually switching time periods. It allows Vonnegut to make his book as diametrically opposite from any other war novel as possible. The very structure of the book seems to deemphasize war. In effect, this makes the story a strange and wonderful creation, needless to say powerful. The story follows Billy Pilgrim (note the name: it is critical to two aspects of his character). Pilgrim is an awkward young man sent to fight in World War II. Yet, the story also follows his experiences in a hospital after the war with an old eccentric named Rosewater, his experience as an opthomologist, his relationship with his family, and, finally, his delusions of Tralfamadore. Certain aspects are included later, such as his dad throwing him into a YMCA swimming pool.This is a novel where nothing is as it seems. At first, it looks as if Billy is doing fine after the war. He lives comfortably, has a profitable practice, and seems happy. Yet, he is tormented by many things, experiences he can't get over, and finally the Tralfamadore visions. A masterfully written novel by Vonnegut."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I would agree with the other reviews that say this book reminds them of Douglas Adams (or maybe Monty Python). Phrases are repeated and things that seem to make no sense initially, come back later for some humorous irony. Also, in typical Vonnegut style, there are no heroes or villains, and no punch-lines.I also enjoyed the author's unusual directness and honesty. If you are fortunate enough to read the version of this book which contains the author's introduction; Vonnegut writes,&quot;The Dresden atrocity, tremendously expensive and meticulously planned, was so meaningless, finally, that only one person on the entire planet got any benefit from it. I am that person. I wrote this book, which earned a lot of money for me in royalties and made my reputation, such as it is. One way or another, I got two or three dollars for every person killed. Some business I'm in.&quot;Ironically, the book that was supposed to be about the firebombing of Dresden, contains very little information regarding the actual event. Vonnegut who witnessed the event first hand, admits that he had the intention of writing this fabulous book as soon as he returned from the war. However, he states that he just didn't have enough material for a book. Twenty-five years later he produces a masterpiece!This is a short book and requires little investment to enjoy. I would recommend reading it in one sitting so that the many ironies are not lost. Well worth the effort."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"after reading cat's cradle and especially sirens of titan, i was expecting to love slaughter house 5.

This novel left me feeling the exact same way. The whole time I kept thinking if I just get through this next chapter I am sure I will begin to see the magic. Never happened. The few pages he actually spent on the war were excellent. The dull sci-fi story that takes up the vast majority of the book were not.

Now I know why. After reading it in a matter of days, I walked away very pleased and eager to read more books by Vonnegut. Although it is not my all-time favorite novel (that label belongs to John Steinbeck's ingenious &quot;Grapes of Wrath&quot;), &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; is without a doubt the craziest and most abstract novel I've ever read.The story is about Billy Pilgrim who is &quot;unstuck in time&quot; and can travel to his past or future. There is no order in the story whatsoever, in fact it is quite chaotic... which is why it is such a fun read. It does have anti-war elements in it, but I wouldnt say that it is the overriding theme of the novel (although the part of the book where Billy watches a war movie backwards points out the absurdity of war). What Billy learns from the Tralfamadorians (the alien civilization that abducts Billy) is just as important of a theme.Well after I finished this novel, I ordered &quot;Cat's Cradle&quot;. I'm halfway through it right now and it is just as impressive. I suggest you pick up one of these two books immediately."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"One of the things that I love about Slaughterhouse Five (and many of Vonnegut's other books as well) is how the sci-fi elements are there, but they are not the focal point of the story, nor of the characters.The sheer mention of Tralfamadore rockets this novel into the classification of science fiction. Yet, despite the \\"popping between time\\" of Pilgrim that tries to defy a physical setting, the story remains solidly anchored within an emotional setting: the bombing of Dresden (WWII), which keeps everything in perspective. Tralfamadore, and many of the \\"non-linear\\" qualities of the story could as easily be the creation and fixation of a weakened mind, just as much as they could be (?) real. You never know. Vonnegut always keeps you guessing.SH-5 is a great introduction to Vonnegut. If you enjoy this one, I would recommend moving in either one of two ways: for those who liked the character elements and emotional qualities, move to \\"Bluebeard\\". For those who were more intrigued by Pilgrim's temporal displacement, try \\"The Sirens of Titan\\" next."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"First of all, I'd like to say that I'd give this book four and a half stars if I could, it's funny but deals with serious subjects. Slaugtherhouse-Five foucus on the life of Billy Piligrim, a quite timid,man who is able to travel through time to different points in his life. Billy jumps from being a POW, like Vonnegut, to a sucsessful optometrist, to a human being in an alien zoo. Much of the book focuses on Billy as a POW who was a survivor of the fire-bombing of Dresden. After the war, Billy becomes sucsessful, but begins to mentally fall apart, he doesn't like his wife and is not close to his children. When the aliens from Tralfamadore capture Billy they explain all moments, past, present, and future, are structerd and cannot be changed so he accepts all that has happend. One aspect of the book I like is that you can see how things Billy has already seen in the future effect his life in the past and vice-versa. This funny look at the life of a mentally deteriorating man and many aspects of culture is defently worth a read."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This book probably is becoming more relevant in times like this where we need to think about why war exists and why it is so common between civilizations. If it's something that no one wants to happen then why does it happen so often. In the conflict with Iraq in the Spring of 2003 the opinions are split by two fervently polar sides. This book was written in the midst of the Vietnam War at the height of popular disapproval of ongoing death of troops and destruction of property which were lost for no apparent reason.Vonnegut I thought took a good approach with the book's subject material. The book doesn't naturally talk about Vietnam which was naturally going to be admonished by one side and raved by the other or hating by both should the book be perceived as sitting on the fence. He drew from his experiences of war from the bombing of Dresden to described the relevant events of Billy Pilgrim's, the hapless main character's, life. The bombing of Dresden was the most devastating operation by the American forces upon a German city. But its not just this that makes the book good and its not just about the bombing in Dresden as the book spans the whole adult life of Pilgrim. From the start the book tells you that the book is written in a &quot;schizophrenic&quot; form that bounces Pilgrim back an forth through his life in the form of a stream of consciousness. As the character experiences a certain emotion or speaks upon a certain subject, he switches into a different point in his life where he's experienced (or will experience) something similar. This happens often within chapters and yet it is not confusing. Ironically you'll also come out with a sedate feeling if you understand the point of the author and the quotes from reviewer of the book will make more sense the next time you read them on the front and back cover after reading this book. The book was entertaining as well as memorable and philosophical. I include memorable because Vonnegut creates passages that talk about an idea or a thing and that idea or thing becomes a symbol for something. When the author recalls that iconographic idea its easy to understand the meaning of the passage and its these ideas that tie together the fabric of the plot. The philosophical part was simply the moral of the book about knowing the difference between what you can change and what you cannot and knowing what to do in either case.I would recommend this book to college students and people who are uptight."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"You may read this book and find it so funny and enjoyable that the underlying message will be missed. Which is ok bacause the true sign of a classic is a book you can return to and pull something new from it. That's the beauty of Slaughterhouse-five. There's no timeline. There's no strong characters. There isn't a bad guy. And the bombing of Dresden (which according to the author is the reason the book was written) lasts about a paragraph. And in the middle of all of this chaos and nothingness, Vonnegut still gives the reader something grab hold of and savor...again and again.If you haven't read this book, this one is a 'must read'. Do yourself the favor."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This book was rather interesting. This being the first book I have read by Vonnegut, I wondered if this would be a difficult book to read or not. &quot;Slaughterhouse Five&quot; was a fairly easy book to read, no more difficult than most others were. The most difficult part of this book was following the story. The story is told through the memories of a day-dreamer. The story jumps around from topic to topic with the author popping in with his own insight every so often, much as the mind of the main character Billy.The story of Billy Pilgrim twists and turns through experiences in his life that have greatly effected him, which you can see through out the book. Experiences such as the bombing of Dresden in 1945, a devastating plane crash, and other small but integral glimpses through out his past come back to haunt him in his daily life.Coming in to this book I thought this was going to be a book about war, death, and other atrocities, but was I fooled. As you read this book, you can tell this is anything but a tale of war. The subject of war was a traumatizing and atrocious part of his life, which furtherd the feeble, and weakening mental state of the character.While reading this book, I realized the lack of form in his writing and the spuratic thought paterns are used to futher illistrate the emense mental tolls on Billy\`s mind.To say I recommend this book is to say the least. The dynamics of this book take you through different emotional states, which help you relate to the character on a personel level as well as a phisical level.Although, the lack of form in his writing was new to me, it doesnt make the book any more dificult than most others. Since I have read this particular book from Vonnegut, I plan on reading more of his books to see if they are as interesting as this one."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"After reading Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five, I found myself wishing I had read it long ago and not waited so long. I had heard mixed reviews, a lot of negatives, and never decided to find out for myself until this year.While the book has been reviewed as both a comedy and a tragedy, I could not help but feel pain throughout the book, pain for Billy mostly, but pain for the human race.Vonnegut seems to know our faults, including his own, and exploits them in such a way that we are faced with a horrible image of how we treat one another, even in a time of tragedy. We seem blind to others pain and focus solely on our own, and Vonnegut has something to say about that. He introduces us to a character, both pathetic and not, stronger perhaps than most people, someone that would be and has been kicked around. What makes Billy Pilgrim a hero in my eyes is not his plight, but his tremendous ability to survive, to find happiness in memories of what seems like a miserable life, from his overweight wife to his experieces during WWII.We can learn much from Billy about our own lives, about finding happiness where it seems unavailable, about how we should treat one another. This lesson alone helps keep this book on my list of favorite books of all time."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Wonderful book. In a nutshell, this books is a novel in a novel. The book starts following the \\"author\\" who is wrote a story about Dredsen -- a famous bombing during WWII. The main character in his book is man who is able to move about in time as he will. That probably sounds a little confusing, but that's the best way I can describe it.This book doesn't glamorize war. In fact, it's a very anti-war book. It doesn't make the people in the war look like heroes with an unhealthy lust for defending their countries. Most of the characters were just human. Some were too old, too young, too cowardly for war. They questioned the need for war, but still they had no way to stop it. Many were too young for the war hence the sub-title \\"The Children's Crusade\\".But the book isn't just about war. Some might see it as a SciFi book (the time traveling). We see the character, Billy Pilgrim, in various stages of his life, his birth, his marriage, his wife's death, etc. This book is also slightly cheeky in nature. Some might see it as a satire. There are many things going on in this book making it one of those book that you have to read more than once to catch different subplots.Vonnegut has a style that tends to ramble, and I can see why that would annoy some people. The story also could be a little confusing, and one might question the point, but it made perfect sense to me. I enjoy this book muchly."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Beginning a review for this book isn't an easy task.Most likely how it wasn't easy for Vonnegut to catalog his time in Dresden, as is evidence by this book. Yet, he still tells an intruiging story that subtly explains his view of that time.After a short prologue about the book (thought titled Chapter 1), we continue the story of Billy Pilgrim. Yes, continue. The events of Billy's life are not displayed in chronological order, but rather, in the order Billy experiences them in his mind, as he first falls through time and understands the events of his life from during his time in WWII, knowing his career, his relations, and even his death before he ever leaves Dresden. And even in these times, he falls through time while in these falls through time, as evidenced by his mate in the Tramalfadorian zoo.It's a fragmented story, trying to portray a man's fragmented life, while the undertones regard fate, massacre, and meaningless effort. And some of the story may not be real, or perhaps all of it is imagined while Billy daydreams in Nazi Germany, arousing problems with those around him. Things such as his abduction by the Tramalfadorians and being put in a zoo seem ridiculous, as well as his relation to Kilgore Trout and his reactions toward people.In short: Billy's mind is also fragmented. He can't think straight, he daydreams, and seems too stupid or awestruck by everything to understand what goes on around him. It's amazing a man this disoriented became a doctor; and maybe downright impossible if he really is imagining all his travels and experiences in different points in life.\\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" is a very strange novel, but it will have a profound effect on its reader, as one realizes near the end the impact of the words engraved on his mate's necklace towards the rest of the story. It's about fate, whether Billy imagined it or not, and while it's an odd tale, it's Vonnegut, and there's a valuable message, whether you agree with it or not."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Although you should all be reading the Vonnegut collection instead of reading my shanty review, I will go ahead and say that this book is wonderful by all standards.Read it as soon as possible.So it goes."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughterhouse Five is an anti-war novel told through a unique perspective that describes a man's life that has already happened. As th reader, you see it as reruns witha live cast. In Slaughterhouse Five, Kurt Vonnegut tells the story of Billy Pilgrim. Billy was an infantryman in World War II. Before and after the was, though, he went to optometry school and became successful. The only problems with Billy are that he didn't experience his life in order; he is &quot;unstuck in time.&quot; Billy walks through the front door of his home in Illium, New York, and could walk out of a door in a German prison camp in World War II. Billy's other problem is that he was abducted by aliens,but no one believes him. His daughter believes that he is insane, and so does his wife. In Slaughterhouse Five, Vonnegut selects a unique style to tell the story of an exceptional man. He tells you the story, but lets you wonder whether Billy is a senile old man or is he a man that knows his own fate and has learned to accept it. Slaughterhouse Five is written to let the reader use his own imagination and also acheives Vonnegut's of being an anti-war novel. It's sister story, Mother Night, is also suggested reading if you enjoyed this book, which I can safely say you will."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Books (and writers, for that matter) like this are few and far between. Never before have I been so totally compelled by a book that simultaneously made me laugh, cry and ponder at the world around me. Vonnegut easily balances between some dark humor and downright horrifying images with a style of storytelling so at ease with itself. He tells the story matter-of-factly and, perhaps my favorite part, treats the fact that Billy Pilgrim has become unstuck in time with such a &quot;so it goes&quot; matter that it's easy to gloss over the sheer absurdity of much of what happens. However, despite being downright strange in some places, Vonnegut also brings a very human element to the story by introducing (rather quickly) at times several characters that you either loved or hated. There is one part in the novel where I am saddened to such a point that I felt that this character was someone I had known at one time in my life. It is a rare and welcome surprise to be so easily manipulated by a book, espescially by one with so many meanings and so many great quotable lines! I strongly recoomend this book to those looking for a change of pace from the normal. For those of you with short attention spans, I also reccomend Vonnegut's Welcome to the Monkey House.

As everyone points out, it is similar in nature to Catch-22, but only in that it conveys its message in an unorthodoxed manner. To condemn this book because it's &quot;Anti-war&quot; is absolutely ridiculous. Vonnegut shows us that the bombing of millions of INNOCENT human beings is truely horrific and inexcusable. As the victors, we (Americans) tend to ignore the less than dubious actions taken by our side. Sure, right is served, but at what cost? Do we not become the same monsters which we are &quot;valiantly&quot; trying to defeat? Are the millions dead in Dresden and in Hiroshima no less innocent than the millions killed in concentration camps? That is the question Vonnegut wants to ask.

Laced with sarcasm, irony, parody, metaphor, analogy, and satire, SH-5 explores a mind gone mad due to the horrors witnessed during the tragic bombings at Dresden.Vonnegut manages to craft a classic book that is dark without being overtyly evil, depressing without being heavy-handed, and funny without being comical. Unlike war books such as 'Johnny Got His Gun,' for instance, SH-5 deals with the horror of war almost oddhandedly, making the mental carnage of death all the more surreal.Heartily recomended"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Just a thought on the anti-war theme: compare the totalsenselessness of Billy Pilgrim's presence in Europe (as he stumblesaround comically in his circus clothes) to the theoretically condemning but in fact celebratory aura surrounding Speilberg's little band of virtuous men fighting the Germans. Even though the specific mission seemed meaningless, in Private Ryan the lager war makes perfect sense--we have to hold this bridge so the artillery can't cross, so the Germans can't gain the advantage, etc. In Slaughterhouse Five, the larger war is given no story to justify it, we are simply dropped (like Billy) into the chaos and senselessness of war, and never given a coherent narrative with which to make sense of it. That is why, it seems to me, Slaughtehouse Five is a brilliant anti-war novel, and Private Ryan is more of the same old s***."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughterhouse-Five the wrenchingly sad tale of Billy Pilgrim, tells the story of a man whose experience in WWII haunts him for the rest of his life. When the book was published, most middle-aged American men were veterans of WWII. Billy's nightmarish flashbacks, his contempt for women and his desire to live a middle-class life must have seemed familiar to many of them. Slaughterhouse-Five was a valuable attempt to shine a cartoonish light on the horrible memories that veterans carried in their hearts. It was a counterpoint to the myth of WWII, popular at the time, that WWII was a \\"good\\" war, and that the horrors of real war had not existed.Slaughterhouse-Five is not about the bombing of Dresden. nor about the German people who were killed or survived the bombing. It is about the way the war can destroy a life, even after it is over. Billy Pilgrim, witnesses very little in Dresdin, but sees many horrible things during the war. During the bombing Billy was being held prisoner in a meat locker. When this book was published, the most shocking thing about the story was the coverup of the Dresden bombing by the American government.Slaughterhouse-Five depicts war as awful and senseless. But beyond that, you can't read Slaughterhouse-Five and not feel the loathing that the author had for women. Female characters are viewed by the narrator the way a twelve-year-old boy might treat them--at his worst. Its a kind of objectification that has gone out of style in American literature.For me the one dimentional, comic book style characters were more depressing than humorous. Billy goes though life in a dream that has little to do with the complexity of the human experience.There are much better books that describe the horrors of war."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This was my first Kurt Vonnegut book. It took perhaps 50 pages for me to get into his unique style of writing. I did not particularly enjoyed it at first. I was especially annoyed by the constant use of the phrase, \\"so it goes\\". But once I decided to go with the unusual style and writing I began to enjoy it a lot. The story follows the life of a WWII veteran. and jumps through time (past, present and future) constantly. Time lines are not separated by chapters and within one page, time jumps around several times. To make it more interesting the protagonist believes (or maybe he really was, but I believe it is not important whether he really was) that he was abducted by people from another planet and that he can travel through time. The reader can interpret this part as science fiction or merely that the protagonist is mentally ill. Vonnegut describes his life on the other planet, where he is in a zoo. Despite what sounds like a complex plot, the story is surprisingly easy to follow and delightful.The author admits that he intended to write an anti-war book. Through comedy and the story's unique characters, he delivers an entertaining book that will leave you with a lot to think about. The craziness of the story parallels the craziness of war. I highly recommend it and even if you don't end up liking the book, it will be a short time investment. It took me about a day to get through it."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I'd have to say this is one of the best \\"sci-fi\\" books I've read but honestly I don't think it's really a sci-fi book at all. It's almost a poem, yet written in easy to understand prose. It's fantastic but only illustrates the realities and absurdities of day to day living.This book is quite a unique experience, and even if you hate sci-fi you might pick it up since it's a different experience than the genre implies. Even satire doesn't seem to sum it up as there is a human warmth here that is absent from many other books labeled \\"satire.\\""},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughterhouse-Five is perhaps one of the most recognizable anti-war novels. I had blushingly never read this one before. It's one of Megan's favorite books, and she's tried to get me to read it for years. And now I have, and I'm so glad that I have.Slaughterhouse-Five is Kurt Vonnegut's satirical tale of Billy Pilgrim, a World War II veteran who is \\"unstuck in time.\\" What this means is that Pilgrim often disconnects from the present and picks up again at some other time in his life and usually at a different location. Pilgrim was in Dresden during the bombings, he was in Nazi concentration camps, he was at home with his wife, visiting with his recently married daughter, visiting with his son who was a green beret, being abducted by aliens and taken to the planet, Tralfamador, where he is put on display at a zoo.I found this book to be quite powerful. It's a touching story at times, very light-hearted and almost humorous at times, and at other times just disturbing. It's a story that will always remain relevant in these days of war. It shows how powerful of a thing war is and the traumatic toll that it can have on the life of a soldier.Vonnegut's writing style is amazing. I found myself asking \\"what makes a book a classic?\\" This book is the perfect example of a classic. It's a writing style that's totally in a league of it's own. The book flows so easily, yet there's so many complex connections made in it. Little tiny lines that stand out at first come back in a major way later in the book tying into the main plot. Vonnegut was a master of the American novel."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"The first statement I have about this book is that it is not for everyone. This book's plot jumps around between different moments in the main character's life. If to read a certain section of the book where the main character, Billy, is in World War II, in the next few pages, he could be an infant or an elderly man! Therefore the plot is difficult to navigate through.However, the plot is no reason to deter you from his excellent novel! If you can follow it, the plot is extraordinary! The author introduces us to vivid characters, new lands, and a great message: Choose what is important and good in life and focus on that, and try to ignore the bad. You see, in Billy's spastic trips through time he meets a race of aliens called Tralfemadorians. These aliens can see in the fourth dimension, which is time, and they teach Billy a valuable lesson about life: \\"That's one thing Earthlings might learn to do, if they tried hard enough: Ignore the awful times, and concentrate on the good ones.\\" (Slaughterhouse-Five, Vonnegut page 117).This is also a great antiwar novel. The only plot that returns in a linear way in this novel is Billy's experiences in World War II. We learn of a place called Dresden, where there was no military action on behalf of the Nazis, it was a civilian area used only as a Prisoner Of War camp. The Allies bombed it and killed more people there than when they dropped the atomic bomb in Japan. The author shows us the true horrors of war, the desire of man to win; at all costs.Slaughterhouse-Five is an excellent novel for most readers, but those who cannot follow plots, might want to look elsewhere. It has a great message and compels us to look at ourselves inside and see what we would do to win, what we would sacrifice."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I don't feel that I am making an overstatement when I say that this is the best novel ever written. The theme is one of man's insignificance in space and time. All we can do as humans is hold onto the present as it is. We will never change that the past has happened, that the present is happening and that the future will always happen. I first read this book in high school and then several years later when I was in college and it is amazing how the book seems to grow with you as your understanding and world views change. Vonnegut takes the reader on a roller coaster ride through the life of his character Billy Pilgram and jumps from one peak to the next valley of the various stages of his life without ever losing his main story line. A very hard book to put down that only gets better each time you read it."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"The title Slaughterhouse Five, sounds like a cheesy horror movie, but you could never guess this story involves World War II, an American soldier, and time travel to a out of this world planet named Tralfalmadore. Slaughterhouse Five is a fiction novel based on historical fact. The life story of the main character, Billy Pilgrim, unfolds throughout flashbacks and brief flash-forwards. Billy is a clumsy American soldier in World War II who becomes separated from his unit. He moves along with three other American soldiers, until they are captured by the Germans. They are then taken to the doomed city of Dresden, Germany and held captive in the slaughterhouses. Billy was in \\"slaughterhouse number five,\\" where the novel gets its name. A week after their capture, Dresden is bombed by the Americans and the city is completely destroyed, but Billy survives physically, but not mentally. Due to the effects of the terrible war, Billy's mind has been seriously altered. He claims to have visited a distant planet called Tralfalmadore, in the fourth dimension. As result of these visits, Billy is now able to travel through time. It is clear Billy Pilgrim is a very changed man from the effects of the war, but it is up to you the reader to decide whether Billy has simply gone insane, or whether he has been day dreaming the whole time. This novel is a great mix of historical fact and far off fiction, with a light touch of science fiction and a lot of twisted humor. The author, Vonnegut was an American soldier held prisoner in the Dresden slaughterhouses during World War II, so the descriptions are truthfully vivid. The only bad thing is that the time travel makes the story hard to follow but, after reading it you will have a different picture of what a war is like and what it can do to you physically and mentally."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughterhouse 5 is every bit as good as it's reputation suggests. It is witty, observant, humane, and clever. Vonnegut writes in a deceptively simple prose, but which must have been difficult to have pulled off: namely, the way the story flits from the present to the past and to the future, very often in a single page, but manages to do it without disturbing the effortless flow of the narrative. No mean trick for a writer. A favourite book of mine. I can also recommend some of his earlier books: The Sirens of Titan; Piano Player; Mother Night, and Player Piano. His later books are not so hot; but Slaughterhouse 5 is his masterpiece. Like Heller's Catch 22, with which it has something in common, it is fun to read. My only gripe is with the cover, which is dull beyond belief. Leo and Diane Dillon: We need you. Where are you?"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Kurt Vonnegut's &quot;Slaughterhouse Five&quot; is a modern, anti-war classic. It is the story of Billy Pilgrim and his problematic life marred by his horrific experiences as a prisoner of war in Dresden during World War II. There, Billy experiences firsthand the catastrophic fire bombing that leveled the German city. The reader jumps back and forth to different points in Billy's life, many times randomly and unexpectedly. All of it adds up to a darkly (yet humorously) told story of a sad, existentialist life.I must say that I, as a Believer, have a different worldview than Kurt Vonnegut and Billy Pilgrim. But this book is so very honest about what everyday human life must mean if there is nothing more than fire bombings, dogs barking, family members, dreams of trips to imaginary planets, and so on. If what we see is all there is, as many of us, with our actions and beliefs testify to frequently, well then, as Vonnegut writes, &quot;...so it goes.&quot; The only thing we can do to cope is deny the fact and create our own subversions, unless we truly want to open ourselves up to something our very nature tells us from which to run.&quot;So..&quot; said Billy gropingly, &quot;I suppose that the idea of preventing wwar on Earth is stupid, too.&quot;&quot;Of course.&quot;&quot;But you do have a peaceful planet here.&quot;&quot;Today we do. On other days we have wars as horrible as any you've ever seen or read about. There isn't anything we can do about them, so we simply don't look at them. We ignore them.

Slaughterhouse Five is Vonnegut's masterpiece. One note of advice. If you are a person who always reads the first page of a book before buying it, which often works, make sure that you read the first page of chapter two. Chapter one is an introduction tot he story, and although it is good, it doesn't hold a candle to the rest of the book. There are an infinite amount of discussions that this book can raise. Is Billy Pilgrim a Christ Figure? Is this an Anti War/Glacier book? Does Time exist? True, this book is very deep, especially if you analyis it exstenseively. The book, however, is extremely enjoyable. It is a short book and fairly easy to read. Do your self a favor and read this book. You might not like it, I admit it is not for everyone, but it has the potential of changing your way of thinking. In a good way."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I never read Kurt Vonneguht before and, thus, had no idea what to expect from his book. Through the first few chapters I was a little confused to where he was taking this book; especially since it was said to be loosely based on his own experiences during World War 2. Kurt forced the reader to deal with the fantastic reality, that one could only view as absolute humor, and forced us also to deal with the harshness of life and death and the fine line between them. He intertwined the two and created a character whom was eternally trapped re-living his War days and the time when he was abducted to the planet Tramalfagador ( I probably spelled that wrong ). One cannot completely overlook the meaning of the &quot;imaginary&quot; world....because who is to say what is reality and what is not....I certainly dare not impose my opinion; figure it out for yourself."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"The Children's Crusade, as i like to call it- i believe the publisher forced the name change (read the first chapter)- is without a doubt the best book i have read. Along with Catch 22, it turned me from a child facinated by war and eager for glory into a young adult who is totally opposed to armed conflict. The writing style allows the reader to enter a dream, or trance like state, where events have no order, and things just happen. It helps you to empathise with billy pilgrim. you become billy pilgrim, and you end up with the same sense of helplessness. However, you don't end up with billy's lack of concern. I think that is the whole point of this masterpiece. A truly world altering book."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Although I'm just beginning to explore Vonnegut's works, I did thoroughly enjoy this book. His cynical yet witty style reads wonderfully while the story's dark, anti-war sentiments are clearly present. Slaughterhouse five makes me excited to delve further into Vonnegut's work."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"The title of this review seems to run with the content. After I read Vonnegut's most famous novel, I found myself wondering if I liked it or not. As I read further Vonnegut works, I saw that the same style was emulated in each book and I kept questioning whether it was good or not. Vonnegut is truly nothing like any other writer you may have read; when reading the novel, the story seems whole, yet when you reflect upon it, it changes into merely a shell of a story. You also forget what you have read, both during and after you've read the book. It's quite an experience!"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"It's been many years since I read Slaughterhouse Five, and while some passages have aged poorly, the overall experience is still a wonderful read. Well worth picking up again. Maybe it's just a phase I'm going through, but I read so many newer novels I don't review because they just aren't good and I don't want to denigrate them. This was a pleasure, soundly demonstrating why some books are classics. Five resounding stars."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Well, as a protagonist says, it might as well be an anti-glacier book, glaciers being somewhat easier to stop than war.This is an odd little book, full of wry humour and unaccustomed association of ideas. While presenting a picture of the sheer, stupid, murderous futility of war as a backdrop, it pursues a partly science-fictional narrative of a man lost in the skein of his own time-lines and thus explores some fairly intractable philosophical territory. The two lines of inquiry make an odd mixture.The central character is lost in time. What this means - what, indeed, it can mean - is part of the philosophical can of worms that this book opens. Billy Pilgrim has been abducted by aliens and placed on display in a zoo. At least, we are told this - if Pilgrim has lost his ability to construct a linear subjective time then hallucinations about aliens may be the least of his worries. Slipping through a time warp to reach their home and then learning from them that humans are unique in not being able to perceive the whole of time as if viewing it at right-angles, Pilgrim has at some stage come unmoored in his own subjective time-line. The story follows his staccato perception of time as it lashes back and forth from one part of his life to another.The Tralfmadoreans find it amusing that humans believe in \\"free will\\". Seeing time as a dimension, in its entirety, they also see it as a completed causal whole. To us, chained to the railway wagon of time and only able to view the passing landscape down two metres of fixed, narrow pipe, the future is open and free will a going concern. Seeing the entire causal landscape, they know free will to be a delusion, and now so does Pilgrim. For him, those who died remain alive in a different part of the landscape, and all that will be is as it always was.Being able to see time backwards might have its compensations for a Dresden survivor. Rivers of burning human fat flow back, cooling, to reconstitute young women's bodies and blocks of ghostly, translucent soap stamped \\"RJF\\" are sucked up by the shower and sent back to camps to bring murdered Jews back to life. Anti-aircraft batteries suck damage from planes that reverse overhead, hoovering up bombs and quenching fires. Horrors undo themselves, and the world can rejoice that a war will soon roll backwards across Europe and Asia, building cities in its wake as the graves empty and millions reawaken to life.Here, chained to the track, time racing with glacial inevitability past the end of our pipe, horrors remain, forever beyond any undoing. What is done will not be undone. This, I think, was Vonnegut's message."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"\\"Listen: Billy Pilgrim has become unstuck in time.\\"And so it begins in the late Kurt Vonnegut's classic of American literature,Slaughterhouse Five, the absurdist masterpiece that this veteran of the 'Nam Era first read in college in the early '70s. It was a time when peace protests were spreading across the United States, and disillusionment was growing in the ranks of pour troops in Vietnam.And then in June of 1972, a photo appeared in newspapers across the country and around the world, an image of a young Vietnamese girl running down the road, her body scorched by napalm, her face contorted in pain. That photograph, taken by Associated Press photographer Nick Ut remains a haunting image of the American war in Vietnam. This photo became one of the most famous and memorable photos of Vietnam, and won Nick Ut the Pulitzer prize in 1972, and is the subject ofThe Girl in the Pictureby Denise Chong.Shortly after this photo had appeared in the news, I had read the section in this book where protagonist Billy Pilgrim had again become unstuck in time, and was seeing the firebombing of Dresden as if it was a movie being run backwards: \\"The formation flew backwards over a German city that was in flames. The bombers opened their bomb bay doors, exerted a miraculous magnetism which shrunk the fires, gathered them into cylindrical steel containers, and lifted the containers into the bellies of the planes.\\" And Vonnegut ran this scene, quickly backwards in time, with Billy Pilgrim extrapolating, all the way back to Adam and Eve.I made the mistake of reading these few passages about Dresden in my Contemporary American Literature class, and all hell broke loose, mostly because the impact of Nick Ut's famous photo was on everyone's mind and being discussed from many aspects. The class discussions rapidly turned away from the discussions on Kurt Vonnegut's contributions to science fiction writing and literature in general, and didn't stop until the class was over. So it goes.The concepts of free will and fate that Vonnegut raises here can be thought provoking in themselves, and the author is also capable of adding a bit of hilarity in places where it's least expected. Not wanting to interject any spoilers here, but Billy has been kidnapped in a flying saucer and is taken to the planet Trafalmadore. These extraterrestrials appear (to humans) like upright toilet plungers with a hand atop, into which is set a single, green eye. During the trip to Tralfamadore, Billy asked for something to read. Among their \\"five million Earthling books on microfilm,\\" the only actual book in English that they had was 'Valley of the Dolls' by Jacqueline Susann. \\"Billy read it, thought it was pretty good in spots. The people certainly had their ups and down, ups and downs.\\"There have been many analyses of this book, many reviews, and most of them are far more thought provoking than this reviewer is going to get into here. The characters that proliferate this book become three-dimensional as Billy Pilgrim bounces back and forth in time. Paul Lazzaro is a memorable and obsessive character who appears in a very crucial role, but to describe him further would be a spoiler. Billy meets adult film star Montana Wildhack on the planet Trafamadore, where they both share a space in a zoo there, and Billy does have some interesting dreams about her as well... we'll leave it at that.Vonnegut continually uses the refrain \\"So it goes.\\" This can appear when death or dying occur, as a transition to another subject, to explain what cannot be explained, and as comic relief. I heard or read somewhere that this appears over a hundred times, but I'm not counting. So it goes.Should note that the 1972 filmSlaughterhouse-Fiveis available on DVD, and it's as faithful a film adaptation as one could find for a book such as this. It's expertly directed by George Roy Hill, and Michael Sacks really becomes the character as Billy Pilgrim, and Sharon Ganz is perfect as his overweight, overprotective wife. Ron Leibman is quite good as the loony and obsessed Paul Lazzaro, andWas glad to find this in Kindle format, as my last two printed copies of this book were borrowed by friends who had promised to return them when they finished. One did say that she was \\"still working on it\\" a couple of years later, but that she was having a tough time following it, as Billy Pilgrim becoming \\"unstuck in time\\" was difficult for her to follow. So it goes.There are too many good Vonnegut books to recommend here, and this reader has read almost all of those by this author. Some, likePalm Sunday: An Autobiographical Collagemight appeal to diehard Vonnegut fans more than those just beginning to explore his works. In Chapter 18 of that book, the author graded his own works, and some of them are as follows:* Player Piano: B*God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater: A*The Sirens of Titan: A*Mother Night: A*Cat's Cradle: A+*Slaughterhouse Five: A+* Welcome to the Monkey House: B-* Happy Birthday, Wanda June: D*Jailbird: AIn each of these grades, this reader will agree, and most if not all can be found here. But it's still Slaughterhouse Five that remains as my personal 5-star favorite. So it goes.2/22/2012"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I read this book as a teen and re-read it as a middle-aged adult with PTSD.

This is one book I need for my collection."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Billy Pilgrim is the definition of a spectacle. With his azure shower curtain, fur muff, and silver boots, he is an embarrassment to the US Army as he marches into the Dresden Prisoner of War Camp. In Kurt Vonnegut's cross genre classic, Slaughterhouse Five, Vonnegut approaches the anti-war novel in a new light. Vonnegut's story focuses on the life of Billy Pilgrim, a slightly insane optometrist who believes he was abducted by aliens and now has the ability to time travel. Throughout the novel, Billy travels through time, mainly focusing on his time as a POW in Germany and Dresden during WW II.In its simplest form, Slaughterhouse Five is an Anti-War book. Vonnegut achieves this, by highlighting the pointlessness of war and the easiness of death. Vonnegut however, fails to acknowledge how one must deal with war. Yes, there is pain and suffering, but how does one come back from that? Billy Pilgrim, embodies this idea within himself, as he has a seemingly successful life after the war, but he unable to enjoy It as he becomes obsessed with the idea that he was abducted by Tralfamadorians. Is Vonnegut saying that to move past the horrors of war, you need to envelope your mind in something else to point of insanity? Even the phrase \\"So it goes\\" implies a passive acceptance that things are the way they are. Vonnegut succeeds in the age old argument that war is evil, and pushes the envelope by highlighting the psychological effects after war. Vonnegut, however, fails to provide any inspiration or guide as to prevent wars in the future.Outside of its anti-war message, Slaughterhouse Five is a strange but enjoyable read, as Vonnegut dark satire provides a new perspective and outlook for the reader."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I have a friend who reads lots of books about WWII. That's not my favorite genre, so after I finished the acknowledged classic Slaughterhouse Five, I was excited to finally have a book we could discuss together. Imagine my surprise when I found out she hadn't read it! Turns out she thought it was science fiction, so didn't feel compelled to read it. What a mistake. Why are we (myself included) so afraid to step outside of our boundaries and read something different? No wonder many authors, Vonnegut included, chafe so at being classified as this-or-that genre. So limiting. Even my scifi book club, for which I read Slaughterhouse Five, was mixed over whether this book was scifi or not. But we agreed it didn't matter. It is simply a Great Book. And Great Books are Great no matter what their subject, genre, or era. The genre thing comes down to this: I do not want to spend my precious time reading mediocre works about WWII, and the same goes for my friend vis-a-vis scifi. But brilliant works like Slaughterhouse Five or The Left Hand of Darkness (which won the 1970 Hugo Award over Slaughterhouse Five) really should be read by everyone. Yes, that means YOU!"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Vonnegut's deliberate style of taking serious material and examining it through a detached spectator illustrates the horrors of warfare in WWII without sounding preachy. By taking this unusual lens the author exposes us to the absurdity of what is often taken for granted in war. Although differing from his other more constructive or humanist books Slaughter House Five offers a great insight into the American way of life in the middle to late 1900s. Additionally, Vonnegut casual and straightforward style of writing makes it enjoyable for the casual and the intellectual alike."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"At random points in time I still think of Billy Pilgrim. Obviously, I have never been to war, but this book, more than other war experience books I've read, is the one I feel has best helped me imagine and understand the personal and psychological effects of what it must be like to be a veteran. I'm sure I can't understand it truly, not having experienced it, but there is something about the way Vonnegut wrote Billy Pilgrim that makes me feel like I connect to the madness. There is a passage in this book where Billy Pilgrim envisions a war documentary in reverse, with bombs being sucked out of the sky and the world being repaired, and I don't think any passage from any book has had a more immediate and profound impact on me than that one."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughterhouse-5 is a semibiographical fiction satire about a bewildered war veteran named Billy Pilgrim. Throughout the novel he struggles to find meaning in his life and in the senseless and cruel war that he lived through. Through this novel Vonnegut found a way to describe his horrible experiences in WWII, but does so in a pleasant and humorous way and I give him a lot of credit for that.After reading chapter one I have to admit I didn't have high hopes for this book. In it Vonnegut talks about his preparation and the difficulty he had writing this book mixed in with some biographical information. Most of chapter 1 seemed very random and sounded like the ramblings of an old drunken man, but the book definitely improved as I read on. Many of the seemingly random details revealed in chapter 1 were, to my surprise, worked into the storyline in subsequent chapters.There is also a sci-fi element in this book: Billy Pilgrim \\"has become unstuck in time\\" and time travels. The story jumps back and forth through time with him, it is not told linearly. Although moments of his life before and after the war are not told in order, his war experiences are basically in order, so it's not confusing. The aliens who abduct him cause the time travel Billy experienced. These aliens, the Tralfamadorians, have interesting philosophies on the nature of time and death. They believe \\"All moments, past, present, and future, always existed, and always will exist.\\"The narrator says, \\"so it goes\\" after each death, which is obviously some kind of statement about death, but it gets annoying after a while since a lot of people die in this novel. It is almost as if he kills people off in the book just so he can say \\"so it goes.\\"The parts of the book that are loosely based on Vonnegut's life are about his WWII experiences, told as a third-person narrative using Billy. In the novel Billy is drafted and goes to fight in the Battle of the Bulge and is quickly separated from his unit behind enemy lines. Lost, confused, and close to freezing to death he is saved by a delusional soldier named Weary. Weary refers to himself and the other two soldiers he is with as the three musketeers. He romanticizes war and views himself a hero who is on a mission from God to win the war. When I read about this character I am reminded of our media that glorifies war, constantly praises the troops, and acts as if war is the only option to deal with our \\"evil\\" enemies. They never tell you the perspectives of our enemies, show you pictures of the dead civilians, or reveal the brutality of war and the destruction it leaves in its wake. Vonnegut may not have been referring to the media in this chapter, but that's the wonderful thing about books: you can take themes from them and apply them to observations made in your own life.Billy witnesses the brutality and senselessness of war first hand. As a prisoner of war he is always starving and cold. On a crowded train to a POW camp Billy is forced to sleep standing up \\"self-crucified\\" in the corner of the freight car. Vonnegut discusses the hypocrisy of soldiers committing needless, evil atrocities, while at the same time being proud of themselves for fighting evil. One of the hardest things Vonnegut has had to live with was the unnecessary bombing of the beautiful city of Dresden, by the Americans, that killed 130,000 people, mainly civilians. He was in Dresden as a POW and lived through the bombing and tells of his experience using Billy.Other parts in this book deal with Billy's postwar life. By all accounts he is living the American dream: he has a successful career, money, a wife and kids, material possessions, yet he is unhappy. He struggles to find meaning in life and seems like a confused and empty person.While I don't think this book is quite 5 star material, it is still an entertaining, fast read. It is not an overly challenging book that I would recommend for teenagers as well as adults."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Overall this isn't a bad book; however I think its geared towards the generation of the 1960s and 1970s (I'm 30). This book is touted as an antiwar book - I just didn't see that in reading it. The style and the story is easy to read and I like how certain events are linked to each other; such as Billy Pilgrim hiding under a hospital bed cover only to awaken in a makeshift hospital room in Germany. I also found the use the phrase \\"So it goes\\" after the mention of someone's death an interesting literary device. My major negative point is that I don't feel any attachment to Billy Pilgrim, he's a character I really couldn't grow to have any concern for or feel any emotional connection to...then again, this might have been by design."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I had not read a book by Kurt Vonnegut before and I did not understand what the big deal about his books were. When I first picked up Slaughterhouse Five I expected it to be like so many other standard \\"this happened, then this happened, and so on\\" books. After the first chapter though, I was hooked.The character of Billy Pilgrim is perfect in that he illustrates the carelessness we have about war. The aliens and their perspective about \\"fate\\" also gives into this concept that \\"war is inevitable\\" which Vonnegut is in fact arguing against. I don't want to give away to much, so I'll stop here on the substance.But beyond the \\"meaning\\" of the book the way it is written is also brilliant. The story goes back and forth and lets us see every moment in its full context. Also, Vonnegut does this clever tactic of bringing up seemingly small and irrelevant material in the course of reading the book only to bring it up again later in the book thus having you turn back the pages and ferociously look for the references.This is at the top-tier of American literature and deserves all the praise it has received over the years."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"A 2006 Summer Reading List - Mini ReviewKurt Vonnegut experienced the atrocities of the fire bombing of Dresden in World War II. He was sheltered in Slaughterhouse-Five (A meat processing plant) during the assault. In the same way I and all his other readers experience The Dresden Bombing, WWII and the surreal in his novel Slaughterhouse-Five.Billy Pilgrim is the main character an aptly name observer of the human condition. Vonnegut takes his subject seriously by not taking his subject seriously. The book is a crazy jumble of Pilgrim's travels in war, space, and time. It does not hit you immediately, but amid the craziness, Vonnegut is making solid points about the absurdity of war.This is a funny and thought provoking book worth several readings."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This book is not only a staple of american literature, but also a modern classic. SH5 is a simply breath-taking anti-war novel. what made this book such an enjoyment for me was the fact that vonnegut used equal elements of humor, visualizations, compassion, all without ever breaking off from his main point. vonnegut's style is like nothing i have ever read, or will probably ever read. it does take a little getting used to, but it is well worth it. this is an excellent novel, it may even change the way you view your life. so it goes."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"The story itself was great. But what made it great was Vonnegut's writing style. He takes a man's life, spread out the events of his life like a deck of cards, then shuffles the cards, and spreads them out again. At first it is confusing, but once you catch on, it is a magnificent journey.But beware. This isn't a straight, WWII book. You have to have a little taste for science fiction. And a sense of humor."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I'm not a very avid reader, but what I can say about this book is that it made me realize that there is some literature out there that I can really appreciate. I was recommended this book by a friend about 4 years ago in college who had similar tastes as I do. Since then I've read it three times among many, many more books than I had read before that.The story is unconventional with its mostly unironic WWII/science fiction theme and nonlinear story telling. Its like Vonnegut is saying this time were doing it my way, were doing it Billy Pilgrims way, and this is the story of his life.The use of blunt, sometimes vulgar language is one of Vonnegut's characteristic tools that he uses to get at a truth that can only be reached through this type of storytelling. The opening line: \\"Listen, Billy Pilgrim has become unstuck in time\\" says it all. The tone for the entire book and a mini-summary of it is all in that one sentence.This to-the-point style is I think what makes it such and easy and popular read, although it is in no way unskilled. With that I'll just say that I think more people need to read this book. Other five star ratings dont even come close to what this one means."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Vonnegut's suberb 1960's antiwar fantasy based upon his experiences as a POW held by the Germans during the Anglo American firebombing of the \\"Open City\\"(no military targets) Dresden in 1945 seen by many as a revenge bombing for the destruction of Coventry by the Luftwaffe.*spoilers*The story is the unconventional tale of Billy Pilgrim who as a result of being kidnapped by aliens has become unstuck in time and travels back and forth between events in his life from childhood to his death at the hands of a madman.Though it drifts back and forth I've always found the story to be rather linear in nature and easy to follow. The parts of the narrative related to Billy's experiece in the War are the most griping. Especially the description of the death and destruction as POW's are enlisted to search for bodies and clear debris in the aftermath of the Fire Bombing of Dresden where more people died than in either Hiroshima or Nakasaki. One is shot for basically \\"looting\\" a knick knack.The story holds up quite well for being nearly 40 years old. Vonnegut's works will probably gain a new following due to the current War and the state of things today."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"\\"Listen: Billy Pilgrim has become unstuck in time. Billy has gone to sleep a senile widower and awakened on his wedding day. He has walked through a door in 1955 and come out another in 1941. He has gone back through that door to find himself in 1963. He has seen his birth and death many times, he says, and pays random visits to all the events in between. He says.\\"This text was pulled from the beginning of Chapter Two in Kurt Vonnegut's classic American novel Slaughterhouse-Five. After being abducted by a race of aliens called the Tralfamadorians, our protagonist, Billy Pilgrim, believes that he has become \\"unstuck in time.\\" These aliens live timelessly and believe that time moves in a circular method as oppossed to the linear method that we believe in, and after Billy's encounter, he is able to seamlessly and effortlessly move through the important time periods of his lifetime, especially when it comes to the days he faced as an American POW being held in Nazi Germany.The only problem is that not even Billy can decide when he is going to time-travel; he'll often fall asleep in one year and wake up 20 years earlier or 20 years later, and as you have already read, he can time-travel simply by walking through doors.Maybe he's not even time-traveling at all. Maybe it's nothing more than a sleeping disorder. Maybe Billy is having elaborate dreams that he cannot tell apart from reality. Maybe he's suffering from post-traumatic stress as an affect of WWII. You decide...If you are a reader who has to experience a story analytically, this book is probably not for you. Clearly, this story isn't told in chronological order, but it's still rather easy to follow along with Vonnegut's relaxing and flowing tone, and it's very easy to realize when a change in time has taken place.I really enjoyed how Kurt Vonnegut molded his personal experiences into the novel. Vonnegut himself was a prisoner in Dresden, Germany, and witnessed the fire-bombing of the city, which killed hundreds of thousands of civilians as well as many POWs. The title of the book itself is taken directly from the name of the prison that Vonnegut was held in during his stint in WWII.I also enjoyed the way the novel was written. Kurt Vonnegut uses an almost sarcastic or satiric tone, and it's quite funny to read even with the mention of war, death, and alien abduction. The novel also forces the reader to think about and analyze the concepts of time and reality.Overall, I would recommend this book to readers who enjoy the questioning of bigger concepts that cannot be explained. If you are a fan of The Matrix, you would probably love this book, and you should probably pick up a copy ASAP if you want to expand your mind.- James-Carroll Parker Hayes"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"_Slaughterhouse Five_ is so many things: witty, profoundly sad, moving, humourous, an accusation, a confession, an act of contrition. The story revolves around Billy Pilgrim, no one special in any particular way, as he bounces around in time: from his experiences in Dresden during World War II to his wedding day, to his kidnapping by the Tralfamadorians and back again. Through his experiences we learn much about what it is to be human and a little about time. I absolutely loved this book.It is deceptively easy read, but don't be fooled: still waters run deep, as Vonnegut shares a profound insight: \\"Ignore the awful times and concentrate on the good ones.\\" Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I think Slaughterhouse-Five was one of my first books I read with aliens involved in it. And because I considered all alien-involving things to be boring, I considered this novel to be the same. However, the novel turned out to be very interesting. Because I am a slow reader, I often got bored with novels. But this novel wasn't boring. The continuous time changes provided new stories, and the freshness of each scene kept my eyes on the novel.I liked the idea that Billy, the main character, wasn't able to change the happenings of his life moments. Although he revisited same scenes of his life, he couldn't change what had happened before. It showed the importance of decisions, choices, and actions people made in their lives.When I was reading the novel, I wasn't focusing so much on the anti-war theme(what other people commented about). Instead, I thought Billy was really traveling through time, and I tried to imagine his life through my mind. And I pitied Billy. And I decided that going back time or looking out to the future was not always something to be excited about because people don't always have good memories and your past could be full of resentment. And I thought it would be most meaningful if I appreciated my \\"present,\\" which Billy didn't have, and do my best to make my time full of happiness.Slaughterhouse-Five taught me the value of life. It also planted me positive thoughts about alien-involving novels. Lastly, I just want to comment that the novel would have been more interesting if it showed more emotions. I wanted to see how the author would have made Billy feel. Although I liked the idea of leaving the interpreting the \\"very emtional part\\" to the readers, I wanted some profound emtions in order to understand the author's intention more fully. But overall, it was an exciting novel with various scenes and life-related morals to ponder on."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I've been reading and re-reading this book once or twice annually for nearly thirty years. I just cannot get over the poignant, filthy, worn out world of hope and shame this guy creates. Vonnegut was there in Dresden during the bombings. He has seen things that no one should ever have to see and he sorted out in his mind a way to present chaos,loneliness,inhumanity, humanity, space critters, plane crashes, fire bombings, time, and life itself into a book. He finds a place to look out at the world and contemplete time and aging. \\"I'm an old fart who smokes too many Pall Malls.\\" and \\"My breath smelled like mustard gas and roses\\". To me these are heart wrenching lines in the context of the story. This is an anti-war book, just as it is a book trying to deal with the nature of mortality and time. It is also a book which attempts to deal with truth. The fire bombing of Dresden was an absolute military secret and until the mid-70's, the US government wouldn't admit that it had even happened. That this book was even released in the form of telling a story of Dresden is remarkable. But, as Vonnegut says, \\"I was there.\\" I love this book and I always will. Everytime I read it I am aware of a new feeling or a new idea the book has proposed in my mind. Brilliant stuff in a simple, yet complex; funny, yet deadly serious tour de force of a book."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"It's a classic. The description of the fourth dimension, time, like the three other spatial dimensions is insightful. The author manages to be funny and tragic at the same time while describing some of the worst atrocities of the WWII."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Kurt Vonnegut, the narrator, wants to write a book about the World War 2 bombing of Desden, Germany. He focuses his narrator on one soldier, Billy Pilgrim, who happens to time travel and was abducted by aliens for display in a zoo on the planet Tralfamador. Billy's time travel involves constantly slipping into different moments in his life. One moment he will be a prisoner of war in Dresden, the next he will be a middle-aged optometrist, twenty years later, and after he will be back in the trenches, pre-capture. This time travel is the basis for a non-linear narrative structure where the futility of the war is told in parallel with much other futility. The time travel aspect makes Billy an observer of his life, not an actor. (In consultation, the only other novel I could identify with a similar narrative structure isThe Time Traveler's Wife.) Vonnegut, through all this, teaches the absurdity of war, but the novel is also crammed with trippy tributaries: For example, Billy Pilgrim reads a science fiction novel about a man who travels back in time to verify whether the Messiah actually died on the cross or not. And in the zoo on Tralfamador, Pilgrim has a child with a Hollywood starlet.(This actually leads to the one inconsistency I found in the novel. The Tralfamadorians teach that human reproduction, in ways we do not understand, relies not on only a man and a woman but also on the existence of gay men, elderly women, babies who have died, and others. And yet, Billy and his Hollywood lover are able to reproduce on Tralfamador despite the fact that they are - as far as we know - the only humans on the planet. Perhaps a minor inconsistency, but otherwise everything seems to make sense, in its way.)Vonnegut - zikhrono livrakha - fought in World War 2, so he knows some of what he speaks. Ethan Hawke's reading of the audiobook is strong.Note on content: The book has strong language scattered throughout, and it has a number of references to sex although no graphic scenes."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Stumbling around for something good to read, I asked my 20-something daughter for her suggestions. Slaughter House-5 was among them. I'm glad I read it. I won't go into a detailed review; there are plenty of others who do. I will say, though, that this book gives a stark look at the damage war does to its participants. Clearly Billy Pilgrim was affected by what he'd endured, although he was a bit spacy from birth, I'd venture, and perhaps the war isn't the only reason for his strangeness. The Tralfamadore's outlook on time--that past, present, and future exist at one time and events are not linear--is thought-provoking in an \\"imagine the effects of this\\" sort of way. (It may also appear \\"spiritual\\" to those readers who believe in a God who simultaneously sees the beginning and the end of time.) Other Tralfamadorian beliefs left me pondering(which is a good thing for a book to do)and many have a hint of \\"wisdom.\\" I found the twist at the end of the book startling, another thing good books have. Because SH-5 has stayed with me in some way, I give it 5 stars."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"An unusual but effective way the author has adopted to get the anti war message across.

The book was for a project and it was a great way to purchase."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Browsing because you've heard the hype? Well it may not change your life but do yourself a favour and put this on your bucket reading list......so it goes."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I picked up this audiobook from my library's shelf because Ethan Hawke is narrating it. I loved Ethan Hawke ever since Great Expectations, so I was really curious. The name \\"Slaughterhouse 5\\" vaguely reminded me of a book that I might have had to read in high school, or maybe not. It was very vague. But I also knew the book was famous, and no reason why.So...what did I think?Well, most people will say they didn't like the book because of the jumpy timeline. Actually, I didn't mind it. I wasn't IN LOVE with it either. But the author did a REALLY good job of making sure WE KNEW when Billy (the main character) was \\"getting unstuck in time.\\" So even though it was constantly moving forward and backward all over the place, it really wasn't too bad. It did have a \\"Main\\" timeline of Billy suffering through WW2 and the bombing of Dresden.Style-wise, Vonnegut is really a good writer. There was a part where he described Dresden as \\"If angels could build a city, which all its curves and heavenly sky, Dresden would be that city.\\" And you know what? I could totally picture the curves, and colors, and sky, and sun of that heavenly city, even though I've never seen old pictures of Dresen before WW2, if there even are any.I will say this, it's not an easy book to read. Between the story lines and the subject matter, it really does need to be read by a more adult audience to be able to keep up and capture it all. But that's not to say a smart high schooler can read it.And so, I liked this book. I didn't like the war, and suffering, and bombing, and death. But it certainly was a different way of writing about the same subject. I recommend it to others."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I've long heard people mention Kurt Vonnegut as a great American author and Slaughterhouse-Five as one of America's great novels, but I never really knew much about either of them. I think someone had once told me this was a book set during World War II, but I guess I'd forgotten that. I wasn't sure what to expect as I opened the novel...maybe something about working in slaughterhouses? I certainly wasn't expecting what I found...a strange little work of fiction that bounces around time nonlinearly and even into science fiction while exploring the ideas of fate, mortality and free-will.The book opens with an introductory preface explaining how the narrator (potentially Vonnegut's voice, but since it's a fictionalized introduction, he's distanced himself from it) is qualified to tell a story set in World War II and why he is writing the book. After this kind of odd introduction, we are thrown into the story of a man named Billy Pilgrim. The plot meanders through time and presents Billy's life in a very non-linear fashion. We jump back and forth between Billy's early life, his early experiences in the war, his time as a POW, and his post-war life. The events are often intermingled or juxtaposed in ways that make the plot line slightly disorienting.The narrator allows for this nonlinear jumping around through an odd element that really caught me off guard. This is also a science fiction novel. About midway through his life, Billy is abducted by aliens...Tralfamadorians. He is taken to their planet and placed in a zoo within a \\"cage\\" built to resemble a human home. The Tralfamadorians have a different concept of time....they see in four-dimensions. They see and experience all moments of time in a single instant. Past, Present and Future exist all at once to them. As Billy spends time in their zoo, he becomes \\"unstuck in time\\" and also experiences life in four dimensions with everything very nonlinear.The narrative is an examination of Billy's life in a way that lets us see how events lead to consequences. But the causality shown is presented in a very matter-of-fact way. Everything happens. It just happens. Even if you know the future ahead of time (as the Tralfamadorians do...and as Billy later does), there isn't any desire to stop things from happening or alter the future in any way. In fact, they suggest that fate cannot be changed.Billy is a soldier (really a chaplain's aid, and not very well trained as a soldier) captured by the Germans in World War II and taken to Dresden in time to be present for the bombing that destroyed the city and many/most of its inhabitants. After the war he returns home to become an optometrist and marries the daughter of a prominent optometrist in his town. Around this time he is taken by the aliens and spends time in their zoo and becomes unstuck in time. After he returns to Earth, he begins telling the world about his experience. Finally he announces that he knows how, where and when he will be killed...and then it happens. So it goes.The narrator apologizes for the length and jumbled nature of the book and excuses it by pointing out that there is \\"nothing intelligent to say about a massacre.\\" Even though he points out that this book is about the War and the bombing of Dresden, much of the book takes place outside of the War but in a way that comments on war and mortality.The style of writing is very straightforward and direct. The sentences and overall structure is short and to the point. The plot itself is fairly simplistic either as a war novel or as a science fiction novel. And yet, the whole package is very thick and nuanced with all sorts of strange ideas and themes. I suspect that it is this depth within simplicity that has made this novel stand out.Through the circular timeline as well as textual repetition, the author makes subtle points again and again. Probably the most commonly repeated phrase in the book is the sentence \\"So it goes\\" which the author writes every time someone or something dies. It's a very matter-of-fact commentary on the nature of death. This short refrain is almost humorous when juxtaposed against some of the more tragic or horrific deaths within the book. On the one sense it seems to speak to the desensitizing nature of war that the narrator and Billy can both look at death in such a nonchalant manner.In another sense it emphasizes the authors Tralfamadorian notion that death is just part of life and there's nothing especially noteworthy about it. This concept (coupled with the idea of fate and lack of any personal will) creates a sort of passive view of life and existence. To me this is a pretty depressing viewpoint. Essentially it negates any personal choices I might make, suggesting that \\"it\\" (the universe?) already knows what choices I'm going to make and my entire path is plotted. This sort of thinking is a little paradoxical in my mind. If we take out agency and tell somebody that no matter what they do, they're going to have this outcome, then a person could become apathetic, lazy and despondent and not do anything...and as a result, fate must necessarily change to accommodate the change in behavior. Or had fate already accounted for the lackadaisical change in attitude and integrated it into your path. All in all, fate and predestination are strange concepts that I just can't get behind. I guess I'm not Tralfamadorian enough yet. ;)Overall I'm not entirely sure yet what to make of this book. Generally speaking, I enjoyed it. Emotionally I found myself bouncing around. Sometimes I would laugh at the absurdity of things or at the attitudes of the characters. Other times I was horrified at the senseless tragedy of war and the destruction and death that comes with it. I do acknowledge that it should be read by a more mature audience if only for some of the language and some of the descriptions of war scenes. They aren't overly graphic, but certainly not intended for kids.There are a lot of themes and concepts ripe to be unpacked and considered. From merely a plot standpoint, this is a strange little book that can be entertaining. From a deeper sense, this is a book worth exploring. I definitely see why it is held up as among the \\"great literature\\" of modern times.*****4.5 out of 5 stars"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS BOOK.

However the story and the characters and the unique structure and take on World War II in this novel was really intriguing.

The book explored some interesting themes such as free will vs. destiny. It was told in an unstructured way which left me wondering if there was a reason behind it being told the way it was. I also wondered if there was some grand revelation at the end of the story that would explain the popularity of the book. I finished the book and never figured the above out.The book could best be classified as dark humor / sci fi, but the humor didn't appeal to me. The book wasn't a chore to read, but I didn't find it compelling in any way. When I finished it left me wondering what all the fuss was about.

Kurt Vonnegut & Lawrence Durrell were sources of wonder & delight during my 20-something years. Now at 60-something The Alexandrian Quartet seems over-wrought, like too many raisins in the cake, while Slaughterhouse Five, a sure five-star read then, now for me hovers between three & four stars. (In deference to my younger self I have opted for four.)Vonnegut did shake up the conventional novel structure with his mix of memoir, space travel & war-story all told in his signature, deceptively easy style. Optometrist Billy Pilgrim is a deliberately nondescript hero who lives through the horror of Dresden bombings, time-jumps & occasionally lands on the planet of Tralfamadore where he is a zoo exhibit, mating with a porn star.Vonnegut deals with time, fate & war without being remotely ponderous. So what's not to like? It is a book of semi-expressed ideas, sometimes too much in love with its own iconoclasm.

It was one of many antiwar books that I read. Reading it again now brought greater appreciation as to the ingenuity and quality of the book. By juxtaposing one of the more horrific acts of the war to the innocence of its main character, billy pilgrim, Vonnegut paints a picture of war that none can justify.By making billy a time traveler and visitor of tralfamadore, a planet where all time is present, he makes the firebombing forever there, a constant symbol of the nature of man and of war.For some reason I never read any other Vonnegut books. I don't know why. This second serving has wet my appetite to make up for lost time.So it goes"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I thought Slaughterhouse-Five was remarkably creative, especially if you take into account when it was written. Basically, it's a dark but sometimes funny story told through the eyes of a misfit who's floating through war (and the rest of his life) without really caring if he lives or dies, hardly understanding anything that's going on around him, and making very few value judgments as to what it all means or whether it's good or bad. The thing is, I kept wondering what Vonnegut was saying by creating a protagonist like this. In other words, why was the main character so accepting of everything he saw and experienced? Why did he keep repeating the phrase \\"So it goes\\"? I found these questions especially interesting considering that the main character's fictional experiences clearly parallel some of Vonnegut's own experiences.For instance, it's well known that Vonnegut was himself present at the firebombing of Dresden, Germany, that he was one of the few survivors of the attack which killed more people than the atomic bomb at Hiroshima, that he survived only because he was locked up in an underground slaughterhouse as a POW. And in the autobiographical first chapter of Slaughterhouse-Five, Vonnegut writes that \\"there would always be wars,\\" and, even if there were no more wars, \\"there would still be plain old death.\\" Can we therefore assume that Vonnegut believes the attitude we should take toward death and war is the same detached resignation displayed by the main character in Slaughterhouse-Five? I thought about that for a little while and did a bit of research, and in the end I don't think that's what Vonnegut was trying to say.As noted by William Rodney Allen, \\"despite its mask of Tralfamadorian indifference, Slaughterhouse-Five conveys at times an almost childlike sense of shock that the world is such a violent place.\\" Looking at it from that perspective, Slaughterhouse-Five's main character is probably the opposite of indifferent: he's someone who cares so deeply about the indignity of the senseless death all around him that he's no longer able to care. It seems that he's suffering from something like post-traumatic-stress disorder, so much so that he's forced to create an elaborate metaphysical scheme to explain what he's seen. Or, as Vonnegut put it: \\"There's nothing intelligent to say about a massacre.\\" Thus, although the main character survived, he is nevertheless haunted by \\"a great big secret somewhere inside,\\" a secret that Allen described as \\"the awareness of the horrors of war and the certainty of death,\\" an awareness that Allen says could not be covered up by the materialism of postwar America.On a side note, I also found Allen's interpration of Paul Lorezzo very interesting. [SPOILER ALERT:] Allen argues that when the main character is hunted and killed by Lorezzo, a paranoid sadist the protagonist had met decades earlier during the war, the experience can be seen as \\"an emblem of the fact that a soldier can never really escape his war experiences, that they will always \`track him down' even years later,\\" even if on the surface it seems that the war left him unscathed. Ultimately, I think I agree with Allen: \\"Slaughterhouse-Five is built on the paradox that it appears to offer acceptance and even indifference as responses to the horrors of the twentieth century, when in fact it is a moving lament over those horrors, a piercing wail of grief over the millions of dead in World War II.\\""},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"\\"Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time\\"(23). After his involvement in World War II, Kurt Vonnegut Jr. became an established author, with one of his most famous novels being Slaughterhouse Five. Slaughterhouse Five tells the story of Billy Pilgrim, a man from Ilium, New York, his participation in World War II and his travels through time. Because of his background in the war and his personal views on war, Vonnegut's creation of an anti-war novel is quite effective, while entertaining at the same time.Kurt Vonnegut Jr. was born in 1922 in Indianapolis, Indiana. In 1943 Vonnegut enlisted in the army and in 1944 he was taken prisoner at the Battle of the Bulge. Like his main character Billy Pilgrim who was locked in a meat locker under a slaughterhouse during the Dresden bombing, Kurt Vonnegut too emerged from a meat locker under a slaughterhouse to find Dresden a pile of ashes and 130,000 dead. This inspired Vonnegut to write Slaughterhouse Five, bringing not only an interesting plot-line to his novel, but personal experience as well. The publication date of Slaughterhouse Five is also notable. The novel was first published in 1969, during the United States' involvement in the Vietnam War. Slaughterhouse Five, an anti-war novel by Kurt Vonnegut Jr., a critic of the conflict in Vietnam, made a strong statement about Vietnam. He shows many similarities of the Vietnam conflict in the novel.Slaughterhouse Five begins with Kurt Vonnegut narrating, telling the story of how he always wanted to write about his experience in Dresden. He then shares what he came up with about his experience in Dresden, but it is \\"short and jangled...because there is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre\\"(19). Billy Pilgrim then becomes the narrator, narrating his war memories and his travels through time. Throughout the novel he shares his experiences in the war, in his childhood, in the present and, the most interesting, his travels through time to Tralfamadore. On Tralfamadore he learns to focus at the happy moments in his life because the Tralfamadorians believe that when someone dies, that person, \\"is in a bad condition in that particular moment, but that same person is just fine in plenty of other moments\\"(27). Knowing this, throughout the novel he does not fear his death, he just focuses on more important moments in his life.When Vonnegut set out to write Slaughterhouse Five, his goal was to \\"write about the destruction of Dresden\\"(2), and his thoughts of war in general. After reading the novel, I believe Kurt Vonnegut Jr. did a wonderful job not only of accomplishing what he set out to do, but also writing an interesting novel for all to read. One addition to the novel that confused me was the entire Tralfamadorian component. It seemed as though this science fiction component clouded the focus of the novel, Vonnegut's views of war. Although this segment may have clouded the focus of the book, Vonnegut was able to work it into the novel in such a way that it added meaning to the novel, while still playing a minor role to the war issue. Science fiction is a part of Kurt Vonnegut's writing style and I believe his novels would be incomplete without at least some science fiction. Overall, Vonnegut accomplished his goals, while also making it a novel interesting to read.Slaughterhouse Five represents the best of Kurt Vonnegut's writing. Written as both a science fiction novel about Billy Pilgrim's travels to Tralfamadore, and a social comment on war and destruction, Vonnegut accomplished his goals thoroughly and completely. I would recommend this novel to science fiction fans, Kurt Vonnegut fans, or fans of reading in general."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"In the novel Slaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut, The life of a soldier, Billy Pilgrim, in World War 2 is portrayed through misery, suffering, and self realization. Throughout the story, however, Billy, travels in time after discovering the secrets of time travel from an alien world called Tralfamadore. In one paragraph of the story, he could be a P.O.W. in World War 2. In another, he could be back home in Illium, Illinois. However in chronological order, after fighting in the war, Billy finds himself back at optometry school where he marries a woman named Valencia. Later on Billy describes his ubduction by aliens in which he is displayed in a zoo like environment. When Billy returns to Earth he becomes the only survivor in a plane crash. Ironically, his wife dies soon after. Throughout the telling of Billy's Story, told by a character named Yon Yonsen introduced at the beginning of the novel, Billy's life shows how easy it is to remember and how hard it is to forget. And that even though our pasts might be difficult, we still have to recognize them and embrace them in order to learn more about ourselves during the present. Overall I enjoyed this book a great deal because of the authors realistic descriptions and interesting look into the meaning of time."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This is a novel that I would like to suggest to anyone. Simply saying, it is enjoyable, yet thought provoking. Along with the attractiveness of a science fiction novel, it addresses various points, not only the gruesome aspects of the war but also issues involving crimes and punishments.Despite the fact that the fire-bombing of Dresden was as worse as the atomic-bomb attack in Hiroshima, not many people gave attention to it, maybe because it didn't involve advanced and historical weapons, or didn't affect the overall war effort greatly. However, the number of people who died still matters. They are the same lives as the people who died by the atomic bomb. And this book's attempt to turn people's attention to the Dresden massacre has succeeded, performing its antiwar purpose.The novel also shows war criminals that have been punished, including Campbell who have committed suicide before getting a trial on treason, and poor old Edgar Derby who was sentenced to death because of a teapot that he took from the remaining. In addition, Billy later gets killed by an assassin because of a crime that he didn't even commit during the war. These examples show that punishments given during wars can't be fair, again emphasizing the injustice of war.It was a unique attempt to combine a nonfiction war story with a sci-fi, and I believe that it was quite successful. I guarantee that the readers' trips to Dresden and Tralfamadore with Billy would be both worthwhile and entertaining."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughter House Five is a great book, PERIOD. As a soldier currently serving in Iraq, I always jump at an opportunity to read any book that is labeled as \\"anti-war\\". After hearing some friends talk about the book, I decided to read it for my own. Words cannot express the adventure, comedy, and horror I felt as I read the book.The book follows the life of Billy Pilgrim, in the many phases of his life. After Billy is abducted by aliens, he learns how to \\"time-hop\\" and the reader is treated to Billy Pilgrim in different points of his life. The reader is taken along Billy's journeys as he is stuck in time (as the aliens, Tramaldforians explained humans are) while he visits different parts of his life. The reader follows Billy as a young P.O.W. in World War II, an optometrist in his \\"middle years\\", and the voice of the Tramaldforians in his later years. Throughout each phases of his life the reader is given glimpses of what is, has, and always will be of Billy Pilgrim.The center focus of the book is the bombing of Dresden, which by some accounts rivals the destruction of Hiroshima, and the TOTALLY destructive nature of war.Billy Pilgrim is a chaplin's assistant in World War II that is taken as a prisoner. The book follows his accounts of his capture, then jumps to other parts of his life. Most notably, later on in his life he is abducted by aliens and taken to another planet, Tramalfodor, where he learns that there is a fourth-dimension where Earthlings can travel in time.Quite frankly it is difficult to give a clear outline of this book as it is not your \\"standard\\" work of ficition. The book is written in a matter of factly type way. Concurrent with the standard of the fourth dimension, as taught to Billy by the aliens, all time is existing at the same time. Therefore, Billy can visit any part of his life and never really dies in the natural sense. he always will live, stuck (or unstuck rather) in time.I believe that this book is a great example of what a war book should be. Instead of painting the people in war as heroes and men without fear, this book puts a realistic face on what REALLY goes on. Unforetunately, most war novels and movies potray war with strong men, who prevail at all costs, not this book. Vonnegut, places a human face and war that shows that war is hell, and most times (as with the Iraqi Crisis) it is fought by children. These children are like any other human beings, yet our society has gone through great lengths to make the horrible atrocities of war seems ok, or even heroic. War is has definately been over-hyped throughout the ages, and this book did a good job of bringing war down to what is really is, hell.The story contains very few characters, and even less description into these individuals. The author admits that this was done on purpose, because there are no individuals in war. Opposite to what movies would have you believe (I guess realistic stuff is boring) soldiers for the most part are not individuals, they are one. They wear the same clothes, eat the same food, and generally have the same struggles. Throughout the books Vonnegut's style and prose make this very clear, which makes the story even more compelling.After reading the book, I have become very interested and curious about the bombing of Dresden. From my initial research, the bombing was definately a great kind against human kind, by some accounts over 100,000 civilians were killed in the massacre order by the Royal Air Force and the United States Air Force. Still most people do not even have the slightest ideal of the carnage that took place on Feb. 13th, 1945. Vonnegut's book, however, paints a clear picture that is funny, sad, and serious all at the same time.I would sugguest reading the book, then reading it again to really get a true understanding of the ideal that Vonnegut is trying to express. While the simple narrative of the story is misleading, the book has really raised some strong convictions about the way that I have viewed war. While I am not a pacificist or idealist, I believe that Vonnegut gave a good account of the wages of war. Just read and see!"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This is a fantastic book, one of the best I have ever read (it is also by a considerable distance Vonnegut's best).As usual for Vonnegut the book is basically an exposition of his psyche. This time combining large themes WWII, the bombing of Dresden, inevitability, time travel and a non-linear existence to produce a truly compelling book.Some will dislike Vonnegut's idiosyncratic prose and his tendency towards flippancy. Personally, I find his prose engaging and entertaining - he is capable to conjuring up quite vivid imagery, and being funny and moving (often at the same time).This book contains a couple of my favourite moments - the wonderful image of the planes flying backwards over Dresden and restoring it (how I wish Martin Amis had never read it - maybe he wouldn't have written Time's Arrow) and the idea that he would keep returning to his favourite moment - sitting on the back of a hay wagon in Dresden.Read it!"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughterhouse 5, or Slaughterhouse five, or The Children's Crusade, also called A Duty-Dance with Death, is described by the author Kurt Vonnegut's alter-ego, Billy Pilgrim as a \`fourth-generation German-American now living in easy circumstances on Cape Cod [and smoking too much], who, as an American Infantry Scout Hors De Combat, As a prisoner of war, witnessed the fire-bombing of Dresden, Germany, \\"The Florence of the Elbe,\\" a long time ago, and survived to tell the tell. This is a novel somewhat in the telegraphic schizophrenic manner of tales of the planet Tralfamadore, where the flying saucers come from. Peace.' So it goes.The book is an anti-war book, but tells us that it is about as useful being an anti-war book, as being an anti-typhoon book, meaning that some things will never change. Vonnegut tells us this by giving us the story of Billy Pilgrim, whose most important role in life was to witness the secret American British bombing of Dresden, where 135,000 died, and who spent most of his time as an American Prisoner of War, a survivor who can tell the youth of today what war is all about, by using his shellshock trauma induced time travel capabilities, given to him by the Tralfamadore aliens, to revisit the war, so that he can write a book about it, goes to see old war buddies, becoming unstuck in time, his life as a series of scenes in a non-linear fashion which ends up making linear sense, even though it did not at the time. So it goes.Slaughterhouse 5 is a very interesting and somewhat touching series of events that finally all come home to roost in the final pages, the loss of man is the gain of man, whether we like it or not, is not the point, Darwin told us that this is what we are designed to do, Billy Pilgrim becomes an optometrist in the process, marries a woman who suddenly has a series problem, while Bill ends up in a zoo on an alien planet to produce children with Montana Wildhack, a famous movie actress, while trying to write his Dresdon story, filled with death, a plane accident where he was the only survivor following his POW term, fact from fiction, he thinks the rescue party are nazis, it sets off the time travel again. So it goes.Vonnegut is not all down and war depressing however. His humour captured brilliantly by such antics as considering the money tree that grew hundred dollar bills, gems and bank bonds, feeding off the people who met the quicksand by its base, or a young Jesus who once built a cross with his father so the Romans could use it to do something to a protestor that they didn't like. When the wit is there it scores in aces. You have never read the likes of such clowning around before, although compared to Joseph Heller's Catch 22, this one is more personal, less satirical, more direct and exposes that horrible World War II bombing of Dresden. In 1941 Charles Portal, A British Air Staff officer, put forward the idea that entire cities and towns should be bombed. Air Marshall Arthur Harris agreed in February 1942. It was napalmed in 1945. Vonnegut made it very public in this 1969 novel. It was revealed by the historian David Irving in 1963 in his publication, \\"The Destruction of Dresdon\\". So it goes.Billy spends the final days of his life out across New York looking to tell a radio show his story, ends up finding a world war II sci-fi book author's book as window dressing, attempts to buy the book as a memory keepsake because he met the author and knew the war buddy who introduced him to the books, and is nearly arrested, and or committed, old age coupled with the dying man's last bastion of whatever his mind can make of it all, gives us much to ponder in death, by remembering our lives, Pilgrim travels in his memory and says that death is living ones memories over and over again... so best be good... and enjoy life. So it goes."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"\\"Slaughterhouse-Five or The children's crusade\\" is the first book written by Vonnegut that I have read, and the experience has been quite good. After reading it, I realized that I had felt all kind of things at different times (or pages) of this book. I feel surprised by the lack of logic in some parts, enchanted by the wisdom of some phrases, and somewhat puzzled by some of the antics of the characters. But I didn't feel bored, not even once, and that is good news in my book...The story is told from the point of view of the writer, at least at the beginning. Shortly afterwards, the main narrator changes: now it is Billy Pilgrim, who like the writer is a former soldier in World War II. The writer and Billy survived the bombardment of Dresden, the city were both were held as prisioners of war (yes, Vonnegut was a POW in the 2nd WW). They stayed in a place called \\"Slaughterhouse 5\\", due to the mere fact that that placed used to be...a slaughterhouse.Billy has some peculiarities that no one else seems to share: he can become \\"unstuck\\" in time, going seamlessly from the present to the past or the future, and from there to the present again. He is also quite familiar with aliens, having spent a season with them in their planet (as a specimen in the Tralfamadorian zoo), and isn't shy to tell so. Of course, that brings him a few problems with his family, who wants him to upheld his image of respectable optometrist, but that cannot be helped.This work has an anti-war tone that pervades the whole book. That is evident in the musings of the characters on the absurdity of war, and on how illogical many actions were (a good example would be the bombardment of Dresden, a city that lacked war industries). Billy, one of the protagonists of the book, accepts things as they come, and after every death he simply says \\"So it goes\\". He probably is the best illustration of the fact that \\"There are almost no characters in this story, and almost no dramatic confrontations, because most of the people in it are so sick, and so much the listless playthings of enormous forces. One of the main effects of war, after all, is that people are discouraged from being characters...\\" Also, and even though Vonnegut writes that \\"there is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre\\", I think that thanks to this book he gives at least a good statement on the massacre of war.All in all, \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\" is a book beyond strange, so if you prefer linear stories, you are highly likely to dislike this one. If there is something that stands out in it, is its lack of chronological continuity. Despite that, I recommend it even to them, because who knows, they may like it. After all, this book has been considered a classic for many years now, so it certainly has some value. On the other hand, if you are one of those who prefer the unexpected in a book, you just must read it, because I'm certain you will love \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\".Belen Alcat"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"That the victims of the Dresden firebombing were, by and large, innocentbystanders caught in the cogs of a grisly machine called 'war' is irrefutable.That a man named Kurt Vonnegut was there, witnessed it from the ground-level(and below), and carried the psychological burden of it around with him foryears is obvious. That he was able to write such a brilliant book on such adark subject is, quite frankly, amazing.On the surface, \`Slaughterhouse-Five' deals with the trials and tribulations ofone Billy Pilgrim, ophthalmologist and erstwhile WWII chaplain's assistant,whose life is apparently filled with more death and destruction than his mindhas the capacity for. At least, that's what his daughter thinks when Billystarts behaving erratically. Little does she know that he has become unstuckin time, experiencing his life in a random, non-linear fashion forever. SinceBilly has no way of knowing what will come next, all he can do is enjoy thegood moments when they come, and deal with the bad as best he can.Who can make sense of a life like that?And in a larger sense Mr. Vonnegut asks us, who can make sense of a world wherepeople blow each other to bits for arbitrary reasons? What is there to say?It really is for the birds: poo-tee-weet.Truly a masterpiece of 20th-century literature. Should be required reading forevery high-school student."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I know this novel fairly well having read it several times (once aloud to my students). It is about all time being always present if only we knew, or could realize it, or had a sense about time in the same way we have senses for light and sound.It is also about the Allied fire bombings of Dresden which killed something like 25,000 people. (And so it goes.) Kurt Vonnegut begins as though writing a memoir and advises us that \\"All of this happened, more or less...\\" Of course it did not, and yet, as with all real fiction, it is psychologically true. His protagonist, Billy Pilgrim, an unlikely hero, somewhat in the manner of unlikely heroes to come like Forest Gump and the hero of Jerzy Kosinski's Being There, transcends time and space as he bumbles along. This is a comedie noire--a \\"black comedy\\"--not to be confused with \\"film noir,\\" a cinematic genre in which the bad guys may win or at least they are made sympathetic. In comedie noire the events are horrific but the style is light-hearted. What the genres have in common is a non-heroic protagonist.This is also a totally original work written in a most relaxing style that fuses the elements of science fiction with realism. It is easy to read (which is one of the reasons it can be found on the high school curriculum in our public schools). It is sharply satirical, lampooning not only our moral superiority, our egocentricity, but our limited understanding of time and space. And of course it is an anti-war novel in the tradition of All Quiet on the Western Front and Johnny Got His Gun.Vonnegut's view of time in this novel is like the stratification of an upcropping of rock: time past and time present are there for us to see, but also there is time future. Billy Pilgrim learns from the Tralfamadorians (who kidnapped him in 1967) that we are actually timeless beings who experience what we call the past, present and future again and again. And so Billy goes back to the war and forward to his marriage, and to Tralfamadore again and again. He learns that the Tralfamadorians see the stars not as bright spots of light but as \\"rarefied, luminous spaghetti\\" and human beings as \\"great millepedes with babies' legs at one end and old people's legs at the other.\\" So time is not a river, nor is it a snake with its tail in its mouth. It is omnipresent, yet some things occur before and some after, but always they occur again.And so it goes.What I admire most about this most admirable novel is how easily and naturally Vonnegut controls the narrative and how effortlessly seems its construction. It is almost as if Vonnegut sat down one day and let his thoughts wander, and when he was through, here is this novel.In a sense, Vonnegut invented a new novelistic genre, combining fantasy with realism, touched by fictionalized memoir, penned in a comedic mode as horror is overtaken by a kind of fatalistic yet humorous view of life. Note here the appearance of Kilgore Trout, Vonnegut's alter-ego, the science fiction writer who is said to have invented Tralfamadore.Bottom line: read this without preconceptions and read it without regard to the usual constraints. Just let it flow and accept it for what it is, a juxtaposition of several genres, a tale of fiction, that--as fiction should--transcends time and space.--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"The World Is Not as We Think It Is\\""},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughter House Five deserves its reputation of being a piece of great American literature. The book follows a young man, Billy Pilgrim through his life. Billy believes aliens, tralfamadorians to be exact, have abducted him. We assume that it's through these aliens that he learns to time travel, a skill he frequently uses. In the book Pilgrim bounces around time to all the various portions of his life, many times returning to World War II where he was captured, taken prisoner, and held in slaughterhouse five in Dresden, Germany. He seems to be defined by this moment in his life as he frequently returns there. If you know anything about Vonnegut, you know that he too was held in Dresden, Germany when the city was firebombed. This is the major setup for this antiwar novel as Dresden was home to over 100,000 persons while at the same time Dresden didn't have any industry lending itself to the war effort. Obviously you wander, &quot;Then why was this city bombed? What advantage came from killing well over 100,000 thousand civilians?&quot;One of the major themes of the book is fate. The prayer of serenity appears twice in the book stating that we need to change the things we can and be wise enough to know which things we cannot change. Also the Tralfamadorians speak of fate. They say they know how the universe is going to end, but they do nothing to stop it. Vonnegut seems to say that yes, war is one of those things we cannot avoid, but we need to change the things we can about it, like the atrocious bombing of Dresden.Overall, the book's message is clear, and Vonnegut delivers his message in a very accessible way. The story of Billy Pilgrim is enjoyable to read, and contains more than dry philosophy that some antiwar novels are filled with."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This novel is essential in many ways. It is undoubtedly one of the best-written, most well respected novels of the 20th century (No. 6 on the list that was a compilation of all the other lists) and is, therefore, essential to your understanding of 20th century fiction. If you have never read Vonnegut, this book should be the first one you read: it is the most famous and one of the best and really captures the essence of Vonnegut. Finally, despite its literary merit, this is a FUN book to read. You will laugh, you will think, but, most of all, you will enjoy reading it and you will finish it FAST.This should be your introduction to Vonnegut. I've found that true Vonnegut fans don't often choose Slaughterhouse-Five as their favorite, but, instead choose one of Vonnegut's other wonders (Breakfast of Champions, Cat's Cradle, Sirens of Titan, etc.). I think that most would agree that this is a good jumping off point, just as, in music, people often start with Greatest hits albums and then work from there.Only Vonnegut could make such a strange premise believable and emotional. The book shifts time and place from paragraph to paragraph without warning. It is about aliens and WWII. It all works so perfectly, however and is so profound to those who read carefully. Billy Pilgrim is one of the great characters in all of literature.Don't be scared off by aliens and the weird premise. It works better than 99% of so-called &quot;normal&quot; books. Absolutely ESSENTIAL.thanks {{{milo}}}"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Listen:Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five is really something else. I have to admit this is one of the few books where I saw the movie first (years ago), and about 3 years ago, I decided to read the novel. Left a deep impact on me, although I had a hard time understanding it.So a couple of months ago I saw the movie again, loved it again (although I normally detest movies done after books), and then decided to read all of Vonnegut's novels and shortstories, and chronologically this time, starting out with the promising Player Piano.Now I reread Slaughterhouse Five, and so far it is Vonnegut's best book. It is clearly an attempt to describe his impressions in World War Two and especially Dresden, but instead of writing a realistic novel about war, Vonnegut 'invents' a totally non-linear genre of science fiction that is absolutely unique in its scope.There is no suspense at all, because the novel's main character (not to call him hero) Billy Pilgrim is unstuck in time, which means he travels back and forth in time. We meet a young Pilgrim traumatized by his gun-loving father, a Pilgrim lost in World War Two, a Pilgrim married to the obese daughter of a rich John Birch Society nutcase and above all a happy Pilgrim living on Tralfamadore, a planet in a faraway solar system. All this is narrated in no particular order, and maybe the book needs to be read twice to get its scope, but it is worth it.Vonnegut's style also reaches a level that I haven't seen of him in the past, very bitter-sarcastic-loving-sweet... all at once. Every death is followed by a shrugged &quot;So it goes.&quot;, and paragraphes are often introduced with &quot;Listen:&quot;. In a heartwarming sad tale, Vonnegut tells us not only of the senselessness of war (where there are no crooks, just victims), but also teaches the reader a valuable moral: focus on the positive moments of your life.Then there are some characters which avid Vonnegut fans will love to see back: wretched sci-fi writer Kilgore Trout, millionaire Eliot Rosewater and American nazi Howard Campbell jr. Plus two goofs: the border between Luxembourg and Germany is a valley, not a hill, and people with an IQ of 103 are of average intelligence, not morons.Read this book though.Poo-tee-weet?"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Throughout the seemingly incoherent plot structure of Slaughterhouse-Five, Kurt Vonnegut illustrates not only his subtle outcry against the stupidity of war, but also his cynical views on the meaning of life. Although the novel is based upon the life of Billy Pilgrim, an optometrist correcting the vision of people on Earth, and his experiences leading up to the bombing of Dresden, Germany during World War II, the time-setting fluctuates as Billy comes \\"unstuck\\" in time to view his past and future. This fluctuation may confuse the reader at first, but soon becomes clear, revealing the purpose behind the masterfully chosen timeline. The apparent random structure of the tale holds within it Vonnegut's ideas on the circular nature of life and existence of fate. He first hints to this in the first chapter as he quotes a song that continues through infinite, just as a circle. As the story progresses, the Tralfamadorian aliens are introduced, providing the basis for the abnormal writing style. The Tralfamadorians write in such a way that all events of the book are read at once so that the scenes \\"produce an image of life that is beautiful and surprising and deep\\" (88). Although his abduction by aliens is only a part of his imagination, forced into existence by the stresses of war and the influences of his favorite science fiction novelist, it plays a major roll in Billy's \\"so it goes\\" attitude toward life and causes him to act in such a way that people are eventually repelled by him. Just as the aliens introduce Billy to infinite, they also reveal the nature of fate. Because these creatures can see through time, they already know the outcome of all events, even the one that destroys the universe. Because they know that nothing can change this, they find that the human concept of free will is hilariously preposterous. Vonnegut also includes his anti-war position throughout the whole mess. In the autobiographical first chapter, he even states that this is an anti-war book. This is further supported by his alternate title, The Children's Crusade, referring to the episode during the great Crusades when thousands of children marched to their deaths. The parallel between Billy's capture in Germany and his capture by the aliens also reveals his attitude. Billy asks the aliens why he was chosen out of all the people on Earth. They only respond \\"Why you? Why us for that matter? Why anything?\\" (76). When he is captured in Germany, a soldier is asked \\"Why me?\\" and he replies \\"Vy you? Vy anybody?\\" (91). This connection between the aliens and the war create a sense that war is stupid. His repeated use of \\"human beings\\" in his description of the Nazi transport train forces the reader to realize that these are actual people in this terrible environment. Vonnegut's beliefs in life and war can clearly be seen through the workings of Slaughterhouse-Five as he constantly changes the timeline. These beliefs are all very important to the meaning of the book, but none more than his idea that life is meaningless in a structured time."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Kurt Vonnegut's novel \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" is one of those great books that defies easy classification. A blend of science fiction, satire, and war fiction, it is both fun and grim. The book tells the story of Billy Pilgrim, an optometrist, World War II veteran, and apparent UFO abductee who becomes \\"unstuck in time.\\" We accompany Billy back and forth from his wartime experiences to his encounters with aliens and to other events in his remarkable life.\\"Slaughterhouse\\" is greatly enlivened by a colorful, richly imagined cast of supporting characters: American-turned-Nazi Howard W. Campbell, movie star Montana Wildhack, and more. But probably the most resonant of these amazing creations is Kilgore Trout, the underappreciated science fiction writer.The book has an intriguing structure. Vonnegut's prose is a joy to experience: he combines a sort of Hemingwayesque simplicity with a knack for rendering startling, and often ridiculous, details. He is often very ironic and funny. Along the way, he explores ideas about free will and the nature of time. Much of the book is about writing itself.In this book there is an intriguing reference to Stephen Crane's classic \\"The Red Badge of Courage\\"; perhaps this reference is Vonnegut's way of directly connecting with the tradition of American war fiction. But this book transcends that genre. \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" is sad, surreal, whimsical, brutal, and oddly gentle. It's a remarkable book; I highly recommend it. As an interesting companion text, try \\"The Things They Carried,\\" Tim O'Brien's excellent book about the Vietnam War."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"For a truly surreal reading experience, it doesn't get much better than Kurt Vonnegut's seminal science fiction/drama novel \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\". Ostensibly an anti-war novel, \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" transports the readers to many different places and times following the journey of the unimpressive Billy Pilgrim. Billy is a sad, pathetic individual who seems to have spent almost all of his existence just mindlessly wandering from one station in life to the next without much enthusiasm for it or even much interest. He's the kind of person that, if you saw him walking down the street or met him at a party, he would leave absolutely no impression. Billy, like many in his generation, served in World War II. The story (stories) of this novel center on the Dresden fire bombings in the last days of the war and his survival in an underground shelter, the aforementioned 'slaughterhouse five'. He survived the war, went back home, became an optometrist, got married, and had a life with all the trappings of suburbia. None of it really seems to matter to him, though. He would have been content to die in WWII for he did not want to fight. He was joke to those that served with him in a German POW camp. Even in his own life back home, Billy wasn't much. He married relatively unattractive woman because that's what people did. His colleagues didn't have much respect for him, nor did his own children in later years. So, what was Billy Pilgrim's purpose for existing? He seemed to think it was to spread the message of an alien race about becoming 'unstuck in time'.\\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" departs from any semblance of normal story-telling formats. As Billy Pilgrim has become 'unstuck in time', he feels he exists in an environment where, instead of time being one chronological line, it is a series of points that exist concurrently and perpetually. Billy falls asleep a widower and wakes up on his wedding day. He may revisit his war experience or go back to childhood. Billy journeys all over time because, where he's concerned, everything that has happened and will happen is all happening at the same time. Perhaps it is the influence of the aliens that enable him to think this way, or perhaps Billy is really just suffering from severe post-traumatic stress following the Dresden bombing. Either way, Billy is missing something in his life. His journeys through time are his way to try and find meaning in a life where none exists. It is a unique and existential journey for the reader and one definitely worth taking. So it goes."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Kurt Vonnegut creates an intricate and creative story of science fiction while still writing an anti-war novel. &quot; Slaughterhouse-Five &quot; focuses on an incredibly silly character named Billy Pilgrim. After a series of tragic events, aliens called Tralfamadorians abduct Pilgrim. These aliens have the ability to travel to any moment in time whenever they wish. They teach Pilgrim how to travel through time and we find him constantly traveling back and forth through his own life at random. We find Pilgrim one moment reliving the firebombing of Dresden and on the very next page teeing off at a country club ten years later. Incidents exactly like this can be found adorned through the book along with Vonnegut's distinct wit and black humor. One of the stronger points in the book deals with free will and predestination. Billy Pilgrim and the aliens believe that everyone's life is set in stone and everything that we do was destined to happen. One Tralfamadorian tells Pilgrim, I've visited thirty-one inhabited planets in the universe, and I have studied reports on one hundred more. Only on Earth is there any talk of free will.&quot; If such a thing were true then obviously the notion of free will is nothing more than human imagination used to fool ourselves. Thought provoking subjects such as this grab the reader's attention and never lets go. Although the writing style is a bit strange and takes time to get used to, Vonnegut manages to weave an intricately detailed world of laughter, war horrors, and moral issues. Slaughterhouse-Five is a truly creative and incredibly entertaining read which comes highly recommended."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Kurt Vonnegut, Jr.,is a self-described \\"trafficker in climaxes and thrills and characterization and wonderful dialogue and suspense and confrontations.\\" To this end, \\"Slaughterhouse-Five or the Children's Crusade: A Duty Dance With Death,\\" is a brilliant and outrageous antiwar book about the catastrophic World War II fire bombing of Dresden, Germany.Vonnegut delivers serious messages coated in humor. For instance, early in the narrative he states that there is \\"nothing intelligent to say about a massacre.\\" And then adds, \\"I have told my sons that they are not under any circumstances to take part in massacres, and that the news of massacres of enemies is not to fill them with satisfaction or glee.\\" The author then drives his convictions home by clearly explaining, \\"I have also told them not to work for companies which make massacre machinery, and to express contempt for people who think we need machinery like that.\\"This is a remarkable book. Vonnegut expresses his antiwar outrage with blistering humor. And by the way...Billy Pilgrim and the Tralfamadorians will leave you in stitches. So it goes.Bert Ruiz"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"One of those books where after you read it you look at your copy and wonder how something of such power could be put on paper. Through Billy Pilgrim's experience with the aliens of Tralfamadore which take the reader to-and-fro various parts of Billy's life, you'll see that this book isn't so much about war but about how life gets caught up in war. Very offbeat book with loads of great parts, both sad and funny.Through Billy Pilgrim, an unfit soldier who had a horrible and embarrasing experience in WWII, Vonnegut paints a keen portrait of life. Like all Vonnegut books, this one has a load of great characters, including my favorite Vonnegut character Kilgore Trout (you gotta love his stories). Many of the characters are startlingly close to life. Soom good and some bad. Some make you see how rotten people can be, others make you see how wonderful (I know far too many Paul Lazzaros and far too few Elliot Rosewaters).When Vonnegut writes from a first-person point of view, the character is narrating, and that's all there is to it. But when Vonnegut writes from a third-person point of view, it's not just narrated, Vonnegut makes sure you know that he himself is narrating, and he's writing this book. This book is third-person, and (as in Vonnegut's Breakfast of Champions) Kurt shows up in the pages. It really works well with this one. It cements this book's sense of reality when it could so easily float away (the plot does, after all, hinge around aliens in flying saucers)."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I usually dislike using the word \\"awesome\\" simply becuase it is so overused, but I know no other word that I could use to describe \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\" by Kurt Vonnegut without understating it's brilliance.A tale of the author's experiences in WWII told through the eyes of Billy Pilgrim, an unfortunate and rather foolish soldier who lives throught the fire-bombing of Dresden (which killed almost as many people as the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima) along with his adventures on the alien planet of Tralfamadorian and his travels through time, the book is one of the best pieces of American literature I have ever read.The schizophrenic style of writing, which may be had to get used to at first, helps to emphasize the chaotic nature of the war that the author lived through, and the sarcastic, cynical, nihilistic voice that Vonnegut uses throughout the book is excellent at showing the postwar trauma the Vonneguy must have suffered from and the horror of war that he had probably seen.A book that excellently reflects the morbid and violent side of war, as opposed to the novels of romanticism that tend to show war as a glorious fight for honor, Slaughterhouse-Five is one of those books that will open your eyes to the true, grim reality of the world if you bother to read it carefully. I would recommend it to anyone who would be willing to sit though a couple chapters of chaotic flashbacks in exchange for a fine piece of reading."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"\\"Slaughter House\\" is particularly timely to read now that the U.S. is engaged in morally questionable war in Iraq.Vonnegut's hero, Billy Pilgrim, is so scarred by the war horrors of WWII, that he steps out of reality, and begins to travel backwards and forwards in time, and even believes he is kidnapped by aliens. Despite the underlying humor of the book, the author reveals a sober reality: more people died in the meaningless firebombing of Dresden, Germany, than people that died in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. Yes, we won the war, but not without committing our own atrocities.Is war worth it? Do the ends justify the means? The reader is left to answer such questions, but if you read this in the shadow of Bush's Iraq, those questions are put into context."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This is my favorite Vonnegut so far. I didn't read it at first because the title was unappealing. But I enjoyed other Vonneguts, so eventually tried this one. It is excellent.One error keeps appearing in other reviews here that for some reason is bothering me. Billy's trip to Tralfamadore did NOT teach him how to travel in time, and he did NOT travel at will. On the first page of Chapter 2: \\"Billy is spastic in time, has no control over where he is going next, and the trips aren't necessarily fun.\\" Later in the same chapter: \\"The Tralfamadorians didn't have anything to do with his coming unstuck. They were simply able to give him insights into what was really going on.\\"Thank you for listening, and enjoy the book. One other thing: Chapter 1 may put you off and seem boring. If necessary, you could start at Chapter 2 (the real beginning) and read Chapter 1 later after you are hooked."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Obviously an amazing book...anything positive I say is understatement. After reading this I ordered an arm load of other Vonnegut books, and spent hours online reading about the author."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I don't feel like I got into this one as much. Lots of fun as far as Vonnegut's well-known writing style, and just as far out. I think the book will hold more meaning to me as I get older."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This was the second novel I've read by Vonnegut. The first was Hocus Pocus. I didn't enjoy this one nearly as much as Hocus Pocus, but it was still good. I really enjoy Vonnegut's writing style. He seems to scrap together bits and pieces of a story into a seamless and enjoyable read.For a novel about war, it was quite comical even though I would still rank it up there with All Quiet on the Western Front and Hiroshima. Vonnegut shows the ugly side of war and how it effects those that survive. If you enjoy war novels, this one is a little off the beaten path but still worth the time."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I think young people may have trouble understanding this book, which is about the experience of life. Told with great compassion, Vonnegut, in fact and in fiction both, is a mature man looking back on the tragedies he saw in his youth. Being \\"unstuck in time\\" can be seen as a metaphor for intrusive post-traumatic memories, and dissociated dreams, both of which happen to someone who has undergone great trauma. Vonnegut had the horror of his mother committing suicide when he was home on leave in WWII, and going from there to being a prisoner of war, seeing his friends shot and being forced to dig for rotting bodies in Dresden.Ethan Hawkes does a superior job of reading the book, gentle and without irony. I recommend his audiobook. ( Although I think they put pictures of World War One soldiers on the cover for some strange reason. )"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This book was very strange but interesting. It was very hard to follow in how he jumped from what was actually happening to things that have happened in the past, and then jumping to the present then random years. I found it very interesting because what he was talking about was very interesting.In the beginning of the book, he kept talking about how he always wanted to write a book about war, but could never think of enough details to put in it. He was also very humorous in telling random details about everything. He mentioned his wife and how he studied Optometry. How his daughter ended up marrying a Optometrist so it stayed in the family.This book was kind of crazy in the sence that he felt he was abducted by aliens. No one believed him. He ended up publishing letters in the newspaper. He thought that everyone would believe him if he kept writing letters.I thought it was pretty cool how Weary was from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (my hometown). You never find how people in a book from your city in a city like this.I didn't like, however, the random jumps of how he was in a different place he actually was there, and you didnt really understand how he got there and then he blinked and he was back into what he was doing before.I think that i would have liked it a lot more if the things went in a chronilogical order instead of jumping from year to year so that i would be able to follow it better. I also think that if it was like that it would have ruined the whole effect of the book.I like Vonnegut's style and i feel that i will read many more of his books."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"All in all I thought this book was good not great but definitely a book I would suggest to others. I was sorta lost in the beginning from all the different sections brought up at such a random pace, there was quite alot of scene hopping. Billy was shot with the drug Morphine causing him to pass out, then he woke up after the bombing and the war had ended, which started to complicate on my thoughts what really just happened. I was conceded with the fact that a man with such significance to lifes great aspects of becoming an optometrist and being so well academically inclined became a regiment in Luxembourg to fight against German troops in Belgium.I enjoyed the setting because they're places I am familiar with unlike most books that takes place in odd places. The book threw me off alot because at one point Billy was in war and the next Russian allie soldiers are taking over the city and Billy ends up goin back to school for optometry. After re-reading some parts I didn't understand them, I then started to slowly catch on after remembering his psychotic post-vietnam like syndrome.Just when I thought the book was making an impression, He gets abducted by aliens called Tralfamadorians (two foot tall toilet plungers.) After a little more reading in that section it started to seem like a psychotic fantasy. He was forced to mate with a movie actress who also was captured from earth though Billy is married to Valencia a heavy-set obese women seemingly that he wanted to be with a beautiful famous woman. Another good point in the novel is that it interlocks into different thoughts of each plotted scene. I really did enjoy my time reading this wonderful book by Kurt Vonnegut for where there were misunderstanding scenes it was made up of a well written novel. ****"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Kurt Vonnegut Jr. does a fantastic job in the writing of Slaughterhouse Five. In each and everything he goes into great detail about it in order to give the reader a descriptive view of every piece of the novel.This book is different from any other. As it goes through many different times of Billy Pilgrim's, the main character's life. Billy travels through times of his life to face many different situation.Although there is really no climax throughout the book, the reader is engaged at every moment waiting for the next time change to come. Vonnegut also keeps a constant theme running throughout each time period to tie the book together. With Vonnegut's skill of writing, he makes his book into one of the best.I highly recommend this book for any reader. If you are looking for an interesting read that will keep you engaged from start to finish then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut is a very well-written book. Vonnegut does an excellent job of keeping your attention by adding certain aspects of humor to a very solemn subject. The time-travel can get a bit confusing at times, but is easily understood after a little thought. He adds in certain passages that have nothing to do with anything, with absolutely no meaning, then triggers the reader to try to interpret what he was talking about by asking why. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in an entertaining anti-war book."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"After introducing himself and his own war story, Vonnegut narrates the war stories of fictional Billy Pilgrim, who like himself survived the firebombing of Dresden, Germany. Like a storyteller commanding his audience's attention Vonnegut begins: \\"Listen: Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time.\\" He has taken his own true story of Dresden and painted fictional Billy Pilgrim into the frame. But he has also constructed the rest of Billy's life and the devastating consequences of witnessing that massacre. And just as Billy has \\"told\\" it to him, Vonnegut tells us Billy has begun to move freely and involuntarily in Time. He says now that he's done this for years. He says.There is something wrong with Billy and he doesn't know what. He finds himself weeping silently and he doesn't know why. He's almost catatonic emotionally but he doesn't see it. When a barbershop quartet triggers a memory of Dresden and he nearly collapses from the sudden emotional load, Billy begins to understand. \\"Billy thought he had no secrets from himself and now here clearly was a great big one.\\" Not long after, Billy suffers a terrible head injury in a plane crash and begins talking of aliens and time travel and the wonderful things he has learned from the Tralfamadorians: that nobody ever dies but lives on forever in another moment in time. It's not hard to understand how a man who witnessed the massacre of Dresden (among other things) could find himself rationalizing so much death by simply denying that Time exists, so that no one is ever truly dead or gone.Slaughterhouse-Five is well deserving of its reputation as one of the great works of the 20th Century. While superficially farcical sci-fi, the careful reader will find a tale that is devastatingly sad--and not science fiction at all. Billy's madness might seem comic on one level but it is also heartbreaking. Vonnegut's unconventional story structure is richly layered and as fragile as Billy himself, and the time travel allows Vonnegut to relate events from the war against events in Billy's later life directly, in adjacent paragraphs if he wishes, so that as the boxcars of war prisoners move steadily towards Dresden our understanding of Billy's madness becomes clearer until finally the reader is flashing back and forth between the night of the bombing and its aftermath on one hand and on the other Billy going public with his delusions for the first time, explaining time and Tralfamadore to a late-night radio audience many years later. (And unconsciously borrowing details from Kilgore Trout to flesh out his story.)Vonnegut's prose is flawless, handling the strange structure with utter clarity and weaving together a devastating and subtle fictional portrait of a man unglued with an important factual historical document about Dresden. In war scenes Vonnegut refuses to make heros out of anyone. These soldiers, for the most part, are babies, teenagers, lost and starving and freezing to death far from home. There are no parts for John Wayne, as the author says. By the same token Slaughterhouse-Five doesn't need to create a laughing nut out of Billy and his delusions, and Vonnegut doesn't try to. This is a character whose humanity has been completely destroyed by the violence and death he has witnessed. He emerges helpless and plaintive, wanting desperately to understand. And while his new understanding of Time may have amusing qualities, at it's heart it is profound sadness. We weep silently with Billy, both for him and for ourselves."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This story, &quot;Slaughterhouse Five,&quot; has basically one character that Vonnegut hasn't removed from the story at one time of another. &quot;Slaughterhouse Five,&quot; is however, filled with antagonists. Valencia, his wife, has appeared throughout the story for brief moments in time. The schoolteacher, Derby, has too been mentioned and appeared on numerous occasions in the book. Kilgor Trout also is a character that is there, but not all of the time.The story takes place in many settings. The main setting, however, is Dresden, Germany. Throughout the story the narrator travels through time to many locations. He could be in his hometown of Ilium one moment and then be whisked away to the far away planet of Tralfamadore. He has been to the Swiss Alps and to Canada. The story's setting changes many times, but always comes back to Germany.Kurt Vonnegut intends to convey the anti-war theme in &quot;Slaughterhouse Five,&quot; by showing the horror of war. He does this by describing the Dresden fire bombing during World War Two. Vonnegut uses many literary devices to convey his theme. He definitely uses flashbacks through time. He also repeats one single phrase throught the story, he always says &quot;so it goes,&quot; right after or before someone dies. Vonnegut does describe the war very well, and certainly conveys his ideas. In my opinion this book was a little hard to read and to keep up with, but it was overall a fairly good book."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"&#65533;LISTEN: Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time.&#65533; The hero of Slaughterhouse-Five, Billy Pilgrim, is never sure what part of his life is going to occur next. Kurt Vonnegut&#65533;s genius, creative, and moving novel tells Billy Pilgrim&#65533;s story in just that way. Billy&#65533;s life begins in the upstate New York town of Ilium in 1922 and ends more than 50 years later, when he is a prosperous bourgeoisie optometrist. However, the book swings back and forth through time revealing pieces of his life one by one. The novel is a strong anti-war story, dominated by the horror of the experience of Dresden. However, these facts are broken and reorganized by another component in Billy&#65533;s strange life. Aliens from the planet Tralfamadore abduct him late in his life. They teach him that they can see time all at once. This is how Billy comes to experience his life as unstuck in time. Warping from his death to his childhood and from the ever-present experience of Dresden to his abduction.Slaughterhouse-Five was a terrific book.

I don't have to summerize it, as many others have done so, so I'll just skip to what I have to say. This book is one of the only books I've read that completely lets the reader deside what this book means to him/herself. There's also plenty of praise out there, so I'll shoot down some of the odvious misconceptions some of these other reviewers have about the book. This book is not ment to be a character study. It doesn't try to be, and it shouldn't be judged as one. The characters are pawns that Mister Vonnegut uses to tell us what we need to hear. This book is not character based. It is theme based wholly, and the charcters are not there to give us depth, but to act out what needs to be said by the author. This book is also not a typical novel, and people can't say they are annoyed about the random order of events, or the lack of a resolution. This book is made to fit the reader. I would highly reccomend this book to anyone who I feel is open-minded and free-spirted enough to experiance something wholely different then any other book ever written"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Well I want to keep this brief, but don't take that as I don't love this book! This is quite possibly the best book I have ever read, and it brought me to tears. I couldn't put it down, it took me less than a span of 24 hours to read.

That's not the case here.... SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE is horrifying, hilarious and profound simultaneously."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Kurt Vonnegut does what so few other modern authors are able to: create important yet easily consumed literature. The latter half of the 20th century was far from the golden age of books with most novels written falling into the category that I kindly label \\"Pulp.\\" In short, John Grisham, Tom Clancy, and the like are not changing the way we think. Vonnegut, in contrast is. This dryly witty commentary on war actually means something. Its about violence, its about inter personal relationships, its about the way we think and act as human beings and animals. These themes are sometimes hard to spot but the text is never hard to handle. The books is not long winded and it reads quickly. A perfect fit for a first time Vonnegut reader or anyone who was born with even the smallest cynical streak."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"The first time I read this book (as a high school student), I found it tremendously liberating, primarily because of Vonnegut's style of writing, which was unlike that of other books we had to read at the time. This second time, however, I was surprised to find that Vonnegut's writing seemed almost clumsy. And I wondered about my voracious desire in high school to read all of his books. There may be an optimum adolescent time frame when Vonnegut speaks most influentially to his readers.Still, it carries the weight I felt in the first reading, and his voice is perfect for pointing out the absurdities of tragedy. Though Vonnegut's topic is the firebombing of Dresden, his book concerns all war and massacre. It is about the fringes of rationality, and the attempt to find something beautiful and optimistic in a world where the darkest things can occur. But in the end, it seems that this hopeful humanism shares the stage with another philosophy. The Tralfamadorians set a pessimistic tone: Time is a mere dimension, observable in an instant, the things that happen must happen, and no event is good, or bad, or sad-they are just inevitable."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"While living in the Haifa University dorms I developed the habit of checking a dozen books out of the library at a time and one of them was \\"Slaughterhouse five.\\" Before reading \\"slaughterhouse five\\" I'd have laughed myself stupid if someone suggested I read ANY book cover to cover in one day but, yes...Vonnegut is that good.I always read the blurbs before reading the introduction. The blurbs for \\"Slughterhouse five\\" were so well executed that I figured the book must be \\"that good.\\"Vonnegut starts with an introduction that reads like a post card to a friend and before you know it, the narrative kicks in and Vonnegut introduces timeless and structureless events that make sense in their timeless and structureless state but, when juxtaposed, give the story its substance, its kick, its juice. There are no loose ends and no soggy and simple-minded moral to the story other than the one you manage to extrapolate. no unnecessary passages, characters, dialogue or even unnecesary words. An airtight novel if there ever was one.A treat for anyone with a penchant for the more twisted traits exclusive to the human species. The images of Hiroshima and Nagasaki that most people are familiar with can't even compare to the images of the fire bombed Dresden Vonnegut conjures up in my mind. Raw and dead serious matter treated with a levity that draws chuckles in situations that would otherwise draw tears of blood.

I'm not sure why, but if I had to guess I'd say they fear that it may be difficult to read or dry.You can't say either of those things about Vonnegut. This book is the perfect introduction if you're not familiar with the author. Not only is it humorous, but it's also concise and easy to read. It's a book about war, but it never gets preachy.The plot deals with one character--Billy Pilgrim--who served in WWII. When he comes home, he become an eye doctor and later claims to have been abducted by aliens. The plot sounds a little crazy and hard to follow, but it all makes sense once you get into the book.Vonnegut and Hemingway share a trait that most readers should enjoy: they are both precise and to the point. There are very few wasted words and you don't get bogged down with long descriptions or flowery prose. That's not to say that the story isn't well-written. It's just written in a manner that most people will appreciate."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I couldn't put it down until I finished. It absorbed me after the first page because of what it was telling me.My father was also in the Battle of the Bulge. After all the horrible things he witnessed and experienced, his most significant concern expressed was what it took to keep his feet warm - the last thing he wants to do is dwell on a more significant event of burying several dozen men who were mowed down by the Germans. (I learned at a young age to never screw with our thermostat at home!)How does this relate to the book? The book jelled a thought I have had for some time. To handle the difficult, we focus on what we can deal with, and for the rest we create abstractions from other elements of our past that can cloud it, explain it, justifify it, forget it etc. In the case of SH5, Billy Pilgrim used science fiction to put horrible things into a perspective that was acceptable - it just happens, it's suppose to, it always will!Except for the concept of aging on earth, SH5 makes you look at life and realize there truly is no beginning, no middle, no end - just a series of often unrelated events brought to us or created by us. You can not choose the events always, but sooner or later you will choose what to believe and how you want to believe - interestingly enough, that's not always a choice in the purest sense either."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"One of the great aspects of Slaughterhouse Five is its ability to challenge the reader's idea of reality and various social norms, namely war. Billy Pilgrim, the main character of the novel, is born in Illium, New York. At a young age, Billy enlists to fight for America in World War II and claims witness to one of the biggest blunders of World War II, the bombing of Dresden, Germany. After Billy gets out of Germany and the war alive, he claims to have been abducted by an alien race called the Tralfamidorians, a species far more advanced than the human race. As he shares his outrageous experiences and the ideology of the Tralfamadorian race with the reader and other characters of the novel, his credibility and sanity soon become skeptical, landing him in a mental institution. While the character of Billy Pilgrim is simply an intermediary through which Kurt Vonnegut displays his ideas, the reader can not help but wonder if Billy and his beliefs are valid, or a figment of the imagination. Even if you do not enjoy anti-war or science fiction novels, this book will bring the reader far more than what is expected opening up a world of new ideas and endless possibilities."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This was the first book I read by Kurt Vonnegut, and in my opinion, the best book to read as an introduction to his work. The next book I read after SF-5 was Cat's Cradle, and I doubt I could have understood it if it wasn't for SF-5. Vonnegut's writing is not for everyone - he often uses strange, outlandish elements of science fiction and the like that take some getting used to.Slaughterhouse-five follows the story of Billy Pilgrim, a private in the US army during World War II. Vonnegut tells us right away that Billy is 'unstuck in time', and throughout the book we make seemingly random trips to parts of Billy's life. Later in the book, Billy is allegedly captured by aliens and taken to their planet, Tralfamadore. In he very center of the plot is the destruction of Dresden, a completely civilian city in Germany that was demolished by an Allied firebombing. A reference to Dresden crops up almost every other page, revealing Vonnegut's obsession with this event he witnessed. There are many seemingly contradictory elements in SF-5, such as Tralfamdorian philosphy vs the theme of the book.However, anyone who says that SF-5 is just a silly, mashed-together jumble of weird, absurd, unconnected events is reading it too shallowly. In English class, I wrote an in-depth literay analysis of this book. I picked a very narrow topic and still wrote 16 pages without having to fluff it out at all. I could have written thirty pages, but the limit was 10 (I eventually pared it down to 12).A lot of people don't like SF-5 because they say its theme \\"War is Bad\\" gets too repetitive. A careful reader, though, can see that Vonnegut approaches the topic from many different angles, even from the seemingly random science fiction elements. SF-5 is a magnificently deep, poignant, yet still funny book. It is one of my favorites and I reccomend it to everyone without hesitation!Anyone who is having trouble understanding this book should try and read some criticism or analysis of it. Go to the library, go to the computer card catalog, type in \\"Slaughterhouse-five, Vonnegut\\" and see what you get."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"\\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\" is brilliant because Kurt Vonnegut is NOBODY'S apologist. You may disagree with his politics (and I definitely do), but his story of Billy Pilgrim, a hapless World War II veteran who lives in several parallel timelines, is a masterwork.Vonnegut was actually there. He was a POW in Dresden when it was bombed into the stone age. He witnessed its effects first-hand. He even wrote himself into \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\" as a background character.Personally, I think story-behind-the-story is that Pilgrim is the author, or a part of him that splintered off. Billy Pilgrim's was a fragile mind that came unhinged because he saw too much. His leaps of fancy, which are written as though real, are the product of a mind stressed beyond its breaking point.Kurt Vonnegut, unlike Pilgrim, did not suffer a break with reality. Instead he chose to part with it on his own terms - as a novelist. I would imagine that there are only so many civilian corpses - woman and children chief among them - you can stack on bonfires before you start to question your own sanity - and the sanity of the people responsible.What he offers in \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\" (and in every novel of his I've read) is not a condemnation of a particular group (i.e., Americans) but of the human race as a whole. Necessity does not make atrocities any less horrific. Killing is killing. Though it may be justified in some sense (in the case of self-defense, or the defense of others), it is no less an act of destruction. Morally speaking, war punishes the victor, too.Vonnegut's argument, as I read it, is that we need to stop thinking of any war as justified or necessary. War is neither. It is simply a fact of human nature that aggressors will attack others, and that we must sometimes act to stop them. That we shouldn't have to in the first place is, I think, the whole point of the book. It's insanity to incinerate people by the thousands. That the axis forces did it first makes it no less so. That it may have been necessary in some way only shifts the blame. No one who commits such acts - even for the greater good - has a clean conscience, except people who are clinically insane.In short, there is a distinction to be made between the morality of going to war, and the morality of war itself. I think Kurt Vonnegut sees this. If you don't, then it's all the more reason to read this book."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I'm no literary critic by any means but to me this is a great book. In some way that I cannot describe in words Mr. Vonnegut tells his story and conveys his message by not taking a direct approach. On one side it is a story of WWII POWs, and on the other it is a science-fiction story of one man's unusually bland life. It is a must read book."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"In the late 1960's society was at complete unrest. War was occurring in Vietnam, leaders were being shot, and families were drifting apart. This was the time that Kurt Vonnegut wrote the novel Slaughterhouse-Five. In the beginning of the novel he places himself as the main point of view. He sets up the story with his own struggles of isolation. He calls long lost friends drinks and smokes. It is here where he visits an old friend and war veteran, whose wife worries that he will glorify the war by writing about it. By mentioning this I feel that Vonnegut is justifying the novel's randomness, moving it away from a war novel to the multi-set version that it became. The fact that Vonnegut himself is struggling, sets us up to the struggles that Billy Pilgrim will face while setting us up to the character himself being seen as the eyes and ears of the author.Billy Pilgrim is a very interesting character. In the novel he experiences the war, personal abuse, disability, mental illness and a lack of self-worth. As ironic as that sounds, he is the center of the novel, the piece that holds it together. Billy represents not just the negatives of war, but of the overall problems of the human condition. The fact that Billy is a victim and what he represents creates a cynical view of how the author views the world at the time.Some may view Pilgrim strictly as a weak character. The fact that he is taken advantage of time and time again is difficult to deal with. I often wondered why he was so pathetic and what the point of that was. In researching the author for this paper, Vonnegut himself was weak in many ways. This is why the character of Billy Pilgrim works in this novel. Kurt Vonnegut needed to be able to make a statement from the core of society, which was weak at the time. The fact that Pilgrim goes into the future and becomes a celebrity equates his own writing success and what it really means to him versus how he feels about himself. At one point in the novel he even mentions that writing is like advertising, you need to tell the truth or you get into trouble.It is no accident that by the end of the novel, Billy Pilgrim seldom seems to know who, where and why he is. The author notes this in the last chapter set in 1967. It is the year before the assassinations of Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King occur. These problems in our society and Pilgrim's cluelessness are used to make a point. The point that he is trying to make is that Pilgrim is presented as sick and listless but there are good reasons that this is occurring.Still, why is this important to have him as a weakling? I also feel that he is depicting mental illness as something caused by society itself and it is these mentally ill that create a major part of how the world is run. Pilgrim at many times in the book is abused so badly you understand why he has become the weak person that he is during many moments of the book. You understand why he is the weakling or the victim. Tie that in with the previous points you realize that is us, all of society that is victimized. It also runs into who is running the world. In 1976, Pilgrim becomes a hero of society, yet you wonder how that can occur. You know him as very un-heroic, yet Vonnegut places him in that role as if to say, it is the nuts that are running the asylum. The point being that some of the same can be said about the leaders of the world during the time this book was written.If the book is to be viewed basically, I could say that Vonnegut is telling us that war is bad. In fact, the raid of Dresden is a large point regarding the unrest of society. He could have stayed with this point throughout the entire novel. It would have been the easy way to make a basic point. The fact that he moves away from this to Billy in the present and later in the future, what the author is trying to say is that society needs to be fixed not just now, but later, before wars and cruelty cease to exist.As mentioned early, the book is often criticized for being too random in its structure. It was viewed as a fault. I believe that randomness was used to make a point and is a strength rather than a weakness. Vonnegut does this by the pace and quick changes in setting and plot. The violence and cruelty is another way that he is reaching out to what is going on in the world. Vonnegut frames this by placing himself in the beginning and end of the novel, thus introducing where he is at in 1969, as well as bringing the novel to a logical conclusion.In conclusion, Slaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. uses many layers and levels of understanding of society to make his point. What was happening while his book was being written adds to the structure and meaning of the novel itself. The novel is not jumpy or all over the road, but rather a well thought out piece using a main character to define the place society was at that time."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughterhouse Five is excellent! No other book has dealt with a subject like war in such a humorous manner. Kurt Vonnecut writes about a World War II prisoner of war, Billy Pilgrim, who time travels throughout his life. Billy is trying to find the meaning of life through the fractured pieces of his life. Though these time travels can be a bit confusing at times, they are an excellent basis for the book. The reader is able to travel with Billy from the time he goes to war, to the time he becomes a feeble, moderately old man. Vonnecut's writing style is so superb that the reader feels like they are time traveling as well.I find the Tralfamadorians to be quite funny. Billy's trip on a flying saucer allows the reader to escape from reality and have a good laugh. I think the Tralfamadorians have an amazing outlook on life and time. They believe no one ever really dies but continues to live in the different parts of their life. I often find myself hoping this idea is true.After the trip to Tralfamadore, Billy believes he knows the true meaning of time. I find I often get frustrated with Billy for believing in such an idea and making himself out to be a fool. However, I do think Billy creates his own world to escape the memories of the detrimental bombing of Dresden, Germany. This artificial thought gives Billy an insight that helps him deal with his need to know what life was about.This book must be read! It was truly one of the best books I have read. It is extremely well written with the right mixture of humor and seriousness. I believe there is a hidden meaning in this book that only the reader can experience. I would recommend this book to anyone!"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"\\"Slughterhouse-Five\\" was a little strange for my taste, however the message suits for real life in any time period. Even if you don't read it as anti-war propaganda (I didn't immediately connect with this theme), it applies just as much to peaceful times as times of conflict.Vonnegut's portrayal of death as a normal occurance is more striking to me than the anti-war theme, because he NEVER let's you forget about it. \\"So it goes\\" litters every page, and makes you see the death in ordinary situations that you probably wouldn't have thought about. Every time I saw \\"So it goes,\\" I felt something drop in my stomach. Just what you want when you read...something that makes you feel.He also shows a creative way to synthesize the difference between time and space, a way to find some meaning in life, and a few subtle (sometimes not-so-subtle) jabs at what he believes is wrong with the American way of life. His method of doing it all was strange and sometimes confusing (why only 4 stars), but picking through the confusion you can come up with anew idea that Vonnegut hid in the rubble!Forgetting all of that, it was a funny book in its irrelevancy and randomness, and sad in the same exact manner. Maybe that's why it strikes a chord."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Straightforward Fantasy of Baffling RealityBilly Pilgrim has been unstuck in time, and I feel that way too. Through my English class, the whole contemporary style threw me completely off. This is not Dickens. This is not Steinbeck either. The closest I've read before is James Joyce, but I had no clue what he was saying. The similarity: half my brain cells died reading either book.So it goes. However, this book is not going to be like any other war book you'veever read-besides the usage of drugs as a plot device. This story has one of many interpretations. I am certain I have overanalyzed this book over and over again, but this is what I feel about the book.The first is the easiest to explain and understand. Kurt Vonnegut is crazy and disillusioned after the onset of a terrible war including the hellish bombing of Dresden during World War II. This could easily explain for the random twists, plot spins, alien abductions, etc. However, this seems too simple an explanation.Another explanation is an extremely deep one: the characters in the story are intended to be completely sane, and the book is not as much an antiwar novel as much as an analysis on free will. The narrator includes countless allusions to this argument, starting when Vonnegut compares stopping a war to stopping a glacier, to when the Trafamadoreans tell Billy Pilgrim that free will does not exist, to Billy getting thrown into the deep end of a pool. Billy is being taught the \\"sink or swim\\" method by his dad, but is rescued \\"against his free will\\" when they find out that he actually likes the bottom of the pool.At this point, I cannot say that I have made a thorough analysis. I have practically nothing good to say. Perhaps the only thing I have left to say is \\"poo-tee-weet?\\""},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Nothing I can say would ever add to the legacy this book already has.

My back is bowed from too much bowing in reverence."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughterhouse-Five (or The Children's Crusade) is an anti-war novel by Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. about the bombing of Dresden, Germany at the end of World War II. While Kurt Vonnegut was a POW at Germany he related the experience of being in Dresden through the character of Billy Pilgrim. Billy is deeply disturbed by what he experiences at Dresden and through the rest of his life he travels to different moments in time. He believes that he was abducted by aliens, Tralfamadorians, who can see and travel through all moments in time. This discussion of time is one of the most fascinating parts of the book.This creates a disjointed effect as Billy tells the story of being captured and sent to Dresden, interspersed with experiences from the rest of his life. Kurt Vonnegut makes interesting use of prose with many repeating phrases, the most common of which is \\"so it goes\\" which comes after death (to include animals and even a glass of water). It seems to create the effect numbing effect of seeing as much death as the author saw in World War II, while at the same time highlighting each instance.This is a creative and engaging anti-war novel that is also very well written. A very quick read but one that provokes some thought."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Outstanding reading by E Hawke.

Smacks of 2001: Space Oddesy I had seen, but much, much better! Based on an American soldier's life in Germany during the 2nd World War.

Vonnegut has a style unlike most other authors, but if I was to try and type-cast him he would be a Mark Twain/George Orwell/Philip K. Dick hybrid--though that would still not completely encompass his style."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughterhouse Five tells the unique tales of Billy Pilgrim as he travels through time. The main part of the story is how Billy became a prisoner of war during World War Two and his witnessing of the bombing of Dresden, Germany. But it also includes Billy's other journeys, such as his trip to the planet of Tralfmadore, where he and his porn star mate are monitored by the Tralfmadorians, who live in the fourth dimension.I really enjoyed reading this book because of the brilliant way Kurt Vonnegut used a character that had the ability to travel through time to show how the war affected him during and after the war. One of my favorite parts of the book was when Billy watched a war film backwards. The way Vonnegut described the movie really gave you a feel for the cruel intention of war and the damage it can create. In my opinion, this is the greatest anti war novel I have ever read.Kurt Vonnegut is an interesting author because of how original his writing technique is. He uses many different ways to develop characters in this book, rather than just blandly explaining about the character. He also uses similes often to give the reader a really good mental picture. I think that Vonnegut's style of writing is very effective as far as getting his message across in a way that makes you think.I would most definitely recommend this book to anyone because it has a philosophy that I think everyone could gain from. It's also a very unique read and Vonnegut does a very good job at keeping the reader constantly interested in what's going on. If you want a book that will give you a new perspective on things then I think you've found the right one."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Lemme guess. You read it, you loved it, you say good things about it, and it's been so long since you actually read it that you can't remember it. Guess what? It's still a classic. Thoughtful, humorous, clear-eyed, moving, powerful, unique, brilliantly conceived and executed. He was a master of character, plot, pacing, and language. It's amazing to think that he wrote this about 40 years ago. I bought mine, but you can probably go to the library. You will thank me."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"As soon as I finished this book, I wanted to read it again. And everything else by Kurt Vonnegut. For me, the mark of a good story has been one in which the reader completely forgets that he is reading text on a page, written by a person at a typewriter - i.e., total immersion in the story. At many times, this book was the polar opposite of immersion, and yet it works brilliantly. Every step of the way you feel the author's presence - particularly in his choice of words. Vonnegut uses certain descriptors repeatedly and at unexpected times, catching the reader off guard; I was both hating and loving it at the same time. I was left envious of his wit and disturbed by his purposeful callousness. The reader doesn't want it to be true that events are not preventable, that it is better simply to sit back and watch the world destroy itself."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"The Reason I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5 was because I read this book in a short period of time so I did not get what other people got out of it I also thought that this was a crazy story and I related this to the fact that Kurt Vonneget is a bit crazy if you don't mind me saying and that this book is far out of the ordinary. This book has a new type of writing which is different to the ordinary prose that is common in most books. The book has an unusual beginning because it starts off by Kurt Vonneget telling us about how he tried to write a book about Dresden and how he had alot of trouble getting it started so he decided to write a book about Billy Pilgrim a man from Ilium, New York who becomes unstuck in Time. In this book Billy travels through times to many important events of his life like his birth and his struggle in the POW camps in WW2 and even the time he thinks he was abducted by Aliens from the Planet Tralfamadore. The time on the planet is a split second in earth time but on the planet it is a couple of months. Thre a couple of themes present in this book that can be easily discussed here. The first which is an obvious one which is the time travel which occurs in Billy Pilgrim's world. There is another theme that struck me as odd was the way that he did not sho any emotion of sadness during the war and when his wife died he just said So it goes. There are many reasons that this book was banned for example the use of vulgar language and the use of blasphimus language that there is in the book. There is also a sex scene that occurs when Billy is on Tralfamadore and this would be the grounds for the banning of any book from a school or library. So this book has been banned in many places for these many details but Rye High School didn't ban it"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This novel can be broken down into three principal stories, much like the film Pulp Fiction. The struggling writer, Kilgore Trout, meets his only fan who happens to be as crazy as himself after living as a hermit. The passive hero of World War II, Billy Pilgrim, ..., and the aliens from Transfalmadore who cause the destruction of the universe. Together, these three entities create, the greatest anti-war novel? Yea, crazy enough, this book has nothing to do with these stories. Much like Pulp Fiction, there is a deeper message that resounds off a funny and edgy premise. I won't delve further into details because I'm lazy and most people won't read this. However, for those who are looking for their next novel, I assure you this is it. Getting past the first few pages of meandering is easy and all phrases are important and used for a reason. Unfortunately, I had to explian to my mother what, \\"So it goes,\\" meant.

When I finally did, however, I was astonished at what I found. Kurt Vonnegut's \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\" is one of the most refreshing books I have ever come across. The mere fragmented structure of the book, along with the wonderfully simple language used by Mr. Vonnegut, created an unparalleled atmosphere that fit perfectly with the story of Billy Pilgrim and his voyage as a prisoner of war in World War II. Many of the ideas presented within the novel were completely amazing to me. Vonnegut forces us to consider concepts that we have never put our minds to.

My favorite of the Vonnegut books I've read so far."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"As a novel, this book is a very nice piece of literature. For anyone interested in Vonnegut's writing, however, it appears very \\"done\\" - it seems Vonnegut intended this book for the mass audience, while some of his other books were meant more for a smaller audience, one that was ready for his bitter sarcasm and irony. In other words, this book is toned-down Vonnegut. While it has many interesting twists and turns, they are either to subtle for the average reader, or so obvious that they can no longer qualify as sarcasm, but are rather elementary criticisms of war, human nature, and society (the usual suspects). If you want something truly interesting, read his more thought-provoking novel, Sirans of Titan which is outstanding. If you are looking for sarcasm in general, make sure to check out One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, which is the best book ever written. Don't read Catcher in the Rye, it is irrelevant :)"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I decided to add this after reading a few other reviews.First, Vonnegut explicitly states that Billy did not begin time traveling because of the Tralfamadorians but that they were merely able to explain things to him. Billy still may or may not be nuts, wrecked by his experiences, but that's different. He first time travels when near death in the frozen wilderness behind enemy lines in WWII and he first begins talking about it after nearly dying in a plane crash many years later.Second, I didn't just spoil anything because in the first few pages (after the autobiographical intro) Vonnegut lays out a straightforward biography of Billy's life in two or so pages, which can help with the rest of the story if you read it thuroughly, though I found it easy to follow anyway. As an example of how time travel is used: in one moment he's near death in a frozen German forest; in the next, he's a boy hearing music at the bottom of a swimming pool and about to pass out (and drown); and then he's a mature man visiting his mother, who is dying. All in about five paragraphs. He doesn't travel that rapidly very often but it's a good example. (There are equally good examples of funny or ironic juxtapositions like these but this happens within paragraphs of time travel being introduced to the reader so I didn't think it would spoil things much.)"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This was a really cool book. It's a humorous account of a soldier's passive trip through war and consequently, the rest of his life. Vonnegut pretends to give us an deconstructed time and plot structure, while he is actually giving us a pretty conventional one. Nevetheless, I found it pretty clever. I know that Vonnegut is supposedly a moral writer, but I don't think that this book needs to be read as such. I think it's what you make of it. Slaughterhouse Five is always fun, never truly sad - this is what makes it clever. I think Vonnegut took a risk by creating a story in which commonly sad and depressing things are dismissed as trivial, but of course the author clearly doesn't believe they are. His statements are about war, not pronouncements on the vagueries of the &quot;the human condition.&quot;"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Book Description Billy Pilgrim's life was normal until he started finding himself in strange places. He had a wife and two kids and life was good. Billy had started writing a book about Dresden, Germany, where he had once been held captured by Nazis soldiers in World War II.

Follow Billy on his wild adventure through time, as he goes back to his childhood, war days, and even his alien abduction.Review Slaughter House -Five tells a tale of a man trying to regain a grip on reality and ultimately his life. The books transitions are choppy and hard to follow because the author jumps from one stage to another. But the choppiness represents a broader vision on modern life. People are quick to jump from one life to another. At work a person may be a totally different identity than what they really are. The sudden surprises that the book has, is also similar to the sudden surprises we face every day. The reader has to adjust their mind frames from one situation to another. The humor in the book lightens up the mood and allows the reader to appreciate the sadness. After all is said done, the Billy Pilgrim finds himself beginning his life after war.

As another reviewer said, this book is &quot;mercifully short.&quot; The Dresden scene at the end of the book is well-written, though."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"How does one go about writing a review for Slaughterhouse Five? The genre can't even be defined (horror? comedy? war drama? sciene-fiction?), let alone the essence. What can be told about Slaughterhouse Five is that it makes the reader reconsider. It can easily change how one looks at war, peace, family life, aging, humanity and even the science fiction genre in one sitting. As thought provoking and entertaining as this is, perhaps the most endearing aspect of the book is the protagonist. Billy Pilgrim is easy to love because he is simply an exagerated form of the common man; observant, thoughtful, and destined to be bewildered by the world from the moment he entered it. The reader doesn't know what to make of Billy or his sitation, but he or she loves him nonetheless. In a way, it seems that this is how Vonnegut wants people to view his story - with a combination of sadness, confusion, and laughter."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This isn't a review of the book so much as of this CD version. If you, like me, listen to books on CD in your car, you may not like Ethan Hawke's style here. I didn't. He whispers, or nearly whispers the whole book. I had to turn the volume WAY up to hear, which was distracting. Maybe someone thought that conveyed the tone of the book, but at times it was like a bad Jack Nicholson impression.The book itself is fine and worth your time."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"It is not my usual stuff but it had some interesting ideas. I have to admit though that I checked out the Spark Notes just to make sure I was keeping up with everything. The \\"getting unstuck\\" and traveling back and forth through time was a bit nerve racking but in the end, I understood why he did it. At least I think I do. Either Vonnegut is a literary genius or a complete fool. Judging from his popularity though I am going to say that it is the former. If not, we are all the latter."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"As a young man fighting in World War II, Kurt Vonnegut was captured by the Germans and taken as a prisoner to Dresden, where he witnessed the bombing of the city by the Allied Air Forces. He only survived because he and his fellow-prisoners were being held deep in the cellars of an abattoir known in German as \\"Schlachthof Fuenf\\", or \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\". Hence the title of the novel, which tells the story of a young American soldier named Billy Pilgrim, who is captured by the Germans and taken as a prisoner to Dresden, where he witnesses the bombing of the city, only surviving because he and his fellow-prisoners are being held deep in the cellars of an abattoir.Although the book is partly autobiographical, it is by no means a realistic depiction of the horrors of war. It is highly experimental in style, with a strong element of science-fiction. Billy is described as being \\"unstuck in time\\", which means that he is an inadvertent time-traveller, who can suddenly find himself whisked from one point in his life to another without warning. (Billy's surname is probably meant to have a symbolic meaning- he is on an uncertain, random pilgrimage through life).Vonnegut's writing is similarly unstuck in time. There is no smooth linear narrative progressing logically from one event to the next; the narration rather hops, seemingly randomly, from one part of Billy's life to another. We learn (but not necessarily in that order) about his marriage after the war to a girl named Valencia, about how he becomes a successful optometrist in upstate New York, about how he survives a plane crash and about his wife's death shortly afterwards, and about his own murder in the 1970s. (The book itself was actually published in 1969). Most bizarrely, we learn how he is kidnapped by aliens from the planet Tralfamadore, who take him back to their world to keep him in a zoo and mate him with a porn star named Montana Wildhack.Experimental novels often have the reputation of being wilfully obscure and difficult to read. \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" is neither. Vonnegut's prose is wonderfully lucid, and although his narrative may lack strict chronological logic, the sequence of events has a logic of its own. For example the bombing, which is in chronological terms one of the earlier events in the novel, is placed near the end, because it is the most powerful event in emotional terms and therefore makes a suitable climax.Because of the central role played in it by the bombing of Dresden, \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" has often been described as an anti-war novel. Yet in the opening chapter Vonnegut relates a (possibly invented) conversation with a friend who asks him why he doesn't write an anti-glacier book instead of an anti-war book, implying that wars are as easy to stop as glaciers and that anti-war books are therefore futile. This attitude fits in with the Tralfamadorian philosophy of life, something frequently referred to in the book. Unlike humans, who can see only one point in time at once, the Tralfamadorians can see the whole of their lives, past present and future. This means that they know about future events before they actually occur and therefore believe that there is no point in trying to alter or avoid them. After his return to Earth, Billy becomes hugely popular and successful by preaching this philosophy to his fellow Earthlings.At times it seems as if Vonnegut himself is preaching a similar philosophy. This attitude is emphasised by his frequent use of the phrase \\"so it goes\\", used here to mean something like \\"that's the way things are\\" or \\"that's life\\", every time someone dies or something unfortunate occurs. It did, however, seem to me entirely possible that Vonnegut may not have intended his apparent advocacy of passive fatalism to have been taken at face value. This may simply have been an ironic way of putting an anti-war message across. This is not an anti-war book in the sense that it makes an intellectual case for pacifism, nor does it address the strong counter-argument that the Nazi regime was so aggressive and brutal that the war against it was morally justified. Vonnegut rather attempts through the use of irony to reveal the absurdity of war, just as Joseph Heller does in that other great American satirical anti-war novel, \\"Catch-22\\". Billy and his fellow-prisoners only survive the bombing because they are protected by a slaughterhouse, a building normally associated with killing. After the destruction, one of those prisoners is executed by the Nazis for the risibly minor crime of stealing a teapot from the ruins. The last words in the book are given to a bird: \\"Poo-tee-weet\\". Perhaps that is the only meaningful comment possible."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I was left disappointed by Slaughterhouse-five. I see the creativity no doubt, and I also see the ease at which it reads. What I don't see is a top 20 of all time science fiction books. This book as it is is borderline science fiction at all. What Kurt calls time travel is only Billy Pilgrim remembering the past. Obviously his abduction by aliens was a result of his skull being fractured.I am just amazed that over 400 reviews of this book give it a 5 star rating. It just isn't that good plain and simple. Kurt has the ability to tell a story but this one just doesn't work. Too much reminiscent jumping and not enough science fiction. The satire falls empty and has no teeth. I would have given this book a 2 star rating if not for the unique writing style utilized by Kurt.Definitely a passerby and not worth the reading. Save your eyes for something else."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This is a much acclaimed novel by Kurt Vonnegut that is not a simple tale, but an intricate story of the life of Billy Pilgrim. Billy Pilgrim is a man who is \\"unstuck in time\\" meaning his timeline goes back and forth in atypical order. The novel takes an anti-war stance relayed through Pilgrim's witnessing the bombing of Dresden and surviving being a prisoner of war. He is trapped in a marriage, trapped into a career and has also been abducted by aliens from the planet Trafalmador. According to the Trafalmadorians all life is happening simultaneously. Billy Pilgrim lives his life out of order, he never knows where in his life he will next awaken. Vonnegut's character also relives the terrible times repeatedly, like many people caught in traumatic devastating times. There is an oft repeated line in this novel, \\"And so it goes.\\" Knowing that Vonnegut was a Pacifist this line seems to demonstrate the ability to just accept whatever comes your way with no hesitation or ability to question. It is this characteristic that \\"traps\\" Billy Pilgrim in his marriage, his career and in a world filled with inequitable situations, he just accpets these things at face value, no more important or less important than any other. I know this is a modern classic, attaining cult status, but I am just not a Vonnegut fan. I am glad that I read it for the sheer experience of reading a classic. Obviously Vonnegut was a gifted writer with an innate ability to convey his thoughts, feelings and experiences through his many novels and he has a significant and devoted following, but he is just not for me."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"If you read the back of this book,I highly doubt that you will read about how ironcly funny it is.

I'm going to have to read this again sometime soon so I can be sure to soak up every little detail."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I always have mixed feelings when discussing Vonnegut. Some of his works are fascinating, fun, and ultimately moving (&quot;Sirens of Titan&quot;) and some are flat, off-putting attempts at juvenile sarcasm (&quot;Cat's Cradle&quot;).There's no doubt where &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; falls. It's not only his most powerful work, but the best distillation of the Vonnegut world-view:(you can almost hear him spitting venom between clenched teeth) &quot;Life sucks. People suck. History sucks. What a laughable mess this human race is. What an absurd excuse for existence.&quot;(short pause)&quot;...but there are so many nice things to see and do along the way.&quot;It's that powerful moment of recognition of beauty that ultimately redeems all the pain and humiliation of life, and nowhere has Vonnegut so clearly and forcefully driven this concept home. The novel is stunning and heartfelt. He makes full use of his now well-honed ironic style (purposefully monotonous prose that sends banality into the realm of dark comedy) and sends his hapless hero, Billy Pilgrim, on a weird and disorienting journey through time and space, as well as to exorcise his own demons from the war.It's a pity that science fiction is so poorly regarded in this country. Otherwise this novel would be considered one of the great anti-war statements of our time.Because, as Vonnegut puts it, there really is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre. It's best to let the birds have the last word."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This is the ultimate World War II classic but far from typical. Slaughterhouse Five is sophisticated and eye opening. Written in Kurt Vonnegut's unique style it's one of his most personal novels describing the destruction of the German city of Dresden and it's lasting effect on the main character, Billy Pilgram. Slaughterhouse Five points out the absurdity of war and destruction, the torment of mental dysfunction and raises questions about cosmic justice and human nature. There is so much packed into this novel it can be overwhelming. Read it more than once and you see new aspects each time. This story makes you think!"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This deserves every star I gave it. The \\"and so it goes\\" after almost every death of anything has great meaning. Vonnegut is refering to the fact that Billy is unstck in time and knows the past as well as the future. Hes saying \\"so it goes\\" in connotation to the timeline. Anybody who gave thius book under 5 or 4 stars should read it again. Its a great book and when i finished the last page, realized this. Read it!"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Vonnegut based many of his novels on his experiences in World War II. Slaughterhouse Five is probably his most notorious and well recieved novel he has written. Being a big Vonnegut fan, I would not go as far as that. Though it is an incredible book, it is a little toned down and obvious in its social commentary. Vonnegut seems to be less sarcastic in this novel. In contradiction, it could also be argued that this book cannot be as sarcastic because of its serious topic. This book seems to be Vonneguts strongest attempt at a serious and affective anti-war novel. Of cours, Vonnegut does not take the conventional methods to preaching the evils of war. This novel somehow combines time travel, alien abducttions, WWII, along with Billy Pilgrim's, the main character, whole life. Bill becomes unstruck in time and no longer travels in a chronological order. He leaps from moment to moment in his life. Though this idea maybe hard to follow at first, and it is deffinitely difficult to see the relevence of an alien culture that resembles toilet plungers to World War II, the book eventually ties together extremely well. He manages to use these other unrelated topics to help underline his major themes. Whether it is Vonnegut's best or not,it is a brilliant book that I would reccomend to anyone."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"i know im going to enrage a lot of diehard vonnegut fans out there, but i honestly dont think this book is the holy grail its made out to be. its entertaining, original, funny, and even a little educational, but there are better books out there that have gotten less word-of-mouth advertisement. i liked, and i highly recommend it, but not as the modern-classic end-all-beat-all. that honor, in my humble opinion, belongs to thomas pynchon for Gravity's Rainbow."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I loved the positive spin on this book. The main character is not a typical guy -- through his strange experiences with aliens, soldiers in WWII, family and doctors, he tells his anti-war story convincingly.A very fast read."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughterhouse 5 was written by Kurt Vonnegut in 1969. Within the story, Kurt Vonnegut is an author who is writing another story. The Kurt Vonnegut who is a character in the story is writing a book called The Children's Crusade. In The Children's Crusade, Billy Pilgrim is the main character. Vonnegut also makes connections between himself and Billy Pilgrim. Billy Pilgrim is the main character in the story. The first chapter is an introduction to the author, and his reasons for writing The Children's Crusade are explained. Much of The Children's Crusade describes the horrors of World War II, specifically the firebombing of Dresden. Vonnegut had first hand experience with the destruction caused at Dresden, so he had a strong basis for describing the war. Strangely, in The Children's Crusade, Billy Pilgrim is &quot;unstuck in time&quot;, which means that he randomly travels through time to different periods of his life throughout the story. The idea is that Billy has lived his whole life already and died, but now he continues to skip around through different moments which have already passed. Billy spends much of the story going through his experiences at war. He skips around to moments ranging from his life as an optometrist after the war to his abduction by space aliens known as Tralfamadorians. Billy even experiences moments where he is already dead. Both the structure and ideas of the story are intriguing and new to an unsuspecting reader.I recommend Slaughterhouse 5 because Kurt Vonnegut opens the reader's eyes to many ideas and problems which may not have even entered his or her head before. The story portrays many different ideas ranging from the obscure outlooks on life given by the Tralfamadorians to horrors and inhumanities of war described by Billy Pilgrim and various other characters. When the Tralfamadorians captured Billy Pilgrim and took him back to Tralfamadore, they shared their knowledge with him. They believed that every event in the universe had already taken place and that humans were just living in one specific moment. No one can change the future, because the future has already happened. However, they say that Billy has become &quot;unstuck&quot; from the track of the lifetime that he was following and therefore skips from moment to moment uncontrollably. As Billy skips through time, his moments at war depress him. He and many others display their common hatred towards the war. Kurt Vonnegut was obviously strongly opposed to the ideals of war and portrayed his feelings through Billy. One of the main events of World War II that was thoroughly discussed in the story was the firebombing of Dresden. Billy was present during the bombing of the city, when he and the rest of his company waited in a meat cellar so as not to come to any harm. When the American soldiers emerged from the cellar the following day after the bombing had taken place, they were horrified. Dresden had been left in ruins, and no person or other life form was left living. Billy was sickened by the masses of civilian casualties. Kurt Vonnegut obviously must have been opposed to the decision to destroy Dresden in such a complete and devastating manner. Vonnegut's views on war and life are well supported and strongly portrayed in this story.The unique structure of the story makes me want to recommend this book to a potential reader as well. The story skips suddenly in and out of different moments and events in Billy Pilgrim's life. The seemingly unrelated and random moments are tied together by Vonnegut's carefully constructed common themes and ideas. Vonnegut gives the reader a sense of how startling and sudden Billy's time travelling is.Although I enjoyed the new, unique style of structure, it is easy to see how one might become confused and lost in such a twisted array of scenes and images. A reader who is used to a straight forward, chronological plot structure will have trouble getting used to Billy Pilgrim's time travelling. If one does not take his or her time while reading this book, the reader will lose track of the many intertwining plots and will not appreciate Vonnegut's style.Slaughterhouse 5 is a well written story which forces the reader to think about and become involved in its strong opinions and ideas about war and life. The structure shows that a book can be successful even if it varies from the traditional chronological plot line."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"There is little really to be said about this wonderful novel (Vonnegut's one true masterpiece, though &quot;Cat's Cradle&quot; and &quot;Mother Night&quot; are great too)--not that I'd need much to say anyway. Vonnegut's quirkiness, wit, and humanity are honed to perfect pitch in this story of the complacent Billy Pilgrim's random and unhinged journey through time, from the firebombing of Dresden in 1945 (&quot;I was there too. Me. The author of this book.&quot;) to his life as an optometrist in Ilium, NY (that is, Schenectady) in the 1960's.But why should I say anything? This is a unique novel, a great, moving read, &amp; a quick one too--you can read it in one sitting if you want to (I think I did it in 2 or 3 over one weekend). You have little to lose and everyting to gain."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I definitely enjoyed some of the humor and the innovative structure of the book. Regarding the latter, I've become so accustomed to seeing movies and reading books in an out-of-order fashion and it's fun to do so. Always there will be some confusion at the beginning, but the order of events clears up. The humor was more of this ludicrous type - the type where you're reading something and you say to yourself &quot;Well that is just silly&quot; because it was written to be like that. But maybe my complaint stems from that in regard to the whole alien kidnapping thing. When I started reading that, I could not take this book seriously anymore. Was that the Vonnegut's intent? This is what war can do to a person? This is how a person reacts to war? Billy becomes &quot;unstuck in time&quot; so he doesn't think about war or face the realities of war? If Vonnegut wants to say that war is silly and pointless, well of course it is - we all agree on that.Basically Billy went mildly insane and this is what the book details in its plot. Maybe the point did get across to me, but it was a point not worth repeating again and again. I was looking for something a little deeper or more meaningful."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":". . . that Kurt Vonnegut, Jr.'s &quot;Slaughterhouse Five&quot; was written by a pillar of salt.

That is the first line of one of the most powerful anti-war book I have ever read. Vonnegut tells the story of Billy Pilgram, a POW in WWII, based on his own experience as the same. He approches this popular, and sometimes over writen topic with a refreshing, and most human manor. Vonnegut uses emotion rather than plain fact and humor rather than contempt. This book is a must read for anyone interested in the topic of WWII, but not only that, for anyone interested in excellent literature. This edition also includes an essay by Vonnegut himself discribing his own need to write this book and why he choose to write it in the way he has. This book has found it way into my own list of personal favorites, and I'm sure it will become that, or more for you"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I greatly admire Vonnegut for his use of transitions from time period to time period.At first, it was a little awkward, but the storyline became clearer and cleareras the connections are recognized by the reader."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Perhaps I missed the boat, but \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\" just doesn't come across as hilarious and eye-opening as many see it in my opinion. Sure, there's no denying Vonnegut's satirical viewpoint, but the story is just too disjointed and jumbled to really enjoy it. Vonnegut uses Billy Pilgrim to get his point across that war isn't worth it. In a perfect world, we wouldn't need war. However, there comes a point when shaking hands and talking over tea just doesn't work anymore. It's obvious that Vonnegut disagreed with the actions taken at Dresden (He was there), but he fails to mention the reasoning behind the attack on that particular place. Also, he gives us a brief glimpse at conditions in the German concentration camps but fails to fully paint the picture of just how cruel these places were. In short, what you have here is one man's viewpoint of warfare. If you agree with him, you'll probably think his sarcastic remarks are hilarious. However, if, like me, you see war as an unwanted but sometimes necessary evil, you may tire of Vonnegut's lingo rather quickly.In closing I must say that this book just wasn't for me. When I was in college I happened to see the film that's based on this book and I actually enjoyed it. Perhaps age and real world experience have rubbed the sand out of my eyes and I now see this book for what it really is? I'm not saying that this book is bad, but I won't recommend everybody go out and read it either."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I love Kurt Vonnegut but like \\"Jailbird\\", \\"Slaughterhouse 5\\" is full of details and great phrases, but little pay-off.From the beginning we become acquainted with Billy Pilgrim, an impish lucky man who fakes it through life. Pilgrim is a pathetic but intriquing character. We meet others along the way. The British POWs that warn of \\"Jerry\\" are hilarious and great sketches of the English.Vonnegut's description of the bleak landscape of war and of normal life is great. But the narrative goes in circles the entire book. There was no progression or path to it. I understood why Pilgrim had the trauma and the absurdity of the events. Still there's no movement and every chapter seems the same. Again, if you've read \\"Jailbird\\" you'll recognize this flaw of his works.I would instead recommend \\"Cat's Cradle\\", \\"Breakfest Of Champions\\" or \\"Mother Night\\"."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This is an easy-to-read satire that alludes to the weighty concepts of war, death and fate but never seems to bring home the point.

Just mentioning those ideas over and over again without examining them is not enough."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This book contains some very interesting thoughts and social commentaries on war, but the timeline, though interesting, skips around too much for my liking. I would reccomend this book to those interested in a thought provoking read, but not to those who have trouble understanding complex plots and metaphorical themes."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I don't get it. After all this time, I still do not understand the moral, theme or premise of Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five. The book starts promising; and the story captivated me early. But, I did not have a good feel for where the story was heading even after the story ended - such as it was. The story begins with what a first-time reader will assume to be the protagonist commiserating with his old World War II buddy. And, the first-person narrator, who is an author, describes a book he is about to write about the Dresden firebombing in World War II. The rest of Slaughterhouse-Five is simply that book, with the actual protagonist, Billy Pilgrim.To make a short story even shorter, Pilgrim wanders through World War II, becomes a prisoner of war, lives underneath the firebombing of Dresden, and wanders through various points of his life courtesy of his time-traveling (although \\"traveling\\" is not completely accurate - it doesn't really matter) alien abductors, the Tralfamdorians. Slaughterhouse-Five ends with Pilgrim. And, we never really understand why Vonnegut begins his story with the narrator, who remains anonymous. The author mentions before leading into the Pilgrim narrative that \\"the story is so short and jangled.\\" I wonder Vonnegut did not insert the first chapter with the narrator after the fact to cover for the notion that Vonnegut's story is so \\"short and jangled\\" indeed.I have read any number of possible themes for the book. Among the most popular, of course, is that Slaughterhouse-Five is an anti-war book. That is entirely possible. Slaughterhouse-Five is certainly not complimentary of war or war makers. But, it does not exactly call out the offenders either. Rather, the theme -- if there is one -- is that war is irrational and destructive, yet inevitable. However, by the time the reader gleans through aliens, Hollywood starlets on the Planet Tralmafadore, and optometry sessions - all courtesy of Billy Pilgrim - any hopes of finding a theme are long past.Vonnegut's long-lived reputation as a creative narrator is well deserved. The narration is succinct and flowing. It has a symmetry and repetition that is endearing and captivating rather than annoying. Unfortunately, I did not find much of a story beneath the creative writing technique. I really wanted to like this book more.So it goes."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I've had a copy of Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five on my shelf for a few years now. It was never a required reading book in high school where I'm from, read 1984 by Orwell instead, and I'm glad I've read it now when I'm older albeit none the wiser. I finally picked it up when I heard of Vonnegut's death, so it goes.While telling the story of Billy Pilgrim, the predecessor of Forrest Gump, and the fire bombing of Dresden during World War II, the author throws in the fourth dimension of time and delivers the narrative alternating between the past, present and future much like a Quentin Taratino movie does now.Vonnegut's comic relief use of the phrase \\"so it goes,\\" appears after each anecdote on death, dying or morality and occurs 106 times in the text. Other phrases that were used frequently to tie the story together were the \\"smell of mustard gas and roses,\\" \\"blue and ivory,\\" hands and feet, and \\"radium dial.\\" Also the Serenity Prayer was mentioned twice in key parts of the text so that even if you have a difficult time with Vonnegut bouncing back from future, to past, to present, you can still see how the story is pulled together with the help of his literary devices.It's a hard book to categorize, because it deals with so many genres: satire, anti-war, and sci-fi to name a few and like any great piece of literature deals with universal themes like fate, free will, the illogical nature of humans and how life is only enjoyable with the unknown. I loved every minute of reading this novel and was sad to put it down after finishing it, but I will definitely read it again and his other works too."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Not much. On a re-reading, what is most impressive is how horror is communicated so well in writing that is so understated . This is true of other great works on war, whether the Gettysburg Address or Washington's Farewell Address or An Irish Airman Forsees His Death.

I hated it then because I didn't get it.After time discovering that history is not about memorizing dates but what happened and learning about the firebombing of Dresden, Germany, I returned to Slaughterhouse-Five for a new look. Billy Pilgrim is an absurd protagonist. He isn't manly or a knight in shining armor, he's an infantry man taken prisoner and a witness to a massacre that out did the atomic bombs.Forget that Billy comes unstuck in time and his alien abduction, what matters is that Kurt Vonnegut makes an event that is so overwhelming human and knowable - not understandable.Put aside any expectations about how a book should read and slip into this novel that makes history come alive on the level of one man's point of view.And so it goes."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughterhouse Five is about a young man named Billy Pilgrim.

Then he was sent to Dresden and placed in a slaughterhouse. Billy had many ups and downs during his period on Earth. One of the better times was when Billy was living on Tralmafordore. This novel \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" is a magnificent read. Anyone with a sense of humor will enjoy it. This is definitly a great novel to read."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Tiemless classic, an excellent read and very difficult to put down once you start. Mr. Vonnegut tells an abstract story based on his own personal experience as a prisoner of war in Germany durring WWII."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I read Slaughterhouse-Five for one of my English classes and fell in love with Vonnegut's writing. It was such a strange book but it was so entertaining.Similar to the concept of The Matrix, Vonnegut makes you wonder what's real and what's dream as the main character drifts back and forth between his own time in World War II and other sub-realities of different times, both before and after he lived. Vonnegut's writing is so solid, however, that you don't feel pushed too hard or fast. This is especially important given the strange story.Slaughterhouse-Five is one of the best books I've ever read and I recommend it to anyone who isn't afraid to stretch their minds."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Kurt Vonnegut claims that he's never had formal training in writing. It's pretty evident here, but in a good way, if that makes sense.Slaughterhouse Five is quirky, funny, and ultimately a dispenser of prudent political advice--in both the modern and ancient interpretation of the word. The book is essentially about the fire-bombing of Dresden in World War II, or even more generally, about the nature of people killing each other. The following excerpt from the book summarizes it nicely:\\"...it was a movie about American bombers in the Second World War and the gallant men who flew them. Seen backwards by Billy, the story went like this:American planes, full of holes and wounded men and corpses took off backwards from an airfield in England. Over France, a few German fighter planes flew at them backwards, sucked bullets and shell fragments from some of the planes and crewmen. They did the same for wrecked American bombers on the ground, and those planes flew up backwards to join the formation.The formation flew backwards over a German city that was in flames. The bombers opened their bomb bay doors, exerted a miraculous magnetism which shrunk the fires, gathered them into cylindrical steel containers, and lifted the containers into the bellies of the planes. The containers were stored neatly in racks. The Germans below had miraculous devices of their own, which were long steel tubes. They used them to suck more fragments from the crewmen and planes. But there were still a few wounded Americans, though, and some of the bombers were in bad repair. Over France, though, German fighters came up again, made everything and everybody as good as new.\\"There's a great deal of satire and irony in the book. Some of its most poignant sections deal with men deciding to kill other men, using logic in reason in ways that Vonnegut shows to be callous (a judge's long-winded order to execute a deserter, and a military historian's argument in favor of Dresden's fire-bombing by the Allies, among other things, all followed by the book's \\"So It Goes\\" motif).All in all, a terrific read, and something that ought to be required reading at higher levels of English, or perhaps even in social studies classes."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I chose Slaughter-House Five because a friend of mine that attends another scool has the same sense of humor that i have reccomended the book to me along with most anything by Kurt Vonnegut.The book is a reliving of a young soldier(Billy Pilgrim)'s tale of life as a young child and eventually as a soldier that lives through the infmaous Dresden bombings of East Germany killing more people than the atomic bomb in Hiroshima did. The novel is not historical. Billy Pilgrim has an epiphany of sorts that allows him to travel sub-conciously back and forth in time, experiencing all his good and bad events in a random series of pages or paragraphs. One page he was a young employee for his wife Valencia's father, te next he left his optometry room to appear in the front lines of World War 2. Billy has a stay in a mental asylum after his \\"efforts\\" in the war where he meets an avid science-fiction fan: Elliot Rosewater. He grows fond of Elliot and his ficticious novels of aliens and space travel. The author of the books he loves is one Killgore Trout, whom emphasizes aliens and time travel the same way Billy sees it. The Trafalmadorians teach Billy to become \\"unstuck\\" in time and that his death and many others is simply one moment in life; only one moment in a collection of infinite moments that have no boundries of time. Billy is taught by the Trafalmadorians to change his human perspective of the notion of time and existence and simply enjoy every moment; live every moment.I loved the book. Essentially it was partially intended to be na attack on the Dreden bombings and in general war workings. The way Vonnegut describe's death of soldiers, civilians, cats, dogs, heroes, and fools is simple and uniform: \\"So it goes\\". It implies a humour that's rarely personified with such gruesome situations. He even shows the reader melodramatic war campaigns that soldiers greet with disgust and distaste (the exception being a Ronald Weary; chubby and patriotic, Weary is ironically abandoned by fellow troops he tries to help [they, also ironically, are shot and killed shortly after trying to avoid Weary and sure capture]). Perhaps as important if not more so is the psychotic side of Billy Pilgrim's experience, who simply gives up living life in any given moment. Perhaps insane from war (or \\"alien abduction\\") Billy still offers themost sane perspective of all the books characters, who Vonnegut describes as \\"non-characters\\". The best example of such perspective is his gay parade around the city of Dresden after the horrendous slaughter occured, wearing Cinderalla azure boots and a bright yellow cape. Even as the most insane person Billy sees the war in its simplest as a massacre. Billy cries as a simple child would at the site of a dead parent at the end of the novel in utter awe."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughterhouse Five is a pretty good book. It is also a tough read, though. I was thrown off of the main storyline of the book many times, by its random skipping to different people and time periods.I was kind of confused, especially at first when Vonnegut changed from talking about himself to talking about Billy. All together it was an interesting book with a generally interesting story. Although, it was a good storyline, I am still brought back to the fact that it was overly confusing to me. Another part that confused me a lot was when Billy was drugged and then woke up after the war. This was then followed by Billy waking up back in the war. The book has a lot of random time skipping, which bothered me and sort of made me not want to read it.While the skipping around and general disorder of the book threw me off and turned me away, I stayed with it because of its general nature. It is a World War II story, and I love reading about World War II. That was probably the only thing that kept me reading it. Another thing that I did like was the way that he made war seem almost stupid and he said that there was nothing intelligent to say about a massacre. That caught my attention probably more than any other lines in the book.All in all I would have to say that I would not recommend this book to someone who doesn't like trying to figure out writing that is confusing, but I would recommend it to anyone who likes reading about World War II."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Kurt Vonnegut hardly needs my praise. It could be sufficient for me to say that \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" is a wild ride through absurdity, and full of wit, anger, and vision. But I'd like to look at three aspects of the book that, from my perspective, make it an experience that will resonate with readers, and help to explain why the book should be read by anyone who wants to understand America after World War II and through to today.First, there's Vonnegut's imagination. I read fiction fairly regularly, but it's usually earth-bound fiction; that is, books that hew pretty closely to what could actually happen, and which tell a story in approximately chronological order. Vonnegut is coming from another place. His books depart from many novelistic conventions and veer into absurdity of time, place, events, character, etc. It makes for invigorating reading and opens up undreamed-of possibilities (and, not incidentally, it helped to show writers how far they could go and still attract a mass audience).In Slaughterhouse Five, Vonnegut chronicles the life and the thoughts of a man (Billy Pilgrim) who himself is unhinged from time. Pilgrim remembers events, but he also foresees events. He travels through time, and he also travels through space. In fact, Billy becomes a featured creature at a zoo in another galaxy. It's tough to tell which things happened, and which didn't -- and that's one of the ways Vonnegut keeps you on the edge.The second point I want to make is that Vonnegut is angry. This is one of the angriest books I've ever read. It's a brutal anti-war diatribe, and it also skewers middle-class life in America, religion, and much more. Billy Pilgrim has no business being in WWII, and he is supposed to be a non-combatant, a chaplain's assistant. But he becomes a POW, and he's treated with contempt by his fellow Americans, as well as his German captors. Through his plight as a POW, he sees horrors, such as shootings, hangings, and the bombing of Dresden (never commits violence -- his worst offense is bumping into people). When he's back after the war, he just stumbles towards middle class success as an optometrist and upstanding citizen, while growing increasingly disengaged from his life. Vonnegut is angry about the emptiness of all of it -- of alleged valor, of material success, etc.The third and final point I'd like to address is free will. It's been said that the book is about free will, and I'd agree. But I'm not sure where Vonnegut comes down on the issue: Do we have it or not? Billy Pilgrim just stumbles through life and lets things happen to him. Perhaps has free will and chooses not to use it, or perhaps his life is predestined. Meanwhile, others act on him, using their free will (apparently), yet forces act on them that are unavoidable.In this way, Vonnegut is telling us something about the absurdity and pointlessness of life. For example, he writes about an American corporal who survived the battles and was actually a pretty good commander, but who, in a moment of weakness, stole a teapot in Dresden. He was executed by his compatriots just two days after the Americans bombed Dresden and incinerated 130,000 innocent inhabitants. Was it free will that led the corporal to steal the teapot? Did he have to be shot for his crime (a crime, by the way, that many others also committed)? Did Dresden have to be bombed in the first place? These are the kinds of things that the reader of Slaughterhouse Five will have to wrestle with long after reading this compelling book."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Kurt Vonnegut is one of my favorite authors. I would recommend Slaughterhouse-Five to anyone. It should be required reading. Although the general concept of the book is a little hokey, it makes for a very entertaining read. To be able to write a book about something as depressing as war and make it not depressing is a commendable feat."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five is a pleasure to read. The story flies off the pages. The writing is succinct and the sentences are short and to the point. No words are wasted.Blending facts with fiction, the story centers around an anti-hero named Billy Pilgrim. An awkward optometrist, who without trying, keeps travelling through time and space. From the battlefields of World War II, to a distant planet with a cyanide atmosphere, Billy takes whatever happens in stride and does the best he can.Slaughterhouse-five is anti-war without preaching. Instead, we see the absurdity of war and life through Billy and his travels. Filled with dark humor and wit, it also has some interesting ideas on free will and the structure of time. A great book."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I am a 17 year old who had the option of reading Kurt Vonnegut's \\"Slaughter House-Five\\" as part of an assignment about novels based on World War I and World War II. The one thing that attracted me about this book was that the reviews on the back cover said it was full of great sarcastic humor and tells a tale making one realize that war is not needed in the world. One thing that I saw many times in other reviews about this book was its strong anti-war message that Vonnegut states in the text. This was one of the big negatives that I did not like very much about this book. The anti-war message was unclear and did not come across well to my point of view. It seemed to me that the book talked more about events leading up to the war and the events that followed the conclusion of the war. But this was only a small con among the many pros that I had for really liking and enjoying the book. For some basic background, \\"Slaughter House-Five\\" is about a man named Billy Pilgrim who becomes a soldier in WWII to fight for the United States Army in Germany. It talks about how he becomes \\"unstuck in time\\" and how Billy has very different encounters than the normal everyday person. Billy talks and experiences things with aliens called Tralfamadorians and he mentions how their beliefs are so much different than the earthlings. The book also talks greatly on the fire-bombing of Dresden and how Billy Pilgrim is a prisoner of war at the time and he talks about his survival experiences before and after the bombing. The interesting part about this book is that Kurt Vonnegut is talking about Billy Pilgrim's war experience but at times Vonnegut mentions things that have happened to him during the war because he was at the same Dresden bombing. \\"Slaughter House-Five\\" overall was a very interesting and descriptive book. I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in the subject of World War II because it is such a classic novel. Vonnegut's sarcastic humor just makes all of the events that Billy Pilgrim encounters more interesting and enjoyable. The author puts an odd twist on the subject of war and violence. Lastly, Vonnegut's structure of plot is an unethical method that jumps around from subject to subject but makes reading the book different and more fun than the normal style of writing. Please read this book because you will not regret it! So it goes."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I didn't like \\"Breakfast Of Champions\\" one bit, so I was hesitant to read this. But thanks to this little giveaway table in my building lobby, I found this piece for free just waiting to be plucked. To be honest, what drew me in was that old timey paperback book smell. You just can't beat it.Not what I was expecting. It's an anti-war tale with Billy Pilgrim as its very boring, troubled and certifiably insane protagonist. Billy acquires timetravel powers as a POW right before the firebombing of Dresden during World War One. With these powers, we are shipped around through the here, before and after of all things Billy Pilgrim. He starts off as a quiet outcast and pretty much stays that way throughout the ups and downs of his whirlwind life. Strange and withdrawn, he still manages to survive terrible experiences, make love to a movie star, meet his favorite author and marry into wealth.Oh yeah...and get kidnapped by aliens.When I call Billy insane, which he definitely is, I still do not imply that he doesn't actually have timetravel powers. No, that is never disputed as his future is presented before us in the ways he predicts. But he is surely out of his mind nonetheless. The price of acquiring this super power, maybe? Could be. He's just a lunatic who can surf through time. And that's my kind of book right there.Vonnegut breezes through the piece with an air of sad humor, often narrating in first person, always witty and ironic. His catchphrase of \\"So it goes\\" when dealing with the topic of death or someone dying did eventually become maddeningly tedious and bored me to distraction, but he sometimes found creative anecdotes for which to build up the line, which I welcomed hungrily. A town gets bombed and so it goes. A fly gets swatted...so it goes.It's a thoughtful little novel with a big message, not without many of the author's first-hand accounts of his own time as a prisoner of war alongside the fictional Billy Pilgrim. Some Vonnegut recurring characters pop up for novelty's sake and sometimes because they just need to be there. Some were memorable, others not so much. Either way, aside from Edgar's death being ridiculously anti-climactic when he was being built up into a real character, I have nothing to keep me from recommending this fine book."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Written in 1969, Slaughter House Five tells the story of an ex-World War II soldier, Billy Pilgrim, who is going mad due to what he saw and felt in World War II and then what is compounded by surviving a plane crash years later. Vonnegut tells the story through a unique method of forward and backward chronology - time warps. The manner of story telling is unique and has its share of humor; both black and laugh out loud funny.Billy Pilgrim is shunted through his war years, with divergent moves to the science fiction world of Tralfamadore where he spends time in a zoo as the specimen. Other traumatic times of his life unfold through the time warps giving background and filling in the gaps. Billy is so shocked by the bombing of Dresden that it stays with him until he survives the plane crash. At this point, everything comes \\"unstuck\\" and to compensate for these horrendous events, he finds peace in his science fiction world. But the story is not all whacky fun and games. Vonnegut is brutal in his portrayal of WWII and the final train ride for many of the Allied prisoners of war after the Battle of the Bulge and their movement to internment camps. His use of black humor to tell this story shows how much it bothered him and how much of it remained with him.Vonnegut uses techniques that I've never seen to tell such an original story in a way never done that it has to be taken as a masterpiece regardless as to whether you like the style or not. I admire the genius behind the story telling. The pictures and images painted will last a while."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This was the second book I read by Kurt Vonnegut and made him one of my favorite authors. I once purchased a Kurt Vonnegut book for my mother for her birthday when I was a teenager. It was the first time I had ever purchased a book for her as a gift. I don't know why I chose that book, It was Slapstick. It had a picture of a clown on the front and I guess I thought my mom needed more humor in her life. I don't think she read it, but I did. Anyway, I read Slaughterhouse Five for a High School History book report and I was hooked. I have read most of Vonnegut's works. He has remained one of my favorite authors for his humor, his hiccup-like writing style, his illustrations, his metawriting, and blunt portrayal of humanness."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I don't want to write a long review, but I will say that this book gets better and better every time I read it. Yes, I think it does a very good job dealing with the disillusionment of war etc. The thing that I like best about this book is the fact that it is a circular--rather than a lineal--story. The main character goes forward and backward in time, and there's never really a clear-cut beginning and ending. I'm trying to get my students to like this book, but so far I've had no success. I think that the jumping around might confuse some people. But if you dig aliens, this book has those too!"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughterhouse five is one of those great anti-war books in the 60's that is really hard to describe, so I'll make it quick. It tells about Billy Pilgrim, who 'time travels' to many points of his life, including the bombing of Dresden. He also gets kidnapped by aliens and learns about their way of life. Embedded in the whacky, realistic narraration is a message about war and life itself. I can't say much about it except that it's a must-read before you die."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"An amazing story that pulls the reader through time and back again. Story fragments shuffled in time. Escaping to the future, being in the present. Then always coming back to the war. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I thought this book was maybe a tad over-rated, perhaps because I just read catch-22 and this was supposed to be in the same vein. It's a bit disjointed (by design) but once you get used to that, it's not too difficult to get used to the shifts in time and place. There are some funny lines here and there, and a few insights into the lunacy of war, particulary the bombing of dresden, but overall i would not say the book profoundly moved me. I don't doubt Vonnegut's talent and you can see flashes of genius, but i still was left underwhelmed by the totality of the book. I kept waiting for more. If you want great dark humor centered around ww2, with cutting insights regarding society - then i'd go back to catch-22. I'm willing to try another Vonnegut book - but this one leaves me a bit let down."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"\\"Billy Pilgrim has become unhinged in time.\\" It's the classic line that starts off the classic story of what is considered to be Kurt Vonnegut's opus, Slaughterhouse Five. For those who didn't have to read this seminal tale in their college literature classes, Slaughterhouse Five is considered by many to be the ultimate anti-war satire, a story that scolds the meaning of all war (via examining the fire bombing of Dresden during WWII) through fairly anti-jingo themes and a bumbling optometrist (Billy Pilgrim) who claims to have learned the meaning (or rather, meaninglessness) of life from a troupe of extraterrestrials that locked him in an intergalactic zoo towards the end of his time-traveling adventures.Re-reading that last sentence will give you a fair idea of the nature of Slaughterhouse Five: it conveys it's painfully serious message through absurd and hilarious means--a text-book technique in the world of satire and a more basic tenant of sarcasm. Slaughterhouse Five--which most likely gained much of its prominence as an anti-war tome released on the cusp of the Vietnam Era--offers the reader a narrative that periodically sets up check points that challenge the reader into looking beneath the surface of the prose and to figure out the inherent symbolism Vonnegut is trying so desperately to display. And on that level, the book succeeds. We're constantly introduced to a cadre of oddball avatars that could represent just about any solider involved in any war in a foreign land, and we immediately learn how they die before we learn how the war effected them, how they in turn effected the war, and the indelible mark they've left on the world by being just another individual in the never-ending line of individuals that make up human existence. It's in this message--that even the most random and common life matters, no matter how inconsequential and expendable it may seem--that the book soars. Unfortunately, it's in its relevance where the book sinks.While the book is exceptionally well written, with Vonnegut providing innocent yet lush descriptions and verbiage, Slaughterhouse Five will easily collapse under its own \\"classic\\" status for some readers. Despite what the late Vonnegut (and, most likely, your college professor) probably wanted, this book won't resonate with everyone. There's the obvious risk that some just wont get the message of the book--whether it's the message conveyed above or another, maybe more personal, message entirely--and take it's lofty tale too seriously, while those who will get the subtext just won't care. However, that's the unfortunate price that comes from being considered a classic work of art. That said, the book is regarded as a classic for a reason, and active readers would be doing themselves a favor to find out why.Michael P. FerrariAuthor,Assault on the Senses"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"First off this isn't science fiction. The premise that he transports to random points in his life is too simple a plot device to throw it in with the scifi genre. Not to mention it scares the regular fiction readers away, they don't like scifi because of the arduous names and detailed plots that often have little to do with the overall point of the story. Since this book doesn't contain those issues its only hurting the sale of the book.Next this book is an extremely entertaining book. It is written entirely as the internal workings of an observer to a very strange and sardonic life. Reminding me much of The Stranger, Vonnegut blends the detail of the environment in with the plot and observations of the narrator.Vonnegut's a cynical/realistic author who will remind you that life, no matter how depressing, is one big plot device of non-sense. You can't help but laugh to keep from crying. I actually did get teary eyed at the ridiculousness of the final scene where the author watches war in reverse and describes what he sees. Only a child's misconception of the world could bring tears to your eyes like he did."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I liked it, but not as much as Cat's Cradle.

It looked interesting & throughout my life, this was one of Vonnegut's books that everyone's crowed about. I just wish I'd liked it as much as they did.Since there's dozens upon dozens of reviews on here that give the plot synopsis, I won't bother rehashing it here & just give you my opinions.I liked the book for the most part. It just didn't grab me. The idea of the book is fantastic & I can see where it is very well written. Parts of the book did interest me- especially the idea of predestination. Billy accepts that things won't change, so he doesn't really try to change anything. (Well, assuming that he traveled through time at all. It is debatable to some people whether any of the book was real or just a delusion.)If you have to read this for class, don't worry. The book is enjoyable enough. Hopefully you'll even like it more than I did. I liked it enough to finish it & recommend it to my sister (who loved it), but not enough to really re-read it like I do some of my other books.

I've read everything this man ever published and have never been disappointed. What a great mind!Slaughterhouse-Five: A Novel"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five is a well known American classic. It provides a look into the future, a peek into the past, and a narration of a portion of the present life of Billy Pilgrim, the protagonist and unlikely hero. Vonnegut took a creative risk by writing a novel that could be categorized as both science fiction and historical. In doing so, he created what could be considered one of the most innovative and successful works of literature of the modern age.Vonnegut's main character, Pilgrim, has the ability to \\"come unstuck in time.\\" He has learned how to move in between memories of the past and visions of the future. The most vivid memories come from Pilgrim's time spent in the war. He has many horrific reminiscences of being herded into Dresden, which, through his time travels, he knew would be destroyed. Pilgrim also has \\"memories\\" of his time spent in the future on a planet called Tralfamadore, a planet where he is taken after he abducted by aliens who enjoy keeping him as a type of pet to study. Vonnegut smoothly transitions between these two sets of recollections by Therefore, Vonnegut's work seems less like choppy satirical anecdotes, and more like a fluid story.In my opinion, Slaughterhouse Five succeeds in conquering the eternal question of time. Billy, unlike most people, is given the opportunity to not only reflect on the different parts of his life, but also relive them. Rather than focusing on living in his present life, though, Billy is constantly moving in and out of time in the search for why things are happening. He has been given a gift, but he is unable to take each moment as its own. He has to learn, like the Tralfamadorians already have, that the reason that something is happening is not important, it is just the fact that it is happening. Instead of thinking like and Earthling, Pilgrim must learn not to ask, as he does in the beginning: \\"Why you? Why us for that matter? Why anything?\\" and just accept that the answer to all his questions of time is merely: \\"Because this moment simply is.\\""},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Did anyone else read the copy of this book which had the introduction about Vonnegut meeting with a friend of his from Dresden and that man's wife? He promised the woman that he would not represent the events of Dresden in a John Wayne-style, but instead would represent the horror as it truly was. What Vonnegut has done with this book is even worse than if he had filled it with bravado and glory. His now token use of science fiction makes ridiculous the gruesome truth of war, and places this novel on the level of G.Gordon Liddy's writings in the realm of anti-war. Anybody read JOHNNY GOT HIS GUN?"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This is the first Vonnegut book that I have read, and so, I can not be categorized as a fan. The book is good for, among others, the following reasons: 1)Its non-linear timeline stays fresh. 2) A rhythm is created by repeated motifs. 3)It is at once visceral and sensitive. 4)It is not too long. 5)It invites you to reconsider some common preconceptions. 6)Published in '68, it reflects its times.I did not rate it a 4, but I would actually place it closer to that than a 3.

If you like conventional stories, where you're just being dictated to throughout the entire book, this novel is not for you. Actually, it is for you!

It will make you think, so BEWARE!"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Kurt Vonnegut is the novel's author and one of the main characters in the novel. In the first and last chapters, Vonnegut speaks about himself, the story he is writing, and what led him to write it.The novel is a very satirical story about the bombing of Dresden by the British. It is clear that many of the war occurrences of Billy Pilgrim, the main character, are autobiographical in life. His appearance in the book complicates the plot and the point of view. Vonnegut himself was a prisoner of war during the firebombing of Dresden, and he occasionally inserts himself in the narrative. Kurt Vonnegut executes an odd, but creative way of authorial existence that reappears throughout the novel. Such examples of when Vonnegut appears and exists are when the novel mentions him or his idea particularly in the refrain \\"So it goes\\" that follows each reference of death. Vonnegut's commentary as a character and an author allows a more factual understanding of a story that seems supernaturally imaginary and adds structure to the idea that such fictional elements may be the reality of a disturbed mind.Another large area of this book is based on the satire on society. One account of satire is how the Tralfamadorians, made up aliens in the mind of Billy Pilgrim, control how he thinks of death. Since the Tralfamadorians think of death as just a \\"state of being\\", Billy consists of that idea, too. It is almost as if death is made as a joke.My overall opinion of this book is fair. This book can be very confusing to read. It jumps from subject to subject. Although the novel may seem out of order, it is very creative in showing the satirical realties in society. I suggest this book for readers interested in satirical novels who can be accepting to displaced ideas, yet creative thoughts social order."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"The horrors of war have unhinged many a man, Vonegut's Billy Pilgrim being one of the more famous of them. It takes no great insight to grasp that war is awful almost beyond human understanding and that participating in it, or merely witnessing it, can crack someone's sanity. Billy Pilgrim can't stop reliving his trauma. His time-tripping is an unconcious attempt to escape that trauma. Goofy looking aliens tell him to think of the positve things in his life. It never works. He goes tripping back to Dresden at random times in his life, and trips back to his life at random times while he's in Dresden. I don't understand why this novel ever rose to the status of a classic. There are much better anti-war books ( Johnny Got His Gun ); there are much better science fiction books ( too numerous to mention ); there are much better anti-war science fiction books ( The Forever War, The Stars My Destination ). The only pluses I can give this book are Vonnegut's style ( crisp, succinct and in plain English ) and its relative brevity. Get it from the library ( don't waste your cash ) and read it just so you can argue intelligently when someone tells you how great a book it is."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"The Dresden Raid has been written of by numerous people and particularly by those that were neither there nor in most cases even born at the time.Early 1945 was good for those of us on our side as it goes, who had already had more than five more than disturbing years of war.Kurt like any reasonably deep thinker, even as young as he was at that time was pitched into the mix and emerged perhaps just a mite unhinged by it all.He portrays that well in what we might recognise from his later works as \\"his own inimitable style\\".Revenge it most certainly was, combined with a graphic example of \\"there you are you Ruskies, how's that then?\\"War, to be successful is about humans killing humans, keep as far away from wars as you possibly can, ours was a fine example and it has to be said......well done us.Ray"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Truly an American masterpiece.

It is very, very, very good. It is also based on the authors experiences in World War II so its got factual parts to it.Also, the &quot;So it goes&quot; statement is a something the Tralfamadoreans say after someone dies. This is because they consider death to be another stage of life.

Vonnegut wrote a great book with good use of words and a strong statement about war.I enjoyed Billy's strangeness very much. He developed the characters very well, and he made each of them round by showing different aspects of them. This is also a very good science fiction book that does not follow the exact mold of one. I say that because the aliens in the story have very little to do with Billy course (the time-traveling) through life. I also like how the book doesn't really follow any set plot line. It skips from one point in Billy's life to a different one without warning.

Billy admits that he never cried throughout the whole war, even through all of the deaths he had witnessed and the destitution he had survived.Vonnegut adds to his description of war's evils by suggesting that soldiers grow to be robots with no consciences as to what effect their desctructions really have.Vonnegut has beautifully constructed a novel which is laugh-out-loud funny, yet tragic, and extremely thought-provoking. A great book!"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I always enjoy rereading this book.

It was a sobering experience."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I read this book four years ago, so this is what remains of it as a shadow of my original impression. Sure, it's a very strong anti-war story, but what else is it? Prerequisite is Palm Sunday, where Vonnegut explains the origin of his interest in Germany and Germans. Billy Pilgrim is a symbol for all of us are aware and insecure enough to feel disconnected because we have no roots (our connection to old pre-immigration culture has vanished). If you find this book hard to read then maybe you have no such trouble to be American today: you're not 'unstuck' because you fit. People who feel unstuck from modern consumerism and all its idiocy might say that they feel like they're from some place else, like 'outer space'. Anyway, following the Holocaust and also the far less important but still very sorrowful allied destruction of medieval architecture in Germany, the ending of the book in Dresden is believable-the old Wirt worrying that people need food, drink, and shelter and offering it. Sister book/complement to Schlacthof Funf is Mother Night, where maybe Vonnegut imagines himself on the other side-? I was in A-burg when the opera played Schlacthof Funf in Munich and didn't bother to go. I had read that Vonnegut didn't go because they invited him AFTER constructing and planning the opera, but not before."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I caught myself laughing out loud, and two minutes later, almost coming to tears while reading this book.

Its a smart, insightful, poignant, and witty novel that approaches such subjects as the fire bombing of Dresden, time, modern warfare, and even death (so it goes) from some of the most original and unforgetable standpoints ever conceived of in modern literature. If there is any tragedy associated with this book, it is the fact that Mr. Vonnegut was not awarded the Pulitzer or Nobel Prize for writing what is without a doubt one of the great anti-war classics and a landmark of 20th century American literature."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"An excellent book.

I didn't know that more people died in the Dresden bombing than in Hiroshima. Truman's speech, given verbatim in this book (supposedly, I didn't check) was very eye-opening.So the value here, to me, was to learn a little history in a palatable and interesting story.

The only other Vonnegut I've read is Breakfast of Champions, which struck me as a self-serving pity-fest. Slaughterhouse-Five seems no less bleak, but at least it's bleakness is tempered with a nastily acerbic sense of humor which made me occasionally snort at the wretchedness of life, the universe, and everything. I think I'd have to be a bitchy, nihilistic teenager again to really love it though. And I have to say, this book has an incredibly strong reservoir of bitterness, defeatism and hatred which seems to be hovering just below its surface and which even the satire can't make entirely palatable. I wonder if one reason Kurt Vonnegut is so good at writing about what miserable wretches human beings can be is that maybe he was something of a miserable wretch himself. I get that living through the fire bombing of Dresden would probably fundamentally alter how anyone looked at their fellow man for the worse but man, Vonnegut seems like an incredibly rare, insufferable breed of jerk at times."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I don't think it's the best SF novel I've read, though, I've been told it resembles more of a dark satire. Sure. Not the best in that area neither (SF:Dune, DS: Catch 22) Well, it has no major characters. It does teach you a little about Dresden. I assume it was accurate to what really happened, I didn't pay attention in High School History. It basically makes light of the horrendous civilian deaths by fire bombing, by singling out a looter amongst the burnt out rubbles shortly after, who was taken and shot as a looter for charges of being not fit for a civilized miliary man. I didn't think it was funny. Many think it's funny cause it's ironic.Just wanted to share my insights. I'm a huge Sci-fi reader. This was more of the other genre. More focused on irony, which is funny for some. I think Catch 22 is better."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"When I start to read a book, I always read the summary on the back first. This book's summary did not help me at all. The book is without a doubt, very different indeed. Nothing could have prepared me for what Slaughter-House-Five had in store for me. On a scale of one to ten, I would have to give the book a five, because of the way it was formatted. The chapters jump around so much between time scenes, that it made it very difficult to follow along. Besides that, the book was written very well. Kurt Vonnegut is a very descriptive writer, but I could have done without the foul language.In a way, I feel that Kurt is Billy Pilgram, in that Kurt is senile and really thinks he is Billy. He might be suffering from Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD), but that is too hard to tell from just one of his books. I've made that assumption thorough what I have felt the author was trying to say behind the lines. Kurt talks as himself in the first part chapter, and as if he were Billy in the rest of the bookThere were parts of this book that made me laugh out loud when I was reading it. Other parts of this book gave me a real feeling of what it was like to be in the war and the hardships people went through. One thing I am for sure of is that Kurt Vonnegut is a very descriptive writer. There is just something about Slaughter-House-Five that drawls you into it and keeps you going even when you want to quit.I truly enjoyed some parts of the book. I believe that the only reason that I wouldn't say that Slaughter-House-Five is one of my favorite books is because of the way that Kurt Vonnegut formatted it. I would recommend this book to a friend, if they really enjoyed reading and they could understand what is going on in between the lines."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"There are few books that contain the events about an author's life in which they are not addressed as autobiographies. Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five; the Children's Crusade is one of those few. This story is of Vonnegut's life, but his life is changed by adding a few fictional plots throughout the novel. However, there are many references to factual events that occurred to him as well. Vonnegut may have done a fine job describing the exciting events of his life, and creating new incidents, but that was not enough to keep my full attention while reading this novel. Quite frankly, this piece of literature was not exactly a \`page turner.' His idea to create his life under the name of someone else, (Billy Pilgrim), was intended to give himself relief from the way he felt about his time in war. Billy Pilgrim was what Vonnegut called \\"unstuck in time.\\" He travels back and forth to different time periods in his life. In the novel his first occurrence of being \\"unstuck in time,\\" happens just before he is captured behind German lines. When he once returns from his time travels, he is taken to Dresden where he is kept as a prisoner. During the bombing of Dresden, he hides in an airtight meat locker, and emerges to find a city of annihilation. Vonnegut, also known as Billy, feels guilty for being saved while thousands of others were killed. His whole life from that moment on is full of sorrow and guilt. He cannot get rid of the feeling he could have done something to help the others who died, and he feels he is a horrible person for saving only himself. Vonnegut does not do a high-quality job of venting his true feelings of his time in war. He avoids actually saying directly that Billy Pilgrim feels responsible for many of the other deaths. He tries to get his point across without actually literally saying that he suffers guilt. The way that he addresses it is very indirectly. He goes about it by almost flat out saying that he is insane. He accuses his mentality for the death of the people rather than blaming his decision. Billy Pilgrim, through the entire novel, is a man losing more and more of his wit each day. It is shown in the novel that he is losing his mind for the reason that he claims \\"toilet plunger shaped aliens\\" kidnappe him and take him to their planet as a hostage. This is evidence that not only has he lost his psyche, but it also proves that he repeatedly has visions of being taken hostage over and over again. He continually remembers the point in his life where he was held hostage, hence the apparition of the aliens. This confirm that he must think about the event at Dresden all of the time, and must in some way be disturbed by it. After being bombed in Dresden he, meaning Billy or Vonnegut, is not capable of living an enjoyable life. He is tortured by his thoughts. From then on he is doomed to a life of anguish. Therefore, Vonnegut has created this novel to spice up his history to make it seem as though he did not have a poor life. He also created this piece of literature to apologize, in some very strange way, for have only saving himself. Writing this novel produced for him to relieve his feelings of his war time and to show that he not only thought of himself, but the others also involved in the war. I feel that Vonnegut wrote a very confusing and choppy piece of literature. It is not consistent in where he is going through the novel, and many times there are gaps, as too what will happen next. He leaves many things up to the reader to decide what will occur after that. I do respect and give Vonnegut much credit for creating a piece that contains nothing like I have ever read before. This novel contains a lot of fictional experiences tied into true and real life events in history. He has made a story that is supposed to be some what real life, but Vonnegut has added in many things that are difficult to consider. He has created a new genre of literature that I would have to title; \\"fictional reality.\\" This title is appropriate simply because Vonnegut ties in many of the events of World War Two into his novel, but also includes prophesies and illusory characters into his narrative. There are many stories that I would prefer to read more than this novel. Such as Cat's Cradle, simply because it is better written. I enjoyed this novel much more because it is completely fiction, as apposed to half real life and the other half imaginary. This novel is much more entertaining, since it is easier to picture what is happening, rather than being confused throughout the entire plot. Overall, I perceived Slaughterhouse Five; the Children's Crusade to be somewhat strange and intriguing, yet it did not have enough \`pizzazz' to keep me glued to the novel. Also, it lacked many characteristics and qualities that I look for in a book. Once again, I do want to give credit to Kurt Vonnegut for writing such a creative and unique piece, but to anyone who has not yet read this novel, I do not strongly recommend reading it."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"The book itself was in perfect, brand-new condition, but it was a different cover which was disappointing.

The main character of the book, Billy Pilgrim, goes on many different adventures, some at home, and some on other planets several quadrillions of miles away from earth. Many lessons are taught in the book, some which certain people may disagree with. Among these are ideas that cannot be controlled, and the future cannot be altered by your decisions. Another suggestion is that death is not a large thing to worry about, as one can remember the good parts of someone's life, not just how they are now. However, these lessons have the potential to be disregarded by people who believe otherwise, if they are not already.An interesting aspect of the book is that it is written in a format similar to the described Tralfamadorian format in the book. Several small passages make up the majority of the book, which alludes to the way the inhabitants of planet Tralfamadore format their books. Their books are meant to contain many short, happy memories that can all be viewed at once to form a single image of contentment. However, not all of the scenes in this book may be viewed as joyful. Plenty morose sections counter the good in this book.The repetition of \\"so it goes\\" (1) in this book is unique and confusing. Usually it follows a mention of death, therefore following the main theme of life being uncontrollable, but is absent at certain instances, such as the death of Russians. This may be because the author doesn't like this group of people for some reason, or it may just be one of the many cases of disrespect in this book.This novel has many inappropriate aspects as well. Wikipedia commented that \\"Because of its realistic and frequent depiction of swearing by American soldiers, its irreverent language (including the sentence \`The gun made a ripping sound like the opening of the zipper on the fly of God Almighty,') and some sexually explicit content, Slaughterhouse-Five is among the most frequently banned works in American literature, and in some cases is still removed from school libraries and curricula.\\" (2) This is true, as many swear words were often repeated, and coupled with pornographic content at the end of chapter nine, this book may not be recommended to some audiences. Not to mention the fact that the repetition of this content distracts from the meaning found in this novel. However, any alterations to create a censored book would drastically alter the plot, so unfortunately it is hard to avoid this content if one wishes to read the novel.In conclusion, Slaughterhouse 5 is a unique book with many hidden details that this criticism just touched the surface of, though it may not be recommended to some audiences. Vonnegut has created another novel that matches his style exactly.(1) Slaughterhouse 5 by Kurt Vonnegut(2) Wikipedia Search \\"Slaughterhouse 5\\""},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"How this book became a classic is beyond me.

It is the story of Mr Vonnegut remembering his experiences which centred around 13-14 February 1945 during the levelling of refugee-swollen Dresden. Through his protagonist, Billy Pilgrim, he might be expressing the idea that atrocities of this type are not inevitable events. Billy Pilgrim slips in and out of consciousness, spending an equal time with his memories of his war years and fantasies of alien abduction. Mr Vonnegut is probably making a case against such moral somnambulism. This is an unconventional novel for many reasons. First, it is a war novel which is not glamourous. Further, my literature teachers tell me, ;D it is outside the novel tradition, which focusses on creating realistic characters with psychological depth. These are the things which I appreciate about this fine novel. On the other hand, these ideas don't make for an interesting read. Cardboard cut-out characters which are no more than posters for political ideas becomes less fascinating as the book lumbres along. As a political statement, I find it a bit hollow. It makes a point that the fire-bombing of Dresden was wrong. (duh?) At the same time, it neglects the more complicated task of offering viable alternatives to war? It reminds me of ranting by a veteran who gets drunk and makes phone calls late at night. If you made it this far before hitting the &quot;no&quot; button, thank you. ;D If you are interested in one of the most important books of the mid-twentieth century, this book will be interesting to you."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Mind poisoning and looks at life as a free period to do anything and everything in instead of life meaning something.

Why so many people think so highly of this book is a mystery I shall never hope to solve, probably not even on Tralfamadore. I found very little humor in it, and the wit was dry and unimaginative to say the least. I would strongly recommend anyone who thought they have read a profound piece of work in this book to turn their attentions to the brilliant prose of Thomas Hardy and then draw their conclusions.

It also follows the life of Billy Pilgram, one of these POWs at other times in his life. Billy believes himself able to time travel and believes that he was once abducted by aliens that studied him as well as the other Earthlings they periodically capture. Because of his time traveling abilities as well as the insights that the aliens imparted on his life, he knows how his life will be long before he actually experiences it. Much of his life is shaped by his experiences as a POW and war time is a period that he frequently revisits during time travel.Not only did I have trouble and frustration with the plot of the story, I simply did not enjoy the writing style. I found the constant use of the phrase \\"So it goes\\" to be distracting and annoying. It is never clear whether the reader is to believe that Billy can actually time travel or whether he is completely out of his mind. At times it seems as though his inventive memory is completely influenced by things he has read or seen and that this is simply his reaction to dementia. Other portions of the book leave the reader thinking that it is possible that he has powers that others do not. Either way, it makes for a confusing and disjointed story that is not particularly enjoyable. It is a novel that is ripe for discussion in a high school or college lit class that will excite the professor and utterly confuse and bore the student."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Though this book has so many reviews, I decided to share my opinion. It appears that a fair number of people love this book, as it was at my school when we read it. However, I'd like to tell anyone who thought it was overly strange and disjointed, I agree! So it goes... some enjoy classics like this, some do not. My english teacher told me I took it too seriously. All I have to say to him is, \\"Po-tee-weet!\\""},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"As one of the set books on my university course I found Slaughterhouse Five to be the most enjoyable of the lot (so far)...At heart, Slaughterhouse Five is sf but rated highly on anybody's list because it's not just sf. It's genreless if you like. The point of narrative is constantly changing, the main character, Billy Pilgrim, timetravels to the extent of knowing the time of his own death. Of course, Slaughterhouse Five's theme is war, more precisely the impact of war on the minds of its survivors (Kurt Vonnegut in the driving seat). And the mix of realism with humorous sf makes Slaughterhouse Five one of the most enjoyable books I've read in a while. But it."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"To judge by your reviews, I'm certainly in the minority. I read this book for a reading group and the best thing I can say is that it was mercifully short. I found the style disjointed and artifical. True, it gave one a desolate feeling about war and its follies, but cerainly other books have done it better, certainly in a more attainable less tedious style."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Kurt Vonnegut'sSlaughterHouse-FiveSlaughterhouse-Five is about a World War II veteran who is struggling to understand people, time, and what people think of time. This books protagonist is Billy Pilgrim although Kurt Vonnegut wants the readers to know that he himself is part of the story.Billy Pilgrim has experienced many difficult and abnormal points in his life during and after the war. He sees his life as a never ending timeline where he skips back and forth recounting events that made him feel a certain way. Maybe, Vonnegut wants readers to know the feeling of emptiness and confusion that war veterans face or wants us to see life in a different way, a more happier way. Either that or Vonnegut wrote a really good anti-human/war book. However, Vonnegut does begin the book with establishing that war on earth is inevitable.The book starts out as Kurt Vonnegut's own account, he is in 1967 and is visiting the slaughterhouse where he was once held captive by German soldiers during World War II. He's with a friend also from WWII. Later, Billy Pilgrim is brought into the story and is said to be \\"unstuck in time\\", meaning Pilgrim has the ability to move from time period to time period. For now he is in 1968 and has survived a plane crash... I think Vonnegut adds an 'alien' encounter in the story for us to further understand the timeline we live in and are not bound to. Its always easier to explain how human life is when you look at it from the perspective of 'aliens'. In the part where Billy Pilgrim is abducted by aliens, the aliens teach him how life is just many accounts of good and bad memories and people should pick out the good parts and enjoy them. While recuperating from his plane crash, Billy's wife dies. Billy becomes more and more obsessed with how he sees life differently and he begins to share it via the media. His adult daughter begins to think that he's going insane. Billy moves back and forth from when he was captured by German soldiers to post-war with his family. In his memories of war he remembers himself feeling like 'The Three Musketeers' with his friends- this being an example of Vonnegut showing Billy only remembering the happier time in life.\\"So it goes\\"... I still have to finish the book even though I don't want to because I can't understand the point nor relate to it.All books need a point, Vonnegut goes back and forth. 'CHANGE the world' and 'changing the world is POINTLESS'.This review is in dedication to Mr. C and his fantastical job at teaching."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughterhouse Five is by far one of the greatest books ever written. The constant skipping around of the writter may distract some readers, but in actuallity, it raises the vlue of the compelling story of Billy Pilgrim. Never has a book so greatly captured my interest. Slaughterhouse Five is definatly one of the new classics, and will remain a classic for decades to come."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"While I was a bit suprised by the plot of the book, I wasn't expecting the whole unstuck in time thing when I picked it up. Nevertheless I found the theme to be particularly moving. The way these dijointed events all interconnected. I couldn't give it a five because I had to right a chacter analysis of it and found it so frustating that I'm kinda bitter."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"add to the encomiums? The vast, modern anti-war literature contains but one equal, but Celine required over 700 pages to say the same things. Slaughterhouse Five wins the prize for economy; and for great story telling. I never &quot;believed&quot; in science fiction until I took that little trip to Tralfamadore with Billy Pilgrim and heard the Message about the Golden Rule. Is it correct that the Golden Rule is not to be found anywhere in the Bible? If not, then I can now understand why. When I lie awake sleepless at night I sometimes pass those crazy hours recounting to myself Billy's time on Tralfamadore and reflect upon the true meaning of Charity. If all of the foregoing seems too personal a tale then I am able to say with some certainty that the reader has never been possessed by a book."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This book goes beyond most books. There truly are very few books that can transcend this far. Just describing this book is difficult, but I'll give it a try.It starts with an introduction from the author about what went into the book at first, and basically tells the entire story, which seems to suggest that it's plotline doesn't matter (which is even more amplified by it's unpredictabe path), and what matters most is the content.It then plunges the reader into a mish-mash of the life and times of Billy Pilgrim (who's name suggests even more about himself). Very little seems to take place in Dresden (the seemingly main point of the stroy based on the title and the introduction), yet the story seems to focus on it somehow.That is pretty much all that can be said, because to try to explain the plot would be completely fruitless.So it goes."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"What my college English professor said about this novel basically wraps it up. He said, &quot;If you die and have not read this book, you will have died an illiterate person&quot;. Therefore, you should read this book. It will make you see the world in a different way."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I read this book when it first came out, and believed it to be a wonderful commentary on war and human nature. I just reread it for a book club and found it much better the second time around. It is simple in its narrative, yet complex in its commentary. And so it goes."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"In the genre of WWII novels, the literary world has been doomed to romantic tales of our heroes fighting the Nazis. Not Vonnegut! While challenging our convictions with tempting and subversive viewpoints, Vonnegut allows us to look inside of ourselves and each other through the mind of Billy Pilgrim. While the science fiction and lack of defined plot may be dreaded by literary traditionalists, Slaughter House V is a respectable necessity that everyone should read. A Catcher in the Rye search for ourselves in a world full of daunting and overtly oppressive realities. Congrats, Mr. Vonnegut!"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Finally, abook that actually deserves five stars. I literally couldn't put it down. It is my frist Vonnegut and will definitely not be my last. It isn't the least bit confusing and goes by almost efforlessly. Totally enteraining."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This is my favorite Vonnegut novel, even after Breakfast of Champions and Galapagos, because it is the simplest way to sum up the whole of any person's life. If one reads it for the fun and tragedy of the book, or if he reads it for the in depth struggle of a personal war, he reads it and enjoys."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"In buying this book I expected to read about the firebombing of Dresden, and instead got an alternative view of war and its impact on people. The storytelling by Vonnegut was rather sporadic and unorthodox, and was not at all what I had expected to read. But once I had started, I could not put the book down. It is one of the better books which I have read, but not the best."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I'm reviewing a second reading of this book. Fifteen or so years have gone by since I first picked it up with unreal expectations and a teenager's misunderstanding of many of the key ideas Vonnegut attempts to set forth. The first time I was amused and occasionally moved by the poignancy, drama and rather offbeat satirical insight of aspects of life I couldn't yet hope to have a grasp on. Now, this time, after a day and a half of plowing through this remarkable (and remarkably easy to read) novel I feel as though I have been touched to the very core of my being . . .Now of course this praise is a bit high-faulting, based more on my mood at the time of the undertaking, but it is a powerful and educational experience nonetheless. A story of time and key moments lived in jump-cut fragments, Slaughterhouse Five relates the key memorable moments in a man's life, a man so harrowed and scarred by irrational realization and recognition of the horrors of the world he lives in that he literally becomes 'trapped in time'.Not so much a 'science-fiction' novel as a study of mental degeneration, Vonnegut tells the story of Billy Pilgram, a man who witnessed the greatest massacre in the history of warfare and lived through it to become a productive, happy and successful member of American society. But he is haunted by the past and his witness has allowed him to not just to expect the worst from the future, but to accept it, to allow these events to crash down upon him (plane crash killing all but him, death of a wife, the increasing indifference and resentment of his children as he grows older, et cetera, ad infinitum). The statement of 'time' as a concept lived all in the same moment, of life existing spontaneously in elliptical cycles, past merging with future and the present never truly mattering relates how desolately unhinged this victim of circumstance has become. I do not believe that Billy has truthfully become unglued and randomly travels through time, back and forth, throughout his life, but that his life simply stopped at the bombing of Dresden and the shattered reflections and memories of his overwhelming terror and moral approbriation have haunted him throughout his life, so much so that the rest of his existence is spent waiting to die; simmering, forever experiencing the past as his life forms and decontructs in the present tense. The addition of an alien society actually take the place of God, a once loyal concept that ceased to hold meaning for him. These aliens have simply given him a new gospel to preach, a new understanding to base his life upon and, whether real or imaginary (like any conceptual 'higher power') they have a profound affect on his life.It is a deep, very personal look (Vonnegut repeatedly refers to himself throughout the novel, opening with a very significant autobiographical chapter that outlines his own ideas on witnessing the massacre) and even goes so far as to include a fictional recreation of himself shuddering right there in the slaughterhouse beside all these products of his imagination, imagination, it seems, saving his own life. For all its simplicity, for all its good-natured and often dark comedy, there is no laughter in this book. There are smiles, there might be the occasional titter, but the ultimate effect, for me at least, was one of aching, heart-rending movement, stirring even my own black heart of pitilessness into a genuinely humane feeling of honest human empathy.And the best part is, reading over several of the other reviews, is that it seems to affect each reader in a dicisively different manner . . ."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This is a serious book about war seemly hidden by Vonnegut. The book jumps around a good bit, as the main character is unstuck in time. Because of this and the lack of character interaction, many people may find the book a hard read. However, the book is well worth the effort. It certainly gave me a new perspective on conventional war."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This is a great little book. It's the story of Billy Pilgrim, a kind of awkward nobody who floats through life without really living it, and who becomes successful in spite of himself.There are two main themes in the book. The first has to do with the way Billy's perspective on life is affected by his ability to travel through time. The book too jumps between periods in his life, revealing a bit more about Billy's life with each jump. Billy is eventually abducted by aliens who tell him that time travel isn't a strange thing at all; the aliens can see time all at once as a sort of panorama. They even know how the universe will end. This may explain Billy's way of life: he never takes action because he already knows how it all ends. So do we. In the begining of the book Vonnegut tells us how the book ends. Further, as each character is introduced we get a bit of his future (like how he dies). This technique may seem a bit anticlimactic, but it lets you see life through Billy's time traveling mind. By the end of the book I felt like I didn't care about anything in real life either since I knew how the universe was going to end :)The second theme is the firebombing of Dresden by the allies. Kurt Vonnegut was there himself and he pops up unobstrusively throughout the book. Billy is completely numbed by the war and by its horrible horrible violence. By the time the bombing starts you've already experienced the petty nature of war, the tiny details that mean the difference between life and death for tired, miserable soldiers. We don't really know who the good guys are. He talks about jews and gypsies being turned into soap by the Nazis with the same dispassionate prose as he uses to describe German civilians being turned to dust by the allies. This theme is especially timely as our leaders prepare to march us into one war after another.The two themes merge together to make you really feel how insignificant life's problems are, and how important it is to focus on and enjoy the happy times.A final bonus is that you get all of this in a very efficient dose. The book is short (only ~200 pages); you'll finish it in a day or two, and be ready for your next Vonnegut book."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five is increadable. It is a book that gets better every time you read it. His style of writting is fast paced and full of things you won't catch the first time. His unique narrative sets this book apart from all other novels I have read and his message is profound. A must read for everyone."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughterhouse five presents a refreshing view of the time-worn anti-war theme. The novel skillfully blends history, science fiction, and humor to illustrate the story of Billy Pilgrim, a man who was never made for war. Slaughterhouse five focuses more on Billy's life than the actually bombing of Dresden to show that war itself is not as dramatic as the people's lives who fought it and were changed by its effects.If you are deciding whether to read Slaugherhouse five or Catch-22, pick Slaughterhouse five. Though both books are similar in theme, Slaughterhouse five is shorter, easier to follow, and far more amusing and enjoyable than Catch-22."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I first read this book as a student and found it brilliant. I then went on a Vonnegut binge and though I enjoyed his other books (with the exception of Galapagos) none came close to this one. The cover blurb praised the book as \\"funny, compassionate and wise\\" and I can only concur. The story deals with weighty topics like war and death, and though funny it avoids flippancy. And in Billy Pilgrim Vonnegut has created one of the most pathetically likeable, characters in all of fiction.If you still wonder if you must read the book, just read the first one or two lines of the story proper (not the introduction). If that fails to interest you, don't bother."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This is a combination of a lot of different things. It's funny, yet sad, and quick, but deep. It's a fast read, but it will stick with you for a very long time. The protagonist bounces around in time and space and the book follows his confusion as he passively progresses through the story. Time has no meaning, and even when he hasn't been traveling, the days march on without any regard to Billy.Billy Pilgrim is an observer to everything going on around him. He has no control over the war, he has no control over the zoo he's put in, and he has no control over his own life (he only remembers proposing to his wife in a fit of pseudo-madness). He has no power and no sense of self. He follows along to what others do to him, or simply obeys the orders of those around him. He's become as desensitized to life as he has to death. Every death is closed with a simple &quot;So it goes&quot; and every living person is simply talked about, not interacted with. There's no passion, no anger and no other emotions in his existence. He simply reports what he observes and waits around to see what will happen to him next.This book is definitely worth reading. Ride along with Billy on his insane voyage through time and space. See if you can discover which is more mad - strange space aliens that kidnap people for their interplanetary zoo, or the human fire-bombings of Dresden and the concentration camps of the Second World War."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Kurt Vonnegut is a GENIUS. Pure genius. After reading some reviews of this terrific work, I can understand why he formatted the book the way he did. He wanted to separate the pure Earthlings from those who have the potential of becoming &quot;unstuck&quot; in time, and then speak to those who could understand and even those Earthlings with the desire to understand. All of this is Slaughterhouse-speak, but in order to read this excellent piece of work, you must disregard the conventional novel structure. Let go of your book-reading safety net and let Vonnegut unwittingly spin his tale in the organized and haphazard genius that Slaughterhouse-5 follows. Those who criticize the outline to which Slaughterhouse-5 adheres simply have not allowed themselves to open their minds to something out of the ordinary...which this book truly is.Billy Pilgrim is a well-developed character, and although the majority of the book is written in third-person, the reader feels as if they are reading a first-hand account. He becomes &quot;unstuck&quot; in time, as many of us wish we could do and sometimes are able to do within the dark corridors of our psyche, but for Billy Pilgrim, it is via the horrors of World War II and the bombing of Dresden. But what is truly remarkable is how Vonnegut weaves aliens, time travel, and war stories together without turning off the average anti-science fiction nut. The story is kept witty and intellectual with the underlying struggle of Billy Pilgrim, and kept fresh by &quot;randomly&quot; (as some people refer to the structure; however, do not take the genius of Kurt Vonnegut so lightly...the structure is easily underestimated, which is a mistake you cannot make when it comes to Vonnegut) jumping in between the different periods of Pilgrim's life.If you doubted this book initially, have another stab at it. You are missing something crucial, and you are getting caught up in the way in which the book is formatted. This is an excellent, EXCELLENT piece of literature that can only improve with every reading."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"In my opinion, Slaughterhouse-Five was a very thought-provoking book and I enjoyed it very much. At first the story seemed a little slow, Vonnegut actually devoted the first chapter to tellin ghow he considered the book a failure and how he could not seem to write a book about his experience in Dresden. he goes to a friend who also cannot recall anything significant about the bombing. The next chapter seemed to start to pick the book up. The war is not mentioned until about half way through th chapter and then spastically jumps in and out of Billy's military career. The is perhaps a message that Vonnegut is trying to get across. He does not say much about war because war is senseless and there is really nothing to say about it. Billy seems to be unphased by death when he is in the war. This is shown when his group is being shot at. Billy is narrowly missed by a bullet and stands stil in order to give the shooter another chance at hitting him. If Billy does not see death as a thing to fear he must not htink of war as anything too important. From Billy's point ov view all the war brings is death. Even after the bombing of Dresden Billy does not pay attention to the dead bodies he is cleaning up but focuses on other, more obscure details. FOr instance, Billy said that the best moment of his life was laying on the horse cart under the sun in Dresden. MOst people could not be able to enjoy any moment in Dresden after the bombing rad with the 135,000 dead people all around. This unrelenting obliviousness gave Billy a comical aura. There is much more dark humor such as this spread throught the book. It's the unique humor that makes this book stand out from the many others I have read"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Of all the books I have ever had the pleasure of reading, few can match the caliber of Slaughterhouse Five. It is witty, frightening, and unconvential. I had no idea what to expect when I first read the book, but one thing two things that I got out of reading the book were to expect the unexpected, and that everything is related to something else somehow. If you looking for a good read, pick up a copy of Slaughterhouse Five!"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"A friend of mine, asked me to read the book &quot;Cat's Cradle,&quot; also by Kurt Vonnegut, I didn't enjoy it all that much. Then I was assigned to read a science fiction book for school, so I chose &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five,&quot; this book was hilarious and yet very sad. I enjoyed reading about Billy Pilgrim's adventures with the &quot;Three Musketeer's.&quot; Roland Weary and Paul Lazarro are the best characters in the book! It made me think about war, and all the nonsense of it, but it also made me realize what happens to the troops. I really enjoyed the book, it made me laugh and it made me think."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"When writing about an enterprise as destructive and foolish as war, an author with a clear agenda must take an absurd approach to the subject in order to address just how ridiculous the entire enterprise is. Like Mr. Vonnegut, I also believe the beings from afar are looking at our silly little circus and asking themselves, \\"Why?\\" The book itself gets 4 stars. The man himself gets more stars then there are available to give.\\"Slaughterhouse Five\\", while not my favorite Vonnegut novel was the first I ever read back in HS. Unlike most other authors I encountered in those painfully formative years, he was saying something I felt I needed to hear.Now as a teacher myself, Vonnegut is the author I most recommend to my students who come to me looking for something different, something that will speak to them. I can't tell you how many times I've lent out \\"Cat's Cradle\\". I can't tell you how many sad teens I saw on Thursday as they all came to me to talk about the death of an author. None of them had ever mourned for a writer before. Many of them may never mourn an author again."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I first read this book as a fifth grader more than thirty years ago. The very fact that a ten year old could read it with no difficulty at all certainly highlights the best of Vonnegut -- his completely natural, clean, flowing colloquial style. Without question, this man is a great American writer in the tradition of Mark Twain.Just as Vonnegut is the modern Mark Twain, so Billy Pilgrim is like Huck Finn, only floating through time instead of floating down the Mississippi. The difficulty with this novel, however, is that unlike Huck Finn the protagonist never grows up, never takes responsibility for his actions, and never really learns anything of lasting value.Most reviewers seem to think that the message of SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE is that \\"war is wrong.\\" This would parallel Twain's message in Huck Finn that slavery is wrong. Problem is, while Huck takes action and strikes out at slavery directly, by freeing Jim, Billy Pilgrim remains merely a passive spectator throughout his life. Vonnegut tries to excuse this with a lot of sci-gimmickry, about being \\"unstuck in time\\" but in the end what really comes across is not the evil of war but one man's personal surrender.There are other problems, more specific to Vonnegut's writing. The whole outer space adventure is fascinating at first, with Billy being a pampered prize exhibit in an intergalactic zoo, with a beautiful porn star as his mate. Thirty years ago I spent hours and hours fantasizing about this -- it's just what a ten year old would think of as the ideal sexual situation.But now that I'm middle aged, I wonder about certain things. Vonnegut stresses over and over again that the tiny Tralfamadorian aliens think Billy is a \\"perfect male specimen.\\" They don't know enough about the male physique to see he's a runty middle aged man. Fair enough. But then, why do they find a stunning porn star for him to mate with? Evidently they know a lot more about women's bodies than men? Why didn't they just pick up a male porn star so they could have a matched set?Then there's the obvious contempt Vonnegut has for women. In the Tralfamadorian sections, the aliens quiz Billy endlessly about life on earth, war, suffering, justice, free will, and so on. But nobody seems to think Montana Wildhack has anything to contribute to the discussion. And evidently there are no female aliens to ask her about the female perspective. The very fact that Vonnegut does this without thinking shows how narrow minded he really is.In the war sections, one notices that beneath the hippy-pleasing pacifist rhetoric there is a lot of callousness, and some strange examples of the double standard. It goes without saying, as many critics have noted, that Vonnegut refuses to discuss the bombing of Dresden in the context of Auschwitz. \\"So it goes\\" replaces more basic insights like, \\"what goes around, comes around,\\" \\"you reap what you sew\\" and \\"you raise hell, you get hell.\\"But there are more subtle manifestations of this. For example, Roland Weary, the vicious American soldier who picks on Billy, is particularized with great skill. His behavior is not just shrugged off with a \\"so it goes.\\" Vonnegut describes it with passion. But what Vonnegut does not do is acknowledge the fact that there are SS and Gestapo agents all over Germany who make Roland Weary look like an amateur. The only Germans we ever see are noble, long-suffering and thoroughly civilized. Even as he condemns America for fighting an unjust war in Vietnam, Vonnegut implies that the German people are in no way to blame for fighting a far more unjust war against an entire continent of people. On the one hand, he insists that free will is an illusion, and no one is responsible for anything, and on the other he condemns American brutality as if we all are personally responsible for everything our government does.The fact is, as rich and rewarding as SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE is as a reading experience, it's not a book you can reread after thirty years and still respect as a classic. Vonnegut has the style and grace of Mark Twain, but not the clear moral vision."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Vonnegut once again introduces an audience to a zany world full of colorful characters and situations. In Slaughterhouse Five, Vonnegut gives a detailed description of Billy Pilgrim and the events he encounters throughout his life, as well the philosophical influence that he gains from writer Kilgore Trout (a character that Vonnegut uses in other books, Breakfast of Champions). Overall, I thought this was an excellent book. I love the way that Vonnegut writes; beginning with a story, then preceeding with a different one, and connect the two later on in the novel. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Now, hear me out! My husband is the oldest grandson of Vonnegut's war buddy, Bernard V. O'Hare. The book is dedicated to his grandmother Mary O'Hare. If the slaughter house had not been there for my grandfather-in-law to hide in while the Americans destroyed Dresden, then my husband would never have been born. I got started reading Vonnegut because I was looking for references to B.V.O'Hare, but I was fascinated by his insane humor and commentary on &quot;a world rushing headlong into madness.&quot;"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I really have some questions for Mr. Vonnegut, but I just learned that he passed away last year, in our Earthling's terms anyway. But I figured I should post a review with questions anyway as I am sure he will swing back from time to time (should I even mention \\"time\\"?) to check out these reviews. And so it goes.OK, OK, I get your main point, \\"war is bad\\". I can also get over the ambiguity whether Billy Pilgrim was demented or really could travel in time -- I guess it could really go either way and that is part of the magic of the book. Fine. But let's see, if the main point is that \\"war is bad\\", yet another point is that \\"things happened because they were bound to happen, and they would always happen\\", then what are we supposed to conclude? Should we try to avoid wars, or should we just let them happen? I also get this from the book: we should just look at the happy moments in life (or throughout the history of the universe) and ignore the bad moments. So are we supposed to just let wars happen but look the other way?So, Mr. Vonnegut, please swing back from the purple light and answer my questions. Of course, I understand you may already have answered my questions, as you always would, but I just can't see that moment yet. Please kindly post a comment if you happen to swing back, as I am a poor Earthing who can't see the future.Meanwhile, all I have to say is: \\"Poo-tee-weet!\\".And so it goes."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I was assigned this book to read for my junior year high school American Literature class. When first assigned we were told it was a book about the bombing at Dresden. Our teacher told us that it would probably be one of the most controversial and weird books we will read. When I delved into this book I was expecting another World War II book with many action and battle scenes with heroic feats, not understanding what my teacher had said about it being controversial and weird. By the end of the third chapter I came to understand the weirdness and was surprised by the content put forward by Vonnegut.It starts out slow, with mentions of the bombing and mostly talking about Billy Pilgrim and his life. I was not expecting this at all. It goes on and on about Billy and his life before the bombing... and so on. The novel then brings into play the concept of becoming unstuck from time and the views of the Tralfamadorians. Vonnegut continues to write about the life of Billy Pilgrim in the style of the Tralfamadorians and only gets to the bombing of Dresden in the last three chapters of the book. Vonnegut also brings up Jesus Christ and somehow compares Billy to Jesus throughout the course of the book.Overall this book was not what I expected it to be from the very beginning. As I said before I was expecting a very action-packed war book with many battle scenes. This book was nothing like that at all, and it ended up being a very pleasant surprise, with the story of the Tralfamadorians and how he changes his life after the encounter with them. I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it very highly to anyone."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I first read this book in high school when my English teacher recommended it. After completing it, I then went to the library and sequentially checked out and read all of the other books they had by Vonnegut. Fundamentally, it is an anti-war book based on the Allied firebombing of the German city of Dresden. The city had no real military or strategic value and was swollen with refugees; the goal of the allies was simply to kill as many German citizens as possible.Billy Pilgrim is a man caught in a cycle of situations involving the war and his value as a museum piece for the Tralfmadorians with the focus passing from one to another in an abrupt manner. Vonnegut was a master at this, creating his unique brand of satire of so many things, although at times it helps to know a bit of history if you are to truly appreciate it.All lovers of literature with a social message lament the passing of Vonnegut, all of us wishing that he had written more so that we could enjoy more. In my opinion, this is his best work and will always remain a masterpiece. It is my hope that English teachers will forever recommend his books. Praise goes to you Miss Locke!"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I have a very good friend. He is an intellectual and an alcoholic. My dad was an alcoholic but not an intellectual. I drink myself and have had a good many in depth discussions with many a drunken barroom philosopher.My old pal, the intellectual, and I have spent numerous evenings discussing \\"life, love, the here-and-now and the forever after\\" over a jug of wine or scotch and a big plate of ham and cheese. Oftentimes my old buddy would turn on the tape recorder and record our meanderings. In the days afterward, he would listen to them over and over - even without a bottle of scotch by his side.One day I asked him why in the name of heaven he was recording all our drunken babbling. He said, \\"Some day I am going to put it all together and publish it as a Kurt Vonnegut novel.\\"Reading Slaughter-house Five has been my first experience with Kurt Vonnegut and I must say my old buddy has a pretty good idea.Kurt admits to being a drinker in this book and calling friends on the phone late in the evening ... and babbling. I know nothing more about Kurt and his life than what I have read in this one short volume. But this book does remind me of many a bar-stool conversation that I have had in my lifetime.I sit down at my stool and the fellow next to me, Kurt Vonnegut, begins to expound. He smiles, laughs often and sucks me into his monologue. He begins light and airy but with a humorous gravity. A few minutes into his spontaneous dissertation, he lowers his head to the bar and goes to sleep.Ten minutes later, the bartender slaps his hand on the bar and Kurt wakes up. He immediately starts talking about his days as a prisoner of war in World War II. He talks for about five minutes and then his head collapses to the bar once again. When he awakes this time he has just been kidnapped by Martians. He talks about this experience for a moment or two but then slips off into the fog once again.Life goes on ... \\"and so it goes\\" until Kurt pops up again. This time he talks of his pal who didn't make it back from the war and somehow we slip into his wife and her current cancer treatments and then we go back to the slaughter-house where he and a few buddies were being held as prisoners during the bombing in Dresden, Germany in World War II.The next time he wakes up we are into his oldest son and the fist fight they had when the boy turned 22 and then we are off and into his third wife and her bouts with depression.Kurt wanders in and out of consciousness. He makes you laugh, he chocks you up and he changes the topic as soon as he thinks he could be losing you. His story has no beginning, middle or end. It is a feel-as-you-go type thing - spontaneous, quick-witted, personal, witty and emotional. And, like Mark Twain, he challenges the reader to find a plot. But yet you find yourself very entertained. And when you get up from your stool, you toss a few bucks onto the bar and tell the bartender to give Kurt a drink or two on you ... when he wakes up again. \\"You know,\\" you comment to the bartender before leaving, \\"every barroom needs a guy like this. You got to keep this guy around.\\" The bartender laughs.Kurt admits that he did not want to write about this subject and for much of the book he doesn't. It reads as if he wrote it with a bottle of scotch or bourbon by his typewriter. As the bottle empties the monologue becomes more intense, more emotional and more dramatic.The trick here is like with Mark Twain himself. Mark Twain was a \\"rambler\\" but he was also a serious writer. His rambling were planned and thought out and agonized over. I believe Kurt is of the same character.Contrary to intended appearances, he's not babbling and he is not drunk. He is writing, composing, creating. He is capturing his reader with variety and inventiveness. He has created a character of himself. He is definitely a \\"different\\" type writer. He has a style and a personality and it shows. He's good.Cheers Kurt. The stool next to me is always open.I will be reading more of Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. I have a big stack of his books out in my poor man's library in a shed in my backyard. Poor Kurt has been sitting out there by himself for a number of years. I will have to join him more often in my future; I'll bring a bottle of something special along.Richard Edward Noble - The Hobo Philosopher - Author of:\\"A Summer with Charlie\\" Salisbury Beach, Lawrence YMCA"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Made In Hero: The War for SoapVonnegut joked that he didn't know if people read his books after high school. With that in mind, trying to get re-acquainted with SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE can bring up a vague feeling of dread. Like a lot of people who love this book, I first read it when I was an unsuspecting teenager. I loved the prospect of a planet Tralfalmadore. The creatures who live there aren't bothered by things--not bombs, not hunger, not crowds, and least of all, history--although Billy Pilgrim is plagued by them all.That's because unlike Pilgrim (a fumbling soldier and an Earthling), the Tralfalmadoreans don't believe in free will. They don't even believe in Time. They claim it's all in our minds. To help us understand this, they compare Time to bugs trapped in amber. At any given point, \\"here we are, ...trapped in the amber of this moment. There is no why.\\"Upon getting sucked into the Tralfalmadoreans' flying saucer, Billy Pilgrim is compelled to relinquish his Earthling traits of free will and time stuckness. This is a mixed blessing mainly because he gets to relive the horrors of a prisoner of war train in Germany, and subsequently, the carpet bombing of Dresden. So it goes.Beside the absurd and hilarious parts, there profound moments in this book. They tend to involve violence. In the German prison camp, a guard takes offense at a remark uttered by one of the American soldiers--and roughs him up. The prisoner is stunned, having intended no harm by what he said. Likely, though, it implied self-pity. Rising from the ground with two teeth missing, the boy asks, \\"Why me?\\" Shoving him back into the prisoner ranks, the guard replies, \\"Vy you? Vy anybody?\\"Along with the raging humanity, Vonnegut offers self-mockery to spare. A bit turns up in the fictitious, embittered science fiction writer, Kilgore Trout. By happy coincidence, Trout lives in the same home town as Billy Pilgrim--one of his most avid fans. The problem is that the literary hero is a hack. \\"His prose was frightful. Only his ideas were good.\\"SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE is still best read with a dose of innocence, at least enough to appreciate a name like Montana Wildhack (the porn star). But it's good to know I can re-read Slaughterhouse Five and still manage to laugh. It's the Tralfalmadorean spell. Time passes, and doesn't. The glob of amber is real."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughterhouse-Five is one of the greatest books I have ever read. Kurt Vonnegut narrates the partially autobiographical account of the life of Billy Pilgrim, a fictional World War 2 veteran, as he struggles to make a life for himself after returning from bondage in Dresden, Germany. Vonnegut, known for his unconventional style of writing, fractures the story's time-line claiming that Billy Pilgrim has \\"come unstuck\\" and is traveling through time, showing us Billy's life as he sees it, not as we would. Using his overlapping time-line to effortlessly juxtapose civilian life after the war with serving as a prisoner in the soon to be incinerated Dresden and life in a zoo of the extraterrestrial plunger-like Tralflamadoreans, Kurt Vonnegut creates a literary masterpiece.In World War 2 Billy Pilgrim finds himself friendless and lost behind enemy lines. Eventually taken as a prisoner of war, Billy finds himself working in a slaughterhouse in Dresden Germany making syrup to nourish pregnant women while he and his fellow soldiers starve to death. In the sixties Billy has returned to the general populous, become a successful optometrist, and after a brief stint in an asylum, married and started a family. Interrupting his life, Billy is abducted by the Tralflamadoreans, a satire of the univocal absurdity of war and human apathy, placed in a zoo, and mated with the movie star Montana Wildhack. As the order of events swirls seemingly capricious, these three plot lines, representative of past, present, and future, all confluence to the eventual climax of the fire bombing of Dresden.Kurt Vonnegut plays with the readers emotions throughout the book forcing the reader's ruminate between laughing out loud and wanting to cry their eyes out. The three main story lines of the book, the war, life after the war, and Tralflamador, each invoke different emotional responses. After bombarding the reader with images of pain and suffering caused by the war, the time-line jumps and replaces the downcast imagery with the ironic story of Pilgrim's life as an optometrist or the ridiculous story of Tralflamador, eviscerating laughter and denying the cathartic reaction of crying just as the reader is about to breakdown. While this may seem hectic and sound cacophonous, Vonnegut pieces the story together in such a way that the ironies of a \\"normal\\" life and the satirical Tralflamadoreans blend together to heighten the sorrow evoked by the tragic plight of the American prisoners of war as they become emaciated echoes of the men they once were."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five introduces us to Billy Pilgrim, a man who has become unstuck in time after being abducted by Tralfamadorians. We follow the eccentric (and perhaps insane) Pilgrim as he ambulates through different parts of his life, from \\"red\\" pre-nascence to \\"violet\\" death-by-high-powered-laser-gun. This jumbled tale of a World War 2 veteran deserves all five of the stars it receives.It is hard to describe the plot of Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five, his masterpiece of black humor. Pilgrim time-travels between periods of his life, and the period to which he travels to is not determined by his own volition. The narrative is neither chronological nor linear. Instead, it jumps back and forth in time and place, like the mole in the famous Whac-A-Mole arcade game. The novel is structured in small sections, each several paragraphs long that describe various moments of his life.One of the most indubitably important motifs in the novel, and one of my personal favorites, is the image of a bird asking the question, \\"Poo-tee-weet?\\" Vonnegut relates this unanswerable question to the firebombing of Dresden. It corresponds to the question, \`How could we allow such a repugnant massacre to happen? How can we describe it?' As with the bird's question however, there is no intelligent answer, no valid description, no indisputable truth. \\"And what do birds say? All there is to say about a massacre, things like \`Poo-tee-weet?'\\".Another underlying theme of the novel is Pilgrim's lack of free will. When he is abducted by the Tralfamadorians, they expound upon their view of time. Rather than seeing it in a straight line as humans do, they experience all parts and times of the line; they call it the fourth dimension. Because their view of the universe is characterized by ennui, the concept of free will is ethereal to them. This is underscored when Pilgrim's father tosses Billy into the pool in a \\"sink or swim philosophy\\"; as a young child, he promptly sunk like a rock, emphasizing the lack of control over his life. Ironically, Billy likes it at the bottom of the pool. Once again, however, he is not free to choose his fate, as he is rescued and taken out of the pool. Fate makes another, more significant choice for him later in life, when he is drafted into the army to fight in the Vietnam War.Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five, by far his most provocative work, exemplifies the meaninglessness and indescribability of the Dresden massacre and questions the boundaries of free will. This American classic embodies the feeling of lassitude and apathy that many soldiers felt returning from World War 2. It is thought-provoking and is one of the greatest anti-war novels ever written."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughterhouse Five is like no book I have ever read or heard of. It is mesmerizing, thought provoking, and lugubrious. Kurt Vonnegut is finally able to write about some of his experiences of firebombing Dresden Germany during World War II in a cathartic way in Slaughterhouse Five. Vonnegut claims most of what is written is true especially the parts about war. Slaughterhouse Five is eye opening. Written in an insipid and mix of autobiography, science fiction, and in an anti- war tone it is nothing short of magnanimity. Slaughterhouse Five is told in the voice of Vonnegut and makes the reader feel there is a strong connection with Vonnegut's own pensive experiences. Though the connection is between the narrator and character is intriguing I am vexed as to why Vonnegut fails to go deeper into his own personal tale.The main character of Billy Pilgrim is born in 1922 in Illium New York and through his journey in life has been an optomologist, family man, police reporter, student of anthropology, public relations worker, among other occupations. After fighting in World War II and being captured by aliens called Tralfamadorians the main character Billy Pilgrim becomes \\"unstuck in time\\". Taken to their planet of Tralfamadore he fornicates with a famous porn star, Montana Wildhack. The aliens observe the two as extraterrestrials. Due to Pilgrim being \\"unstuck in time\\" he is able to discursively travel from periods of his life though he is unable to control what period he travels to. After a death in the novel the quote 8 0so it goes\\" always follows. It doesn't matter the circumstance. It doesn't matter who died. There is always a tone of inevitability. The Tralfamadorians believe though you can die in one moment you can be alive in othermoments which can be visited through time travel. A main theme in Slaughterhouse Five is the inevitability of death, the vacuous of life, and the pernicious nature of war.The uninhibited way Slaughterhouse Five is written caused me to ruminate over every event. I found the idea of time travel inundate and loved that it was the impetus that kept the story going full throttle. You can't help but feel horrible when you read of the tempestuous time travels of Pilgrim and try to understand the exhaustion he must feel from his circumstance. Though Pilgrim's tale could be viewed simply as balderdash one has to wonder if his demeanor is due to a combination of post traumatic stress disorder and brain damage. Viewed in this light, Billy is a strangely confused man. Though I enjoyed the amazing story of Billy Pilgrim I would have liked to see Vonnegut deeper discus the real sto ries he has to tell- ones that don't involve aliens or porn stars but the history of a brilliant author. In the end, Vonneguts history is sadly neglected, Pilgrims unbelievable story is told, and I was left quite satisfied. I have always sought a book that would blow me away with its strangeness but never found it. Until I read Slaughterhouse Five. In short you need to read this book. You need to experience it for yourself."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"It's quite difficult to throw a few stars and some constructive criticism at Slaughterhouse Five and call it a day. It feels a lot like reviewing the toothpick stuck through an impeccably-made, piping-hot corned-beef sandwich served on rye in Ireland on Saint Patrick's Day; it's just the tool used to consolidate a solar system's worth of meaty goodness. Slaughterhouse is the toothpick that keeps Kurt Vonnegut's epic account of life as a man in the 20th century from reaching critical mass and swallowing him whole, turning him into the 1974 equivalent of a Britney-venerating, codine-snarfing vegetable. Slaughterhouse is the Narnia in the back of his closet, where specters of his experiences with life, death, time, war, nature, and people can run circles around each other, freed from a chasm in his brain that required far more than savvy with a typewriter to extract. This review is tough, because I'm not fussing over a neat little book filled with numbered chapters and linear mumbling. I'm reviewing a man.Nothing about the book can be described \\"in a nutshell.\\" Without getting specific, Slaughterhouse Five is the story a man named Billy Pilgrim, whose life is documented by in-story Kurt Vonnegut, whose documentations are arranged and edited by real-life Kurt Vonnegut. Yikes. Well, what does Billy Pilgrim do? He lives his life: goes to war, marries, has children, becomes an optometrist, gets in a plane crash, is abducted by aliens, travels through time, et cetera. Okay... What does in-story Vonnegut do? He witnesses Billy's life. But... What does Kurt in the Flesh do? He uses in-story Kurt's witnessing of Billy's life to tell his own story about the hellacious firebombing of Dresden during World War Two, which only exists between the lines. The quirkiness is relentless. The kicker is, it takes careful reading of the entire book just to be aware of the three entities' coexistences; they're seamlessly integrated. They have to be, or else Vonnegut wouldn't have been able to detach enough to pick his life apart and call it art. Slaughterhouse Five is the grain alcohol of literature: frighteningly potent and impossible to drink without three people and a whole lot to mix with. Take one part Vonnegut, one part imaginary Vonnegut, one part Pilgrim, three parts Dresden Vintage Neutral-Grain Spirit, and a dash of bitters. Shake vigorously.Instead of providing his readers with food for thought, he gives them his thoughts for food. Vonnegut does not want to discuss Dresden, the (aesthetic) topic of the book; he wants readers to come to a certain understanding about it without directly saying a word, like leading a thirsty horse toward water using a puppet. He understates most major events in Billy's life with the catch-all statement, \\"so it goes.\\" Dead baby? \\"So it goes.\\" Going to war? \\"So it goes.\\" Reflecting on some of the most cruel synapses ever fired by human brains? \\"So it goes.\\" When he does go into detail, though, his rhetoric sometimes makes Shakespeare's Sonnets read like street signs. I'm not sure if I've seen a more pleasing balance struck among eloquence, articulation, power, and brevity in 15 years of literacy.If I had to guess when Vonnegut wrote Slaughterhouse Five, and I was born at any point in time after March of 1945, I'd probably say yesterday. Its relevance will barely even be diminished when we're all speaking Chinese in 2013, and even then I'm sure the translation will be fairly poignant. Vonnegut is an old man with a young mind; an old dog who learns new tricks and then offers Ph.D-level classes in them. It's a book about duality and paradox: a perpetual moment in time, overstating the shadow and understating the substance that casts it; life and death. The preface provides the operative definition by which I am reviewing this book: \\"There is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre.\\" He didn't try to. He said something true about a massacre, and then wrapped his entire life around it. In doing so, he said something true about all that is sacred to mankind. And he said it well. Five stars."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"A brilliant writer with a brilliant mind, indeed, nobody can appropriately qualify the magnanimity of Kurt Vonnegut's genius. Its made clear by his sardonic cynicism and unique voice that Vonnegut has things to say.His powerful philosophy surfaces at times, letting linger lasting quotations, insightful and enigmatic like \\"everything was beautiful and nothing hurt.\\" His work is like a written Picasso painting. The premise of the story is that Billy Pilgrim, an American drafted during World War II, becomes \\"unstuck in time\\". The structure is discursive as any other work of literature as Vonnegut pulls the reader randomly around different points in time during Billy's life. And what he lacks in perspicuity proves to be only a part of his unique art form, whether he intended it so or not.That being said, I'm vexed as to why Vonnegut might choose to write about his interesting but incredibly farfetched perception of time instead of using what seems like a fine opportunity to express his disapproval of war, which is as incendiary as the firebombing of Dresden. I'm vexed as to why he would entertain such a digression from what I can only assume is his desired message.Although he gets across a powerful message about the horrors of war in Slaughterhouse-Five, one can't help but wonder as they flip its pages why Vonnegut hasn't yet inundated them with his seemingly ebullient criticism of the human race in its current condition -because his feelings are just that; not a blas&eacute; observation made in passing, but a passionately morose disappointment at the pernicious nature of people.Vonnegut tells the story of how Billy is abducted by a race of aliens called Tralfamadorians. They take him to their planet and display him in a zoo. Vonnegut uses the Tralfamadorians as a device to advance his time theory more than anything else, the conclusion of which is that people don't have to end, because time doesn't have to move forward. One can skip around moments in their life as if jumping to different points on a circle. Again, while intriguing, this motif is only tangentially relevant to Vonnegut's broader message. Maybe he isn't ready. Maybe he doesn't have the impetus. Vonnegut writes in an obliviously artistic manner, but I would have absolutely loved this book had he strongly supported a position based on his true convictions about the human condition."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"In Kurt Vonnegut's sixth novel, Slaughterhouse-Five, Vonnegut finally explains his full story of Dresden. The story follows the life of Billy Pilgrim, a young man drafted into the army during World War II. The bellicose theme of Slaughterhouse-Five is an unmitigated chronicle of Billy that, while thrilling throughout, falters at the conclusion. Vonnegut's reversion into time-travel depicts the author's inability to end the story realistically. This diffidence formulates an incredibly weak conclusion, which paints an unfortunate shade on the portrait of Slaughterhouse-Five.Slaughterhouse-Five follows Billy Pilgrim throughout World War II, from the Battle of the Bulge in Belgium to his capture. Upon receiving a pernicious shot of Morphine, Billy begins a time-trip. This atypical transcendence of time is crucial throughout the novel, as Pilgrim falls into it frequently. Pilgrim is transported to Dresden, where he works in a slaughterhouse. Allied powers bomb the city, while Billy survives in an airtight meat locker, and returns to Dresden as a decimated shadow of its former self. Soon after the bombing of Dresden, Billy is able to return to the United States, and resumes his normal life. After his return to New York, Billy is engaged to the corpulent daughter of his optometry school's founder, Valencia Merble. Subsequently, Billy suffers a mental breakdown and is committed to a mental hospital. Upon his release from the hospital, Billy falls into his own discursive version of the \\"American Dream.\\" Slowly, Billy is subjected to ethereal repressed memories, such as a barbershop that psychologically sends him back to Dresden. After Billy's daughter's wedding, he is kidnapped by the Tralfamadorians, who explain to Billy that life cannot be viewed existentially. The Tralfamadorians prefer not to live lugubriously, but to relish the enjoyable moments of life. This alien race can see all of life's moments, from birth to death, yet they view death as trivial. Their jocundity affects Billy, despite his ability to see his own death. Upon his return to reality, Billy survives a plane crash. After numerous operations and recovery, Billy goes on a radio talk show, loquaciously spilling the details of his capture by the Tralfamadorians. Billy's daughter, ruminates over the methods of coping with his insanity, but ultimately institutionalizes him. As the book ends, Billy records a tape in which he discusses the imminent bombing of Chicago, as well as how he will experience his own death. This morose tone ends the story, but leaves the reader in the end confused.Conceptually, Slaughterhouse-Five is intriguing. Billy's repression of his memories that are triggered by the slightest connection to Dresden promotes Vonnegut's belief in the unrelenting power of the mind. This theme if not nebulously explored, could have played a more influential role in the story. However, Vonnegut's foray into the extra-terrestrial seems childish and tacky. The author's ebullient transition into science-fiction from historical fiction seems slightly bipolar. The author seems to begin the story as Kurt Vonnegut, renowned writer, but ends the story as Kurt Vonnegut, comic-collecting fourteen year old boy. Despite the sardonic nature of this review, Slaughterhouse-Five is absorbing in theory, though the fatuous ending ultimately impairs the book in its entirety."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Kurt Vonnegut's \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" is my favorite book. It is a black comedy sci-fi story that takes place throughout the main character Billy Pilgrim's life, from birth to death. The majority of which is during three eras: near the end of World War II in the German city of Dresden, his middle life at the time he spent as the exhibit of a zoo on the planet of Tralfamadore, and his later life as an optometrist in New York. The basic summary of the plot is that Billy Pilgrim was born in Ilium , New York . After graduating from his High School, he studied Optometry for one semester, then was drafted to the military in World War II. He served with the infantry in Europe , and then was taken prisoner by the Germans. He was in Dresden when it was firebombed. After the war, he went back to New York and became a successful optometrist and married a woman named Valencia . They had two children. Later, Billy was the only survivor of a plane crash on top of a mountain in Vermont . While he was getting treatment in the hospital, Valencia was killed in the car with carbon monoxide on the way to see him. He then spent time on the planet of Traflamadore as a zoo exhibit with Montana Wildhack. He was returned to the planet and wanted to tell the world of his findings. Later, Billy was assassinated, but he had seen his death many times and there was no way to stop it. The whole time when telling this story, it is constantly jumping around in time. Billy became \\"unstuck\\" in time.It seemed like writing this book for Vonnegut was cathartic. He needed to write it to help himself forget. I'll warn you, you have to be vigilant when reading this book because it constantly changes time periods. Although some don't like it, that's what I love about the book. It uses smooth transitions through time. At one time he was talking about how he was drunk and passed out in his car at an optometrist party, much time after the war, then got shaken awake and it was his World War II acquaintance Ronald Weary shaking him; which I thought was the coolest thing ever. I was excited reading the book, patiently waiting for the next time Billy would go through a rift in time. On Tralfamadore Billy learned an interesting theory about death, and learned that when someone would die, the Tralfamadorians would just say \\"so it goes\\", because that person will always be alive in the past. I enjoyed the use of him constantly saying \\"so it goes\\" after anything that died.. Things I wouldn't expect that he wrote it after, like the dead champagne bottle. Vonnegut is like a sardonic clown at a funeral. He makes the worst of things funny. It shouldn't really be considered as a comedy, but I did laugh out loud at certain points. It's a fiction novel, but it isn't all fiction. Vonnegut obviously used things from his past that he had seen in Dresden and the way he was taken captive to his advantage. He used imagery to describe things clearly and to get us to picture it how he did. I can see the zoo exhibit in Tralfamadore, and the little two feet tall green Tralfamadorians and can hear the booming explosions of grenades and rocket launchers going off as he ran with Ronald and the two others. I personally thought the book was fascinating and, without a doubt in my mind, give it five stars."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"How are you supposed to make sense out of a slaughter? Orderly, organized, logical books should not arise from the ashes of mass murder, which is inherently inexplicable, illogical, and horrid. Kurt Vonnegut's astounding novel, Slaughterhouse Five, recognizes the implicit absurdity of war, and responds with the absurdist tale of Billy Pilgrim's life. The central focus of Vonnegut's book is more or less the devastation of the German city of Dresden during World War II, from a bombing raid that killed between 24,000 to 40,000 civilians and destroyed 13 square miles of the city, but Vonnegut's novel goes far beyond one single act of banal human cruelty, focusing on various perceptions of time, human nature, and war.According to Vonnegut, his novel, which follows Billy Pilgrim through his random shuffling in time, \\"is so short and jumbled and jangled... because there is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre.\\" This view is mirrored by Dresden-survivor Lothar Metzger, who recalls the attacks as \\"not possible to describe! Explosion after explosion. It was beyond belief, worse than the blackest nightmare.\\" When Vonnegut writes about Billy and other Prisoners of War the day after the bombing raids, climbing \\"over curve after curve on the face of the moon,\\" discovering \\"corpse mines\\" where bodies \\"were cremated by soldiers with flamethrowers,\\" war is no longer an abstract, romantic concept. The chauvinistic Edgar Derby has been shot for stealing a teapot, and the war has become an incomprehensible saga of suffering and death, where invisible global forces and theoretical concepts like \\"war\\" engender unfathomable destruction.After finishing Slaughterhouse Five, the reader feels at a loss, questioning what were once incontrovertible assumptions. The foundations of popular conceptions about time, truth, progress, and morality are fractured by Billy Pilgrim's odyssey, which reveals the absurd and repugnant, yet at times redemptive, characteristics of human nature. Characters like the pugnacious and choleric Paul Lazarro, and the vacuous and insipid Valencia provide subtle insight into the various characteristics of human nature, while Billy's experiences with the Tralfamadorians provide a new perspective about life on Earth.Vonnegut's novel, with its rich symbolism, dark humor, and unique prose, provides a refreshing and welcome addition to modern literature. Slaughterhouse Five is a finely crafted story that combines moral statements with probing questions and tales of complete destruction with devastating humor to create a novel that can powerfully affect readers of all backgrounds."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I never knew much about World War II until novelist Kurt Vonnegut made me feel like I was living during that time. This novel, Slaughterhouse Five is based on Kurt Vonnegut's own experience in World War II. Vonnegut's writing in Slaughterhouse Five combines a mix of science fiction, antiwar sentiment as well as a great deal of autobiographical detail. Vonnegut is very much like the protagonist Billy Pilgrim.The writing style is captivating, and he makes his point in an inventive manner. The writing style of this book gives you a sense of the place it is set in. The writing style vivifies the reader's perspective on how tempestuous the war was. His writing was a kind of therapy. He was present at the Dresden firebombing and those parts of the novel are based on his own experiences. But it took him a quarter century to bring him self to write it, and he approaches the traumatic event cautiously, circling around it, trying to keep it at a distance with humor and a matter-of-fact tone that fails to cover the pain. This is Vonnegut's most powerful book.Billy Pilgrim has an interesting demeanor. He goes from his birth and childhood to the moment of his death. In between he is an optometrist in Ilium, the sole survivor of a plane crash, and a captive in a zoo on the planet Tralfamadore where he is mated to a porn star. Jumping through these times in his life it leads Billy to the pivotal point in his life when he was chaplain's assistant in World War II. Then Captured by the Germans and is present for the firebombing of Dresden.I loved this book. This book helped me understand our history and how it is so painful to have fought in war. Vonnegut said, \\" Life is easier if we accept our past.\\" This makes me respect Vonnegut more since, he wrote this book even though it was really hard for him to do so. I would recommend this book for teens and older as it does contain substantial profanity and sexual material. This book is a great book to talk to others about because it creates questions as to what started the war, what were the motivations for each side and what they may have thought of the bombing of Dresden. This book is full of passion, and life experiences and is a book no one should go with out reading"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five deserves its own literary genre. It is a balderdash of stories from World War II, tales from after the war, and accounts from the planet Tralfamadore. Not only does the book mix science fiction with war stories, it does so discursively. Despite the plot's constant digression, the book is not devoid of value. It is neither a completely insipid nor an entirely vacuous piece of writing. The book tells the story of Billy Pilgrim, a man from Ilium, New York, who is thrown into WWII and becomes a prisoner of the Germans. Billy Pilgrim meets several interesting people in the war, like Roland Weary, and experiences the bombing of Dresden. The most interesting part of the book is the fact that author Kurt Vonnegut is the narrator and occasionally adds first-person insight to events. Vonnegut's position as narrator allows readers to ascribe themes to a particular person. The theme of fate, for example, is no longer just a random subject but a real person's ideology. Anytime someone or something died, Vonnegut immediately followed with \\"so it goes.\\" This reveals his belief that certain events are inevitable. Such insight also allows readers to make a connection between Vonnegut and Pilgrim. Billy Pilgrim, who has become \\"unstuck in time,\\" seems to just follow where life takes him, whether it is a boxcar for prisoners of war or an entirely different planet. He has no control of his time-travel. This also shows that war probably is not good for a person's mental health, and Billy appears crazy when he tries to explain time-travel. Vonnegut expressed his own memories of the war through the fictitious character of Billy Pilgrim, and added events like his trip to Tramfamadore and sleeping with Montana Wildhack, to represent his dreams and fantasies. His appearances in the story make the implausible story seem more realistic. Another way Vonnegut manifests his ingenuity is by showing how that the Allies were not always \\"good.\\" (In fact, as described, they are both inimical and pernicious.) Most Americans are not aware of this raid that killed thousands of innocent people and transformed Dresden into an infernal blaze. He describes it in a way, however, that does not make American readers feel like their world is being turned upside-down. By stating the facts of the bombing of Dresden, he is able to show how common perceptions are not always correct.While the lack of confluence of this novel is particularly goading, Vonnegut is able to show how common perceptions are often misleading and how fate is a key factor in life. Although Billy's time-travel points to the fact that life often takes a person somewhere without their consent (or knowledge of time-traveling, for that matter), had the book been organized differently, it would have made the story easier to follow. Because the book encompassed so many different settings and events, it is difficult to classify Slaughterhouse Five and even more difficult to follow its story."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"There seems to be a lot of headiness in the ism's this book comments on. Vonnegut uses his talent to tell me, in a way that I can comprehend, about things I have a difficult time understanding. This book is about war. This book is about death. One of my favorite passages describes the following: Darwin and war are both successful only with mounting corpses.It was my first Vonnegut book and I thoroughly enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughterhouse-fiveThe ingenious author Kurt Vonnegut's book Slaughterhouse Five is about Billy Pilgrim and the Tralfamadorians. The book includes the fire bombing of Dresden, and Billy's ability to jump to different points in his life.In the introduction, Kurt explains his life in the army and how he wrote the novel then explains the story(like how he got most of the ideas and the children's crusade). He then brings us to Billy's earlier days in the war. Vonnegut is quick to explain Billy's full life, and explain both of the plots (Dresden and Tralfamadore/after the war) and opens with Billy writing a letter to bring publicity to his experiences at tralfamadore and the tralfamadorian's ability to see in the 4th dimension. Billy then jumps to the war and Ronald Weary is introduced. Billy and Ronald are then captured by Germans after the two scouts they were traveling with are shot, and are sent with a group of Americans to walk to a train. In the process, Ronald Weary sustains injuries to his feet and starts to complain about how it was all Billy's fault. When Billy then jumps, it talks about his children, how he owns a very successful optometry company, his bed, and how his son becomes a member of the Green Beret. Billy jumps back to the war and finds himself boarding a train going to a prisoner camp. He then hears that Ronald Weary has died from injuries in their feet. After a long trip with many jumps in time, Billy arrives at the German camp, where he meets Edgard Derby, whom is pronounced to be shot by a German firing squad for stealing a teacup from the ruins in Dresden after it was firebombed(Kurt also pronounces that this actually happened to someone in his squad when they were in Dresden). Billy also meets a man named Paul Lazzaro, who promised Ronald Weary that he would kill Billy Pilgrim for getting them captured by the Germans. They go to a play put on by the British prisoners(who happen to be the favorites of the German guards), then eat food cooked by the other prisoners of war. Billy lights his arm on fire and is sent to the prison's clinic. Billy falls asleep and has some more time jump, including his time on Tralfamadorian zoo and meeting the movie star Montana Wildhack, and some of his life after the war back on earth. Billy wakes up in his bed in the clinic, drowsy from all of the morphine that the Englishmen have given him. He sees Paul Lazzaro in the clinic with a broken arm and a British person apologising to Lazzaro, to which Lazzaro promises to kill him after the war is over. Billy walks around for a while, and sees Kurt Vonnegut (yes, the author) in the latrine. Quoting this scene: \\"An American near Billy wailed that he had excreted everything but his brains. Moments later he said,'There they go, there they go'. He meant his brains\\" Vonnegut then talks about Dresden and Billy's work in \\"Schlachthof-fnf\\" German for Slaughterhouse 5. The book finally reaches the firebombing of Dresden, and comes to a conclusion with how Billy goes on a radio station and talks about Tralfamadore. The story reaches conclusions to both of the plots, and talks shortly of death. As stated in the beginning the book end with birds chirping at Billy with \\"poo-tee-weet?\\".Throughout the book, Billy is a somewhat static character, but instead of Billy, the people around him change, which is a better alternative than the . I say this because he doesn't change much throughout the Tralfamadore plot(of which most of isn't included in this review), and Billy is different from the tralfamadore plot line but doesn't change in the Dresden plot-if that makes sense. The overall challenge that Billy does face is his jumping in time. The reason that Dresden isn't overall problem(even though it is the most climactic part of the book)is because it is known that Billy will face this problem throughout the book.The overall themes that Vonnegut seems to make are generally about how people can drift through life, and how war is a terrible but sometimes necessary thing. This is a somewhat repeated theme, but Vonnegut shows it with very good style and an imaginative story, making the book very much worth reading.The book is overall a very good book, with references to Vonnegut's other characters (ie. Kilgore Trout) and his own life in the war. He also includes a very vivid reality on Tralfamadore and the way the all seeing Tralfamadorians see in the fourth dimension. The very imaginative book \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\" about Kurt Vonnegut's time in Dresden and his character Billy Pilgrim's time on Tralfamadore.Works citedVonnegut, Kurt. Slaughterhouse-five.

Marching across occupied Germany in December 1944 -- six months after the Allied D-Day invasion -- Vonnegut's Infantry division was pressing the advance into German-held territory when he somehow became separated from his comrades. For several days he wandered alone behind enemy lines until he was discovered and captured by Nazi troops on December 14. They transported him to the ancient and beautiful German city of Dresden, where he was imprisoned in an underground meat locker -- Slaughterhouse Five -- with six other Americans.On February 13th, the 60th day of his captivity, Allied forces began the legendary fire-bombing of Dresden. Generally speaking, Allied bombing raids targeted German infrastructure -- especially anything having to do with manufacturing or transporting munitions. If they knew the geographic source of munitions, they would obliterate the entire area -- this being decades before satellite surveillance and \\"smart\\" bombs. The bombing of Dresden is something of an anomaly in the Allied efforts: there was no manufacturing to speak of in Dresden, so it was not really a \\"rich\\" military target.It was, however, in a little valley, and over the course of the bombing, which went on without pause for two days, the bombs and the fires they started changed the weather in the valley; it became a chimney of sorts, sucking fire through it, and the destruction of Dresden was nearly as complete as was the destruction of Hiroshima or Nagasaki, the Japanese cities incenerated with atomic bombs the next year.Vonnegut witnessed the whole thing, and survived. After the bombing stopped, the Germans had their few remaining prisoners gather corpses until this proved futile; they then went in with flame throwers and reduced the civilian dead -- numbering in the tens of thousands -- to ashes. In disarray, the Germans fell to the Soviet Union's troops three months later, and Vonnegut was liberated.This series of experiences fed into all of Vonnegut's writing, mostly in the form of a grim appreciation for the way an idea, social or scientific, can take on a life of its own, and demand that it be completed, no matter what the consequences. Most of his novels involve events that hurl forward even when no one seems to know why; they just accept it and deal with it. Regarding the bombing itself, Vonnegut once wrote, \\"There is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre.\\"Vonnegut was prolific, writing essays and stories throughout his life. He was also a tormented soul who once tried to commit suicide, but after his death at 84, in 2007, his friends and family mostly remembered his warm humor.Considered a classic of twentieth century literature, and included in both Time Magazine's and Modern Review's list of Top 100 Books , Slaughterhouse-Five showcases the idiocy of war in an original and darkly humorous way -- a feat that few authors have ever been able to accomplish. The story seems funny because it has no linear time line, and thus no ending; Billy Pilgrim, the main character, has \\"come unstuck in time\\", and he experiences times of his life -- and death -- in random order.Pilgrim survived the WWII bombing of Dresden in a meat locker, of course, called \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\", and his experiences in the war are juxtaposed with his marriage to the obese daughter of the optometrist he works for and with his drunken, late night attempts to re-connect with people who long ago forgot about him. He has also been abducted by aliens from the distant planet Tralfamadore, where he is kept on display under a geodesic dome in a zoo, making love to his fellow captive, the movie star Montana Wildhack, as the aliens watch in fascination.Throughout much of the novel, Pilgrim is deranged, either from shock at the horrors he witnessed in the war, or from the disorienting effect of being unstuck in time. At the end of the book, as an old man, ruminating on the assassinations of Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King, and distressed by the carnage of war in Vietnam, the time comes for Pilgrim to go public with his \\"unstuck-ness\\". He does so on the radio, which makes him out to be an old fool. But the reader knows better. We know what he's talking about; we know what's happened to him. Pilgrim is not un-stuck in time; his world is un-stuck from morality."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"If you are not a huge Vonnegut fan I think you will still enjoy this book.

So it goes.I admit that my venture into reading a Vonnegut book was triggered by my curiosity, yet again, after reading a lot of positive, even gushing, reviews about most of his books. For a book that's dealing with the horror and gore of war conflated with issues of time travel and alien abduction, it is so incredibly well-written. He describes the events so matter-of-factly that descriptions of corpses and human waste don't throw you off. Instead, you keep on reading. He writes with a certain level of humor washed with sarcasm that makes you appreciate the experiences that's being presented to you without feeling any kind of disgust.Billy Pilgrim becomes \`unstuck in time' after a plane crash. The story takes you back and forth to different points in Billy's life--from his experiences pre- and post-war. The novel also has some science fiction elements with regards to Billy getting abducted by the aliens from the planet of Tralfamadore. His daughter refuses to believe him and instead takes it as one of the many signs of his deteriorating health. The Tralfamadorians teach him about seeing life in the fourth dimension. They believe that their body never truly dies and that it continues to exist in other times and places when it was still alive.\\"I am a Tralfamadorian, seeing all time as you might see a stretch of the Rocky Mountains. All time is all time. It does not change. It does not lend itself to warnings or explanations. It simply is.\\"It may sound like a weird book and it is, but it also heartrendingly humanistic. The truth is, this book reminded me of J. D. Salinger's \\"The Catcher in The Rye\\". The experience as a whole felt familiar and the difference is that, I enjoyed this book a lot more than the other. Don't get me wrong. The similarity lies in the writing style and how Billy Pilgrim reminded me so much of Holden Caulfield, but that's about it. This book stands on its own, definitely. So does Salinger's \\"The Catcher in The Rye\\". I'm re-reading both in the near future because they are the kind of books that call for a second or third visit."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I read this book in an afternoon for a book club.

So it goes.. I found little wit nor much humor. I was very disappointed. I would not recommend this book to anyone, Don't waste your time or money."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I would describe this as the worst book of Vonnegut's career.Want a coherent plot? this is not the book for you. Characters whose actions make a degree of sense? Nope. Excellent examples of Vonnegut's biting wit? Not really.Seeing a trend?Slaughterhouse 5, while almost univerally hailed as Vonnegut's best work, is utterly bad. I do not know if Vonnegut was attempting to be an absurdist (if so, he didn't succeed) or whether it was merely a cathartic exercise for taking away his pain from the horrific events he witnessed in the Second World War. Whatever the excuse, it was not ever and is not now a good book.When I first read this book, I stopped reading Vonnegut for well over a year. I could hardly believe that the man who created such well crafted short fiction as &quot;Harrison Bergeron&quot; and such witty novels as Slapstick could do something this incredibly without redeeming value. Its protagonist is an anti-hero of the first rate, yet the reader is expected to sympathize with him. If Billy Pilgrim was intended as another alter-ego of Vonnegut himself, I do not think I would ever want to meet the writer in person, as he would be a let down to his own other works."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I didn't enjoy this book at all.

This book, lauded to be the capstone, the beggining for an exploration of his touted literary genious, is actually probably only useful as toilet paper.So it goes...

And I'm not reading it again to find out either. Apparently, people like almost anything in life, which is really a sad commentary on the human condition."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"i, too, was one of the deceived few who picked up this book thinking that this would be a wrenching novel, one of those novels that makes you sit there and take a good look inside yourself. Instead, there was this incredibly simple, pointless, and RAMBLING novel that went all over the place. There was no coherence throughout the book, there were no &quot;deep&quot; scenes that made me put down the book for a few minutes and say &quot;WOW&quot;, and Vonnegut has this annoying habit of making quantum leaps within his subject matter. I guess that's due to the time travel premise in the story, but that doesn't make it any less irritating. The other problem i seriously have with this book, and maybe this is why i hated Catch-22 as well, is the &quot;anti-war&quot; theme. I find it strange that a person can completely denounce &quot;war&quot;, when &quot;war&quot; (yes, as another reader said, War IS bad), freed the early American colonies from Britain's iron grip. The Great Depression wouldn't have ended if a certain man named Hitler had decided that he was satified with his little plot of land in Eastern Europe. I'm not condoning war, but, in war, as in anything, you've got to take the good with the bad. In addition, most wars have been of the unavoidable type. Remember the period before World War II when America was practicing her isolationist policy? Well, uh, we ended up going into that one somehow. Oh,hell, look at me now, I guess I'm rambling.......Anyways, if you would like to read about war, i suggest you bypass this book and peruse a nonfiction account of whatever war you're interested in. I just finished reading &quot;A Bright Shining Lie&quot; by Neil Sheehan and I'd highly recommend it. (It's on the Vietnam War.)"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I don't like how Vonnegut down-plays death. What's the phrase? &quot;and so it goes&quot;?

(In fact, my favorite...) The story is not, however, the anti-war icon which people make it to be! Billy Pilgrim is the latter twentieth century adaptation of Willie Loman (Our Town). His distorted conciousness is not solely representative of his tragic war experiences; they could have been created by any number of negative contemporary cultural influences. It just so happens that Billy Pilgrim's &quot;dementia&quot; is a result of war. This novel is more a commentary on contemporary cultural pressures and failures, than on war itself. The key to understanding this concept is looking past Vonnegut's simplistic style and finding truth in larger themes, rather than the specific language of the text."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Vonnegut really created a strange yet terrific novel. Billy Pilgrim's war memories and alien-abduction memories make the book worth reading. Through Pilgrim we see some of the horrors of war, and also the idealistic utopia on Tralfamadore. Vonnegut's disjointed, probably-drug-induced novel has a fantastic effect upon finishing it. One of the best books I've ever read, I would recommend it to all."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I don't understand why people have fallen all over themselves to praise this book. As one reader suggested, it's not the sort of book you can enjoy sheerly for entertainment. I found Vonnegut's prose style very difficult to penetrate , and the constantly shifting point of view was jarring, although the sardonic tone of the novel was often humourous. Unfortunately, I've been more gripped by stories of war (various war movies/documentaries), laughed louder at an author's tongue-in-cheek view of society (Tom Robbines, Julian Barnes), and read novels where shifing points of view help to illustrate and illuminate the story (Michael Ondaatje's The English Patient, Joseph Heller's Catch-22). But I can't deny that beyond these criticisms and what I can't deny to be some frustrations when reading this book, it was above all, a good read. . I just don't think it's deserving of the &quot;classic&quot; status that seems to be attributed to it by many readers."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"The other being One Hundred Years Of Solitude, by Gabriel Garcia Marquez.This book by Vonnegut is simply stunning - humanist, melancholy, funny; an alien's-eye view of humanity induced by his traumas during WW2.

Contains some amazing writing: the Tralfamadorians, who see the sky as 'luminous spaghetti', scouts lumbering into a wood 'like the large, clumsy mammals that they were'...I think Vonnegut has gone off the boil in recent years but all his early books are worth reading, and for my money this is the best of them.

In the novel we meet WWII veteran Billy Pilgrim, a simple man who ends up encountering aliens on the planet Tralfamadore, escapes the horrible firebomings of Dresden, and crosses time and space continuously after the war. Vonnegut both mixes grim humor and sly seriousness while reflecting on his own experiences in World War II.

Mostly it's about war, and how this guy deals with it in the years that pass. Oh, and he's also taken by aliens...and time travels. Maybe. Because alot of this book jumps around in time, it's occasionally hard to follow.That's also what makes it interesting. If this was just a day in the life of a veteran I might have been bored. In some ways I feel like I read three books at the same time. He's a POW...he's an optometrist...he's on another planet naked. Part of his time was spent in a Vermont hospital after his plane crashed into a mountain. I live near that mountain so that was kind of cool.Not many times do you read a novel about mass murder and destruction, yet remains fairly light and casual...and is part sci-fi.

I figured it would be a difficult read (going by the story of the movie) but my curiousity set it. The book was awesome and a quick read! I love both versions equally and suggest them both."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"The book Slaughterhouse-Five was a good, yet hard to read, novel. The righting style reminded me of Hemingway, with all the short sentences. The way that the main character, Billy, continually drifts off topic and how the book jumps from place to place strongly reminded my of Catcher in the Rye. If you enjoyed either of those books, then Slaughterhouse-Five would probably be a good read for you.However, the story is rather hard to follow right from the beginning. Vonnegut starts the novel as a biography of how he lived after World War II and how he was pestered to right this book. But out of nowhere, the story suddenly changes to revolve around Billy Pilgrim and his life in the war. Vonnegut's story about Billy continues to leap from place to place, and even skips around in time throughout the novel. The skipping around really got to me and eventually led me to believe that Billy, or Vonnegut, was a schizophrenic. It almost became annoying and sometimes made me want to stop reading, but there always seemed to be a part that would come along and catch my interest. I must say that even though the writing style could become annoying, the main plot always seemed to pull me in. Vonnegut uses crude language every now and then, which is normally fine with me because it's not like it's in bad taste. Now Vonnegut did not write in bad taste, but the language would come up so unexpectedly that I would usually have to read the sentence twice to realize what I just read.Overall I would have to say that this book, Slaughterhouse-Five, is a good read for a weekend or something nice to take on vacation, as that's what I did."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Are you insane? Do you like books about people who are insane? Because this is the book for you. It goes through Billy Pilgrim's journey of life including accidents, war, and aliens. Some of my friends hated it, but it gets better as you go along. If you like this sort of thing, it's perfect!!"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Kurt saw it himself - the greatest massacre in European history. Commited by America &amp; England. As Kurt tries to remember what happened he also admits that he was kidnaped by Aliens. How does this relate? What Kurt saw at Dresden was so weird that it might as well have been being kidnaped by Aliens. As horrible as this massacre was Kurt finds somthing worse... The ravages of time."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This has to be the most twisted book i ever read-in fact i never read anything like this before. The way Vonnegut makes his character travel through time is so unique and the idea that Billy is unstuck in time is hilarious. And when he gets abducted by aliens it just gets better. The aliens see everything in 4 dimensions so they can see the past, future and present at the same 'time'. They know exactly when the universe ends and begins and they know also that there is no way to change anything because it already happened, it happens and will always happen. This idea is very philosophical and really interesting. This book is very stimulating and truly makes you think. I recommend this book to anyone who would like to read something different, twisted and funny but at the same time something that is truly deep and in a strange sence very true."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I greatly enjoyed this book, especially the time travel between past, present, and future. This book was a little hard to follow, but had a great story line and characters. I liked how the author expressed his opinions through the thoughts and words of Billy Pilgrim.

So it goes....."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"The sadness and the humor mixed together in this book truly show how devastating war can be and make it hard to either feel sorry for Billy Pilgrim or just laugh at him, but Vonnegut definitely gets the point across that war is hell, in and out of it."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I am a huge fan of his writing, but sadly, it was not due to his more famous novel, Slaughterhouse Five. Whilst I did enjoy this book, I found the ending a little offputting, and it is certainly one I have forgotten, although reading it not that long ago. I felt it was similar in style, and maybe a little in substance (despite the lack of aliens) to Catch 22, although Catch 22 remains one of my favourites. Perhaps the difference between the two is that Catch 22 had time to be developed, where as Slaughterhouse Five was a tad short. I felt the method of storytelling was immensly effective, as well as highly capturing attention wise. I would love to give this novel five stars simply because Vonnegut is such a champ, but I felt there was something missing. Nevertheless, most certainly worth the short read it is."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"as a schoolteacher fresh out of college in 1975, i was hung by members of my very own home town for teaching this book. the people there remain ignorant. the words of vonnegut are as unchanged as are the pyramids. at the very worst, you can carry around a copy of it so people can point to the back sleeve and say &quot;it says it right on the cover&quot;...&quot;pornographic&quot; (poingant for those of some education). i could say nonetheless but that i recommend you memorize this novel. historical themes and personalities downplay plot. war... what war? ed"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Never a boring part and fully entertaining.

When the story of Billy Pilgrim was first presented I found the writing to be very simple in form and rather unimpressive. However, I became fascinated with the complex plot weaving orchrestrated by Vonnegut. Although the book jumps around in time, all the different sub-plots are interesting and beautifully woven together. This is the first Vonnegut book that I have read, but I certainly intend to read more of his work."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"hilarious (i dared laugh, i don't know how anyone could help but!) fast, enjoyable read, and has some big philosophical themes to chew on as well. an abundance of great quotable lines. i should've written them down, and i'm too lazy to look through it again. lacks any rising action or momentum, and doesn't reach a climax, *but it doesn't need one!* at least not with vonnegut's intriguing, original style and quirky, sometimes perverse humour. the time travel presentation really works (to vonnegut's advantage) i might try catch-22 again. i read about 200 pages. 'twas definitely funny but didn't peak my interest. i couldn't latch on to the characters like i did billy pilgrim. didn't move as well either. i'd give this novel a 4 and half if it was an option, but it was so enjoyable... hit the spot for me, but not for the vast majority"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"With &quot;Slaughterhouse Five,&quot; Kurt Vonnegut has done the near impossible - he has created a surrealistically cautionary novel that uses humor to get at the horror of war and destruction. While the aforementioned intent is almost oxymoronic, somehow Vonnegut manages to strike this very balance between humor and horror. The chief reason this novel succeeds is because it downplays dramatic confrontations and characterizations and focuses instead on a detached, external perspective in an effort to contrast the futility of mankind with his circumstances. Truly a funny book that you won't dare laugh at."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"In this book Vonnegut himself says that the entire idea of writing an anti war book is ridiculous. &quot;Why don't you just write an anti glacier book?&quot; Both of them will always be here and there is now way to stop them. This book can help you to see just how pointless this whole thing (Life) is."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I found this novel to be a very unique, intereseting novel.

So it goes..."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"but, while reading the previous reviews I came across a recurring statement that is entirely false. The Tralfamadorians did not teach Billy how to time travel. It specifically says in the book that the two had nothing to do with eachother. That is how he knew they were coming! Besides the fact, this in an excellent book about the insanity of life. Vonnugut makes humans pawns in their own lives; not really free to do anything truly purposeful, even if they wanted to, even if they tried. Because nothing really matters anyway."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I find the style of this book to be close to that of CATCH 22 , but not as good. However having said that, it is an excellent book. Its time jumping is its strongest feature, but if you like that aspect, CATCH-22 does it better."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"All I can say is that this is one wacked out book. The best line came when Billy Pilgrim was in the zoo and asked for the secret to the universe. When the Tralmafadorians replied that it is destroyed testing fuel, Billy asks if there is anyway to stop it. It was great, but it was twisted. Read with caution. This is a very difficult time period to read from and is very often confusing."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Personally, I do not care for Kurt Vonnegut's politics and lack of faith. The underlying story of Dresden is quite interesting. However, it has been in vapid dispute the number of dead that Vonnegut claims as irrefutable fact. Vonnegut paints his star \\"protagonist\\" as an uncaring nihilist. Furthermore, sporadically dispersed throughout the novel are anti-Christian rants and allusions. I believe everyone can agree war is horrible. However, the author could have wrote about it without the liberal, anti-Christian, nihilist prose. Slaughterhouse five is basically the personal view's of Vonnegut with a mildly amusing story about Dresden during World War II."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This was the most anti-human book that I've read since Gulliver's Travels. Vonnegut's cynicism and apathy are understandable considering the atrocities that he witnessed during the war, and I imagine writing the book was a cathartic experience for him, but other than that, there's not much to be gained from this novel.Vonnegut's shell-shocked brain appears incapable of distinguishing between the Germans who were injecting dye into women's and children's eyes and rendering them into soap and candles and the Allied soldiers that sacrificed their lives trying to stop them.His main points seem to be:1. War is stupid.2. People are stupid.3. Life is meaningless.4. There's nothing any of us can do about it.5. So, try not to think about the bad things in your life and just think happy thoughts.If this is your life's philosophy, you will also consider this a \\"brilliant\\" work."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Kurt Vonnegut's &quot;Slaughterhouse Five&quot; is an enjoyable read. Vonnegut writes with a smooth and witty writing style. The story of Billy Pilgrim's experiences as a POW during World War Two, including his time traveling adventures, are shocking and amusing at the same time. Confronting horror and death with humor is an age-old concept, and Vonnegut finds a good balance between the two.One thing that I kept asking myself as I read the book was &quot;what is this book about?&quot; I think Vonnegut may have succeeded in writing a book where the reader can make up his or her own mind concerning the book's meaning. Yes, it addresses the horrors of war and makes light of authority, but there were so many subliminal and idiosyncratic references to various things, places, events, people, etc., that I couldn&#65533;t help but think that I would just have to use my own creativity and ideas to figure out the book's real message.What really disturbed me about the book was Vonnegut's constant use of sarcasm and irreverent humor. Many people in modern society equate cynicism with sophistication. I respectfully disagree; I think that Vonnegut's numerous disparaging references to various institutions got old after a while.All in all, I recommend it . . . but I won't exalt it to the extent that other readers have."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I've read other works by Vonnegut and while I consider this to be one of his better works, I was fairly disappointed with this supposed &quot;classic&quot;. I have no doubt people of Vonnegut's generation at the time thought it would indeed be a classic--shocking, anti-Establishment, &quot;unconventional&quot;--and this is exactly the problem: It really speaks only to his time and generation. The prose simply doesn't stand up to the test of time and is at time unbearable to read. The oh-so hip use of language is terribly dated and things that are supposed to be shocking to his contemporary audience are today trite, the irony coming off rather simple-minded and pedantic.The greatest moments in literature are when the author forgets about sending messages and delves into what the book itself wants to say. Vonnegut seems to be too concenred with his own ego and scoring points among his peers for being some kind of Moral Conscience of his generation. In another thirty years, this book may be almost totally unreadable."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I purchases Slaughterhouse 5 for a gift for my grandson.

The humor wasn't very effective for me, and in general the book irritated me.CharactersThe book is told from the perspective of the author of the book, and the book is well aware that it is a book. The central character of the book is Billy Pilgrim, a man who lived through WW2 and the book tracks his life before and after the war. The book also talks about several other characters that Billy meets throughout the book, none of the characters are terribly deep.SettingThe book takes place during WW2 in Germany, on the alien planet Tralfamadore, where the aliens see all of time at once, it's weird sounding, and it's even weirder in the book.PlotWhen Billy is abducted by the aliens of Tralfamadore, he learns to go through time and experience the events of his life out of order. The book talks a lot about war, and how horrible it can be.EnjoymentI guess I just didn't get it. This book is regarded as a great antiwar book, and I can see that it pokes fun at war, but it just didn't work for me. The humor in the book was there the whole time, but it just wasn't all that funny to me. There was also sometime in the book that drove me crazy as I kept reading it. It seemed like every other page (if not more often) Vonnegut would punctuate a scene by typing the sentence \\"So it goes.\\" We've all been in classes where you have to give presentations to the rest of the class. Many times, people would say \\"um\\" constantly throughout their presentations. I was originally an education major, and I was told to watch my speech to avoid saying \\"um\\" as it becomes distracting. \\"So it goes.\\" became distracting to me in this book. My paperback copy of the book was 215 pages long, I would be that Vonnegut wrote \\"So it goes.\\" at least 100 times in this book, probably more.Overall GradeI can't recommend this book to anyone, the humor didn't work for me all that well, and the book irritated me by the end of it. So it goes.2/10This and all of my reviews are available on my blog, check out my profile for the link to my blog."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This was a very good book. There was a lot of jumping in time. But then again that is the story"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This is fantastic! I first read this in a library when I was in college. Vonnegut is absolutely brilliant, and stands alone in his field as arguably the finest satirist in the world. I found myself laughing out loud on several occasions. This is great stuff. I read Vonnegut regularly and love it every time. Naturally, its a little depressing... but brilliant nonetheless."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"The book is first of all an easy read and one could easily finish this novel in less than week. The prose is uncomplicated but the timeline jumps back and forth through different perios in Billy Pilgrim's life. One widespread factor that remains throughout the book is that everyone dies. \\"So it goes.\\" The way in which I interpreted the book is that individuals are swept up in the entire global/political state of affairs and many of us unfortunately do not have a choice about where our lives will lead us. It's not that there isn't any free will, but rather we are all subject to the circumstances around us and we must deal with that. The only way we can exist is in the present - the past and future are out of our grasps.This limiting way of looking at life is explained to Billy by some affable aliens from the planet Tralfamadore. He swept up into their way of thinking when he was in Europe fighting the Germans in WWII. He witnesses the overall cruelty of humans toward other humans and is surprisingly indifferent toward the destruction because it is out of his hands. So it goes... Read the book with an open mind and enjoy yourself while you read it."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"When I finished the book on the Lexington Avenue Subway line while commuting home from work I nearly cried. This ranks as one of the best books I ever read (100 Years of Solitude, Razor's Edge, Power &amp; Glory). Vonnegut smacks the reader upside the head with the horrors of war while you're laughing and crying with Billy Pilgrim, one of the saddest characters in 20th Century literature."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Vonnegut's command of his narrative in this novel is commendable. The story seemlessly moves through time and setting almost too logically for the absurdist universe Vonnegut has created. Not one of Vonnegut's funniest books, but he does justice to the war he never thought he could put in writing. The philosophy of the Tralfamadorian aliens is very powerful and desirable to a tragic hero like Billy Pilgrim, as well as the reader and Vonnegut himself. However, I think even Vonnegut rejects the notion that free will does not exist, or he rather wishes to believe in a world where we are free to escape our misery by our own actions."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Kurt Vonnegut! What eles needs to be said. The man is one of the greatest writers of our time. Slaughterhouse-five is my favorit novel by him. I have read most of his other works and I still have to say that this is still the best. If your a Vonnegut fan and you haven't read this, GET ON IT! You'll love it."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Billy Pilgrim, the hero of the book, is just a great target for his entourage throughout time. At first, being one of the only prisoners of war without a decent coat, being shun for his loud sleeping, the death of others being blamed on him and such. However (here's where it gets unexpected), Billy had become unstuck in time, meaning that he can travel in the fourth dimension (time) just like a normal person could travel in the other three (up/down, left/right, backwards/forwards). This talent is typical of the good people of Tralfamadore, with whom Billy has contact with at one point. To these people, dying does not matter, because it is simply a moment like any other, one that can be lived over and over by the Tralfamadorian. So all the moments in life are predetermined, and it is up to everyone to go live the moments which he prefers. A good point, applicable to even those who cannot travel in the fourth dimension. This book contains some hilarious material. Billy, at one point, watches a WWII movie, but backwards (remember, Billy has become unstuck in time, meaning backwards movie-watching is accessible to him). The movie develops like this: Crashes American planes begin flying backwards, and magical German cylinders attract and suck in bullets from the planes and the corpses inside, healing them. Later, bombs are sent to the USA, where they are dismantled and the parts are never to be used again. Hitler (this isn't in the movie - Billy imagines this) then shrinks back to childhood, then babyhood, then doesn't exist. All ends in perfect harmony. Please, all, you must read this book."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I would give this book five stars, but then that would leave no room for me to rate books any higher, and I have liked books better than this one, so it is in the next teir. The title of my review was sarcastic, I'm just thinking about all those people who think this book fails as an anti-war book. I wonder how many of those people who said it was a failure went to war, I know Vonnegut did, and he said the book was a failure, and so to some it was. I thought it was funny. But what is truly sad is the people who hate this book because they think &quot;wow, war is bad--like we didn't know that&quot; and I think that's the most awful thing anybody can say since we need to be reminded of that every day of our psychopathic lives. Propaganda still exists and the probability that we will go to war for some stupid reason is always imminent, look at how we withdrew from Austria. We're morons, and if we can laugh at ourselves that's good, and this book helps us do it. It's the Dr. Strangelove of books. There will always be wars, but to say that it's stupid to argue against causing them is just ignorant. Anyone would rather prevent war, or at least delay it as much as possible, than fight in one. And to anyone who says this book teaches immorality, they have obviously missed the irony of this &quot;immorality.&quot; Although, the biggest irony is that people who don't like the book want Pilgrim to be stronger, they want a proud character who isn't a wimp, as though everyone should be proud and robust. Heroes don't always have to be heroic. Good book, unique philosophy, and a short read."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Put simply, the best book I have ever read.

It is sad, it is funny, it is poignant, and it is wonderfully enjoyable to read. It is truly an incredible book. Everyone should be made to read it at least once."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I think Slaughter-House-Five is a good book. I think it is a hard book to follow, because Vonnegut jumps from scene to scene in the book. I really don't like war books, but this book is pretty good. I think the whole thing about Billy getting aducted by the Tralfamadorians was not exactly what it sounds like. I think Billy chose the Tralfamadorians because he needed something to escape from the war, since the war was so terrible. I really didn't like the phrase &quot;So it goes&quot; but yet at the end of the book it makes sense, because in a way it kind of ends on scene and begins another. Its just another way to say thats how is it, or was. Well, If you like war books, or books that jump around from scene to scene, this book is for you, but if you don't, then I really don't recommend for you to read this book."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I don't care who you are, you absolutely need to read this book. It's justly considered a classic. The thing about it is that it isn't really a \\"humor book\\" like some of Vonnegut's other, justly famous works (Cat's Cradle, Breakfast of Champions, God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater). Parts of it are funny - I especially like the segments with the bitter Kilgore Trout, a sci-fi author reputed to be one of the worst ever - but humor isn't the focus of this book. Rather, it focuses on creativity and a solid message. Most if not all of Kurt's work is topical to some extent, but here his message comes to the fore.Vonnegut's view of time here is fascinating. Rather than present it as a straight line, as most other authors do, he explores its more abstract natures. To him, time is not a line, but a complex network of points that anybody at any time can travel arbitrarily amongst. This is prime creativity. Some of the most memorable segments of the book involve hapless hero Billy Pilgrim becoming \\"unstuck in time.\\" The first time he describes it, he takes a beautiful, \\"poetic-prose\\" approach. He floats freely through ideas, ideas that intentionally don't connect but are still beautifully written. Billy actually experiences both his birth and his death over the course of the book.But here is the REAL reason why you need to read Slaughterhouse-Five. It's very much an anti-war book, and the central message it communicates is that there are no heroes in war. The war Vonnegut focuses on is World War II, specifically the Allies' firebombing of Dredsen, Germany, an event that killed more people than Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It's clear that Vonnegut holds Nazi Germany in the utmost of contempt. But he also makes the claim that the Allies were not flawless, wonderful supermen. It's obvious that he believes in their ideals, but he also argues that they could be just as bad as their enemies. After all, countless German civilians were killed during the Dredsen firebomings, and I'm going to guess most of them had nothing to do with the Axis powers. In today's world, in today's wars, things aren't so black-and-white, and I think our President desperately needs a reminder of that. This conviction of his that America is the heroic cowboy, shooting down them no-good varmints with a gun in every holster, then mounting his horse and riding off into the sunset, is simply delusional. Don't get me wrong, I have as much if not more hatred for the terrorists our soon-to-be-ex-President (hopefully to be replaced by Barack Obama, but that's irrelevant) is so staunchly opposed to. They certainly are psychopaths, and the world would be a better place without them. But I can at least see where they're coming from. After all, hasn't America stolen their culture with its obsession with a globalist economy? There are no clear-cut heroes or villains in this war. Both sides have understandable motives, and while I admittedly side with the U.S. on this matter (though the Iraq War is at least as unnecessary as the Vietnam War, and has arguably done more damage to our country's reputation), the terrorists do have a point, I suppose. And that's why you need to read this book. Because war isn't as simple and clear-cut as certain presidents would like to believe it is. This is a fine example of preaching to the choir, since I'm a pacifist (except in extreme cases, like World War II), but I simply love this book on many, many levels. Vonnegut's masterpiece. If you wanted proof that he was an author of real literary merit and not just some weirdo - though if that's the case, you can't be my friend - this is a sure bet."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"To be honest, I have no idea why I picked that quote to be the title of this review. It just kind of grabbed me. Yet if you are even moderately familiar with SLAUGHTERHOUSE-FIVE, you probably know that any title would work just about as well as any other. SLAUGHTERHOUSE-FIVE, after all, does cover a lot of ground.The book follows Billy Pilgrim, a survivor of the bombing of Dresden, through his life as he ruminates about life, death, time travel and the knowledge he received from the alien race of Tralfamadorians. Billy has accepted the Tralfamadorian concept that all things exist at some point forever. Even death is not what it seems, as the dead person is still alive at some time and that time is perpetually occurring. Accordingly, there is no psychological stance to take on events other than acceptance. Things will happen as they always have happened and there is nothing to be done about it.Of course, everyone else thinks Billy is a lunatic. The story unfolds in an extremely nonlinear manner, with Billy hopping from one time to another, sometimes in midparagraph. Indeed, he has become \\"unstuck in time,\\" so that he lives the main episodes of his life in a random and illogical order. Vonnegut deserves the credit he received for pulling this off without making it confusing to the reader.Although light in tone, SLAUGHTERHOUSE-FIVE does address some deeper issues. Fate, free will, cruelty and the absurdity of human nature are all here. Comic relief is present throughout the book, with a dry fatalism providing an undercurrent to the events of Billy's life. Vonnegut is not everyone's cup of tea, but there is no denying the talent it takes to pack major issues into such a strange literary structure and still make it readable for the audience."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Wow. This was my first exposure to Kurt Vonnegut, and definitely won't be my last.Slaughterhouse-Five takes you on a mind-blowing journey through the disjointed life of Billy Pilgrim. The focus of his life is thus: He had a laughable military service in World War II, consisting mostly of being a POW while in shock. After the war, he lived in an insane asylum for awhile, where he became a fan of author Kilgore Trout, who is a central character throughout Billy's life. He married Valencia, the daughter of a rich optometrist, making him into a rich optometrist himself. He was the sole survivor of a plane crash full of optometrists. He was kidnapped on his daughter's wedding night by aliens from Tralfamadore, kept on display in a zoo there. During his time in the zoo, he was mated with a Hollywood starlet named Montana Wildhack, who never returned to earth, instead being kept there to raise the baby in the zoo. Billy ends his life by being assassinated by someone he was a POW with in Dresden, Germany, who made good on his promise. Billy gave speeches on time travel and alien abduction, and told the crowd about his death beforehand.What is so unusual about Billy Pilgrim, is that he \\"has come unstuck in time,\\" meaning that his awareness randomly jumps forwards and backwards to different points in his life, so that he not only experiences his whole life in bits and pieces and completely out of order, but he additionally has full access to the memories of everything that has happened in-between. Thus, he basically can remember every detail of his entire life before and as it is happening.The ingenious part of the story is that it is told in the same disjointed manner that Billy experiences it in, so that even though his memory tells us ahead of time what is going to happen, we still begin very much in the dark, and over time, as we experience more and more of the different parts of Billy's life, it begins to congeal into a coherent whole that makes sense to us in the same way that it does for Billy.I am consistently amazed as I read through the book and how much detail there is, and at how consistently and frequently Vonnegut's writing makes references back to those details. It truly brings everything together in your mind, and something that is humorous the first time becomes increasingly so each time a reference is made down the road that reminds you of it again. Truly, Vonnegut is a master of stylistic writing, and in a style that no one else could hope to emulate.This is one of the most memorable books I have ever read. A+, highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Kurt Vonnegut, who recently passed away, has been at the forefront of American literature for decades. SLAUGHTERHOUSE-FIVE, a remarkable antiwar book, cemented his reputation as one of the most unique voices of the twentieth century. The story of Billy Pilgrim - a man unstuck in time - the novel provides a fascinating take on the life of a man whose life bridged the firebombing of Dresden to his abduction by Tralfamadorians - aliens from a distant planet.A scant 275 pages, the book grabs you from the first page and takes you on a surreal journey through a life both conventional and bizarre. Of course, which is more bizarre - the insanity of war or abduction by aliens - is the whole point of the matter.Vonnegut is truly an American original. SLAUGHTERHOUSE-FIVE is an American classic. At once perplexing, illuminating, confusing, and thought-provoking - it is altogether absorbing. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughterhouse 5, or Slaughterhouse five, or The Children's Crusade, also called A Duty-Dance with Death, is described by the author Kurt Vonnegut's alter-ego, Billy Pilgrim as a \`fourth-generation German-American now living in easy circumstances on Cape Cod [and smoking too much], who, as an American Infantry Scout Hors De Combat, As a prisoner of war, witnessed the fire-bombing of Dresden, Germany, \\"The Florence of the Elbe,\\" a long time ago, and survived to tell the tell. This is a novel somewhat in the telegraphic schizophrenic manner of tales of the planet Tralfamadore, where the flying saucers come from. Peace.' So it goes.The book is an anti-war book, but tells us that it is about as useful being an anti-war book, as being an anti-typhoon book, meaning that some things will never change. Vonnegut tells us this by giving us the story of Billy Pilgrim, whose most important role in life was to witness the secret American British bombing of Dresden, where 135,000 died, and who spent most of his time as an American Prisoner of War, a survivor who can tell the youth of today what war is all about, by using his shellshock trauma induced time travel capabilities, given to him by the Tralfamadore aliens, to revisit the war, so that he can write a book about it, goes to see old war buddies, becoming unstuck in time, his life as a series of scenes in a non-linear fashion which ends up making linear sense, even though it did not at the time. So it goes.Slaughterhouse 5 is a very interesting and somewhat touching series of events that finally all come home to roost in the final pages, the loss of man is the gain of man, whether we like it or not, is not the point, Darwin told us that this is what we are designed to do, Billy Pilgrim becomes an optometrist in the process, marries a woman who suddenly has a series problem, while Bill ends up in a zoo on an alien planet to produce children with Montana Wildhack, a famous movie actress, while trying to write his Dresdon story, filled with death, a plane accident where he was the only survivor following his POW term, fact from fiction, he thinks the rescue party are nazis, it sets off the time travel again. So it goes.Vonnegut is not all down and war depressing however. His humour captured brilliantly by such antics as considering the money tree that grew hundred dollar bills, gems and bank bonds, feeding off the people who met the quicksand by its base, or a young Jesus who once built a cross with his father so the Romans could use it to do something to a protestor that they didn't like. When the wit is there it scores in aces. You have never read the likes of such clowning around before, although compared to Joseph Heller's Catch 22, this one is more personal, less satirical, more direct and exposes that horrible World War II bombing of Dresden. In 1941 Charles Portal, A British Air Staff officer, put forward the idea that entire cities and towns should be bombed. Air Marshall Arthur Harris agreed in February 1942. It was napalmed in 1945. Vonnegut made it very public in this 1969 novel. It was revealed by the historian David Irving in 1963 in his publication, \\"The Destruction of Dresdon\\". So it goes.Billy spends the final days of his life out across New York looking to tell a radio show his story, ends up finding a world war II sci-fi book author's book as window dressing, attempts to buy the book as a memory keepsake because he met the author and knew the war buddy who introduced him to the books, and is nearly arrested, and or committed, old age coupled with the dying man's last bastion of whatever his mind can make of it all, gives us much to ponder in death, by remembering our lives, Pilgrim travels in his memory and says that death is living ones memories over and over again... so best be good... and enjoy life. So it goes."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I could add to the volumes of literary criticism that fills the reviews of this book, but what's the point of that? Rather, I will recommend that you hear the book as a book on tape - the book's a stream of consciuosness, disjointed approach works very well on tape. The reader shifts from one scene to another as easily as Billy Pilgrim does. The version I heard was not the one available here. Mine was narrated by Jose Ferrer and he did a wonderful job. Too bad Ferrer has passed on. So it goes."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This is not an easy book to read, but it is a great book. What makes it tough to read is that Billy Pilgrim, the main character, \\"comes unstuck in time.\\" In other words, he is constantly moving from the present, to the past, to the future. . . You start reading a chapter and you're not sure if your in World War II or in the future, etc.The story is about a guy who is a soldier in World War II and is taken prisoner. He's sent to Dresden and survives the horrible bombing of that city. After he comes back home, his life is normal, until he becomes unstuck in time. He's constantly going back to his war experiences or into the future on another planet.Vonegut has an amazing imagination, a wonderful sense of humor and a gift for telling stories that keep us interested. I've read most of his books and enjoyed everything I've read by him, but this is still one of his best books ever.If you enjoy this, try his outstanding collection of short stories, \\"Welcome to the Monkey House.\\""},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughter House Five is one of the most unique novels I've ever read. I am only 17 and my knowledge of books grows every year- and I think my mind expanded a little bit after reading the dark humor of Vonnegut. His way of writing is so captivating I really couldn't put the book down. The novel is extremely metatexual, in that, Vonnegut actually wrote himself into the novel, but he conveys his ideas through a really, almost robotic character Billy Pilgrim.Billy Pilgrim (play on the name pilgrim=pioneer maybe?) is a really an emotionless character, the reader never becomes aware of his likes and dislikes only that he becomes unstuck in time. This concept of time and how relevant it is in every aspect of life is the driving force of the novel. Many would say this book is an anti-war novel, and it is to an extent.I think Billy's mind split while in the war- this shows how war can destroy one's sense of reality. The book also opens with an introduction about Vonnegut's own journey into writing the novel and how he decided to make it known that children fought wars not men. I really enjoyed one quote about how stopping war is like stopping glaciers- it isn't gonna happen. This book is an anti-war novel but it is so much more.Slaughter House Five really takes the notion of time and plays with it. What if time is just a man-made schedual to exist in our daily lives. What if time is just moments- like every person is just one long string of moments. I think one the books strongest messages is for one to focus on the good moments of life and not the bad...like war for instance. Either way this novel is great read and an easy read- which I am all for considering my reading load at a private college prep school is not what I consider light work. Just enjoy the thoughts the novel evokes and I promise a fun read!"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"At times, people may focus too strongly on this book being Anti-War. As I see it and taken with regard to other Vonnegut books - as well as anti-war, this book uses the far-fetched aliens and becoming \\"unstuck\\" in time for perspective, allegory and a position to critize society. The themes behind the book are deeper than just anti-war, but extend to the themes that dominate mankind. Do we shape our futures and our lives or are they shaped for us? Can we prevent the atrocities we place on one another (like Dresden) or is it inevitable? As when a Tralfamadorian (alien) tells Billy that, \\"I've visited thirty one inhabited planets in the Universe... and only on Earth is there any talk of free will.\\"This book explorers more than just the pain of a war surviror and the tragedy of those that didn't survive. It is comment on life (fatalism, free will, cosmic purpose or the big empty?), people (and our tendencies toward self-interest and self-destruction) and thereby god and the universe. Sometimes we miss the forest for the trees... but don't miss reading Vonnegut. If not this book, then Cat's Cradle or Sirens of Titan - all are exceptional and worth your time and money."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This book though one of the less artistic from Vonnegut, it however, is one of the most poignant. The great adventure of a WWII veteran seeking both a story to tell in his book and a rationale for all the people who died there. \\"So it goes.\\" Vonnegut takes us in the psyche of many a soldier who served in that fateful war. His characters are so human and realistic that it is not hard to get involved with the story. The author, since he found wars to be utterly and shamelessly stupid and pointless, found a rationale and consolation in an explanation given to one of the character in a planet millions of light-years away. Among other things, Vonnegut shows us how time travel is already possible and we all can achieve it by just thinking about it.This books is a great satire and quite funny at times. What forbids it from being funnier is the fact that the subject matter is indeed very serious and depressing. A must for modern meta-fiction readers."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This is the first Vonnegut book I read and I am quite eager to pick up another one. The book focuses on the life of Billy Pilgrim, a simple man from the US midwest who is a soldier in WWII. The defining moment in his life is his presence , as a prisioner of war, in Dresden during the allied firebombing that killed over 100,000 people.The novel has a matter-of-fact attitude towards terrible events, in a sense subscribing to the notion of fate being inevitable. In a couple of different places it urges one to act on the things one can change, but then seems to say nothing can be changed. Vonnegut blends in science fiction to get this point across, as Billy Pilgrim is abducted by aliens who can travel through time and see everything, but can change nothing. What they do is choose to see only the good things in life.There is also a deep comedic sense in it, though one is prevented from laughing by the sheer horror of the situations. It is quite a different depiction of life, fate and war, a very innovative way of seeing the world. This is definitely an interesting book, one that is clearly written from an experienced point of view (Vonnegut was himself in Dresden during the firebombing). I highly recommend it, especially since it very short, one that could be read in a two to three hour flight."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Prayer of SerenitySlaughter House Five, by Kurt Vonnegut, deserves a reputation of being a great piece of American literature. The book follows a man, Billy Pilgrim through his life. Billy believes tralfamadorians have abducted him. The reader believes that it's through these aliens that he learns to time travel. In the book, Pilgrim explores time to all the various portions of his life, many times returning to World War II where he was captured and held in slaughterhouse five in Dresden, Germany.One of the major themes of the book is fate. The prayer of serenity appears twice in the book stating that we need to change the things we can and be wise enough to know which things we can't change. Also the Tralfamadorians speak of fate. They say they know how the universe is going to end, but they do nothing to stop it. Vonnegut seems to say that war is one of those things we can't avoid, but we need to change the things we can about it, like the bombing of Dresden.Overall, the book's message is clear, and Vonnegut delivers his message in a very accessible way. The reader gains knowledge on fate and what they can do to apply it in everyday life. The story of Billy Pilgrim is enjoyable to read, and contains many new insights."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughterhouse 5, or Slaughterhouse five, or The Children's Crusade, also called A Duty-Dance with Death, is described by the author Kurt Vonnegut's alter-ego, Billy Pilgrim as a \`fourth-generation German-American now living in easy circumstances on Cape Cod [and smoking too much], who, as an American Infantry Scout Hors De Combat, As a prisoner of war, witnessed the fire-bombing of Dresden, Germany, \\"The Florence of the Elbe,\\" a long time ago, and survived to tell the tell.

I was too young, and the book was mature and too sad. I didn't get it. However, experiencing the book as a middle-aged adult, I get it now. Oh, boy, do I get it. It is a rich, rich feast of humanity, humility and soul-retrival. The tenderness with which Vonnegut tells the picaresque tale of Billy Pilgram alleviates the more tragic elements and gives us a melancholy story of a man who just wants to live his life. Billy Pilgram transcends his life to an almost Buddha-like understanding of suffering, happiness and death. I listened to the audiotape recently, read by Ethan Hawke. This has to be one of the best audiobooks I have ever listened to. Ethan Hawkes' spare tone, and lowkey voice are a perfect marriage of prose and interpreter. He brings out flavors and colors that sent me flying back to re-read the book when I finished. I am richer for the trip. Listen or re-read Slaughterhouse Five and prepare to be profoundly moved by a master."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"VonnegutBilly Pilgrim is a rather unremarkable guy. A gawkish, unbrilliant optometrist that marries an overweight, unremarkable woman.There are two events in his life that set him apart, however. In his 20's, he was among a handful of people who survived the firebombing of Dresden, in world war II; and he was the sole survivor of a plane crash when he was in later middle age.Seeing so much death around him, Billy starts to lose his mind. After the plane crash, he thinks that space aliens have abducted him, and take him to their planet to study. His \\"aliens\\" have a different perception of time. They are in the \\"fourth dimension\\", which means that they not only see an object in space, but they also \\"see\\" it in time. They know the beginning and the end of all things, they see it in the same way we would see the color of someone's eyes. From their perspective, there is no anguish in death, war, tragedy, destruction. These things were, and are, and always will be. They do not hold the illusion that we can act to change things.So, the book begins by saying that Billy has become \\"unstuck in time\\". His mental condition (shown in the storytelling) is such that he thinks that he is randomly transported from one point of his predetermined life to the next, with no ability to control it. He has been so changed since being with the aliens, that he \\"knows\\" the hour and the means of his death. Every moment in his life has been given back to him, without the gnawing sense of the unknown, and the anxiety that not knowing brings with it. He no longer feels anguish over the thing not done, or the fear of what might happen. All of these things are \\"written\\" already. He becomes a mere traveller in his own skin. In losing hope, he has also lost fear.Vonnegut's gift as a writer - gravity. He writes in such a way that, no matter how foreign his subject might be, makes it sound not only believable, but also familiar. For example, when the main character is being taken to the prison camp in a train, the author describes the process of collecting prisoners, of the prisoners making room for themselves, standing, sleeping, and so on. He makes the scene so clear, that I often felt that I had some personal understanding of the character's situation, as if I had been in that situation before! Writing in such a clear way makes his characters responses more believable."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughterhouse Five, by Kurt Vonnegut, does not fall under the category of books I would usually read, but it is different from other books in this genre. It is ironic, captivating, and interesting. Most of all, it is passionate about it's anti-war message and can make even the most pro-war human being sympathize and indulge in deeper thoughts about the individuals and their lives that are affected by war. I definitely recommend this book because of it's light-hearted style used to deliver a serious message in a novel that everyone can find appealing."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five is a fantastic, mind grabbing story about life, war, and death. Vonnegut writes with simple words that carry powerful ideas in this classic anti-war novel. In the book, Vonnegut's protagonist, Billy Pilgrim essentially becomes \\"unstuck\\" in time. Throughout the novel, Billy travels back and forth through time describing his service for the American military during WWII, his witnessing of the infamous bombing of Dresden, and his later life in the 50's and 60's. This novel would be easy for anyone to enjoy, but I would recommend it only to teenage or adult readers strictly because the book's jumpy plot does require the reader to put together ideas for themselves. Despite the randomness of the plot, Vonnegut's use of incredible imagery makes the story easier to follow. Over all, this book is definitely worth reading!"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This must be my all time favorite book. (among many)The story is disjointed, but not jarringly so. Vonnegut starts with the story of why the book is subtitled \\"The Children's Crusade\\", and segways seamlessly into a brief lesson of one of WW II's most shocking and little known occurances.You feel like you are there, a fly on the wall, throughout the many stages of Mr. Billy Pilgrim's (the protagonist's) life.Vonnegut writes with an amazing economy of words, and lesser authors would do in 500 pages what Vonnegut accoplishes in little over 100 pages.I could not put the book down, and re-read my copy so often, it is falling apart.God bless you, Mr. Vonnegut."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughterhouse Five is a novel that, like many others, I have heard of for years, and always thought I would get to it 'someday'....someday finally arrived.Described to me by a co-worker as a quasi-science fiction novel, quasi-war novel...I was almost turned off enough to not read it, as those are my two least favorite genres of literature.But from open to close, Slaughterhouse is compulsively readable.Centering on the life of one Billy Pilgrim, the story floats back and forth through episodes of his life as he has become, per his own description, 'unstuck in time'. Weaving between events from his childhood; time spent in the Vietnam war; his marriage; his career; etc.; Billy provides a glimpse into the horrors of war, and the life-long effect they can have on a person.The strengths of this novel are that the language is easy to follow, the tale is never preachy in its opposition to war, and the humor of following Billy through his time-travels, and the disbelief of others.At the end, one is left to question the validity of Billy's travels, as evidence is presented to support what could be deemed simply an 'escape' into past events of his life to deal with the effects of the war....juxtapositioned with present events, that Billy, lost in his past, describes as the 'future'...Whatever the 'truth' of the story is, Slaughterhouse Five is entertaining, easily read, and highly enjoyable.....Hopefully others who plan to read it 'someday' will get there eventually. It's worth the wait."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"There are few books that I have read in my lifetime that left such big imprint on me. One of the most imaginative, if not original books that I have ever read that I always go back reading to is Kurt Vonnegut Jr.'s &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot;. A friend and former co-worker of mine at a local grocery store I had worked at one summer gave me a copy of this vivid story. This was my first (and only) exposure to Kurt Vonnegut Jr.'s writing. The second I started reading the book, I was immediately hooked.The premise of the book centers around Billy Pilgrim. One minute he is reliving his days as a solider and currently serving his country in Dresden. Eventually he is captured by the enemy and ends up in the cellar in a slaughterhouse. Then the following scenario has Billy being kidnapped by aliens from the planet Tralfamadore where he would be put on exhibit like an animal at the zoo along with a popular adult entertainment celebrity Montana Wildhack. If that wasn't confusing enough, Billy manages to do some time traveling between earth and Tralfamadore. Somehow Kurt manages to keep the entire story flow cohesively together. I was wildly entertained and still am whenever I feel like reading this book. There was a good enough humor from the sub-plot as an exhibit for the Tralfamadore aliens entwined with the poignancy of Billy's days as a solider of war and his role as father and husband. Thirty five years later after it was published, &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; still remains relevant to society as it did back in 1969. It is truly an immortal classic for me."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Billy Pilgrim has to be the weakest hero of any novel ever written and yet he might be the most beautiful. Through his ignorance and innocence we see how stupid war is. To bad Vonnegut did not write this novel earlier, who knows maybe some of our esteemed leaders of the early 60s would have got a hold of it and read it and maybe they would not have instituted a draft and fought a war in Southeast Asia. That is how powerful a novel this is."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This book made it onto the Library Boards top 100 English language novels of the 20th century.

By simply reading the reviews on SH5 not only can I accurately gauge whether one likes or dislikes V, but I can guess age and education. Example, if you found this novel hard or disjointed you probably haven't had the challenge of English 101 yet. If you find the anti-war message trite, you're probably born after Vietnam. Why? If WWII was a great and just war (Saving Private Ryan) and displayed the worst of man's inhumanity (Dresden, Hiroshima, the Holocaust...), what does this say about a meat grinder like Vietnam (escalating when the book was published). If you don't like it because it was too simple then you are probably a college graduate and / or more accustomed to Mailer or some other hokum artist. I don't know many writers who in the late '60s or early '70s who wouldn't have sacrificed a limb to have written this book. P.S.--If you've haven't had the pleasure of Vonnegut in person then please see him before he coughs up his black lungs."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I'm a bit bothered that everyone's interpretation of this book is &quot;An anti-war statement.&quot; Were it nothing but that, I would give it 2 stars at most for covering a trite theme (everyone knows war is bad) in an annoying style.But this book captures the horror of *living*, period-- the horror of going on a roller-coaster through whatever life hands you, with no rewind or ability to look at everything holistically. The sanity of the Tralfamadorians and the contentedness of Billy illustrate, by contrast, the confused, frustrating, short lives of normal people-- and the fact that they spend so much of their precious time, which can never be reclaimed, doing things that just aren't worth it, such as fighting for their countries.One of the things I like best about Vonnegut's early work is that it is not persuasive or didactic, but merely analytical; it exposes truths about life for better or for worse, and lets the reader takes away what s/he takes away. In amazingly few pages, this book provides a terrifying yet mobilizing picture of the fact that we will never get back those lost seconds-- and while you may accept this idea intellectually, Slaughterhouse-Five will help you accept it emotionally."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This book explores a nonlinear view of space/time. The main character Billy Pilgrim has become \\"unstuck\\" in time and can move from one moment in his life to another totally different moment from his past or future at will. This ability was given to him be the apppaently benign aliens know as the Tralfamadoreans who can see in the 4th dimension. The way time is presented here is much like the holistic asian view of time where everything in the past/present/future mutually arises. Nothing is created or destroyed rather everything coexists in a 4 dimensional laticework. The idea of death is meaningless when one has this perspective and the aliens refer to death perfunctorily stating simply \\"so it goes\\" when hearing someone has died. George Harrison once said,\\"You can learn from the past but you can't ever relive it. And you can hope for the future but you can't count on it being there.\\" So it is perhaps best to live in the present in the immediacy of the moment with no regrets for the past and no anxieties for the future. Unfortunately for Billy Pilgrim his post-traumatic stress disorder prevents him from travelling to the more pleasent times in his life and instead causes him to jump uncontrollably through time. The book is also about the fire bombing of Dresden by the RAF and in the closing days of WW II. Vonegut balances his outrage and cynicism with a strong appreciate for the beauty and fragility of life. Buddhism teaches that nothing is created, nothing is destroyed. Nothing is born and nothing dies. So the people of Dresden, and Hiroshima and Nagasaki perhaps did not die but moved on to so other aspect of being or someother time. And so it goes."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"this is one of my favorite books of all time. my paltry words can do nothing for it. if you haven't already read it, i assume you're probably pretty new to the reading game. i simply encourage you to get a copy. to take that copy. and read it."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Vonnegut's SH5 deserves its place in the pantheon of great 20th century literature. It is one of the most moral books ever written. Easily at the top of his canon and likely, the only one of his works that will stand the test of time (although much of his work is great and relevant).Most people are familiar with the central character, Billy Pilgrim, and how he time travels back and forth, with the help of aliens, between his experiences in WWII (largely, the author's) and his comfortable suburban life in the 1960's. But, don't let this sci-fi device fool you into thinking the story is light hearted: its not. Vonnegut is a very eclectic writer who often uses various tricks and slights-of-hand to make a point, or sometimes, to structure an entire work. In this book, you can view Billy's time travel and his interactions with the aliens as metaphors for trauma. The parallels between some of those experiences and that of soldiers suffering 'shell shock' are very close.He also finds space to make some other points and philosophical musings. One that I found worthwhile was the aliens' ability to view life in its totality without being hindered by linear time. So, for example, if they view a dead man, they think that he's only in a bad way at that point in time, but in other points of time (which all co-exist simultaneously in their quantum perception), he's still doing fine. Some critics have used these musings to say that the novel lacks a moral vision. Or that Vonnegut is not taking grave things, like dying, seriously. I disagree. I think these other perspectives show the author struggling with ways to make sense of a chaotic world. Much of which, he experienced first hand (as did Heller and JD Salinger, curiously).With the current hostilities which abound in the world, this book couldn't be more timely. It remains the best cautionary tale about war (with all due respect to \\"All Quiet on the Western Front\\", \\"Catch 22\\" and \\"Red Badge of Courage\\") and a great reminder of the horror and futility of unnecessary war acts.As a resident of the world's top military power, I'd say this book should be mandatory reading everywhere!"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"In Kurt Vonnegut's excellent novel, Slaughterhouse-Five, Vonnegut skillfully applies rhetorical strategies such as his unique use of science fiction, reiterated phrases, and a timely use of flashback to convey his repressed but resentful view of war in general and especially his personal experience with the Dresden firebombing. In a separate approach Vonnegut uses the all-seeing Aliens from Tralfamadore to express his view that the best way to live life is by focusing on the positive memories.Vonnegut begins his novel with a personal memoir explaining the beginnings of his \\"great\\" war novel. In a conversation with Mary O'Hare, to whom the book is dedicated, Vonnegut assures her that his war book will not glorify war and that, in fact, he will name the book \\"The Children's Crusade\\" to show that war is not fought by grown men but by a younger generation, the children. The focus for the novel is set.In this memoir Vonnegut chooses to introduce the phrase \\"so it goes\\" and the ice motif that will be used throughout the novel. The ice motif begins when Harrison Starr says, \\"Why don't you write an anti-glacier book instead?\\" (3) He meant that stopping war is as easy as stopping a glacier. Similar to the meaning of the glacier the words \\"blue and ivory\\" are used throughout to describe dead soldiers and the protagonist of the story, Billy Pilgrim \\"There was so much to see--dragon's teeth, killing machines, corpses with bare feet that were blue and ivory. So it goes.\\"(65) \\"He looked down at his bare feet. They were ivory and blue.\\" (72) This motif about ice is used throughout the book to represent death and the frailty of man. \\"So it goes\\" is the phrase that is used more that anything else in the novel. The actual meaning of the word is introduced as a Tralfamadorian philosophy. Death is inevitable and nothing can be done to prevent it. The best way to cope with it is not to focus on it. Instead of focusing on death focus on life and the enjoyable memories that that come with it. The Tralfamadorian philosophy is also Vonnegut's philosophy and is the philosophy that I believe allowed him to get through the Dresden tragedy.Science fiction and flashback played great parts in this novel and also served the same purpose. They allow Vonnegut to keep a safe mental distance from the painful Dresden experience. As the first chapter states, Billy Pilgrim has become unstuck in time. Billy's life is basically chopped up and rearranged to fit with his time travel experiences. This distortion of time serves two purposes. First, it shows the reader how war is. War is confusing and disorienting. It can change a man just as it changed Billy Pilgrim. Second, it allows Vonnegut to explain the confusion of war without directly explaining war. The war experience is still very painful to him. Vonnegut uses a flashback instead of Billy's usual time travel to explain the Dresden bombing. \\"He did not travel in time to the experience. He remembered it shimmeringly...\\" (177) Like Vonnegut, Billy cannot revisit that experience though he has no problem visiting his own death. Also, the use of the Tralfamadorians could be interpreted as a way to distance him from the reality of war. Through the use of the slightly humorous aliens Vonnegut is able to express his philosophies about death.This slightly confusing book is full of rich and deep messages for the thoughtful, but is also simple and short enough for the average reader. The disconnected passages keep the reader's attention while at the same time making the reader think and reflect on what has already been said."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This book is a fantastic read. It is about a man who fights in world war II, thru one of the most dangerous bombings of the war. The fire bombing of Dresden. The book describes the life of Billy Pilgrim a youth who grows up in a small town and becomes a Optometrist. The book goes thou his entire life going into detail on his time as a P.O.W. in WWII. Before the story Kurt speaks very well on his anti war thoughts. My favorite character in this book is Billy pilgrim,although Billy is very girl like and fragile he toughs it out and survives some of the hardest periods of WWII. My favorite part of this story is when Billy speaks about he was unstuck in time, it gives him the ability to spontaneously travel to other times in his life. He never remembers where he has just been. But he knows he has the ability to travel thru time. I would recomend this book to any one who enjoys historical fiction or science fiction books. If you have never read a book by this author before, i suggest you do to adjust to his writing style. Overall i thought this was a fantastic book and it deserves more recognition."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I really liked this book. It makes you wonder how wonderful or pointless life would be. It took a while to get the flow of the book but, when you do, it is very hard to put the book down. It is a very quick read but it is very deep. It is about Billy Pilgrim and how he gets &quot;unstuck in time.&quot; I don't think I would like to witness my death like Billy did, so it goes."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"It's hard to accurately convey the plot of \\"Slaughter House-Five\\" without taking several pages to explain the layers and depth and abstraction with which Kurt Vonnegut handles the gruesome nature. The best I can do is offer enough to hook potential readers in order to encourage them to take the journey themselves.Vonnegut tells the story of the non-hero, the less than average soldier who bumbled through World War II surviving purely on good luck and the good will of others. Billy Pilgrim is a Chaplain's Assistant that really has no interest in the war, in life, or anything for that matter. He's blessed with some extraordinary ability to experience as a non-linear concept... an ability which he maintains no control of. His life becomes a series of incongruent instances later relayed by two war veterans aptly named \\"The Children's Crusade\\". Billy becomes an unsuspecting illustration of the uncertainties of war.So admittedly, the plot sounds confusing in a summary, but Vonnegut delivers a power and almost psychedelic tale which vividly reflects on both the humanity and inanity of human warfare. The story is woven together quite well the chaos of both war and Billy's inability to hold himself within time. Vonnegut writes masterfully delivering powerful questions for the reader and portraying the story of the non-hero."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"It's hard to say much about something one understands so little. Such is the case for me with Slaughterhouse-Five, a relatively short, oft confusing anti-war story inspired by Vonnegut's experiences during WWII, specifically, US and Britain's bombing of Dresden in February of 1945. Vonnegut's sources (p 188) place the death toll at 135,000, while more recent data (this from Wikipedia which cites a 2008 study) set it nearer to 25,000, a still staggering sum. The author begins Chapter One with, \\"All this happened, more or less. The war parts, anyway, are pretty much true,\\" and explains how he came to write the story and choose The Children's Crusade as its subtitle. \\"So it goes.\\"In spite of the (five!) pages of notes I took to help keep track of what was going on, I was in an almost constant state of confusion while reading it. Only afterwards, by reading through my notes and several other sources, was I able to make sense of things. It follows a completely unprepared, militarily clueless, time-traveling chaplain's assistant named Billy Pilgrim before, during, and after WWII. He interacts with fellow soldiers (I found the war parts the most interesting), an alien race called the Tralfamadorians, and his wife and children. Pilgrim's talk of the alien race is a primary cause for concern for nonbelievers. \\"And so on.\\"In spite of the many time traveling tangents and strange happenings, I liked the story for several reasons: I now understand the book's title, it's a challenging read; it depicts war, as expected, in all its horribleness; and it's like no other war story I've read before. Slaughterhouse-Five is a uniquely good look at the badness war. Also good: The Things They Carried by Timothy O'Brien, Operation Homecoming: Iran, Afghanistan, and the Home Front, in the Words of U.S. Troops and Their Families edited by Andrew Carroll, and Zinky Boys by Svetlana Alexievich."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Typical Vonnegut, meaning very post-modern and a bit jumpy, but by far the most serious of his that I've read. Even though this is fiction, I learned a lot about WWII and especially the US bombing of Dresden."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"My senior year of High school my english teacher was fresh out of college and brought in a great deal of \\" new blood\\" to the lit dept. This book was enjoyed by myself and my classmates! Highly recamended for academic or pleasure reading."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"The book slaughter house five is a excelent book, that has a very in depth plot. It starts out in the point of view of the author, describing how he wrote the book. It then moves into a character who thinks he can move through time. It is almost to fictional to believe but the narator inserts himself into the story to make ist seem real. It allows the reader to decide if it is true story or fictional story. For example, one person might see it as a the character trying to escape reality while someone else might see it as the main character really depressed and drugged out person. Personally, the way I see the character is as a war verteran with PTSD. Even so, every persons opion will differ.To enjoy this book there are a few key points one should know.1. The first chapter is written by the author and therefore not in the same point of view as the rest of the book.2. The bombingof Dreesden was a very large part of the main characters wartime experience.3. It has some very dark humor, and therefore the whole book should not be taken seriously, rather it is for the reader to decide what is serious and what is a joke."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"A perfect novel? No. Nothing's perfect. A brilliant novel? Yes. One of my favorites. Why? Because Vonnegut had the ability to create humor amidst tragedy. And the storytelling is told in an unpretentious manner. Gems scattered throughout this meandering tale but left exposed for others to discover. This is a literary gift that only an accomplished calculated writer can deliver. Vonnegut was no dummy. In this novel he created a literary device that was - and still is - ingenious. Simply put, it is an anti-war novel in which the mind of a prisoner-of-war veteran becomes, as Vonnegut says, \\"unstuck in time\\" - with no control over where he will be next. Maybe not everyone can relate, but I certainly can. It influenced me to become a novelist too."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I just finished this book today. I worked at Borders Bookstore and this book was often on the list of many students. I was always put off by this and scratched it off my list to read (huge mistake on my part) I no longer work at Borders and recently I picked up this book. I cannot begin to tell you what a fan I am of Kurt Vonnegut. It was a pure pleasure to read this book and the writing was something that took me away. There are some great reviews on this book-so I will not attempt to write my own. I can say, Vonnegut is a genius and all his books have a way of writing that bring a reader back to his books."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This was one of the most innovative books I read in American literature. It deals with a subject as touchy as the killing of 100,000 people with graceful sarcasm. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I had always wanted to read this book, but never got around to it. I knew it was a classic book, but not exactly what it was about. My boyfriend told me a little and encouraged me to read it. So, I came to Amazon and ordered it, along with a few others. When it arrived, I sat down to read it and finished in a day or so.The book is about the bombing of Dresden, Germany during WWII. It's not about it in the typical sense that a book is about something: you won't find graphic descriptions of the bombing, you won't read about detailed feelings of those who were there or anything like that. It's more of a...story based AROUND the bombing. You have to read it in order to get what I mean.I do find it to be a great book. It made me think, and actually caused me to do a little research into the bombing itself and form an opinion.I don't necessarily recommend this book to everyone. I don't think children should read it, or would even really understand it. Even among adults, there are those that just won't enjoy it because it's not their style. It's a matter of personal preference, I think."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Few books about World War 2 will have their main character doing any sort of time-traveling, and fewer still will involve aliens, and almost none of worth will use both, but Slaughterhouse 5 does it well. Part comedy, part commentary; SH-5 takes the horrific bombing of Dresden, Germany during WW2 and juxtaposes it with a bit of comedic science fiction.Billy Pilgrim becomes unstuck in time after his abduction by some aliens. The narrative follows him as he jumps into moments of his life and centers around the bombing of Dresden where he was a prisoner. The author, Konnegut, was a real life prisoner during the bombing and many of the little details are based on his experiences from the war.This is a wonderful book that will keep you reading to the end. It will make you laugh and, most importantly, think.Well, this is the end of my review, I hope you enjoy the book.So it goes."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"For years I have wanted to read this book, and I finally got around to it. Vonnegut is unique in style and content."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Darkly humourous commentary on war and mass killing from one of the best American writer's of the 20th century.

My favorite thing about his literary technique is that he penned stories that are enjoyable, yet have layer upon layer of meaning that, depending upon your mood, you can explore as you enjoy the book.In my opinion,Slaughterhouse-Five: A Novelwas his finest work. I only wish the book was longer as there is so much more he could have done with the story."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I missed this in the 60's...so now I'm reading everything Vonnegut has written.

Billy Pilgrim could be anyone's neighbor...but with a deep and dark past. Thanks"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"No many words are needed to describe how much I enjoyed this book. Vonnegut's writing style is literary genius and the reoccurring themes, examples of human nature and deja vu will leave you lost for words in a bliss of awe. I only wished that there was such a thing as a 6 star rating. So it goes."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"a very original and thought provoking book about the human condition in general and humans in war time in particular. I found it lacking in emotion, but it's an amazing read."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This is the first Vonnegut novel I've read so I didn't know what to expect. Strange book but I'll say this--I read it in one sitting because it's so odd, it kept me curious to see what the author would do next. My main reading diet is thrillers and nonfiction--not much literary fiction. Slaughterhouse Five is an odd combo of literary fiction and sci-fi.Overall: fascinating; intriguing; keeps you thinking for a while after reading. On the other hand, this book has a consciously inflated sense of self-importance and a vague atmosphere of misogyny. It's billed as a compelling anti-war novel. Well, it is anti-war, I suppose, but the protagonist is so pathetic that his failure as a soldier seems to reflect his failure in life as a whole. If you want an anti-war novel, tryAll Quiet on the Western Front."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughterhouse-Five sets out to protest war without glorifying it, and it succeeds in accomplishing that task. Vonnegut can find no answer for mankind's decisions to commit gross violence against its own kind, except in the meaningless song of a bird: \\"Poo-tee-weet?\\" He purposely does not develop his characters with any depth, a decision that works because it signifies the toll that war takes on the individual. The novel's hero, Billy Pilgrim, wanders through life with little concern or feeling for anything. It doesn't seem to bother him that he slips through time, to the past, the present, and the future. Then again, I wonder if it's possible to read the time travel element on a less literal level. As I was reading it, I couldn't help but wonder whether the alien species called the Tralfamadorians were a part of Billy's damaged postwar mind, a symptom of post-traumatic stress disorder.Vonnegut makes lots of use of irony, satire, and humor, and in surprising ways. The famous line from the novel, one he uses in relation to death, \\"So it goes,\\" seems to comment on society's desensitized attitudes towards death. The phrase calmly and easily tosses the impact of death aside, yet sometimes the reader can't help but feel its effects immensely, particularly in the way the phrase actually draws more attention to death. Vonnegut has a gift for drawing the reader's attention to the sadness of human fate by making us laugh. One of the funniest scenes of the book takes place at a POW camp, where English POWs welcome the exhausted Americans by putting on a play of Cinderella. At one point Billy laughs and can't stop laughing until his laughter turns into shrieks and he has to be carried into the hospital. I don't think I laughed harder in the novel than at this point, but I felt guilty for laughing. Billy's uncontrollable laughter was a product of the horrible things he experienced in the war up to that point.There seem to be lots of hints scattered about that Tralfamadore is a product of Billy's imagination. After his first encounter with Montana Wildhack, for example, he wakes up in his home in Ilium to realize he's just had a wet dream about her. That his perhaps imaginary experience on Tralfamadore serves as a coping mechanism for his experiences in the war can be found in parallel descriptions about him undressing in Dresden and on the flying saucer. Kilgore Trout, Billy's favorite author, is probably the biggest piece of evidence to show that Billy has only imagined his encounter with the Tralfamadorians. For one, many of the ideas we learn from Trout's books are very similar to details we learn about the Tralfamadorians, such as the fact they can perceive sexes in the fourth dimension. But Trout is also a big clue about the reliability of the narrator.We can assume the narrator is the author himself, since Vonnegut makes many mentions of himself in the first person. Some of what he says is factual. Dresden was bombed, and Vonnegut was there when it was bombed. However, Kilgore Trout is a fictional person, though he's not treated as such. This mixture of fact and fiction, both told as though they were one and the same, clues the reader in that we can't necessarily take the narrator at his word. Thus, though he describes Tralfamadore as though it were real, that doesn't mean it is. It could very easily be a product of Billy's post-traumatic stress disorder, a coping mechanism. The idea that Billy can see all times of his life is never fully established either. We don't really know when the present time is, so it's difficult to gauge whether we truly do see into Billy's future. There is a scene where Billy describes how he dies, but this scene is tricky. It's not written as something that has or is happening, as the rest of the scenes are, and the narrator states it not as fact, but as something Billy has said. The question is, can we take Billy at his word? I don't think so."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"On the service/product: This worked out great, no spelling errors or any such mishaps. The product was delivered to my kindle shortly after me ordering it and it worked out beautifully.On the story: This book was marvelous. It was comparable to Hitchhiker's Guide in style, but it had a much more mature message. Intended for mature, intelligent, and active readers, as its got some very confusing structural bits that can be tricky to understand if you aren't very savvy with such things. It might help to read it with a friend or two. I had a teacher and classmates that helped me understand some parts. It was a very sad book about Billy Pilgrim's adventures through time in the WWII bombing of Dresden and his intermittent adventures to Tralfamadore.

Instead it is a creative tale juxtaposing the war experiences of the main character, Billy Pilgrim, with other events in his life, most notably his kidnapping by space aliens. Pilgrim is weak character who drifts though life, moving back and forth in time and space, sometimes on Earth, sometimes on an alien planet. Time didn't flow in one direction for Billy Pilgrim. As the book progresses, Pilgrim sometimes lives in his future, at others goes back to his past.I thought Slaughterhouse 5 was an engrossing read and enjoyed it quite a bit. This is not the kind of book I would normally pick up, and I'm glad I didn't read it in high school, because I would have hated it then.

Highly recommend."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Kurt Vonnegut is back, and he couldn't have done better. Slaughterhouse-Five is possibly his most accomplished book, and may even be considered the best book of its time. This book has soared Vonnegut to the very top of the author list for many. It surpasses his former highest accomplishes and stands alone in a world of classic reads. The reader is sped down winding roads of space, time, and memory. A fast paced book fit for any age, Slaughterhouse-Five is entertaining, inspiring, and smart. Set in the main character, Billy Pilgrim's memory, Vonnegut bring us twisting through World War II, to present day, to planets as far away as Tramalfadore, where Billy had been abducted, and back again. We are pulled with Billy through his tribulations as he makes friends, and also as he makes a few enemies. The imagination weaved so richly and tastefully through the entire novel makes the reader at a constant hunger for more. Vonnegut's signature humor is nothing less than emanating from page 1 to the very end. Slaughterhouse-Five is on a deserving par to its peer novels such has Catch-22 by Joseph Heller and 1984 by George Orwell. It has become a classic American novel, and it is rightfully so. Vonnegut is not a \\"one book author\\". He is the type of author that makes his readers desperate for his entire collection. Slaughterhouse-Five, however must be a top priority and should be made the number one book on everyone's \\"To Read\\" list."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughterhouse 5, or Slaughterhouse five, or The Children's Crusade, also called A Duty-Dance with Death, is described by the author Kurt Vonnegut's alter-ego, Billy Pilgrim as a \`fourth-generation German-American now living in easy circumstances on Cape Cod [and smoking too much], who, as an American Infantry Scout Hors De Combat, As a prisoner of war, witnessed the fire-bombing of Dresden, Germany, \\"The Florence of the Elbe,\\" a long time ago, and survived to tell the tell. This is a novel somewhat in the telegraphic schizophrenic manner of tales of the planet Tralfamadore, where the flying saucers come from. Peace.' So it goes.The book is an anti-war book, but tells us that it is about as useful being an anti-war book, as being an anti-typhoon book, meaning that some things will never change. Vonnegut tells us this by giving us the story of Billy Pilgrim, whose most important role in life was to witness the secret American British bombing of Dresden, where 135,000 died, and who spent most of his time as an American Prisoner of War, a survivor who can tell the youth of today what war is all about, by using his shellshock trauma induced time travel capabilities, given to him by the Tralfamadore aliens, to revisit the war, so that he can write a book about it, goes to see old war buddies, becoming unstuck in time, his life as a series of scenes in a non-linear fashion which ends up making linear sense, even though it did not at the time. So it goes.Slaughterhouse 5 is a very interesting and somewhat touching series of events that finally all come home to roost in the final pages, the loss of man is the gain of man, whether we like it or not, is not the point, Darwin told us that this is what we are designed to do, Billy Pilgrim becomes an optometrist in the process, marries a woman who suddenly has a series problem, while Bill ends up in a zoo on an alien planet to produce children with Montana Wildhack, a famous movie actress, while trying to write his Dresdon story, filled with death, a plane accident where he was the only survivor following his POW term, fact from fiction, he thinks the rescue party are nazis, it sets off the time travel again. So it goes.Vonnegut is not all down and war depressing however. His humour captured brilliantly by such antics as considering the money tree that grew hundred dollar bills, gems and bank bonds, feeding off the people who met the quicksand by its base, or a young Jesus who once built a cross with his father so the Romans could use it to do something to a protestor that they didn't like. When the wit is there it scores in aces. You have never read the likes of such clowning around before, although compared to Joseph Heller's Catch 22, this one is more personal, less satirical, more direct and exposes that horrible World War II bombing of Dresden. In 1941 Charles Portal, A British Air Staff officer, put forward the idea that entire cities and towns should be bombed. Air Marshall Arthur Harris agreed in February 1942. It was napalmed in 1945.

So it goes."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughterhouse 5, or Slaughterhouse five, or The Children's Crusade, also called A Duty-Dance with Death, is described by the author Kurt Vonnegut's alter-ego, Billy Pilgrim as a \`fourth-generation German-American now living in easy circumstances on Cape Cod [and smoking too much], who, as an American Infantry Scout Hors De Combat, As a prisoner of war, witnessed the fire-bombing of Dresden, Germany, \\"The Florence of the Elbe,\\" a long time ago, and survived to tell the tell. This is a novel somewhat in the telegraphic schizophrenic manner of tales of the planet Tralfamadore, where the flying saucers come from. Peace.' So it goes.The book is an anti-war book, but tells us that it is about as useful being an anti-war book, as being an anti-typhoon book, meaning that some things will never change. Vonnegut tells us this by giving us the story of Billy Pilgrim, whose most important role in life was to witness the secret American British bombing of Dresden, where 135,000 died, and who spent most of his time as an American Prisoner of War, a survivor who can tell the youth of today what war is all about, by using his shellshock trauma induced time travel capabilities, given to him by the Tralfamadore aliens, to revisit the war, so that he can write a book about it, goes to see old war buddies, becoming unstuck in time, his life as a series of scenes in a non-linear fashion which ends up making linear sense, even though it did not at the time. So it goes.Slaughterhouse 5 is a very interesting and somewhat touching series of events that finally all come home to roost in the final pages, the loss of man is the gain of man, whether we like it or not, is not the point, Darwin told us that this is what we are designed to do, Billy Pilgrim becomes an optometrist in the process, marries a woman who suddenly has a series problem, while Bill ends up in a zoo on an alien planet to produce children with Montana Wildhack, a famous movie actress, while trying to write his Dresdon story, filled with death, a plane accident where he was the only survivor following his POW term, fact from fiction, he thinks the rescue party are nazis, it sets off the time travel again. So it goes.Vonnegut is not all down and war depressing however. His humour captured brilliantly by such antics as considering the money tree that grew hundred dollar bills, gems and bank bonds, feeding off the people who met the quicksand by its base, or a young Jesus who once built a cross with his father so the Romans could use it to do something to a protestor that they didn't like. When the wit is there it scores in aces. You have never read the likes of such clowning around before, although compared to Joseph Heller's Catch 22, this one is more personal, less satirical, more direct and exposes that horrible World War II bombing of Dresden. In 1941 Charles Portal, A British Air Staff officer, put forward the idea that entire cities and towns should be bombed. Air Marshall Arthur Harris agreed in February 1942. It was napalmed in 1945. Vonnegut made it very public in this 1969 novel. It was revealed by the historian David Irving in 1963 in his publication, \\"The Destruction of Dresdon\\". So it goes.Billy spends the final days of his life out across New York looking to tell a radio show his story, ends up finding a world war II sci-fi book author's book as window dressing, attempts to buy the book as a memory keepsake because he met the author and knew the war buddy who introduced him to the books, and is nearly arrested, and or committed, old age coupled with the dying man's last bastion of whatever his mind can make of it all, gives us much to ponder in death, by remembering our lives, Pilgrim travels in his memory and says that death is living ones memories over and over again... so best be good... and enjoy life. So it goes."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Hard to describe this one except to say that I loved it.Really a book-within-a-book, Vonnegut's tale gets you turned around with great story telling and (in some instances) wonderful use of absurdity. The writing keeps the pages turing quickly and easily and you finish the journey with your outlook slightly different that it was when you began - in a good way.Give this one a chance."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"A WONDERFUL read. This disturbing book should be read, digested, and then re-read. There is a reason this is considered one of the finest post-World War II American novels...just read it NOW!"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I've always loved this book, and except for the author's narration, could never imagine who might pull off a convincing reading. The George Roy Hill movie had Glenn Gould's music and good intentions, but was God-awful. Then, as now, the storyteller's voice needs to be a talent that can transcend time and shift with the narrator's ever-changing age,, and that's what Ethan Hawkes' sardonic, sensitive reading achieves.It takes a few minutes for Hawke's approach to grow on you, but once Vonnegut opens Billy Pilgrim's story and begins to expostulate on war and the horrors of war, on time and relativity on Tralfamadore, Hawke's voice merges perfectly with the narrative.This is a good deal for an unabridged recording, and while the disks are cheaply packed in paper slots, none were scratched or marred. The recording was crisp and clean with a flat, natural balance to the voice. Take this one with you for the ride."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"In his book, Slaughter House five, Vonnegut tells the story of a one Billy Pilgrim. Billy has the unfortunate luck to be abducted by aliens, precisely Tralfamadorians, who inadvertently allow Billy begin traveling randomly through time. As he moves his disjointed way though this book, Billy's life pans out, giving way to a colorful tale of a rather lost boy forced into the Second World War, and his life coping and surviving in a world unsuited to him.This is a novel of Great depth, hidden within a simplistic shell. Billy's travels within his own life carve a picture of how the future can create the past. Billy somehow manages to eek a past out of his own future, influencing the times he lives in. While his influence seems almost nonexistent as the book progresses, a closer look shows how the slightest of nuances hiding in Billy's character can profoundly change the people around him."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This book is a must read. It is both a criticism of society and an every-changing story that is strangely sad, yet not, strangely funny, yet not. Its statement is loud and profound with symbolism spattered throughout. It is a combination of science fiction and war."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"The cynicism and dark humor that runs rampant in this book is extrememly fitting for an antiwar novel. Vonnegut does a wonderful job in showing how detrimental the effects of war are on not only the people directly involved, but also on those around. His portrayl of Billy Pilgrim is fitting for those veteran who have been emotionally affected by war.Vonnegut's technique for writing the novel is different but not necessarily hard to follow. At times it may be confusing, but it mirrors Billy's new outlook on life as the Tralfamadorians view it: as a group of events that one can see all at once, like a mountain range. As the reader learns about Billy, his past, and his future, sympathy is envoked and the reader pities him for the horrific things that he has experienced.Overall, this book is a great narrative of the effects of war and how it can alter the mindset of those involved so closely. Vonnegut speaks from his own experiences so the account is semi-autobiographical and believable."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"There was a moment of sublime significance where it all came together for me in Kurt Vonnegut's \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" It is near the beginning of thr novel. Vonnegut has just finished describing a massacre that had happened in the war. Just at the moment he describes how eerily quiet everything is, a bird interrupts the silence and says \\"Poo-dee-tweet.\\" You might ask yourself, \\"how in the world could that be significant?\\" After you have finished reading the novel it will make complete sense.\\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" is also told from a significant point of view. What view that is you will have to discover on your own. The book starts and ends with Kurt Vonnegut telling us how exactly he is going to tell us this story, and in conclusion, a brief explanation of why. Everything in between follows Billy, Vonnegut's main character, and \\"alter ego\\" in a way. Billy's life supposedly has many parallels with Vonnegut's. The heart of the story is Billy's surreal journey through World War II. More specifically, his experience concerning the Dresden bombings that occurred near the end of the war. The book shifts in and out of different time periods, and rolls along in a non-orthodox fashion. There really is no clear cut beginning or ending. The style in which \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" was written makes perfect sense though. It is just difficult to explain everything without giving away the secrets and symbolism that readers should be privileged to enjoy on their own. I know the description of the plot I gave was fuzzy, but there really is no normal, flowing plot. It is all over the map. That is precisely how it should be, if you realize what Vonnegut is trying to tell us.\\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" is written with extremely dark humor and a very sarcastic overtone. The book does not want you to take it seriously, which is, in fact, a direct parallel on the pain that Vonnegut feels when writing it. You can see behind all the lines that this is a very hard task for Vonnegut to complete. He does not want to fully realize the pain war caused him, so he makes a joke about it. He treats everything lightly and sarcastically because that is the only way he can make his mind cope with the tragedy it had on his life. After \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" was written, Vonnegut thought it was a failure. Vonnegut thinking it was a failure only adds to its greatness. In reality, it is war that is the failure, so any book about it would be one that Vonnegut could not view as a success. \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" is remarkable in the sense that it gives us a non-sentimental, in your face view of war. It can be funny and sad all in one moment. It paints of beautiful picture of how absurd war really is, and underneath it all, the damage it does to those involved.Grade: A"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Few novels contain the sense of humor and the sense of tragedy as this Vonnegut classic. This novel is about aliens, but is not science-fiction. This novel is about war, but makes you laugh. Almost impossible to describe, Slaughter-house Five captures the absudity and hopelessness of life in the most humorous way imaginable. The subject matter seems similar to Heller's &quot;Catch 22&quot;, but the philosophical approach to time as the protagonist becomes &quot;unstuck in time&quot; makes this novel novel more compelling."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"To say the least, the book was innovative, intriguing, and somewhat overrated. Kurt's supposed morbid sense of humor was either: a)not apparent; or b)just not humorous, and seldom created a foundation for the plot. The book does, however, bring up revelations about time and its other dimensions, but is nowhere near the detail of Abbot's Flatland. But it also creates a solid foundation for the plot. It consists of a man being &quot;unstuck&quot; in time, meaning he can inadvertantly warp from time to time. The events that happen during his lifetime, however, do not pertain to any specific theme, except for the manifest anti-war theme. The book is not necessarily a very good anti-war book, but the man's life and &quot;death&quot; still make one contemplate. There are also some powerful anecdotes, as when the protoganist tells the tale of his favorite author's book. It speaks of how there is a tree with bark made of gold, diamonds in the flowers, etcetera, and how humans fight and kill each other on the roots, and only help the tree grow.All in all, the book makes one contemplate virtually everthing analytical, but lacks the commonplace anti-war theme with vulgar scenes, sadistic tales, etcetera, but is still worth reading."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This is the first book I have read by Vonnegut, and it is one of the best books I have read by any author, although after having read a few other books by him, it is certainly his best work.The book is set mostly in WWII, but it also flashes around to time periods after the war. The flow of the story is similar to the movie \\"Pulp Fiction\\", but the flashbacks are in a logical order that makes sense throughout the book.It is mostly a serious story, but the author has the knack for smacking the reader with some witty comment or antecdote that will have you laughing [...], but makes strong social commentary at the same time. He writes in a way that is very matter-of-fact and he tells it like it is, often giving the reader a new perspective on this world."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This book describes war, as it should be depicted. That soulless horrific unstoppable force that rolls on forever destroying everything in its path. Billy Pilgrim is described as a bee in amber who can do nothing but exist in a world he cannot control (This metaphor can of course be extended the entire human race.) Vonnegut uses the aliens and Billy Pilgrim's time travel to show the futility of trying to stop war. The aliens while they know all about war and even the destruction of the universe do nothing to stop it because it is just the way of things. So it goes. This phrase used throughout the book seems to say what difference does it really make we are all going to die anyway. Also especially interesting is the time travel for instance at one point Billy Pilgrim sees a bombing in reverse order. He sees the planes take back the bombs and stop the fires, he sees the bombs being disassembled, and finally he sees the raw materials hidden into the mountain where they can't hurt anyone anymore. So it goes. The irony that permeates Billy's experiences is not only dogmatic but also well developed in this classic work of fiction."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Even as we find ourselves ready to enter another war and in the middle of the tragedies that occurred September 11, 2001, I remain strictly anti-war. I do agree there is a time one must fight for what they believe in, but War is far from glorious.Vonnegut does a wonderful job of relaying all of this to you. What is most captivating about his style is how it flows so smoothly even if the main character can not remain in one time period.The character in this book claims to have know aliens who have shown him that life never really ends for we all exists at the same time in many different times. That they look at us as you would a mountain range, all at once, while we see only ourselves at this moment. That in itself I found profound since it hints at us having no true free will.This is a theme he touches upon often and I believe he feels that, not to sound clich&eacute;, our destinies are already written for us.This leads to his character showing a deep degree of apathy for everything, including the horrible bombing of Dresden in WW2.BR>Especially because of where we find ourselves now, I truly feel everyone should read this book, it helped me see thing differently. I was literally reading this book while the World Trade and the Pentagon were hit by terrorists. It helped me to turn to it, I am not as cold to things as the character, but somehow it offered a chilling calmness in his disregard for all that goes on. So it goes."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"A lot has already been written here about the merits of SH5 as an anti-war book, so I will focus on the two things that impressed me the most about this book. The first is that although it is clearly a serious and devastating topic (the bombing of Dresden), it is so infused with delicate humor that you can't help but smile. Vonnegut brings his characters to life using this humor so that Billy Pilgrim, Roland Weary and the rest of the cast become tangible real human beings. In war, humor is sometimes the only link to humanity - in this case, it is the lifeblood of the population of SH 5. The second thing that never fails to impress me is Vonnegut's way with the English language, his ability to wrap words around a piece of paper in such a way that no one else has thought about before. So simple, yet so beautifully done and so obviously a masterpiece. My favorite piece is when he describes a woman as &quot;a dull person, but a sensational invitation to make babies&quot;. What a Vonnegut way of saying &quot;knockout&quot;. The ideas expressed with make you think (especially for me, the one about America hating its poor people - being a rich nation filled with impoverished people who hate themselves and who are hated by the rest) and the intricate, amazing prose will stick with you."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"What a remarkable look at such a terrible thing. The story of Dresden, Germany isn't often heard of. I hadn't heard of it until I read this book. Then again, neither is the true face of war. What it does to people--to children, not men. This book is great because it doesn't glorify it like so many modern movies and books do. It shows the lasting implications it can have. It doesn't pretend the people involved were &quot;men and not babies,&quot; nor are the characters Frank Sinatra or John Wayne. It tells it like it is, and it's a hard slap in the face."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"&quot;I think of how useless the Dresden part of my memory has been, and yet how tempting Dresden has been to write about....&quot; &quot;And even if wars didn't keep coming like Glaciers.....&quot; Vonnegut creates an anti-war novel unlike any I have read as he writes about Billy Pilgrim, a World War II veteran. This book did become a movie, but not because it had action-scenes for John Wayne or Frank Sinatra (or Ben Affleck). So there is sex with the porno star of the era, in his dreams, observed by aliens of Tralfamadore. There are German soldiers herding American POW's into concentration camps or making Billy dress humiliatingly as Cinderella, yet this book really has no villains but lots of victims. Oh, there is death, every death story summarized by &quot;so it goes&quot;. Billy Pilgrim's story is narrated in no particular order, which is both bemusing and irritating, so a second or a third reading of the book may be warranted. Do read it. You may hate it in the end as a useless book about a useless firebombing (albeit with over 130,000 citizens -- obliterated), or as balderdash science-fiction with an anti-war theme. Or you may recognize it as first-rate writing. But read it."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I reread this in one sitting the other night as I have periodically for some 20 years. Slaughterhouse-Five was the first book to really make me think as a young teenager. After all that time and at least six or seven reads I still laugh out loud at jokes I can see coming for pages, and I'm still moved for days or weeks after. Billy Pilgrim's innocence and sadness and Vonnegut's humanity are still astonishingly pure and beautiful.Don't let the fragmented timeline of Billy's tale put anybody off; it's there to juxtapose disconnected events and thereby create illustrations that are creative and funny and satirical and moving. When available fictional devices cannot make his point, Vonngut puts one or another fantastic tale in the pen of alter ego Kilgore Trout, or brings in the Tralfamadorians for a few life lessons.Vonnegut is an unparalleled storyteller with a style that is at once easy and deep, like a wonderful aunt or uncle with biting humor and years of wisdom quietly regaling late into the evening. The tale he tells in Slaughterhouse-Five is one of the great stories of all time for it's unbelievable creativity and it's quiet, gentle and powerful sense of humanity. A masterpiece."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"With Billy Pilgrim as the hero (or should we say..zero) and Vonnegut's non-traditional out-of-order timeline approach, I would have to say that it was one of the most facinating books I've ever read. It's a great story about a man who is in WWII, a man who is married and has children, a man who foresees his own death, and, well, a man who possibly got abducted by aliens. The amazing thing about this is that none of the book is in order. One moment you're in Nazi Germany and the next moment you're on an alien planet. Many ideas were brought up in my class why this is and I believe it is written to reflect Billy as he looks back onto his life. However, others among me feel Billy may acually be &quot;unstuck&quot; in time. In any case, you'll have to try out this book to get your own opinion. Definitely worth a read."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I purchased this book to enjoy during a summer vacation. I could not put it down. Vonnegut introduces a whole new perspective of viewing our existence in the world. I am a High School teacher. I plan to implement this controversial book into my classroom. Bravo, Kurt!"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Through Vonnegut's use of his incredibly developed satirical style, and the use of motifs, Vonnegut masterfully achieves his main goal for Slaughterhouse Five, to show how horrible is the aftermath emotionally, of war. Vonnegut begins by introducing his main character, Billy Pilgrim. Billy is an already emotionally fragile human being that is forced into an assistant chaplain position in the US Army on the European front of World War II during the Battle of the Bulge. The war eventually causes Billy to go crazy, believing that he is actually time traveling and has encountered and been taken captive by an alien race from trillions of miles away. There is plenty good reason for this, Vonnegut says throughout the book, by offering up several motifs that alone classify war as a horrible thing. For instance, Vonnegut often says that the feet of a dead or dying man are \\"ivory and blue\\" (92), colors that connote stiff, cold death. Whenever a character of Vonnegut's is near or approaching death, he notes that his feet are ivory and blue, an image that really hits upon the reader as expressing the horrible nature of war. Another awfully graphic motif is that of \\"mustard gas and roses\\" (93), an oxymoron, for sure, one horrible smell grouped with the epitome of good scents. Vonnegut uses this imagery to describe many things, his own breath for one, and also the smell of war. The significance of the author's breath smelling like that of war serves as a constant reminder to him what he had to face during the war and never allows Vonnegut to escape his wartime experiences. Vonnegut also uses a load of often grotesque and horrible, if not odd, similes and metaphors to further his purpose. One instance occurred near the end of the book, not the end of the action, because of the constant variances in the setting of the book, and compared the bombed Dresden to the surface of the moon (230). There is no life on the surface of the moon, and so it was in Dresden after 175,000 of it's inhabitants were killed. Vonnegut is a master of language, and one time compared the smell of old books to \\"flannel pajamas that hadn't been changed in a month, or Irish stew\\" (128). These and other odd comparisons contribute to the feeling of overwhelming that accompanied the war. Among other ridiculous comparisons was a very striking comparison. Vonnegut is describing the prisoners of war as compared to their captors, their guards, and writes \\"here is light opera\\" (191). The guards, nervous because of their ill preparation and experience find at the opening of the cattle cars in which the captors are transported that these soldiers are worse off then them, a reminder of the innocence of the soldiers of the war. Vonnegut's satiric style played the largest part in his anti-war novel toward this cause. The most profound example of his horrible cynical writing style comes from his repetitive use of the phrase \\"So it goes\\", and is used every time anything, no matter how insignificant, or incredibly important, dies. Vonnegut varies the usage of this phrase from the death of lice and bacteria during a delousing, to the death of millions of Jews. This usage displays the dehumanizing nature of the war, and the hopelessness as well by understating the fact that so many died so violently. The reader is so offended by the understatement, that the opposite effect takes place. The reader is able to qualify the deaths of these people more profoundly perhaps, then if Vonnegut did so himself, a masterful writing technique, indeed. Vonnegut must be one of the most under-appreciated, least known masters of literature still alive and writing today. His style, his writing ability, and his masterful uses of innuendo clearly separate him from the Steven Kings, and John Grishams of the more popular writing circles into groups with Fitzgerald, Steinbeck, and Hemingway."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This was my second and last Vonnegut book experience. While it is a significant improvement over his much later A Man Without a Country that I barely ranked with a single star, I wouldn't recommend Slaughterhouse Five above a light read. If I'd known that the WWII Dresden fire bombings were going to be set against imaginative space and time travel with a porn co-star I would have drank more, taken the whole story less seriously, and maybe had a few laughs. If there is a historical science fiction shelf, then that's where this book belongs.Poets and Writers magazine can hardly print an issue without a Vonnegut reference. For fans of his work, you don't need my review. For all others, I find his work to be well-regarded mediocrity. There are too many books I want to read to give Vonnegut another chance. If you find Slaughterhouse Five as the only paperback in the lending library at a beach resort, it's worth reading on vacation without any other choices. Otherwise keep shopping."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughterhouse-Five is, as its jacket cover boasts, \\"one of the world's great antiwar books.\\" Centered around the infamous firebombing of Dresden in late World War II, the novel takes its readers on a ridiculous journey through the life of Billy Pilgrim, a detached sort of fellow who has become unstuck in time. As sad as it is hilarious, Slaughterhouse-Five is a thought-provoking novel whose morals are disguised by absurdity. Be prepared for Vonnegut's refreshingly strange writing style; the book is much more enjoyable if you let Vonnegut carry you away to his unique and darkly humorous world. It takes some effort to decipher the novel's abstruse themes, but there is much to be learned from Billy's search for meaning in a seemingly meaningless world."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"It seems to be the appropriate title for this review. Kurt Vonnegut writes about his personal experiences in World War II as the Allies bombed the German city of Dresden which appeared safe. The narrator/author is Yon Yonson but it's really Kurt Vonnegut. Anyway, the book tells about the men who survived the bombing and their lives before and after. Billy Pilgrim barely escaped alive and was not of sound, mind, and body afterwards. He was haunted by his actions, his humiliation, and the inhumane conditions. He was also plagued by guilt. Billy's story could have made the book in itself. He married an overweight woman, Valencia who just wanted some man to love her and marry her. His life was plagued by tragedy as well. There were a few others but none stick so much out as Billy Pilgrim. Just because you survive, doesn't mean life will ever be the same again and it's not for Prisoners of War or anybody who lived through a war."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I found it to be an interesting story of a man mentally escaping to a fantasy world in order to deal with the unshakable hypocrisy, severity, and useless tragedy of war that he had to participate in at such a young age. While I never served in Iraq or Afghanistan, being a military member at a young age, I could identify with being so young and naive, having to make some very mature and profound choices. I did not find Vonnegut very funny, however; if you are trying to make a profound anti-war statement, soldiers taking a crap in a latrine as comic relief seems a little sophmoric and out of place. I did find the irony of Billy Pilgrim's appearance in the prisoner camp funny, however. It is very suiting. Overall, I found it a cool, modern look at the impact of the ethics (or lacktherof) of warfare, and the morality and mental fragility of its soldiers then and now."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Following \\"Slaughterhouse Five,\\" Kurt Vonnegut swore off novels. In the introduction to his 1970 play, \\"Happy Birthday, Wanda June,\\" Vonnegut quotes himself: \\"I'm left-handed now, and I'm through with Novels. I'm writing a play. It's plays from now on.\\" Thankfully he didn't keep this promise. \\"Breakfast of Champions\\" appeared a mere three years later. An eye blink in time. Maybe Vonnegut thought he couldn't outdo his 1969 masterpiece? His Everest was conquered, so to say. Understandable, because \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" remains his most quoted, chatted about, and revered book. And though it fits square-peg square-hole right into his body of work, he never wrote anything else quite like it. Next year it turns 40. It has had a difficult life. Some potty-mouthed irreverent language made it anathema to didactic schoolmarms and the straight-laced. But controversy usually bites back, and the book entered the national spotlight. Censorship has always fueled sales. Even back then. Business 101.\\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" tells the story of a secular messiah optometrist, Billy Pilgrim. Like Vonnegut, who appears as the \\"I\\" and \\"me\\" throughout the book, Pilgrim was in a bomb shelter when Allied forces firebombed the cultural haven of Dresden to absolute smithereens. Historical descriptions are ghastly. Though the German government later revised the initial estimates of 135,000 dead to around 35,000, it remains a brutal massacre nonetheless. Pilgrim comes to Dresden via the Battle of the Bulge where he and his companions are captured and shipped in miserable rail cars to a prison camp. There, proud and hearty British officers feed and entertain them until the Nazis transfer Pilgrim's unit to Dresden as laborers. Once there, they sleep in \\"Schlachthof-f&uuml;nf,\\" or \\"Slaughterhouse Five,\\" where meat was once processed. Soon after, the city gets drenched in flames as the prisoners sit helplessly in subterranean bomb shelters. Horror awaits them when they emerge. Dresden now looks like the surface of the moon.Though Dresden's destruction undoubtedly provided the inspiration for Vonnegut's magnum opus, the story focuses more on the life of Pilgrim and his revelations on temporality. But being a \\"witness\\" to Dresden carries far-reaching implications. And there is nothing linear about this narrative or its implications. It begins, famously, with the line \\"Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time.\\" Like Christ, on who he's loosely modeled (hints abound throughout the text, though this is by no means a religious book), Pilgrim has \\"good news\\" for humanity. Good news about time and the impact of death. We've been wrong all along, it turns out. After surviving Dresden, becoming a rich and successful optometrist, Pilgrim gets abducted by aliens in 1967. They take him 446,120,000,000,000,000 miles from earth. There he becomes the center of attention, the supposed \\"perfect specimen\\" of humanity. Even his urinating causes cheering. In short, he's in an alien zoo. These aliens, known as Tralfamadorians, give Pilgrim a new view of time. Time isn't linear, they tell him. It's total. Every moment has always existed and always will exist. So we live forever. On top of that, in the zoo Pilgrim gets to mate with a human hottie: Montana Wildhack (as opposed to Valencia, the unattractive woman he marries for money and stability). All of his dreams come true. He no longer fears death (presented as violet light and a hum). He's free, and he wants to tell the world. Of course humanity, including his own daughter, consider him nuts. Pilgrim has internalized this philosophy of time, and he jumps from one episode of his life to another, seemingly at random. Only Kilgore Trout seems to understand.Pilgrim's view of time provides the novel's main tension and theme: the old hoary question of free will and determinism. The Tralfamadorians are deep determinisists. In fact, Earth represents the only planet they know of where talk of \\"free will\\" occurs. They provide the mouthpiece for one of Vonnegut's most poignant lines: \\"Well, here we are, Mr. Pilgrim, trapped in the amber of this moment. There is no why.\\" Such passages have led to debates concerning the novel's view of free will. Was Vonnegut denying free will? Does he think we have any control over our destiny? The novel doesn't take sides. Instead, it presents a middle path in the form of a brilliant Vonnegut cartoon. A locket hangs between two potato shaped breasts - Montana Wildhack's breasts. It reads: \\"God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom always to tell the difference.\\" So are we free or determined? Both. The most important thing humans can do is know the limits of our powers. Some things we can change, other things we cannot. With this masterstroke, Vonnegut also helps redeem the often disparaged medium of cartoons.Finally, no discussion of \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" can ignore the book's most ubiquitous phrase: \\"So it goes.\\" Vonnegut inserts this laconic quip whenever a death occurs. Some have interpreted this move as making light of or as dismissing the impact of mortality. But this repetitive leitmotif can also produce the opposite effect: it can magnify death's impact by simple repetition. After finishing the book, \\"So it goes\\" will likely linger in the head for days. Though \\"so it goes\\" represents and calls attention to death, it nonetheless reads as humor, but as \\"naughty humor\\" evoking hesitant or guilty laughter. Many critics have described Vonnegut's work as a perfect combination of funny and sad. This aptly describes the effect of \\"So it goes.\\" Likely \\"Slaughterhouse Five,\\" a deceptively easy read, will stand as Vonnegut's major work as long as people continue to read twentieth century literature. Sadly, Vonnegut passed away in 2007. One is tempted to say \\"so it goes,\\" but unaccompanied by laughter. All one can say is thanks for this book, Kurt, and everything else."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Just buy this book. If you don't buy it, as least read it. Then you'll probably want to buy it anyway. I had high expectations with this book, and they were met.If you're thinking about getting this, just take the advice of most of the people rating this novel, and get it."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Though Kurt Vonnegut's most popular work has been called both Science Fiction and an an alternate view of how we should view time, I'm not so sure.I don't think Pilgrim was ever actually unstuck in time, but he did have flashbacks to his life in Dresden and often lapsed into fantasies about aliens keeping him captive with a playmate. As Pilgrim is unable to distinguish between fantasy and reality, he believes that the aliens who have him under their control are able to propell him back into the past as well as forward into the future.But it's hard to pin down the ideas of the genius who authored the work, and each reader will take what he or she will from the dark humor and social insights of the author. So it goes.This work stands out as both a pioneering work of modernist steam-of-consciousness techniques and a work of post-modernist chaos. It is ironic that it was a candidte for censorship in many school systems, in that Vonnegut was one of the twenty first centuries strongest champions of free speech.I also found the continuation of Hemmingway's portrayal of the \\"Great American Boyman\\" in the descriptions of the American POWs to be an important criticism of our culture...one that we should be aware of in the age of metrosexualization. I often suspect that Vonnegut's relation of how the American POWs dealt with their imprisonment in Dresden and his observance that success is \\"damn hard\\" in America, despite our being taught that it's the \\"Land of Opportunity,\\" were the real reasons why political factions wanted it banned.Like many of his old time fans, I was saddened to hear of his death today and a resurgence of the love for his work has once again awakened in me. I'm dusting his books off now, as I'm sure many others are as well all around the world."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Yup. This is one bizarre book. And I loved it!It's very hard to describe the surreal feeling one has when reading Slaughterhouse 5. You see, Billy Pilgrim is dead. (So it goes.) And he is alive. He exists at all times in his life at the same moment. He can relive them over and over. If he wants to see the bombing of Dresden again, or be a P.O.W. again he can do it. It he wants to re-live his plane crash, his birth, or his visits with the strange writer in the alley he can do that. He can even go back into space to the time he was abducted by aliens and forced to live in a zoo aquarium with a famous actress. And if Billy gets Bored, he can go and be dead and listen to the light hum, and see the violet lights. So it goes.Yes, there is really no other book like it, yet deep, and even in some places not so deep, there is a rich subtext to Billy's life. It is a sad, yet beautiful tale, and at the end of the book the first thing I did was flip back to page 1, because, just like Billy, I had some moments I wanted to re-live again. And you will to.Relic113"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Unlike most novels, \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\" begins with an introduction that you have to read. That is to say, most introductions are interesting and informative, but if you skip them you haven't really missed anything. Not this one - if you want to read the novel, you are required to read the introduction. That's just the way it is.I'm pleased to see that Kurt Vonnegut is now receiving the acknowledgment due him as a great American writer, and indeed received at least a part of that acknowledgment during his lifetime, but not as much as he will over the next few decades. That's one reason you have to read the introduction. Another is that Vonnegut's reputation rests primarily on a series of interconnected novels he published in the late 1950s and early 1960s, and \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\" is the last and probably best of these. And finally, you have to read the introduction because it explains how and why he came to write the novel, and pretty much gives away the whole point of the piece.Under ordinary circumstances we would probably say that if we already know the point of a novel (or anything else), there's no reason to read it, but this is Kurt Vonnegut, remember. In addition to everything else that was unique about him, he loved to talk to his readers, in person or in print. You certainly read his novels because they're great, but you read them at least as much for the opportunity to hang out with the guy.Not to rehash the whole business, introduction or novel, but as the opening line declares, \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\" is primarily about a man named Billy Pilgrim who has come unstuck in time. He does not experience his life in a linear fashion, like you and I do. Rather, he jumps around from event to event in his life randomly, and may find himself in any place or any period at any moment. Which would be fascinating in and of itself, and made all the more so by the unbelievable things that Billy has been through, including the moments before his birth and after his death.You get to be with him as he works his way around Europe during World War II, eventually being captured by the Nazis and imprisoned, like his creator, in Dresden, just in time for the Allied bombing of the place. You get to be with him during a perfectly normal upper-middle-class postwar lifestyle where he becomes an optometrist, marries the boss's daughter, prospers, and survives an airplane crash on his way to a convention. You get to be with him when he's kidnapped by the alien Tralfamadorians for observation purposes, which is not as bad as it sounds when you consider that his captors are kind to him, teach him a great deal, and provide him with a companion in the form of a gorgeous adult-film star named Montana Wildhack.And you also get to be with him as he comes to realize from the Tralfamadorians that everything is eternal and immortal. The aliens don't go through time in a linear fashion either, but unlike Billy, they are constantly present to every moment of time, from the creation of the universe to its destruction. This is how Billy can be present on Tralfamadore with his gorgeous mistress and on Earth with his devoted wife both at the same time, and why he attempts to teach the world that nothing is ever lost. He doesn't succeed, of course, but one of the best things about \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\" is that his failure doesn't bother him in the least, exactly because nothing is ever lost.Now, in some ways, this is kind of depressing, since it implies that the universe is going to go the way it goes no matter what we do, but Vonnegut's deliberately simple style somehow turns it into a comforting doctrine. And that's the final reason you have to read the introduction.In it, as I said, he describes how he came to write \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\". Briefly, he wrote it in this particular manner at least in part because of the wife of his old Army buddy, a man who had lived through the bombing of Dresden with Vonnegut. This woman worried that Vonnegut would make war sound like fun, and thus make children like hers want to go out and fight and die. She needn't have worried - I can assure you there is nothing fun about war as presented here, although it is kind of amusing when Billy encounters a couple of characters from Vonnegut's previous books. The important point, though, is that the author structured his book to not only claim, but demonstrate, that nothing is ever lost.One way he did this, and the most obvious, comes at the introduction's end, where he points out that \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\" begins with the line \\"Listen: Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time\\" and ends with the line \\"Poot-tee-weet?\\" That's his transcription of bird song, a sound Billy hears at a rather horrible moment. The sound reminds him once again that no matter how dreadful life can get, the birds still sing, and their song, like everything else, is never lost.So in his introduction, Vonnegut brings the opening and closing of his novel together and shows us what it can teach us. And now that you know that, you still have to read the introduction. You have to read the novel, too, because there's more in it than just that. I'll let you find it for yourself. I'll tell you one thing, though; Vonnegut was a master prose stylist, and in \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\" he found a style that matched his theme just about perfectly. And that's rare enough that I can't allow you to miss it. So what are you waiting for? Go read it!Benshlomo says, Every word from the mouths of the wise is like gold."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I'll admit, I'm not much of a reader (until fairly recently). Lately I've been on a sci-fi kick and somebody at my work recommended this book, Slaughterhouse Five. Originally it sounded more like I was jumping into the middle of a series of cheesy horror books but after minimal research I learned a bit more about the plot.This book follows a man named Billy Pilgrim. Billy is a unique character, a man of few words. He reminds me a bit of Forrest Gump. Billy has a special ability, he can travel through time, through different parts of his life - though he is unable to do it intentionally. It just happens. Occasionally he travels to Tralfamadore, a planet many light years away. Here he is in a zoo, behind bars. Though the Tralfamadorians like to observe Billy, they also give him sound advice.Billy was behind German lines during the Battle of the Buldge when he was taken prisoner and placed in a slaughterhouse (hence the name of the book). Billy witnesses one of the most horrific events in recorded history, the attack on Dresden. Though we learn of this attack we also learn about Billys life as a whole, such as his wife that loves him much more than he seems to love her.Okay, I have to admit something else - when I first started reading this book I didn't know much about Vonnegut. I didn't know of his history. About 30 pages in I started noticing something... even though the writing style is simple (and brilliant I might add) I was able to pick up that this book really meant something to the author. I know he talks about his experience in the first chapter, I still wasn't sure originally if that was fiction or not. I started doing some more research on Vonnegut and I learned that it was in fact a fact. Vonnegut really did witness many horrors in his life including the attack on Dresden. Suddenly this book really started to make sense.Sure, this book can be classified as sci-fi but there are a lot of truths in there. Vonnegut is a master at the metaphor and you learn that he uses sci-fi as a vehicle for something much greater. This book is simple, yet incredibly brilliant and much deeper then it first seems. It's amazing how much imagery Vonnegut can pack into a single sentence of simple words. I've read books that communicate a lot less with many more words."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"It seems that Kurt Vonnegut couldn't decide which book he was writing. It was a mix of sci-fi, drama, and humor. About 10 pages were about the fire bombing of Dresden. The rest of the book was pointless drivel to build up to the ten pages he seemed to really want to write.I often found myself thinking, \\"oh, that was supposed to be funny\\". It wasn't really. I think a couple lines were mildly humorous."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"A work of perfection. Kurt Vonnegut said all there was needed to say in this harsh indictment of war of and humanity's failure to prevent it.The main character, Billy Pilgrim, was written in a masterful way. A man who could find pleasure in the simplest of things, is thrust into a situation that would break almost anyone, let alone a simple man like Pilgrim.Like all great works of literature, they are open to speculation by the reader, and I found enough in this book's 215 pages that I could sit here speculating on it for ages. This, to me, is the true mark of a great book. One that will be read forever and will never die.My take on the whole alien abduction and time travel was Billy Pilgrim's mind dealing with the chaos of his life. The way a psychiatrist will explain that a person's mind can splinter in situations of dire stress and create other personalities, so in this manner did Pilgrim's mind allow him to believe that he was able to time travel and be kidnapped by aliens. Or, you can believe that it actually happened. God only knows what Vonnegut's intentions were.The war depictions are sad and funny, heartfelt and well-told. You can take away all of the underlying meanings in this book and appreciate it as just a great piece of fiction, a great story.If you are a person who looks around at the state of humanity and says, \\"Why don't people understand how to treat each other? They just don't get it.\\" Then you should start reading Vonnegut right now, and Slaughterhouse-Five is a magnificent place to start.A timeless classic."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"So fluid is Vonnegut's style that you feel yourself on a voyage whose importance and profound nature you can't stop to contemplate until it's all over and you're left breathless. \\"So it goes\\".This is - by far - my favourite Vonnegut story and that speaks to how beautiful this story is. A poignant masterpiece. Read it. Enjoy it on all levels."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Vonnegut's wild satire reminds me of nothing so much as Catcher in the Rye, in tone at least. Bitter and dark with flashes of biting hilarity, his novel is an Alice-in-Wonderland, Matrix-type of manifesto in which a hapless young man, Billy Pilgrim, crisscrosses the world in his wanderings from a planet inhabited by beings called Tralfamadorians to his staid(on on the surface at least) optometry practice in New York to a hellish prisoner-of-war camp in World War II. Through him Vonnegut explores the nature and lack of human connection to this world, the tragicomic loneliness of human existence, and most of all the absurdities of war, bringing a fantastical touch and his own experience to the terrible tragedies he depicts. The book is slightly difficult to read due to its rapid shifting between settings and times, but Vonnegut's prose is smooth and rapidly moving. Not a book I would recommend to everyone - its black humour can be a little hard to take, especially in large doses - but if Salinger's tone rubs you right, read this book. \\"So it goes\\"."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This book shows up on high school reading lists because of its deceptively simple language and (supposed) humor, but only on rereading many years later did I realize how multi-layered and complex the story is. Billy Pilgrim is a hapless American soldier in WWII, who becomes \\"unstuck\\" in time and experiences life as one never-ending seamless moment. He moves back and forth freely in time, from his childhood to WWII to marriage to death, but since all moments exist in all other moments, there's no cause for sorrow over a death or an injury, even one's own. Thus Vonnegut can juxtapose the tragedy of war with the inane suburban life Billy subsequently leads, or Billy's life on Trafalmadore. Trafalmadore?--the fourth dimension, where Billy discovers another way to look at life. Vonnegut suggests that perhaps war happens precisely because we live in the moment--we fail to remember the past and ignore the future.On another level, Vonnegut paints a raw and brutal picture of war--the dead and the unlikely survivors, the killing of 100,000 in a night of firebombing, Americans brutalizing other Americans, the execution of a soldier for stealing a teapot as Billy returns home with a diamond found in an old overcoat. Kilgore Trout, Billy's favorite author, a crazy science fiction writer, is the only one who tells the truth, that man creates his own downfall.I've barely scratched the surface of this painful, absurd, hopeful novel. I read it in high school, but I didn't have a clue. Try it again for yourself."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughterhouse Five was a very good book. It was full of different settings ranging from war zones to other planets that keep you guessing and intrigued. This book was one of the most original books I have ever read. Some of the ideas and concepts the author expresses about war, life, and time put you deep into thought. The author has an incredible ability to bring out the personality in his characters and express their feelings. This book is out of the ordinary. It is funny and sarcastic, yet it gets across a very good point. The message behind Vonnegut's writing is very clear; war cannot be stopped but it is terrible.All in all, Slaughterhouse Five is a very powerful book. It is commonly classified as an anti-war book, and it is. Yet behind the anti war message, there is also a much bigger lesson to be learned from Slaughterhouse Five."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"One of the greatest books I have ever read, and I have read a lot.A must read for every human being able to think for her/himself."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Listen:Kurt Vonnegut wrote a number of extremely good novels.

He approaches his topic, the horror and absurdity of war, with a subtle hand, laced with dark humour and insightful observations that often sneak up on you in ways you never expect.If you haven't read anything by Vonnegut, Slaughterhouse Five is an ideal place to start.

What a disappointment."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"In this novel by Kurt Vonnegut, the main character's name is Billy Pilgram. He is a war veteran who survived the firebombing of Dresden. The novel is very choppy, and switches from different parts of Billy's life. I found it very difficult to follow, and not very enjoyable.In the novel, they often speak of a planet called Tralfamadore, where he was displayed in a zoo with a former movie star by the name of Montana Wildhack. I thought that the very concept of a man who was kidnapped by aliens was truly unbelievable and a tad ludicrous. I did not find the idea of aliens kidnapping a human and putting them in a zoo very plausible. While some of the tralfamadorians concept of death and living in a moment would be comforting for a war veteran, I found it relatively odd. I do not believe that an alien can kidnap someone and house them in a zoo for years at a time, while it is only a microsecond on earth. I also do not believe that a person has seven parents; I feel that two are a sufficient amount, and all that one person really has. Though Kurt Vonnegut was extremely creative with this story, and I usually enjoy creativity, this story was a tad bit to far-fetched for me.I also did not enjoy hearing about Billy's relationship with his wife, and daughter. I felt that there was an extreme lack of love between them, and that is not the type of family I want to read about. I would have much preferred them to hold a more important role in Billy's life.The only part of this story I enjoyed reading was the part about Dresden. I found it rather interesting and compelling. It was an extremely sad story to read and it was the only part of the novel that evoked any sort of emotion from me. I also enjoyed hearing about the author's view of Dresden, and his experience there. Throughout the story, I felt myself wishing that the author would stop talking about Billy, and share more of his own story.While this novel had potential to be enjoyable, and some may have even liked it, I did not. I found it deplorable to read and I would not suggest it to anyone, ever."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I enjoyed the book, but I think it had too much involved in the theory that everything is fated to happen.

So it goes like this:Billy Pilgrim has a big wang and is unstuck in time and gets captured by aliens and went to world war ii where he helped carry around a bible (oh, ironic, maybe? He thinks he is so clever, but he isn't). A tree died. So it goes. A bug died. So it goes. People thinking I am not a bad writer died. So it goes.Stay away from this book unless you want to talk to all your supposedly smart friends about how funny he is when he isn't funny, while Vonnegut is thumbing his nose at you-know-who with every check and still they have a million of his books on the shelves instead of good books.

Aesthetic standards can't be grounded.Thus, don't listen to anyone who tries to distinguish between &quot;serious&quot; works of literature like this one and allegedly &quot;lesser&quot; novels. The distinction is entirely illusory, because no novels are &quot;better&quot; than any others, and the concept of a &quot;great novel&quot; is an intellectual hoax.I prefer Daniele Steele, and there's no basis for telling me I'm wrong.

Kurt Vonnegut's use of a number is no less then numerical enhancement. This is achieved in which the designated number assumes both an odd importance and special meaning. There is little value in the use of numerical emplacement, a number is best served as a measurement.I have absolutely no doubt that Vonnegut fed off of the cipher phase, that reached its apex in the Nineteen-Sixties: Joseph Heller in nineteen sixty-one, Ken Kesey the following year and Thomas Pynchon in nineteen sixty-five. Vonnegut rode the wave and ended the decade with publication in nineteen-sixty-nine.The actual slaughterhouse is an arbitrary marker. Protagonist Billy Pilgrim's surname lacks originality, is overly obvious and the forename represent half of the male population West of the Mississippi. Time travel, see H.G. Wells. A fourth dimension and the power to see your future life. The reader is chained to the constricts of this narrative.

Vonnegut isn't the world's best writer, but he is certainly one of the most imaginative and witty in a socially responsible way. As anti-war propaganda, I put this book square between All Quiet on the Western Front and Catch-22. But what I really enjoyed about Slaughterhouse Five (and imagine Albert would have liked to) is Vonnegut's imaginative use of time and space.

It's about the trial of living the darkest moments of a life and the trial of communicating them inside the artist's aesthetical rigeur, both concentrical and within the other, as a Russian doll. Vonnegut it's every word aware of the risk of his &quot;duty with death&quot;. He wants to be the witness he was in the macabre Bombing of Dresden (as an American prisoner of German ascendance and all the tearing contradictions that circumstance implies), but he wants to tell the World about it as an artist, troughout the capacities of amplification and enhancement of ideas and concepts the creative act allows. Therefore, the Biochemist turned into a soldier, a prisioner, a journalist, a writer, disguises himself as a childlike young Champlain's help turned into a soldier, a prisioner, an opthometrist, and a voice of humanity among extraterrestrial beings, in order to talk in an apparently linear and childlike inocent way about a story he knows too much about, letting all the sad personas of the biographical being comunicate succesfully, due to the choice of images, the tragical esence of the pathos he had to live through.

The Tralfamadorian (those are the aliens that abduct the main character, Billy Pilgrim) view of time truly opened my eyes (in more ways than one) to one theory as to the nature of time.If you have not read this book because it is 'sci-fi,' pick it up anyway.

It is written in a very simplistic manner, yet it is so powerful that you'll wish there was more. The main character, Billy Pilgrim, is an ordinary man who seems to be lost travelling through time. You see his life both as foresight and as hindsight. He is portrayed as an ordinary man who experiences exceedingly extraordinary events. From his enlightening visits with the Tralfamadorians, which teach him much about humanity, to his horrifying experiences in Dresden, Billy's life is far from normal.To me, the novel deserves 5-stars. It is interesting, funny deep, and dark. It has much to teach about life. However, when reccomending it to others I must point out that it is a strangely written novel and takes a certain mind to enjoy it. It is the kind of book where, either you love it or you hate it. Beyond that, Slaughterhouse five is one of the most powerful novels ever written. It is a truly unique book."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This is just a great book. Its a little science fiction, a little war, and a lot of a great book. It is interesting, insightful, and in a strange way, real. Although the main charecter goes through some interesting situations, you always maintain he is an average guy, just like you and me, and that is the beauty of the book.Read it, you wont be disapointed"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"When I first picked up this book, I expected an action filled book about WWII and the bombings of Dresden. However this book is far from it. I was somewhat disappointed at first book this disappointment quickly turned into enjoyment.Vonnegut's writing is unlike any I have ever encountered. It is informal yet poetic, speaking to the reader casually. I really enjoyed this book and am glad for having read it."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This book is as fascinating as it is strange. It takes an important and normal concept like W.W.II, and through narration, repetition, and dark humor, turns it into a strong political statement before you realize what it is really saying.Vonnegut writes this so that it is easy to read and it moves quickly. When he talks about violence or death, he points it out so blatantly and casually that it is disguised, and the reader quickly passes over it.It is very serious and well thought out, despite its casual narration and humor. Kurt Vonnegut uses strange ideas like aliens to help paint a clear picture of the main character Billy Pilgrim's life, and provide a way to break up the war story and the horror of the Dresden bombing with other information.The alien concept of time is also very interesting and provides something to think about for quite some time after reading the novel."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughter House-Five is a captivating novel of Billy Pilgrim and the jounrey through his life. One of Kurt Vonnegut's best works. He combines humor, science fiction, and one of the world's greatest anti- war books in to one. When Billy Pilgrim, a weak and mostley quiet man, becomes &quot;unkstuck&quot; in time after being captured by aleins, you travel through his life. From his terrible World War II experience (inspired by Vonnegut's own war experience), including the tragic bombing of Dresden to the planet of Tralfamadore where Billy and the reader are introduced to a whole new concept of time and death. The reader journeys simultaneously through all phases of Billy's life which is centered on the war and the effects of the war. Constently the reader is torn between reality and fantasy and questions the sanity of Billy Pilgrim. This is a complex novel , basically without following a story line or a conventioal flow of characters. Through out this book Vonnegut makes you laugh, cry, and most importantly think. By the end of the novel the reader is captivavted and stunned by the brutality and horrors of war and questions our own fractured society. Slaughter House-Five is one of the best peices of American literature and I recomend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"More than a simple satire Kurt Vonnegut's \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\" is one of the most important books written in the North America in the 20 Century. Dealing with both personal experiences, fiction and introducing himself as a character, the writer has created a unique work that will remain in the literary cannon forever.It is hard to tell what this novel is about, because it is sometimes funny, sometimes a sci-fiction, and sometimes very very sad. By using such device, Vonnegut shows the reader the absurdity of the war and of the 20 century as well. Death and life are side by side in his words. At the same time, the novel is a personal journey towards the center of himself.Using a fragmented prose only enhances the experience of reading this novel. With such technique, the book requires more attention from the reader, and increases the curiosity of what will happen next, and when this part of the narrative will be resumed. This is one reason why many readers find Vonnegut's work stranger than the average writer. So he is, but in a good way. This elliptic narrative is very sophisticated and beautiful to those who read a book and care about language, character development and plot.Vonnegut's sense of humor and sarcasm are brilliant turning what could be a tacky story into a deep work, filled with undertones and, psychological and political ideas. The constant use of the sentence \`So it goes' display a high level of sophistication, that many veteran writers will never acquire.All in all, \`Slaughterhouse-Five' is an important read for everyone who is interested in good and profound books. Those works that make us care more about the world we live, the society we are building everyday and, above all, the life we are leading."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five is about a writer (Vonnegut himself) who is writing about a book about an optometrist/WWII vet who regularly converses with aliens. Yes, it's a writer who writes about another writer, whose writings are based on the original writer's war experiences.Billy Pilgrim, the protagonist of said novel, is unstuck in time, which basically means that he relives old memories in a seemingly random order. He is totally unfit for war, yet he is forced into service to fight in World War II. Vonnegut's novel within a novel details Billy's experiences before, during, and after the war. During the war, Billy sees many things that would be considered heroic by many, yet Vonnegut portrays these would-be heroes as ridiculous and obnoxious.The book has a clear anti-war message, but ultimately, it states that war is inevitable. Vonnegut brings his book to a filmmaker, who states that being anti-war is like being anti-glacier; you can dislike it, but it's going to happen anyway. When a death in the novel occurs, Billy Pilgrim's only response is, \\"so it goes,\\" which reflects on his powerlessness in his situation. He may not like what occurs around him, but he cannot do anything to stop it, and so he accepts the way things are.Slaughterhouse Five is written well, but it is rather difficult to keep up with because of all the changes in setting. There are several settings Billy is unstuck in, such as America during the Vietnam War and Billy as a prisoner of war during the firebombing of Dresden. Also, Billy's encounters on the alien planet Tralfamadore are just strange. Despite this, Vonnegut's message is clear, and it is articulated in an interesting, albeit perplexing manner."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Now that I think about it, I think that this is one of the best books that I have read. I notice that sometimes when I write I start jumping around and such through time and I can't help that this book had an effect on me. It was a fun read and it moves along quite quickly and it was never boring to me. One minute you're in a crowded boxcar living in excriment and the next you are recalling your wife's death. I thought the ending was great and really tied together this perfect anti-war novel. I had it figured out early on, which is unlikely for myself, yet made the book so much more enjoyable. A brilliant piece of literature."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Without doubt one of the finest books I have ever read. All Sci-Fi books should be like this.The book operates on number of levels.The Story of Billy Pilgrim and the 4 dimensional beings who have abducted him.The almost heart rending account of Vonnegut's own experinces during the Bombing of Dresden where he was prisoner of war.And by giving an idea what it would be like to see time as an additional dimension. That the future and past are just places where one can visit but not change. So - without giving away the plot - when the man is shot for picking up the teapot. It comes as no suprise it has always happened and always will happen.So it goes."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I was never really impressed with the story line of this book, it was on line with what i'd expect from Kilgore Trout. But i couldn't put it down, have you ever heard a voice so beautiful that it dosen't matter what it sings just as long as it sings? this is how Vonnegut writes. He takes a cheesy Sci-Fi plot (by the way i love sci-fi) and makes one of the greatest pieces of literature to be written in the last 50 years"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"All the other commenters here are correct in their hihj praise of this classic. All I can add is to say that Vonnegut has captured our post-modern crisis perfectly. Behind us lies the rationality that led to the firebombing of Dresden; ahead lies the supposed ideal of Tralfamadore. But we are at home in neither. Vonnegut holds up a torch to show the way through the dark."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I was forced to read this book in high school and remember thinking for a book I was forced to read, I enjoyed it. Although at the time I found it difficult to follow. I don't think this is a book one reads for simple enjoyment. It's pretty deep, if I remember correctly. Some of Vonnegut's other stuff is more enjoyable, 'Galapagos' for example."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Listen: for a reason I cannot explain, I wish I was inside Slaughterhouse-5 when the fire bombs raged over Dresden. Surely Vonnegut would laugh if he saw my review. Clearly it was Hell for him. His character, Billy Pilgrim, is a defeated man because of the experience. But because I was not there....becuase I can only read the story....I can never really know what it was like in that meat locker when the giant's feet pounded the earth above. I can never really know what it was like to come out of hiding, among the tremendous blocks of shattered concrete, and feel the sunlight break on my face. To be at German gunpoint mining corpses must truly be the most nightmarish experinece. But still...I can't help but say that it is something so terrible, so testing of my own humanity, that I must feel for it myself. This story is eternally sad, so sad that reading it is not enough. Its hard to explain my feelings here. Its the same as watching Schindler's List. Such a terrible terrible thing happened in Germany during that time and I can only wish I was there. Knowing history is no the same as being there. I guess as a middle-class suburbanite college student, I have never found a time in my life which tested my soul. Slaughterhouse-5 is also a funny book, very satirical, and deeply symbolic of many things. Vonnegut has an uncanny knack for seeing things the way they really are. He is a no-nonsense (funny that I describe him this way, alot of his books are nonsensical in some manner) kind of guy. He is probably my favorite writer. His books often carry the same messages, heck, even the same characters, but he can fashion such an awe- inspiring tale from words. He highly underestimats himself, at least I think he does, and I feel his work is unappreciated in a way. A lot of people just don't get him. I think people like some of his work because its &quot;cool&quot; or &quot;weird.&quot; Hopefully I'm wrong. Maybe I'm overestimating my own ability to judge the writer from his work. Well, I recommend this book to the fullest extent. I hope that I have convinced you of his work's emotion. Don't forget to analyze the story. Read into it, between the lines. See what the author has to say about war, humans, and life. Don't take the Tralfamadorians seriously. Don't take Billy Pilgrim's escapades for face-value. I see that other readers have missed his points. Please, if you aren't willing to invest alot of yourself into the novel, don't read it."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"The story of Billy Pilgrim as he views his life through a variety of time perspectives. He relives his terrible experiences in World War II and the Dresden firebombing. These experiences are contrasted with those of a idealistic alien race where there is peace. The writing style was unusual but engrossing."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"As the Tralfamdorians, the omniscient space creatures who like to look at humans in cages, put it we never die, we live on forever in our moments. Certainly the Tralfamdorians were speaking of Slaughterhuse, which is made up entirely of those moments. This masterpiece which satarizes just about every element of human life truly magnifies Vonnegut's power. However bleak and disparing the messages are, this book should be read by every creature earth and beyond"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I read Slaughterhouse Five last week, a 16th birthday presentfrom my parents. With it's amazing and disjointed journeythrough one man's simple life, Vonnegut illustrates howmessy yet tied together all our lives are. Instead of a simpleflashback that most anyone could use to give a character's backround,Vonnegut brings the readers along with Billy Pilgrim and we all comeunstuck, now able to explore with limitless hind and foresight a fullbut not entirely perfect life. Anyone who reads this novel will interpretesomething different. The Tralfamadorian outlook on life and death affected me themost, while my friend appreciated more the historic backroundof the once beautiful then ruined Dresden. Vonnegut helps us understand the futility of war and the sad, but not tragic side of death. WWII was truly a Children's Crusade. So it goes."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"What can one say about &quot;Slaughterhouse 5&quot; that hasn't already been analyzed to death before? Suffice to say, there is a reason this book is seen as a classic: its portrayal of the coldness of war, its time-warping style, Vonnegut's dark humor at an all-time cutting edge... If you have not been forced to read this book in a class, force yourself. If Vonnegut is remembered for one masterpiece, this will be it"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I just finished this book (For the second time) and I can not say enough about it! The total satire that pervaded every idea we cherish in America cannot help but to force you to take a step back and look at us and how we live. His casualness with attrocity, the comparisions between the chaos of World War II and the order of the Tralmafadoran's, the writings of Kilgore Trout... I cannot even begin to describe the complexities and though provoking ideas this book brought out in me! A must have"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Never have I read a book that has played upon my conflicting emotions in such a way as this. Do you laugh at Vonnegut's trademark humor--here in top form--or do you cry at the emotionless yet moving retelling of the horrors of war, culminating in the firebombing of Dresden in particular? Neither. This can elicit no singular emotional response, unless sheer awe is an emotion. Utterly fascinatingly horribly great"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I read this book as part of my 11th grade English class this year, and had been told for years to read it by my father. I couldn't put it down.The bitter satire, and the fact that Billy Pilgrim is such an average man made the book more than a good story. The time jumping didn't bother me in the least. Indeed, the whole book read like a true story.The style, which delivers the most gruesome happenings in a flat, emotionless way, is at the same time full of a criticism of American society and of war. Funny, isn't it, that Billy Pilgrim was happier in Dresden than in America!"},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Be prepared for a book that jumps around a lot but in the end is a fun and an easy read. I found myself rethinking my thoughts on war and time/space, along with laughing at things that come out of nowhere. I often felt sorry for Billy Pilgrim because of his bland personality. He really wasn't one to have opinions on any subject. He just let things happen no matter how unusual they were. Billy's blandness was countered by the interesting characters he meets up with. I love the names that Vonnegut picks for his characters. They are like an extension of their personalities so that Vonnegut can introduce a character and we already know a lot about them. Another author that I have to add to my list to read in the future."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"One of my favorite's.

Yet it mostly follows him to Dresden in World War II where he was a child at war (he was technically an adult, yet a young one). His ability to time travel was given to him by the aliens where he frequently returns to the life and events at Dresden Germany. A town that was later firebombed killing many Germans who were not soldiers, or an industrious city.A book that tries to get you to focus on the beauty of life, while trying to teach about the atrocities that sometimes happens and no one knows about."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"A classic and well worth reading.

Bonus points for considering a theory of time perception that makes sense and no sense."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"A different story of the life of Billy Pilgrim. After you get in to it, the book is sort of riveting, although confusing. The book is about Billy Pilgrim, POW, who goes goes back and forth through life, marrigae, job, etc., in atypical order that takes place over and over - in a Twilight Zone style. Pilgrim lives in traumatic devastating times and seems to never connect. A repeated line in this novel, \\"And so it goes,\\" is a bit over-done and appears to say \\"whatever\\" accept it and move on. Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five - accept it and move on."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"And so it goes.Listen: There once lived a man whose books changed my life.RIP Kurt."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed in a hail of heavenly fire and brimstone. The reasoning was simple. According to the Bible, the inhabitants were vile and inexorable. So why did Dresden, a gem of Europe, perish along with its 130,000 inhabitants? Vonnegut investigates the purpose for the bombing of Dresden in a satirical allegorical manner that is unrivaled by any author since Mark Twain. Vonnegut shares Twain's genius for describing a situation simultaneously as comic and grave. In Slaughterhouse Five, Vonnegut is able to describe the German concentration camps with the morbid clarity of Elie Wiesel's Night. However, he juxtaposes human tragedy with ripping one liners. How does he get away with such irreverence without coming off as a complete jerk? That's the genius of Vonnegut.The book is structured in the quintessential style of Vonnegut's mid career novels. Each chapter is comprised of small, digestible vignettes ending with a joke or one-liner. This manner makes his novels easy to digest, like the sugar over the bitter pill. However, reflection over what was said is emotional on a visceral level. In Slaughterhouse Five, Vonnegut takes on all the sacred cows: money, Christianity, nationalism, sanity and, of course, war. Each is presented to its most absurd extent.Billy Pilgrim, the unheroic hero, involuntarily follows a convoluted story line that is a combination of recollection, psychotic episode and dream sequence. The story starts with Billy being \\"unstuck in time\\" and the story sequence loosely linear within ongoing backtracks and foresights. A perverse kind of black humor prevails in most scenes. For example, the only time Billy Pilgrim laughs during the novel is when he is being beaten by a fellow American soldier in the solitude of the Luxemburg frontier. The two had been abandoned behind enemy lines; one for his petulance and the other for his incompetence. Both outlive their abandoners. Throughout the novel, life is fragile, death is capricious and events are immutable.In keeping a promise to a war buddy's wife, Vonnegut portrays Billy Pilgrim as a \\"ludicrous waif\\" and antithesis of John Wayne or Frank Sinatra. He is unglamorous and pitiful. Through mental illness, a plane crash, and the destruction of Dresden, he just wants to die. Billy Pilgrim is the one who wants to be left behind, but he keeps surviving when all around him die. Absurd.For Vonnegut, war seems analogous to the namesake of the book's subtitle, The Children's Crusade, described by Vonnegut in Chapter One. Under the auspice of serving Christianity in Palestine, The Children's Crusade occurred in 1213 when several monks recruited 30,0000 children to be killed or sold into slavery in North Africa. Regarding the Children's Crusade, the presiding Pope of the time, Innocent the Third, was cited with the following remark regarding the deaths of the 30,000 children: \\"These children are awake while we are asleep.\\" What is the significance of The Children's Crusade to the World War II? Most telling is Vonnegut's repeated restatement of the quatrain from the Christmas carol \\"Silent Night:\\" \\"The cattle are lowing, The Baby awakes. But the little Lord Jesus no crying he makes.\\" Although not explicitly stated, one has to wonder to the extent that Vonnegut finds Christianity to be a mitigating factor in the deceit (especially self-deception) that he attributes much of the bigotry and hatred in the world that leads to war. If not guilty by fault, Christianity is guilty by negligence. Where was Jesus? No crying he makes."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"The humor in this book is as stark as the landscape of war, and Vonnegut masterfully uses it to open readers' eyes. This is must-read literature for everyone."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I'm sure most of us here have read a bunch of Vonnegut books, which is a beautiful thing. I can't think of a single one of his books in which I did not enjoy, though some I do favor. But for those who don't know Vonnegut, I would say this would be a great starting point. It's got the Vonnegut personal style....yet it still has a somewhat linear plot/storyline. It's amazing how Vonnegut witnesses and survives the battle of Dresden, Germany, and somehow is able to write about it in his dark/comical/vonnegut way!Billy Pilgrim, the protagonist who becomes unstuck in time is perfect. The simple way of his personality is beautiful, asking for them to leave him behind enemy lines and such, escaping into his own world...traveling to anytime in his life...which also includes his experience of abduction and the planet Tralmalfador. I don't want to give away to much, so I'll just say the story is told perfectly, transitioning through so many different times and moments that you are never bored, and it's truly hard to stop reading once you get into it.I'm still amazed, and of course feel somewhat ignorant, for not knowing that there were 2 bombings in WWII that killed more civilians than the great Hiroshima...it's sad this is not taught in schools, especially Dresden....130,000 + deaths. Anyway, it's an awesome book and one of Vonnegut's best...thought most of his are! A must read....twice!\\"All this happened, more or less. The war parts, anyway, are pretty much true.

Any veteran would probably agree with me on that.Reading it made me want to write my own famous Vietnam War novel.

It was irritating to read the story with the flow constantly interrupted by stanzas with tenuous relationships to one another. I imagine an author with ADHD and Alzheimer's would find this to be a comfortable writing style.The antiwar aspect of the book reminded me of later MASH and Archie Bunker television shows: heavy handed and preachy. A few two dimensional characters delivering the same message, over and over.Though it had little in the way of flow (Tralfamadorian style), I did enjoy reading the longer uninterrupted text parcels in the book.

And everything is told in an incredibly simple but profound way, full of irony and wisdom.

So it goes."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Slaughterhouse-Five is science fiction writing that will be timeless for generations of past, present and future readers. Kurt Vonnegut writes about the life of Billy Pilgrim as seen through pivotal moments in his life story. The book is especially interesting to read because it combines a science-fiction time twist, aliens and life out of order seen in a fourth dimension of never ending time.Tralfamadorian aliens capture Pilgrim and transport him back to their planet. Through the aliens, he travels to his own life experiences including: his capture as an American soldier in WWII Germany, his time as a POW in Dresden, Germany (nicknamed \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\" for which the book is named after), his married life after the war and, ultimately, his death; \\"So it goes.\\" These transforming life experiences and the people within them show Vonnegut's point of view and theme of the book. People Pilgrim experiences within his life story appear to have choices. Yet for Pilgrim, he cannot change his fate but only travel back to another place within his own story at a different point in time. Can anyone really chose their fate in life or is it pre-destined?Vonnegut, the narrator, tells us the story, but the chapters are out of order, as Vonnegut allows Pilgrim to be \\"unstuck in time\\". The style of the book shifts the reader off balance forcing you to read closely and engaging in the confusion of Pilgrim's life. Pilgrim sees life as out of control, often senseless, as the horrors of war unfold. Random flashbacks throughout the story give insight to Vonnegut's thoughts on war: trauma, senselessness and meaninglessness. Revenge is shown to be the most senseless as Pilgrim's fated death comes when he is killed by Lazarro avenging another useless death; \\"So it goes.\\" Instantly following seeing his death, Pilgrim travels to another part of his life in a never ending story.The end of the novel discusses the beginning of the novel. Time travel never really ends in the life of the Tralfamadorians. Vonnegut suggests that life cannot be changed even if you know the ending and want to go back and change it. Vonnegut uses the history of WWI which was, \\"The war to end all wars,\\" only to be succeeded by WWII twenty years later. In 1969 when Vonnegut wrote Slaughterhouse-Five, the United States was in the middle of the Vietnam War. More death, loss of life and the meaningless of war recycled, to again repeat itself. Controlled chaos in an uncontrollable life traps the reader in the endless circle; \\"So it goes.\\" No other book has created such an effective anti-war message as Kurt Vonnegut did by transporting the reader on an endless journey of space and time."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"I don't put books down very often, but I put this one down.

More of a critique and a heavy satire on the world surrounding us. Unlike Cat's Cradle which seems to be a much easier read, Vonnegut really pushes his skills to a level that even he knows he oversteps. It does not make this any less of an exciting, thrilling and captivating book.With his repeated phrase of 'So it goes' and the main character's repetition of events in his mind creates a whirlwind, a cacophony of thought that is all at once quite human and flawed."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"The writing alone is worth the reading.

It was great because it was hard to follow but if you understand it its great. The story is about a man named Billy Pilgrim who gets in an airplane accident and becomes unstuck in time. Therefore the story takes place in the past, present and future. In the past, Billy is fighting in World War II. In the present, Billy is working in a Slaughterhouse. And in the future, Billy is in an alien human zoo married to a famous earthling actor. All in all, this was a great book. It's hilarious in some spots, sad in some spots and weird in other spots.Reading this book made me want to go read more of Kurt Vonnegut Jr's books. I would recommend reading this book if you are thirteen years old or older because there are a lot of parts that young kids might not understand and words that might be inappropriate for them. So, if you're thirteen years old and looking for a good book, read this. Here are some other books that you can read if you like this one: Welcome to the Monkey House, The Sirens of Titan, and Cat's Cradle, God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, Breakfast of Champions, and Player Piano. So go read Slaughterhouse-Five and other books by Kurt Vonnegut Jr."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Very tightly written, it took me a day to read. It is worth the price."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Ernest Hemingway once said, \\"My aim is to put down on paper what I see and what I feel in the best and simplest way.\\" As a reader and a writer this is a quote that often reminds me to not exclude being concise and telling the story. Kurt is one of those authors who I feel truly tells the story. As Vonnegut's character Billy even stated that the story could've been about Dresden, it went into the psychosis of time and the entirety of what makes Science Fiction. From being captured by Tralfamdoriansto predicting his own death, I found he never forgets to tell his the story.Personally, I was very confused and almost want to re-read this book due to the amount of times in Billy's narrative he went to another time. What amazes me the most is the fact this incredible story is based around a very real event in our history. Not only was this event real, but the author was also a POW at Dresden! This is why it's almost surreal to find the character of the author mentioned in the book. I can't say I'm in the mood the analyze all the themes between time travel and space and war, but I can understand why Slaughter House Five is considered a classic."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"The bombing of Dresden is what Slaughterhouse 5 is really about. The first chapter accounting for Vonnegut's own experience as a prisoner of war, who witnessed the bombing himself. He explains how this is a book about those events, how it is not a big book, because only so much can be said. A comment which is true, this is not a big book, just over 150 pages, but even with that Dresden remains a presence. Something inevitable and dark, which can't be shifted, and reflects throughout the real tragedy that is Billy Pilgrim's life. Even if he manages to shrug everything else off, we the reader are left with the effect of Vonnegut's story.Its funny too."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This difinatly is the most messed up book that I have read to date. Although I must confess that even with all that happens, it is still a book that is enjoyable. However not very appropriate for the young, do to some of crude and sometimes violent events. It is also a book that can seem dificult to follow with Billy going back and forth in time, this causes it to sometimes become a frustrating read."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This book is defenitly one of the 20th century's finer works of liteture but one would have to have a taste for unusal writing and ideas. A balanced mix of science fiction and historical events and unheroic characters to create a novel that has lasted it's time and times to come. The ideas that are presnted throughout this novel are not easy and but beautiful if one can be opened minded to them.I suggest to try to read this and finish even though the writing style is unnatural."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"Buy this book, better still, buy the 25th anniversary edition. I re-read it ever few years, and still get impressed by it's relevance. Everyone should own a copy of this book.Anti-war books don't get any better, but, to quote from the introduction, \\"What sort of book is it?\\", \\"It's an anti-war book\\", \\"You may as well write an anti-glacier book\\"."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This is an absolutely wonderful sci-fi novel with a lot of heart. It follows the life - real and perhaps often imagined - of Billy Pilgrim as he moves about in time, remembering painful moments of his life as an outsider. He witnesses WWII, but not as a hero; then he is a successful businessman, watching life pass him by, until he becomes a kind of prophet. Interestingly, tho the march of time has overtaken the scope of his narrative - he predicted that the US would be broken up (by the 1970s), that Chicago wd be blown up by \\"angry Chinamen\\" - it is still entirely believable as first rate scifi.The result is moving, funny, and very vivid. Warmly recommended. It can be read over and over, as I have for 32 years."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"In a time where war is no stranger to anyone, this book gives an honest and hard look at the effects of war on life. I could not put this book down. Although this is my first Vonnegut book that I have read, his ability to mix humor with tragedy in a smooth and natural way displays his brilliance. I highly recommend this book to anyone seeking to expand their literary horizon."},{"Title":"Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade","review":"This is an amazingly entertaining book. Before reading Slaughter House Five, I had never laughed out look while reading a book. No longer. This is brilliant book is extremely clever. It is original in almost every sense. I normally read non-fiction and was not entirely excited about reading this. But this book surprised me in spectacular ways. Vonnegut is outrageous. He is witty and he holds no punches. If you like fiction, you likely will like this book.If you are skeptical and think that fiction is a waste of your time, give this book a try. It will open your mind and make you wish that you were as creative as Kurt Vonnegut. This book reads very quickly and should be enjoyable to everyone who appreciates satire and surprise."},{"Title":"The Rack","review":"Finding this book in a second hand shop in 1984, I was impressed by Graham Greene's effusive rating in the blurb and bought it. I ended up reading it in one go, and like the other reviewers, thought it was exceptional, one of the four or five best books I had ever read and possibly the most emotionally moving. I searched around for more on Ellis, but drew a blank, and then the business of getting a life intervened. Fifteen years later, I was working in Geneva and one day, on a weekend outing in France high in the mountains between Sallanches and Chamonix, came across the village of Passy. A bizarre place for a mountain village, it was deserted, had wide boulevards and, among the Heidi chalets, several enormous hotel-like buildings, all of which were decrepit and abandoned. Later, speaking to a local, I discovered that the huge buildings were old tuberculosis hospitals which had been a source of great wealth to the region until the industry died out a few decades past. This reminded me of \\"The Rack\\", which I then dug up and reread. Much to my surprise I realised that the various geographical references to, e.g., St. Gervais, made it possible that in Passy I had found the location for the book, and that the walks I had taken might have been the same as the doomed protagonist Paul. Maybe, maybe not. Anyway, suffice to say, the book seemed just as brilliant and powerful to me on second reading, and I tried again to find out who Ellis was. I still drew a blank, but now just happened to be at Amazon and thought I'd take a look. Delighted to find this most obscure work of genius is not entirely unknown. As of today, armed with the helpful info from reviewer Roger Allen, I shall start looking again. This is a truly great book, I challenge anyone to read it and not find it so. It is incomprehensible that it is not better known. Read it if you can."},{"Title":"The Rack","review":"I read this novel twenty years ago sitting up all night by a wood stove in South Wales. I was about twenty five and recently married. I found it heartbreaking. The love affair Paul has with Michele moved me immeasurably, with the final pages finishing me off. Tearful throughout, I broke down, sobbing. Why this book is so often out of print I will never know. Nor can I understand why no film has been made of it. AE Ellis is not the author's real name, and apparently wrote nothing else. I advise anyone who can get hold of a copy of The Rack to read it and then pass it on to a friend. I did. The friend never returned it; but I recently came across a first edition in a second hand bookstall for 50 pence. I don't think I'll ever read it again, though. It would be pointless. This book still affects me more than anything I've read since."},{"Title":"The Rack","review":"This was the pseudonym of Derek Lindsay, who died last year (Andrew Sinclair: Derek Lindsay, London Magazine May/June 2001). 'Saturnine and reclusive', he was a friend of Kenneth Tynan and is mentioned in Kathleen Tynan's biography of her husband. Another friend was Cyril Connolly, and Ellis wrote a memoir for the Adam International Review memorial for Connolly. The only other work I have heard of is a play, Grand Manouevres, produced at he National Theatre, but not published as far as I can tell, and translations of film scripts for Lorimer Books in the 1960s. Sincalir is editing Ellis's unfinished/abandoned novel. There is also more on Ellis in Sinclair's memoir In Love and Anger."},{"Title":"The Rack","review":"I read this book while aboard a U.S. Navy Destroyer on a \\"Medcruise\\" and was astonished to find it alongside \\"Zorba the Greek\\" and Bellow's \\"Herzog\\" and Nabakov's \\"Lolita\\" all on the same shelf of two dozen or so other books, none even remotely in the same league.The fact that \\"The Rack\\" was a psuedonym and the only work by the writer's fictitious name made the overall effect of the book on me overwhelming, to say the very least! After three additional readings over the years (40, at least) I have just ordered the book from Amazon.com to be sure that my first impression has past the test of time (although, honestly, I am quite sure that it has.)To say that this book is an anomoly...even a singularity...in the ranks of modern and post-modern literary works is grossly understated. Add this to the mystery of its authorship and you have a consumation devoutly to be wished, and one has the highest rank one can bestow on a literary work: It is truly and completely \\"unique\\" in the world of Western art and civilization. /ss/ \\"James W. Casey\\"&lt;ofortuna@bellsouth.net>"},{"Title":"The Rack","review":"This is a deftly-written, incisive, constantly-interesting novel of a young Englishman's never-ending treatment for tuberculosis in the French Alps. The author, writing perhaps from personal experience, convincingly depicts the medical (mis)treatment suffered by the protagonist, who is given an incredible run-around by ludicrous doctors who diagnose his condition as alternately hopeful then not. The protagonist's one chance for real happiness, an affair with a fellow (female) patient, does not endure, unlike his illness. The novel's finale finds him facing a seemingly perpetual future among the sanitoria in the mountains. Graham Greene praised this novel when it appeared. There was talk of it being filmed. Apart from a short story I once chanced upon, A.E. Ellis appears to have done little beside &quot;The Rack&quot;. Yet it is quite enough, really."},{"Title":"Always (Focus on the Family Great Stories)","review":"I bought this book after 22 years of marriage and it was a wonderful resource. The book contains several stories of married couples who struggled through some VERY hard times to stay married. It provides a rare keyhole peak into the intimate details and struggles of couples' lives.And it proves that the great majority of good marriages come at a cost - of much self-sacrifice, letting go, prayer and a deep desire to remain with your spouse, even when the going gets *extremely* rough. It includes stories of verbal and physical abuse and marriages healed and restored through prayer and patience.I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Always (Focus on the Family Great Stories)","review":"This book is a collection of true stories about marriages in trouble and how the couples overcame these problems. There were various problems like abuse, alcoholism, illness, infidelity, and depression. This book showed that despite the worst of problems, things will get better if we keep focused on God.

They were punishing every human that thought they were tough."},{"Title":"Gosta Berling's Saga","review":"Saga is acclaimed by many as her finest work; it is certainly her most popular. Lagerl&ouml;f drew on stories of legendary figures in her rural province in south-central Sweden to weave this epic tapestry of passions, her first major published work.The story revolves around the character of G&ouml;sta Berling, who begins the book in despair after drunkenness costs him his post as a country pastor. Through the apparent generosity of the Lady of Ekeby, he falls in with twelve aging \\"cavaliers\\" who live in a separate wing of her manor house. In a turn of events that bears the devil's stamp, the Lady is turned away from Ekeby, giving G&ouml;sta Berling and the cavaliers full run of the estate and its mines, provided they remain true to their code to do nothing that is \\"sensible or useful.\\" Let it be said that they succeed in this resolve; whether the community benefits from their mischief is a matter of serious debate.Lagerl&ouml;f's masterpiece can be enjoyed on many levels. The setting provides a fresh departure from contemporary life, illustrating a simple country existence. Lagerl&ouml;f's treatment of characters ranging from peasantry to nobility satisfies the reader's moral sense, as sympathy is extended toward the dispossessed, a harsh light shone on selfish or calloused souls, and a gentle wit bent on those exhibiting minor follies. The cavaliers provide charming foils to the melodrama of G&ouml;sta's love interests; to this is added a profoundly supernatural element. The symbolism recalls the power of pagan rites, as well as the consciously Christian theme of forgiveness, while the premise of the saga recalls the Faust legend. G&ouml;sta Berling's Saga deserves renewed attention from students and lovers of literature."},{"Title":"Gosta Berling's Saga","review":"This is not the type of book I would usually read. I'm not into romantics, I generally read &quot;geeky&quot; stuff like science fiction, popular science, and your basic information-filled things. But I do step out of my &quot;usual&quot; every once in awhile and read some popular fiction, or some classic lit. A friend once read a chapter of this book to me, saying: &quot;it's like sitting at a table listening to an old woman tell a story.&quot; ..and it *is*. This has become my *favorite* book. The author translates the absolute passion of youthful love and tragic pain with a pure and beautiful intensity. Within the first few chapters it becomes easy to see why she won an award.--Gypsy."},{"Title":"Gosta Berling's Saga","review":"I was disappointed by &quot;Gosta Berling.&quot; I have been a fan of Selma Lagerlof ever since I picked up an old, battered copy of the &quot;Ring of the Lowenskjolds&quot; ten years ago at a used book sale. For quite a few years, she was out of print and very difficult to find. I picked up a used copy of &quot;Nils Holgersson&quot; - a Portuguese translation, of all things - about six years ago and I enjoyed it thoroughly as well. But all along, I wanted a copy of the Holy Grail of Lagerlof books, &quot;Gosta Berling.&quot; As soon as I noticed this reprint series available through Amazon two years ago I ordered a copy.I'm sorry to say that I really think that the &quot;Ring&quot; and &quot;Nils&quot; are much better books. I suppose that this is heresy for a Lagerlof lover to say, but when I read &quot;Berling&quot; I felt that I was reading the same story over and over again every thirty pages or so. Particularly the women in the story all seemed the same - all of them young, lovely, graceful, all of them wronged (usually by Gosta), and only distiguishable by whether they were blondes or brunettes. I had trouble telling them apart, a problem that I did not have with the &quot;Ring.&quot; It seems a strange comment to have to make about a book written by a woman.So why four stars? Well, after all, even bad Selma Lagerlof is a whole lot better than the best of most other writers. Just let me add in conclusion that if you like &quot;Berling&quot;, you really should read &quot;Ring of the Lowenskjolds&quot; too."},{"Title":"Gosta Berling's Saga","review":"This book can be mystified and confusing if you end in the first chapter. But if you go on, it's full of symbolistics and imagination is needed. It's a great book, from the way the author wrote and how it is delivered. Don't be tempted to end reading it in the first chapter, because everything will be clear in the end."},{"Title":"Gosta Berling's Saga","review":"Lagerlof's most active readership these days, in America and even in Sweden, thinks of her chiefly as the author of the children's classic about Nils and the goose. Gosta Berling's Saga is anything but a children's book. In an Old Norse sense, it IS a saga, though more rooted in the viking romances about giants and shape-changers than in the geneological realism of the Icelandic sagas. There's nothing like Gosta Berling in 19th C British literature; the closest comparison in English, I think, is to the stories of the American Nathaniel Hawthorne, who also wrote of a more \\"haunted\\" time gone by, of agitated consciences, of semi-conscious and fully malevolent forces of nature.Gosta Berling is also anything but a novel, in the normal sense. In its conception, it's a suite of legends and family memories, probing the psychology of Lagerlof's own lost world, the Varmland of the boom times associated with the iron rush, when everybody was larger, or at least richer, than life. In this context, one might think of her work as comparable to Faulkner's or Nabokov's. But Lagerlof is the daughter of a Scandinavia that still shared its reverence of God with its conviction of the presence of Thor and Loki there in the winter darkness. Gosta Berling, in fact, is scarcely to be regarded as a human, and certainly not as a hero or anti-hero. Gosta is Loki, pure and simple, a spirit of defiance to civilized Christian propriety, who links together Lagerlof's magical tales by his omnipresence. There's a lot of Gosta Berling in Ibsen's Per Gynt, but the most brilliant heir of Lagerlof's genius is the 20th C Icelandic writer Halldor Laxness. Both Lagerlof and Laxness, by the way, were Nobel Prize winners.Gosta Berling is funny, poignant, bitter, nostalgic, blunt and poetic. The interludes of nature writing are literally spell-binding, if one recalls the root runic meaning a a spell. It deserves a much wider readership. I read it first in Swedish, years ago, but I took up this English translation because of other reading I've been doing. The translation doesn't have the blue-haired trollish weirdness of the Swedish, but it's accurate and enjoyable."},{"Title":"Gosta Berling's Saga","review":"Gosta Berlings story is set in Sweden, but could have taken place anywhere in the world.

It is a little bit confusing that there are two different titles but it is just because one was published later so they had to have a new cover.

The one at the library is, anyway. It's the same book they talk about on here, not a different book in the series. Other series I've read, like The Baby-Sitters Club, have had two different versions of each book, but all they changed on those was the covers, and not the title.

But Tom Sly fixes Jared up good trying to get in good with the unexpecting Holly Meredith by telling the school principal that Jared and a few other boys where smoking and when that didn't work,he got dirty and didn't catch Jared as he fell off the tampoline and onto the ground breaking his leg.

After telling him off they walked together through the park riding the rides they both wanted to ride on. Holly's nickname was returned to her. Instead of being called Holly-Heartless, her old nickname was back to Holly-Heart. I just love this book!! I really was able to relate to it.

Though some of his conclusions are now outdated by modern research, no one has written with more poetry and skill on this topic than Ardrey. Throughout his quartet of books on human origins and behaviour [African Genesis is the first of the four] Ardrey shows how mankind is less of a fallen angel and more of a risen ape; and that man truly is still only a halfway house between the ape and the human being.After a Broadway flop American playwright Robert Ardrey [author of the play Thunder Rock and the script for the film Khartoum among others] toured East and Southern Africa in the early 1960s. This was a time when astonishing fossil discoveries were being made in the Olduvai Gorge by the Leakey family and by others showing that humanoids had originated in Africa some 2 million years ago. Ardrey talked to the fossil-hunters, the palaeontologists and the anthropologists and learned all he could of the new discoveries and their implications for human origins and behaviour.Ardrey's main thesis is that mankind was born in Africa over 2 million years ago, and for most of that two million years the species' success has been largely dependant on its ability to kill. Without that underlying hard edge the species would have vanished aeons ago along with all the others that failed to survive. And only if we take that unpalatable truth about ourselves into account can modern mankind be truly understood.In this book Ardrey's hero is Australian-born palaeontologist Raymond Dart who discovered and named the first Australopithecus Africanus skull in the 1930s, and who correctly identified Africa as the first home of the human species and A. Africanus as a human ancestor in the face of ridicule and rejection by the scientific establishment for 30 years. The book is moving and beautifully written. If you want to understand human nature, and the possibilities for both the past and the future of the species, there is no better place to start than African Genesis."},{"Title":"African genesis;: A personal investigation into the animal origins and nature of man (A Laurel edition)","review":"African Genesis is a book that deals with experiments, scientific facts, and evolutionary developments. Even though its old you still have to respect all of the different information in this book. Ardrey's first explanation's are the importance of territory. He used two studies done by other Anthropologists. One with ants the other with birds. The red ant experiment was done by Eugene Maris, it was simply a little bridge that the ants wouldn't cross to leave their territory, but would cross when coming back. Eugene Maris's other works are explained in great detail in this book. His other experiments were more interesting. The bird experiment, done by Eliot Howard, explained the importance of a male establishing its territory before anything else; with birds and apes. It explains an error in Darwin's teachings of man, claiming that sexual tendencies are the first priority. Howard, in all his long career, never knew of a male bird, with territory, to lose a mate; nor a male bird without territory to gain one. Ardrey shows some of these same examples later in the book with gorillas.Its stuff like this that makes me believe evolution over creation. Reading though the chapters the relationships of us to Australopithecus africanus or erectus is amazing. According to this book A africanus was a carnivorous smaller type of gorilla, erectus was a vegetarian and was bigger than africanus. Ardrey's Romantic fallacy deals with many animals that had true emotions and showed some examples. You see its all evolution. The last chapter is a laudatory approach to free speech. Ardrey is humble about agreeing with him or not, but not to ignore natural sciences brought to us. We are an unfinished revolution he says. He continues and then relates back to Africa's origin of man. The next book I will look for is where this one left off; for this left off at our stage. I would have liked him to continue and explain how all the different races formed if we came from Africa. But that may be too much for this book. What matters is after you read this book you have a clear understanding of Darwin's decent of man. You know that evolution is a long process and has many debates (like Ardrey's 24 paragraph debate of evidence that the use of weapons is a human legacy from the animal world). Anybody that is interested in the evolution of man and African anthropology, you'll want to start with this book."},{"Title":"African genesis;: A personal investigation into the animal origins and nature of man (A Laurel edition)","review":"For those dissatisfied with the ludicrous baggage of the world's gods and religions as the origin of mankind and the source of human behaviour, Robert Ardrey is a good place to start.

He ceaselessly anthropomorphosizes his animal characters far past where it's proper. This tends to detract from his overall arguments in today's more savvy readership.Still, Ardrey had a point to make. And it's a good one. The struggle for survival in the natural world is the game our ancestors played as well, and we're here because we were good at it - better than our ancestors competing for the same niche. That's why we're here and they're not.This book is also a starting point from which popular anthropology has its base. It was very shortly after this point in time that the Leakeys came into the public arena in a big way. So it's interesting to see where the forefront of the public view was at this point in time. There's a fairly decent summary of the work done up to that point as well. Fellows like Dart, who pioneered the field of modern physical anthropology, tend to get forgotten in the frenzy of activity that followed in the 60's and beyond. For these reasons, the book is worth getting.Finding Ardrey's &quot;African Genesis&quot; may be a chore. But the Amazon book search worked for me, ..."},{"Title":"African genesis;: A personal investigation into the animal origins and nature of man (A Laurel edition)","review":"Robert Ardrey's book on human origins is remarkably well-written. That is both a feature and a possible disadvantage. He writes so well that error--if such there be--might be invisible. It is a fascinating book to read, if only for the writing.His thesis, that man was born to kill, and to kill with weapons made by his own hand--more or less--is hard to dispute, given history.The book came out during a time when the prevailing ethos required, and delivered, the peaceful, noble savage.Jane Goodall, among others, helped the ethos mightily with her first book about the Gombe chimps.Ashley Montague wrote a book implicitly challenging Ardrey's point.The ethos needed the peaceful, noble savage in order to have him, or his descendants, which is to say, us, corrupted by capitalism, male-oriented religions instead of the Goddess, republicans, Americans, or some other evil-of-the-day, without which everything would be so much better. If we had been then as we are now, who would we blame, and for what?I can recall one, if not more, novels about prehistoric man in which the Neanderthals stood in for the flower children while the oncoming Cro Magnons for the Marines and paratroopers fighting in Viet Nam. Not explicitly, of course, but the point was clear. We, Homo Sap, Cro Magnon, white, were evil.I was on campus at the time and got more than a couple of ears full of this.Ardrey is refreshing. He deals in facts. Some of them are no longer quite as certain as he thought. The sequence of pre-human ancestors and the association of tools, or not, upon which he depended for his thesis, have been changed. Whether that makes much difference to his point or not is hard to say, since we don't know much about the newcomers, including how they related to the pre-humans Ardrey used. And, in fact, we don't know that the currently-accepted view of the sequence is correct. And it is further possible that somebody other than, say, australopithecus, both used weapons and fathered the human race. In which case, Ardrey would be correct.He is fascinating in a number of ways, but some of the facts he presents are astonishing. For example, the types of bones of various prey found in a South African cave are grossly disproportionate to their presence in the prey themselves. Why lower jaws of small antelopes, and not the rest of the head? Why straight horns and not curved horns? The matched double dents in the heads of baboons, whose wounds fit the distal end of a medium antelope foreleg--grossly overrepresented in the bone pile--seem quite positive. The hyena skull choking on one of the bones shoved down its throat exhausts all possibilities other than that an angry australopithecus killed it.This idea attracts opposition still.Various television documentaries of our ancestors, either actors with terrific makeup, or superb animation, show the kind of pre-humans Ardrey discusses as unarmed victims of practically any other animal.Ardrey refers to a paleontologist calling fangs in a hominid skull, \\"tools for intra-specific aggression\\" instead of the dread \\"w\\" word, \\"weapon\\".Keeley and others are discussing war before history, or prehistoric violence, but considering only Homo Sap and only the last several tens of thousands of years. Even they are finding resistance, some transparently faulty reasoning.In some cases, the violence in primitive societies is laid at the feet of white interlopers, without whose baleful presence, all was peaceful and orderly.All in all, Ardrey makes a solid case that man is born to make, hold, and wield weapons. Whether subsequent research discredits his sequences or not, the case is well made and definitely worth reading carefully.This book is quite old. I'd be interested in a comment about why you were looking at a review of it.

Zeller covers the whole debugging process:- Problem-tracking systems are discussed, not only as tools for tracking and managing problem reports, but also as valuable idea repositories and requirements management systems.- You will also find advice on how to set up automated tests that support debugging tasks.- Apparently straightforward, reproducing problems can be harder that it seems, as \\"heisenbugs\\" testify (i.e. when debugging tools interfere with the problem so that it disappears when it is being observed).- Delta debugging, an interesting application of the classical divide-and-conquer strategy, provides an automated method to simplify test cases (and focus on the truly relevant part of the problem).- Applying the scientific method is the right way to debug (i.e. reasoning about programs to create hypotheses and performing experiments to validate or discard those hypotheses). Here, the use of a debugging logbook helps to make debugging explicit by writing down all hypotheses and observations.- Plenty of techniques for creating hypothesis and determining the failure cause of an observed problem are covered, from static analysis tools and introducing assertions, to experimental techniques that try to make debugging more efficient.\\"Why programs fail\\" is outstanding. Many interesting (and practical) ideas are explored.

One example of this isthe DDCHANGE plug-in for Eclipse that automaticallyidentifies which of multiple code changes has introduced agiven bug.I found no major faults in this book. The author's styleof writing is very enjoyable.

Clearly the author has extensively researched the field (being one of the authors of DDD probably helped).Delta debugging, parallel debugging and omniscient debugging all look very interesting.

Ralph W, Estes' powerful work is widely considered one of the most important books written on American corporations and their vast power, and he has nothing kind to say. Compelling and clearly written, his book shines a bright light into some very dark, creepy corners. And although he overstates, over-generalizes and tends to blame corporations for every evil in society, there's no debating that the concept of stakeholder accountability that Estes sets forth has moved to center-stage.

In deciding to reprint it, its originator, Ceanne deRohan, found a need to rework it with insights that have come since the material was first printed in 1999 . . . one of the characteristics of the contents was an overwhelming intensity intended to bring the series to a close and let readers go forward with their own work toward healing and arriving at balance and true understanding . . .The new version is available now, July 2012, from the publisher and I have just finished my first read of it.

It is much better."},{"Title":"Right use of will: Healing and evolving the emotional body","review":"LATER NOTE: new edition (slightly revised) published in 2010 available also as an ebook for instant download at $10 - check out the \\"Right Use of Will . com\\" website.This book - and the rest of the series - is unique and contains stunning information about the reason the world is so imbalanced. The succeeding books (which are best read in this order) are Original Cause I, Original Cause II, Earthspell, Heartsong, Land of Pan, Imprinting, and Indigo.This book is the first of a series of astonishing books by Ceanne DeRohan, all of which should be bestsellers. Right Use of Will was first published in the 1980s, long before most of the other new age revelations starting coming out from the mid-1990s onwards - first a trickle, now a flood. And the series remains way ahead of - and is very different indeed from - most spiritual books, of which I've read literally several hundreds. Of the dozens I've bought over the decades, these are the only ones I kept during a clearout when I donated most of my extensive library to a \\"hungry\\" couple who were ready to - in their words - \\"cherish, devour, learn\\". (I also bought another copy of this book to give them, of course.)These books are already classics, going deeply into our origins, including hidden agendas operating right from the start. They are not easy to read with the conventional mind, the emotional body's co-operation is required. Each seems almost more fantastic than the previous one, but I have met the author and can vouch for her sanity and groundedness. I sense the truth resonating from every page of these books, which is not necessarily the case with so many other channeled or new age books.This series of books calls the emotional body the \\"Will\\" and identifies it as the feminine aspect. Emotions as our Will? This seems odd, until you learn, in books about the brain, that people who cannot access their feelings because of brain damage are simply unable to make decisions. They can logically calculate the advantages and disadvantages of each choice but, because they just don't know how they feel about each choice, they're stuck. Clearly feelings drive decisions and this means willpower is only accessible through emotions. This is not what we've all been taught, is it?Many books pay lipservice to the four basic dimensions (spiritual, mental, emotional, physical) but most stint the emotional, a major - and possibly deliberate - oversight, as these profound books show. Negative\\" emotions have been judged against for eons but the problem is that, the more we suppress and deny those uncomfortable emotions, the less we can feel the so-called \\"positive\\" emotions. Society imposes control by the use of guilt, instead of the natural ease and rightness of actions when all emotions are allowed to flow freely and evolve. When emotions are feared and blocked, the result is pain and dis-ease.Also, I wanted to mention the author's latest book, \\"Feelings Matter\\" (2007), addressing \\"the role that stress has been playing in our brain and nervous system imbalances, information on nutrition and detoxifying our bodies and also what can be done during pregnancy, birth and early infancy to stop perpetuating our developmental imbalances.\\" This new book is further described on her website as: \\"Although Feelings Matter is not part of the Right Use of Will series, it contains the same basic concepts applied to our brain development, our health and our ability to function in our daily lives. Anyone you wanted to give a copy of Right Use of Will, but didn't think they would accept the information, can read this, because the same basic concepts are all backed up now with science.\\""},{"Title":"Right use of will: Healing and evolving the emotional body","review":"This is probably the third time I've read this book, each time is more and more profound.For anyone who has lost touch with their own inner voice through control, abuse, or just social pressures 'go along' and be silent, this 'dialog' is very helpful.

The clarity having to address the release of judgment and at the same time honoring our emotional expressions without suppression and allowing them to come through as part of the unfolding by accepting them as part of us for evolution with out suppressing or censoring them with judgement and allowing them to come forth clearing and healing all of the self denial is key for this journey.

I recognize that languaging, especially in works of this kind, is an art, challenging and, still, this work's energy is so potent! Paying attention to what is evoked in the reader, sometimes sentence by sentence, is key, whether it be thoughts, memories, feelings...whatever. The book represents to be \\"received\\" information, which, I suppose, is the same as or, at least, similar to channeled information. For me, it is of no matter whether the book's information/discussion, for example, of Pan, Lemuria, Atlantis, etc. is correct. If nothing else, they are metaphors illustrating the separation of spirit and will, and the mind boggling, resulting, continuing disempowerment. As I began to read and notice what was coming up for me, it became clearer and clearer that I was dynamically, energetically engaged in an amazing healing process. The book deserves, no, demands, a re-read as, now obviously, there are levels, depths/heights, here, so to speak. Right now, I see that \\"my\\" timing has been, is, perfect...a great gift for me personally as, heretofore, I have held a judgement that I was not evolving fast enough, doing enough, clear enough, tough enough, feeling enough, trusting enough etc. ad nauseum...Enough already!

It, and the subsequent books, confirmed things I had sensed deep down as a child but hadn't fully formulated in the mental sense. It also took me way, way beyond what I had previously consciously considered as my \\"reality\\" and deep into the subconscious, archaic, pre-conscious, archetypal realms.Some days I wish I had never found this information. Some days I wish I could go back to seeing things the way I did before I discovered Right Use of Will.

She then talks about unconditional love exists only if you love everything about a person and never get angry with anything they do. This just led me to believe that if there is no such thing as unconditional love then all humans are here in error.She speaks a lot about distancing yourself from everyone who doesn't go along with everything you say, you should never compromise, you should feel your feelings, live through unpleasant experiences over and over again to learn to deal with these feelings.This book will drive you to suicide, do not even try skimming through it, it is a powerful book and the information it contains is dangerous and cult-like."},{"Title":"Right use of will: Healing and evolving the emotional body","review":"This is the first in a series of books (eight so far) published every 2 or 3 years since 1984. Simply stated, these are the most profound books I have ever read. So much so, in fact, that I threw away most of my other spiritual books after getting into these. These books are for the serious seeker--they are not for everyone. They are very deep, but they're written in a straightforward manner. In order to get much out of them, you need to be willing to really look at yourself and the beliefs you hold. But if other spiritual and new age books have left you feeling like something's missing, these may be exactly what you're looking for."},{"Title":"Right use of will: Healing and evolving the emotional body","review":"Read through this book and you may find it interesting or you may not. Feel through this book and you will be changed. There are no promises on the outcome but if you sincerely seek the truth of creation you must consider what this book and the following books in the series have to say. It will force you to look deeper into yourself then you have ever considered. It will challenge every belief you have held so dearly about yourself, your God and your life. It is intended to move your denials, emotions you have avoided and separated yourself from since your inception as a spirit. But consider this, if you succeed in true integration, acceptance and balance, you will be in wholeness and true love for the first time in forever."},{"Title":"Right use of will: Healing and evolving the emotional body","review":"The most important book for those that are ready for it, because not everybody can accept the truth that this book contain.Only sure way to clear your emotional body of all denials, judgments and missconceptions about everything that you thought was right and true.Book that really can change your life if you apply it's teachings.Highly recommended !!"},{"Title":"Right use of will: Healing and evolving the emotional body","review":"Serious about healing and spiritual awakening that is. This book/series is NOT for the faint-hearted. It is not an easy read, even though you look at the first book and think wow it's so small I'll blaze right through it. You won't. This book, unless you are some kind of alien who has no emotional center at all, will trigger emotions you didn't even know you had. This book will rock you to your very core, because of the Eternal Truths contained within. You will become frustrated, angry, go into fits of uncontrolled sobbing, disbelief, and ultimately...you will come to understanding, acceptance, truth, and HOPE. If you have a deep, underlying sense of...\\"something isn't quite right with the world, but I don't know what it is or where it originated\\" these books tell you exactly what \\"it\\" is and why it happened. That spiritual itch that you just can't seem to scratch enough to go away will be relieved. However, it will not be comfortable when you first hear it (or rather, are reminded of it...because you already know it inside). Once you read these books, you will never be the same..."},{"Title":"Right use of will: Healing and evolving the emotional body","review":"I found this book to be the most grounded spirtual book Ihave read in a long while. It is a very practical, no-nonsensesource of information, and it corresponds to my own life experience. Many 'spiritual' books come across as somewhat flakey and wishy-washy. This gets straight to the point and comesfrom the mouth of the big-guy himself (or herself). It does not ignore the nitty-gritty and explains alot of how the world came to be how it is. Alot of information to digest, but worth it. A must read for anyone who is serious about their spirituality and healing!"},{"Title":"Right use of will: Healing and evolving the emotional body","review":"Once you've read this book you'll know the time you spend practicing its teachings is time well spent.

I recommed this book to the serious at heart seeker. It is very potent and impeccably straight forward. This book addressed truths I had never heard or read before. That in itself was very transformational for me."},{"Title":"Right use of will: Healing and evolving the emotional body","review":"LATER NOTE: new edition (slightly revised) published in 2010 available also as an ebook for instant download at $10 - check out the \\"Right Use of Will . com\\" website.This book - and the rest of the series - is unique and contains stunning information about the reason the world is so imbalanced. The succeeding books (which are best read in this order) are Original Cause I, Original Cause II, Earthspell, Heartsong, Land of Pan, Imprinting, and Indigo.This book is the first of a series of astonishing books by Ceanne DeRohan, all of which should be bestsellers. Right Use of Will was first published in the 1980s, long before most of the other new age revelations starting coming out from the mid-1990s onwards - first a trickle, now a flood. And the series remains way ahead of - and is very different indeed from - most spiritual books, of which I've read literally several hundreds. Of the dozens I've bought over the decades, these are the only ones I kept during a clearout when I donated most of my extensive library to a \\"hungry\\" couple who were ready to - in their words - \\"cherish, devour, learn\\". (I also bought another copy of this book to give them, of course.)These books are already classics, going deeply into our origins, including hidden agendas operating right from the start. They are not easy to read with the conventional mind, the emotional body's co-operation is required. Each seems almost more fantastic than the previous one, but I have met the author and can vouch for her sanity and groundedness. I sense the truth resonating from every page of these books, which is not necessarily the case with so many other channeled or new age books.This series of books calls the emotional body the \\"Will\\" and identifies it as the feminine aspect. Emotions as our Will? This seems odd, until you learn, in books about the brain, that people who cannot access their feelings because of brain damage are simply unable to make decisions. They can logically calculate the advantages and disadvantages of each choice but, because they just don't know how they feel about each choice, they're stuck. Clearly feelings drive decisions and this means willpower is only accessible through emotions. This is not what we've all been taught, is it?Many books pay lipservice to the four basic dimensions (spiritual, mental, emotional, physical) but most stint the emotional, a major - and possibly deliberate - oversight, as these profound books show. Negative\\" emotions have been judged against for eons but the problem is that, the more we suppress and deny those uncomfortable emotions, the less we can feel the so-called \\"positive\\" emotions. Society imposes control by the use of guilt, instead of the natural ease and rightness of actions when all emotions are allowed to flow freely and evolve. When emotions are feared and blocked, the result is pain and dis-ease.Also, I wanted to mention the author's latest book, \\"Feelings Matter\\" (2007), addressing \\"the role that stress has been playing in our brain and nervous system imbalances, information on nutrition and detoxifying our bodies and also what can be done during pregnancy, birth and early infancy to stop perpetuating our developmental imbalances.\\" This new book is further described on her website as: \\"Although Feelings Matter is not part of the Right Use of Will series, it contains the same basic concepts applied to our brain development, our health and our ability to function in our daily lives. Anyone you wanted to give a copy of Right Use of Will, but didn't think they would accept the information, can read this, because the same basic concepts are all backed up now with science.\\""},{"Title":"Right use of will: Healing and evolving the emotional body","review":"I recorded this book in my own voice and listened to the tapes as to free my perceptions for full sensory experience. This book has been semi-private, word of mouth, etc etc...for some time. This is the most public I have seen it available. 14 years ago that would have excited me. Today as I saw this pop up on the screen, well there are not words to accurretly describe my response. What I want to say is what I wish had been made clear to me before I picked up this book for the first time. I was seeking to understand my emotional self so that I could better control and understand my life.Read the Introduction first. Be honest with yourself. Breath. If this book is not for you. Put the book down. And walk away while you can."},{"Title":"Right use of will: Healing and evolving the emotional body","review":"I am now reading Right Use of the Will for the third time. This book (and the others in this series) are on the same level as Conversations with God, and A Course in Miracles.

I give it 4 stars because Bavinck is both thorough in his handling of the material, well-organized (the material is laid out within an outline format) and of course thoroughly scriptural.As negatives go, Bavinck often quotes writers and theologians who are obscure today, as if the reader had a good, workable knowledge of their material. This can often leave the reader bewildered as to the argument the quoted writer was making, with no opportunity to read the original materials.Bavinck breaks down the Doctrine of God into 7 categories: God's Incomprehensibility, God's Knowability, God's Names, God's Incommunicable Attributes, God's Communicable Attributes, The Holy Trinity, and God's Counsel. Each of these of course is further subdivided in a logical format. Note that in the Dutch original, God's Names came after God's Incommunicable Attributes, and the editor does not give any rational for the change.The last chapter on God's Counsel is the real gem of this work, and Bavinck's treatment of election is a gripping read, demonstrating God's love and forethought of His creatures. His treatment of the supra/infra-lapsarian debate should also be consulted by any who wish to avoid these errors.The hardback itself is of good quality and mine has held up well over its first reading, although it is rather unremarkable (in fact it looks almost identical to Berkhof's Systematic Theology also published by Banner of Truth)."},{"Title":"The doctrine of God (Twin brooks series)","review":"This book was required reading for me during a course on Systematic Theology at Reformed Theological Seminary.At the time, I was unfamiliar with Bavinck's work and thought, but have since come to appreciate and value his perspective and ministry. Bavinck (b. 1854; d. 1921) was a Dutch Reformed theologian, churchman, and statesman. He was first appointed as Professor of Dogmatics at Kampen Theological Seminary (where he began his studies) and eventually succeeded Abraham Kuyper as Professor of Theology at the Free University in Amsterdam.In The Doctrine of God, Bavinck engages this foundational aspect of Christian theology by devoting his chapters to (I) God's Incomprehensibility, (II) God's Knowability, (III) God's names, (IV) God's Incommunicable Attributes, (V) God's Communicable Attributes, (VI) The Holy Trinity, and finally to (VII) God's Counsel.His treatment of \\"The Holy Trinity\\" is worth the price of the book.If you are new to Bavinck, this is a great introduction to an important theologian. If you are a serious student of Reformed theology, this is an essential volume."},{"Title":"The doctrine of God (Twin brooks series)","review":"No theological library can afford the lacuna that would be without this volume! While one may (rightfully) opt to purchase the four volume edition of Bavinck's work, this is still the translation to always have at your elbow. All major discussions of theology are explored and opened up for the serious reader.Of particular interest is the perennial debate of supralapsarian and infralapsarian interpretations. Bavinck is without equal in both explanation and resolution.Bavinck is Reformed, yet those of other theological persuasions will find this volume to be one of the most sound orthodox books in print."},{"Title":"TAE KWON DO MAN ON BUILDING SELF CONFIDENCE","review":"Master Rory Kyle has done a wonderful job in appealing to multiple audiences the benefits that instilling self confidence into others not only benefits the individual but the rest of the community.This book chronicles the journey that one shy young man takes as he moves from the ages of 12 to 18. As the main character Joey moves through these years, his development into a man of character is defined by his participation in Tae Kwon Do. Mater Kyle shows how each small accomplishment leads to the next and how each contributes toward a larger goal (in this case the desire to get a black belt).What most do not understand, and is also true with the main character at the beginning, is how these small successes also shape each individual into a mature confident person who is able to confidently make live their lives making decisions with purpose instead of fear.I believe that this book can be used as tool to not only showcase the benefits of the martial arts but as a way to approach life.A beneficial read for teens, parents, teachers and martial arts instructors."},{"Title":"TAE KWON DO MAN ON BUILDING SELF CONFIDENCE","review":"Tae Kwon Do Man takes an extraodinary look at some of life's high's and low's and is clearly written to inspire those children - and adults - that lack self-confidence, self-esteem and other skills important to becoming successful in life.I encourage all parents who would like their children seek improvement in the life skills to get this book and read it."},{"Title":"TAE KWON DO MAN ON BUILDING SELF CONFIDENCE","review":"If you are looking for an alternative to classical ballet lessons, Tae Kwon Do is an excellent choice to improve self-confidence, flexibility, balance and muscle tone.Through the story of young Joey, one is treated with a realistic portrayal of what one can expect when considering and attending Tae Kwon Do classes. From the process of searching for a compatible teacher and the first day of class to Joey's earning of his black belt, the details given are typical of a martial arts student. This is invaluable to those thinking about joining a martial arts class, either for one's children or for oneself.As Joey meets the challenges of adolescent social and academic trials, his experiences in learning to discipline his body and mind during Tae Kwon Do classes enable him to visualize and incorporate non-violent options to these trials. Successes in putting these options in to practice increase his self-confidence and encourage him to try new activities.This tale is a great look inside the martial arts classroom and how it can increase self-confidence.To read more about the author's views, you can go to his website [...]"},{"Title":"TAE KWON DO MAN ON BUILDING SELF CONFIDENCE","review":"This easy to read book not only makes a good instructional guide to finding a suitable martial arts school but gives a detailed personal account of increased self confidence and growth as shown through \\"Joey\\" and the other characters.

Joey and Alex display traits of people we want our children to be like and how that can be achieved. Tae Kwon Do Man is written for the adolescent but should be considered a primer for parents raising pre-teens. The intrigue of self reliance and soul recognition becomes paramount to shy Joey's development. Alex's natural athletic talent lends to the sometimes grueling pace which in turn culminates in their self actualization.There are heroes thru-out this book that are respected for their daily strength to endure and not take life for granted. Young people today as always need to experience examples of altruistic confidence. Tae Kwon Do Man is a perfect vehicle for them. I would recommend this book find its way to be required reading for all 5th grade classes.Rory Kyle is a 5th degree black belt Tae Kwon Do Master. He ran his own Martial Arts school in TX. for over 15 years and promoted over 100 students to the level of Black Belt."},{"Title":"TAE KWON DO MAN ON BUILDING SELF CONFIDENCE","review":"I found this to be an inspiring story and one that dispelled a lot of myths about martial arts.It is very easy to read and to associate with the main character, \\"Joey\\". Everyone has feelings of low self esteem some time in their life. This story shows how one very shy boy, along with the help of caring family and friends, overcomes his self doubt and finds it within himself to achieve his goal. He becomes a confident and self assured young man through the lessons he learned from Tae Kwon Do.I would highly recommend this book to anyone in the same situation, or anyone curious about learning more about martial arts and the positive effects it can have on your life."},{"Title":"TAE KWON DO MAN ON BUILDING SELF CONFIDENCE","review":"I first met Rory Kyle in 1976 at Valparaiso University and since I have not met a more disciplined or compassionate person. Rory as a young man was extremely confident and sure of himself. He left school, entered a prestigious accounting firm and had a stellar career there. A few years later he left to devote himself to his discipline. Tae Kwon Do.Rory has the ability to master anything that he focuses on, his latest effort in writing this book is no exception. Bringing to the market a fictional story (perhaps loosely related to his personnel experiences?) is no exception. Rory brings to these pages the anxiety of parents who want their child to be happier, the confusion of childhood, as well as the pleasure of finding something to which you belong, and in time become part of.Reading this book as a novel is a mistake, this is more of a life reference as to how to approach challenges and in turn conquer. If you are a parent with concerns your child that may be a bit awkward or shy, and you need a place to turn, this book will help you direct your childs energies, whether towards Tae Kwon Do or other programs, and become part of something."},{"Title":"TAE KWON DO MAN ON BUILDING SELF CONFIDENCE","review":"I found Tae Kwon Do Man to be inspiring and very challenging, especially for young and old having low self esteem or just not much self confidence. Master Rory writes an easy to understand story of how the mind and body work together to develop a whole person. Master Rory shows that Joey's parents, instructor, best friend and girlfriend are all part of his life long maturation process. As a retired teacher and coach, I can think of several students that would have benefited from reading about Joey's life experiences. I have never taken Tae Kwon Do, but see its merits and benefits from this book. I highly recommend this book to adolescents and parents alike."},{"Title":"TAE KWON DO MAN ON BUILDING SELF CONFIDENCE","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book from Master Kyle.

It tells how an individual can overcome the feeling of low self worth and completely turn his or her life around through participation in a well structured martial arts program and under an instuctor whose main focus is to instill in each student the \\"I can\\" type of mentality and approach to life. Under the guidance and tutelage of his instructor, affectionately know as Tae Kwon Do Man, Joey Bergman transformed from a shy, introverted twelve year old into a confident, athletic young man ready to take on life's challenges as an adult. Such a program, as illustrated so effectively in this book, should allow people to realize there is a solution to improving one's self confidence which parents, for their children, and adults, for either themselves or others that they know, up until now they may not have considered. I highly recommend that this book be shared and read by both children and adults of all ages."},{"Title":"TAE KWON DO MAN ON BUILDING SELF CONFIDENCE","review":"Many young people have difficulty with self-esteem and self-confidence during their early years. Getting involved in any challenging activity where there is the potential for growth and maturation proves to be very helpful in building self-confidence. The martial arts program is one way that students get to know and identify with a positive role model--their instructor. Master Rory writes about how a good instructor can use a small class/high attention environment to train, motivate, and encourage growth in the students. The fictional instructor showed Joey how the mind and body work together to make a whole person. Good manners, punctuality, respect for other people, and working hard in school are just some of the valuable lessons emphasized in this book. These are life-long attributes and character building qualities that make Tae Kwon Do Man excellent reading and interesting."},{"Title":"TAE KWON DO MAN ON BUILDING SELF CONFIDENCE","review":"The characters in this book are both real and easy to identify with. Most people have gone through an awkward stage in their lives--some early, some later in life.

I purchased this book with high hopes, given the reputation of the authors, and am sorely disappointed at the very outdated, generation-specific information presented. Some information on human development never changes, of course, but the book doesn't stick with this timeless material. When it comes to emotional development, the children reviewed for this study (1950s through 1970s, if I understand it correctly) were simply not facing the same circumstances that children of our decade have to contend with. For example, &quot;Boys ... may love bright plaid shirts or like to concentrante their new love of color and daring in a tie.&quot; Um, not any of the twelve-year old boys I know. Even the &quot;good&quot; ones want to wear black. Peer pressure.Do not buy this book if you hope to gain insight into your children if they are at all engaged with the world as it is today.

The issues faced by our children, ranging from AIDS to the technology with which they interact, to terrorism, are drastically different.Second, and perhaps even more importantly, the authors used what I consider to be questionable methodology for writing the book. It is based almost entirely on interviews and surveys of parents and children. It then comes up with global conclusions (\\"Your ten-year-old will feel . . . \\") based on the responses they received. Even if this were a reasonable method of telling me what my 10-year-old will be like -- which I doubt -- the fact that it is based on very old data renders it pretty much meaningless in 2007.Furthermore, I am not sure how you \\"distill\\" all children into such formulaic conclusions. They do distinguish that \\"X% said this and Y% said that\\" in some categories, but this means nothing 30 years later. More of it tells you how clean \\"your 10\\" will be, how s/he will perceive parents, etc., lumping everyone together. Not realistic.So, if you are seeking a relevant, timely, resource regarding pre-teen development and expectations, this is not it. If you want a survey on how parents and tweens perceived things 30 years ago, then that is fine."},{"Title":"200 Difficult Sudoku Puzzles","review":"This book contains a LOT of puzzles, and instead of half of them being easy or medium, they are all difficult.

Within this context, he proposes that the only source of our problems is an unpeaceful mind, and that, with a peaceful mind, we can stay content no matter what circumstances life brings our way. The main part of this book loosely follows the chapter on the perfection of patience in the poem \\"Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life\\" by the great Indian Buddhist master Shantideva.The essence of this book's advice is encapsulated for me in the following excerpt:\\"Just as there is room in the sky for a thunderstorm, so there is room in the vast space of our mind for a few painful feelings. And just as a storm has no power to destroy the sky, unpleasant feelings have no power to destroy our mind. When painful feelings arise in our mind, there is no need to panic -- we can patiently accept them, experience them, and investigate their nature and where they come from. When we do this, we will discover that painful feelings do not come from outside but arise from within our own mind.\\"In my mind's eye, I return to this passage whenever I notice my mind starting to \\"panic\\" and feel like my unpleasant feelings are going to overwhelm me. This book never fails to help quell the storm."},{"Title":"How to Solve Our Human Problems: The Four Noble Truths","review":"This book was given to me several years ago and I have lent it to so many people that I felt I needed another copy.

I am an angry, broken, jaded, disillusioned single parent of a 5 year old, and this book has been the greatest gift I've ever given to myself. It has helped me get over the daily small stuff, and calmed my raging, self-destructive thought processes through the big stuff. There is nothing abstract or even difficult about the teachings. It's amazing to me that I had to read this to understand the faults and process of anger- it seems as though it should be innate common knowledge.

Happy travels..............."},{"Title":"How to Solve Our Human Problems: The Four Noble Truths","review":"How to Solve Our Human Problems by Geshe Kelsang Gyatso is a remarkable book that sheds light on how we can change mankind by first changing ourselves. Gyatso explains that we can improve, \\"our human nature and qualities through developing the capacity of our mind.\\" We are to realize the far reaching effects of suffering on our future lives, abandon the delusions that so often cloud our mind, strive to attain permanent freedom from suffering, and practice moral discipline. All Dharma, or teachings of Buddha, is included in these four noble truths, directly or indirectly. As we learn to have a positive mind and rise above our self-cherishing and self-grasping, we can find inner peace and accomplish the real meaning of human life.This book was enjoyable to read. It caused me to think about why I do the things that I do. It uncovered my flaw in thinking others to be the cause of my pain, anger, or suffering. I believe we all struggle with this at times. Just as the director of an orchestra oversees the balance of all the different instruments, so we are the directors of our lives, and we are responsible for the balance of the many things competing for our attention. I have learned that I am responsible for how I act in and balance my life. I cannot blame others for breaks in my inner peace. This is only one of multiple reasons for enjoying this book.I do not believe all the things that Buddha taught, but I do have the utmost respect for all that he taught and for anyone who faithfully lives by the Dharma. I still have a very elementary knowledge of what Buddha taught, but I am grateful for what I do know at this point. There is much truth to be found in Buddha's teaching, and I believe that anyone who faithfully applies this truth will see their lives blessed. Geshe Kelsang Gyatso states at the end of his book that he truly desires that \\"compassion and wisdom develop and increase for everyone.\\" I truly feel that his desire can be realized to the extent that each person who reads will realize the virtues herein contained."},{"Title":"How to Solve Our Human Problems: The Four Noble Truths","review":"How to Solve Our Human Problems is one of those books that is amazing to stumble across. One day, even though I did not think I was angry about anything, I read this book with close attention - not like a novel. Then I recognized that maybe my unhappy day had something to do with what I was thinking about - what someone else had done to me. Then I tried some of the suggestions in the book. And guess what? Not only did it make perfect sense, but I began to see a difference in how I felt. I got quick relief from my uncomfortable mind. And isn't that what we all want anyway? If happiness and unhappiness both come from my mind - not from what someone else said or did, why not attempt to change my mind? Reading this book and trying some of the methods presented in it has changed my life for the better. Because of that, this book is priceless."},{"Title":"How to Solve Our Human Problems: The Four Noble Truths","review":"I am sort of confused by the title \\"How to Solve Our Human Problems\\" when it only really discusses one problem: anger. I will admit that anger is probably the biggest of all human problems Geshe does a wonderful job explaining to you why its such a problem. This title lead me to believe there was more than one problem discussed in this book. I guess the so called four noble truths Desire, Suffering, Origins and Cessations could be called human problems but these are supposed to be noble truths not human problems? Putting the confusion aside I took this as a book on anger management and I was pleasantly surprised.Anger is your enemy, it deludes you, it undoes years of spiritual enlightenment, it creates bad karma, its useless, it takes the most beautiful thing and makes it ugly. Once you understand that you can live a life without anger then you can work towards ridding anger from your life and one way of doing that is to patiently accept your suffering and do not retaliate. One of the easiest ways to create bad karma and bring just suffering on yourself is to act out of anger. Geshe has a chapter on meditation and prayers to help you deal with your anger. He also gives you techniques for rationalizing it away when it arises.Geshe explains karma from a Buddhist perspective for all suffering is justified for its just your bad actions repaying you in kind. Even a child who is born with great suffering probably bought that suffering on themselves in a past life and they are paying for in this life for we don't die we are just reincarnated. You do something bad in this life and you will pay for it another therefore, everyone gets what they deserve. The meaning of life is to achieve a life devoid of suffering and you do that by understanding that good actions bring good karma and bad actions bring bad karma."},{"Title":"How to Solve Our Human Problems: The Four Noble Truths","review":"A PBS television show on the life of Buddha was shown first.

I would recommend reading this before \\"Introduction to Buddhism\\". Also, \\"Transform Your Life\\" is a good first read. Hope this helps!"},{"Title":"How to Solve Our Human Problems: The Four Noble Truths","review":"After reading so many favorable reviews, I was excited to dive into this book. Now that I've read it, however, I wish I hadn't spent the time doing so.Book reviews are largely matters of perspective and personal taste, and I am so glad that this book has impacted so many people in a positive way. But for me, this was not an inspiring or even helpful treatment on the subject of anger. I found much more practical, compassionate, relevant advice in Pema Ch&ouml;dr&ouml;n's \\"When Things Fall Apart\\", which I just recently reread. While Ch&ouml;dr&ouml;n's prose encourages me to really stop and ponder the nature of reality and our consciousness, Gyatso's work left me feeling underwhelmed. It feels shallow, flat, and preachy.In the second appendix, he tells a story of how, after his mother died, he \\"prayed every day for her to be reborn in England, where [he] was living, so that [he] would have the opportunity to meet and recognize her reincarnation.\\" I read this and could only think, why? Why not live and let live, and let your mother work out her karma and follow her own path as she sees fit, instead of clinging to the ghosts of your personal life story? What if England wasn't quite the right place for her? Why would you pray for something so specific and weird? I obviously don't understand something here, and that's okay. But a guy who tells a story like that, but who then also discourages \\"self-grasping\\", just seems like an unreliable source for the fundamentals of this kind of teaching.So again, it's a matter of personal taste. In addition to Ch&ouml;dr&ouml;n's works, I've also really enjoyed books by Lama Surya Das. \\"Who Ordered this Truckload of Dung?\\" by Ajahn Brahm is one of my all-time favorite reads. But this book by Gyatso just didn't do it for me. Even though it's a short book, it felt uninspired and therefore tedious. I'm left feeling rather sorry for the author."},{"Title":"How to Solve Our Human Problems: The Four Noble Truths","review":"This little book, a brief 171 pages, lives up to its title \\"How to Solve Our Human Problems\\", and is a good guide for anyone wishing to see how real life situations pertain to the spiritual path, specifically the Buddhist way of The Four Noble Truths. As with all of Geshe Kelsang Gyatso's writings, the text is clear and consise and easy to digest and then put into practice. The examples given in the book are practical and help provide a better understanding of how to handle common situations, especially problems of anger and suffering, and then learning how not to retaliate (even though we may have an initial knee-jerk tendency to do so). Recommended both as an introductory guide and a reference tool to refer back to over and over to enhance learning and practice of patience when encountering anger and suffering. All in all, a very good, practical toolkit for life experiences."},{"Title":"How to Solve Our Human Problems: The Four Noble Truths","review":"This is a great book for anyone dealing with anger or negativity. Geshe Kelsang Gyatso has a really nice way of dissipating anger and negativity in his writing and choice of words. There's a peacefulness that comes through the pages. He talks about cultivating patience and not having to retaliate, and the source of the negativity. Other writings on the subject seem careless and superficial in comparison. He gets right to the root of it, and in a way that makes you feel positive and peaceful."},{"Title":"How to Solve Our Human Problems: The Four Noble Truths","review":"Do not think for a second that the author of this book actually wrote it without help. He can barely speak English. His \\"translators\\" are not credited, but they are there, making sense out of the original broken-English, which was delivered at one of the author's countless and expensive festivals.This book is yet another rehash of the author's previous books (i.e.: Transform Your Live, Introduction to Buddhism, New Meditation Handbook, etc.). There is considerable overlap with the others mentioned, with only some limited \\"new\\" material thrown into the mix. If you've read one book by Gyatso, you've read them all. With all of this repetition, it would appear Gyatso has little new to add to the Dharma with his ongoing and relentless recycling of the same thoughts. There is even an \\"English\\" version and an \\"American\\" version (this reviewed copy is the latter version). When I went to one their festivals, they insisted I buy it again to get a fuller understanding. Words like \\"bonnet\\" are replaced with \\"hat\\" ...are Gyatso and Tharpa kidding? Are Americans so stupid they need a \\"translated\\" version to understand what a bonnet is?Additionally, this book is quite preachy, starts way too many sentences with \\"You must...\\" (or words to that effect) and lacks a bibliography for support. If a narrow view of the Dharma is the goal, then trusting in this one author as the sole source of information might be fine. Many seem to be happy with going this route, but a subject is deep as Buddhism is not well served this way.Take note: This author is the same personification of rigidity who claims in his New Meditation Handbook that swatting a mosquito in anger will result in eons in the hell realm ...and he is serious... it is not meant to be parable. Therefore, you have to take everything this so-called religious leader says with a grain of salt (or risk being as inflexible as he is). Apparently the author does not understand the concept of purification.Look at the otherwise across-the-board 5-star reviews, which all say the same things and use the same words. The Buddha said to use your wisdom. Does that mean almost cult-like fervor for the author? Gaysto calls himself a Geshe; however, he refused to take the Geshe test when offered. Would you buy a self-help medical book from a self-proclaimed \\"doctor\\" without a medical diploma? Of course not; so why buy this? Gyatso refused the Geshe test and is not a Geshe, the end, amen. He is no more an authority on this subject than any other lay person.Readers genuinely interested in Buddhism should seek out mainstream authors such as His Holiness The Dalai Lama and his excellent book The Four Noble Truths (also available from Amazon), which unlike Gyato's carbon copy books, really addresses the topic.POSTSCRIPT:I bought this book by Gyatso (and many others) when into the New Kadampa Tradition. After April 22, 2008 (Google the date and the Dalai Lama), I came to realize the true nature of NKT and walked away from it.UPDATE:I walked away without anger or a \\"vituperpous, personal gripe against NKT\\" as the commentator who stalks my reviews pointed out. That said, domino113 (nee: K. LEWIS) apparantly has a vituperpous, personal gripe against Charles A. Miller. After throwing the kitchen sink of names at me in commentaries for my reviews, perhaps it's time YOU look in the mirror and ask yourself who is really the angry person here. Perhaps YOU should seek out professional anger-management therapy as your sprituality does not appear to be helping you with your on-going rage issues. These \\"anger\\" comments (based on nothing) only serve to prove my point. In turn, and I don't know how to emphasize this enough, they literally inspire me to write more reviews. As always (from the followers to the very top), no one in this organization practices what they preach."},{"Title":"How to Solve Our Human Problems: The Four Noble Truths","review":"The book is really divided into two sections, one which illustrates the central points of Buddha's teachings, highlighting that the source of all human suffering is really all in our minds. That it is our perspective on a person or event or thing, the 'broken car', the 'enemy' at work, that often stops us from being happy.The second part of the book contains advice on anger, and how to cultivate patience. The central argument he puts forward is that anger is a destructive mind, which causes pain to ourselves and to others. And that in the grip of anger, people behave in the most unskillful and even dangerous ways. In the West we feel anger is a good thing, active, 'getting things out in the open' as it were, instead of 'repressing.' what it most often does, however, is makes the whole situation worse, because we are letting our often deluded mind, clouded by anger and disappointment, call the shots. Think of Basil Fawlty in Fawlty Towers-his constant anger drove people away, and only made his daily life more and more complicated! I kept thinking of the scene where he gets so angry at his car he says, \\"right, i'll show you,\\" and begins to beat it with a huge tree branch while he tells it all the things that he has always hated about it.We may not use the tree branch with our loved ones, but verbal lashing out can be even more damaging-we can easily get a new car, but a new friend, partner, child?As Geshe Kelsang Gyatso says, a patient mind is able to step back from the situation to see how best to deal with it without flying off the handle and causing one to do or say something they will definitely regret. Arguments with loved ones, for example, are supposed to restore harmony and peace, but how often do they really? A whole chapter on reasons not to retaliate is super as well.This is a very basic book for people interested in learning more about Buddhism, but the ideas for managing anger and cultivating patience in order to keep control of even the most difficult situations is one which any reader can benefit from."},{"Title":"How to Solve Our Human Problems: The Four Noble Truths","review":"I read this book over one of my summer reprieves. I must say in all honesty, this was a much better investment of my time than The Da Vinci Code.This book penetrates and exposes the subtle processes in your mind that lead you to suffering over and over. Geshe Kelsang brings Buddhist teachings into our lives for their very intended purpose: easing our suffering and pointing us to the path of liberation. If you believe Buddhist teachings are simply of an intellectual or mystical nature, this book will show you that they are intended to be applied to your everyday life. This is the only way in which they are of any benefit, and Geshe Kelsang expresses this point perfectly.Awesome."},{"Title":"How to Solve Our Human Problems: The Four Noble Truths","review":"The instructions Geshe Kelsang Gyatso explains in his book \\"How to Solve your Human Problems\\" are very insightful and applicable to people in the Western world living busy lives. Geshe Kelsang explains how happiness and suffering are states of mind. Because this is true, if we learn how to control our minds, then we can learn how to experience deep happiness and inner peace even in the face of very difficult circumstances. This is the first book I have ever seen that distills down the teachings of Buddha to their very essence and explains them in a way that is easily understandable for both a beginner embarking on their spiritual journey, and the advanced meditator who has years of experience under their belt. I recommend this book to anyone who has a genuine interest in improving their lives and being of benefit to others."},{"Title":"How to Solve Our Human Problems: The Four Noble Truths","review":"This latest book from Geshe Kelsang Gyatso gives practical advice on using Dharma to solve our daily problems. Just reading a few pages gives one much to think about. It contains the essence of many of Buddha's most profound teachings, but in a clear, simple format. For complete details about each of the concepts woven together here, you would want to read Geshe Kelsang's other books such as Joyful Path of Good Fortune. If you are a beginner, its a great \\"first taste\\" that will whet your appetite for Dharma. If you are an experienced student, I think you will be delighted by the way the teachings are freshly elucidated. I really enjoy this book, and return to it often."},{"Title":"How to Solve Our Human Problems: The Four Noble Truths","review":"I liked this book. I found it informative and educational. I was a little sceptical at first. Not being what I call a religious person I was concerned that this might be an attempt to get me to subscribe to a particular religious cult. Howevever, the book goes beyond religion and tries to help you understand what your mind is doing (and doing to you).I have \\"allowed\\" other peoples actions to cause great internal stress to me, which has played havoc with my mental and physical health and had a detrimental affect on my family. This book has allowed me to take a truly different perspective on what MY MIND is doing to me, and allows me to recognize a truth that other peoples actions only hurt me when I let them. As stupid as that sounds, I never looked at it that way before as I was too caught up in the hateful internal thoughts that would arise in my mind because of how I saw other peoples actions.I wholeheartedly recommend this book to those people who are angry and stressed-out about \\"other people\\", be it a lousy boss, partner, co-worker, friend or family member etc. If you sit and stew, and seeth and make yourself (and others) miserable because of what others say/do then this book can help you make much much better choices.Make no mistake, it's not an aspirin: it does not fix \\"other people\\". But what it does is allow you to look at your response to ALL stressful events and shows you why it happens and what you can do to stop it.It's helped me. And that was not an easy thing to do. I still have a long way to go, but for the first time in my life I can now see when my own mind is trying to make me suffer. I personally am struggling with this, but that in itself is a real breakthrough. Before, I just used to go down the path of misery without hesitation; becoming angry, hurtful, hateful and full of terrible emotions and thoughts at sometimes tricial things (casual comments from others - sometimes not even directed at me). Now I can see that start and I put the brakes on. Believe me, that alone helps. I hope that with practice I can stop the negative process even starting (it still does as of now), but I'll gladly settle for my new perspective over what I used to do.Easily the best book I have read, quite possible EVER. Buy it. Read it. Give it to someone you care deeply about.WiZ"},{"Title":"How to Solve Our Human Problems: The Four Noble Truths","review":"The title says it all.

I started reading this book to understand the philosophy behind Anger, and How to control it, which this book explains in a very fundamental way. I got glued to the way the concept of Patience, Jealousy and Retaliation has been talked about in this book, and How to Control them? The style of asking Rhetorical questions followed by answers is a great way to explain the concepts; we normally ask such questions to ourselves in our daily routine. This book is a must read for anyone over 30 Years, who wants to improve themselves and understand their behavior better. There are certain philosophies, like rebirth into lower being and good karma bad karma, which many may not agree with and deem impractical. Leaving those aside, you can get many great things explained in this book. I started practicing the Patience; immediately after I read this book.

It's a collection of four transcribed interviews of middle-aged Japanese people who live in the Hanshin area of Japan (near Osaka). The interviews aren't the type we're used to, with questions and answers, but are rather the summaries of several interviews collected into a sort of biography of each interviewee. The book is split into four sections, with each section granted to each interviewee, and the author of the book then compares each interview to the maturing process described in one of four widely-read Japanese novels, so the reader gets an idea not just of the specifics of one person's life but also of the general ideas that surround the central forces and meanings of the interviewee's life. For instance, one of the interviewees is a female producer for a Japanese network station. Her interview is compared with a popular Japanese novel called _A Man in Ecstacy_ which is about a woman who must put aside her career to care for her senile father-in-law.The book is well-written and interesting and would make a good supplement for anyone studying the anthropology of Japan."},{"Title":"Cultural Anthropology","review":"When dealing with textbooks, you eventually realize that every textbook has its advantages and disadvantages. \\"Cultural Anthropology\\" by Kottak is no different. The book has some fundamental flaws that warrant discussion. First, I think the book would benefit if it included an early chapter that introduced students to various anthropological theories. Since many anthropology texts fail to do this, I can't hold too much against Kottak for this negligence. Most sociology textbooks incorporate a chapter introducing students to Functionalist, Conflict, and Symbolic Interaction theoretical frameworks, and I believe anthropology books should follow suit.My second problem with the book is that Kottak, at times, provides questionable definitions for various terms and concepts. For example, in Chapter 6 he defines a \\"race\\" as \\"an ethnic group that is assumed to have a biological basis.\\" This is a fundamentally flawed definition. The fact that definitions of race are socio-cultural categories notwithstanding, most Americans would consider African-Americans, the Dinka, and the Igbo to be three separate ethnic groups but all members of the same race. The same can be said of Italian-Americans, Russians, and the Amish. Kottak's definition implies that \\"race\\" and \\"ethnicity\\" are essentially the same phenomenoa, when in actuality they are two totally distinct concepts. His sloppy, simplistic definitions have a potential to confuse non-anthropology students.My other critique with Kottak is that, at times, he offers ridiculous and overly-simplistic culturalist explanations. For example, Kottak points out that Germany has numerous high-quality female Olympic swimmers, while Brazil lacks high-caliber women swimmers. What accounts for this difference? According to Kottak, the answer is different standards of sex appeal and constructions of female beauty in the two societies. In Germany, women with hard and sculpted bodies are considered sexy, while Brazilians value the \\"natural beauty\\" of women, especially the \\"ghetto booty.\\" What a joke! How would Kottak account for the fact that Brazil sends a quality women's volleyball team to the Olympics - a team stocked with 6'0\\" women with rock solid abs and muscular, toned frames?On the plus side, students find Kottak easy to read, and for the most part, easy to comprehend. Each chapter has a set of discussion questions to facilitate in-class discussions of the material at hand. The instructor's edition comes with an outstanding test/quiz component for each chapter. Also, Kottak does offer many cross-cultural examples and case studies to support his ideas.While far from perfect, \\"Cultural Anthropology\\" is a recommended textbook for intro-level anthropology courses - especially those that project a large enrollment of freshmen."},{"Title":"Cultural Anthropology","review":"Awesome book and great content to use in a college level classroom, great for training missionaries that will work overseas."},{"Title":"Cultural Anthropology","review":"Just the way it was described-was a little late on the shipping [1 day] but it didn't affect the product in any way.

The plot, such as it is, involves an FBI agent who, while investigating illegal trafficking in a special kind of gun, stumbles upon a group of scientists working on a publicly-funded project thought to have been a money sink, but which has actually succeeded beyond the wildest dreams. The scientists have to get rid of the FBI agent, but they can't quite bring themselves to kill him, so they copy his mind and put him in their electronic universe -- which is kind of like the Matrix (from the movie), though without any of the bells and whistles. Instead of Agents (the computer programs in &quot;The Matrix&quot;) to torment our hero, however, there's the main computer scientists, who is a megalomaniac with the power to alter the computer environment as he sees fit. Yikes!Platt pushes the science and technology reasonably far, but the concept still seems a little unbelievable. Happily, that doesn't detract from the novel, which I finished in basically one sitting."},{"Title":"The Silicon Man (Cortext.)","review":"I had an uneasy feeling about this book when I read the introduction. This book (published here in 1997) is part of a series of Wired Books (from Wired Magazine) that changed the world. That's a tall order. The other books in the series have the same self-inflated sense of self worth. (The other books aren't so bad, it's just that they aren't exactly Nobel Prize level fiction.) But the thing that made me feel uneasy is that compared to the other books which are slightly better known, the author is also a contributor to Wired magazine, which smells just a bit incestuous.As for the book itself, it has it's moments. For a 1991 work of fiction some of the ideas were pretty good at the time (but now dated.) Platt, the author, has thought a lot about the details of how to upload a mind into a computer, and some of the moral and philosophical implications of it. The end was an interesting twist, which was good to see. But I really had a bit of an issue with the writing style itself. It just wasn't so dynamic. It read more like a perfect textbook example of how to write a novel. Some pieces of the plot seemed somewhat a little to convenient. Characters were introduced the same way each time and after a while a few of them were a little two dimensional for my liking. The character I like the most was Dr Gottbaum's daughter Yumi, but she only figures in part of the book. But we never really get into some of the motivations, side thoughts or neuroses of some of the characters (but it's all we see of the others.)I picked up the book in a discount bin at a discount book store, so I thought it was okay for what I paid for it. And I'm a sucker for a shiny cover."},{"Title":"The Silicon Man (Cortext.)","review":"This is a wonderful book in my opinion, and it really gave me the chills. We have a long way to go before reaching the stage predicted by Charles Platt, but he writes a truly believeable story about a chilling and profoundly disturbing future. Also, I have never been more scared when reading a murder scene! I only wish that Wired Books will continue with these series, White Light is also excellent, and I would never have found these gems had they not been published anew by this company. The cover design and overall design of the books is excellent too! Two thumbs up for both Charles Platt and Wired Books!"},{"Title":"The Silicon Man (Cortext.)","review":"The basic plot here is that a somewhat shady research group has been illicitly using government grants and black-market trading to finance the development of a project that will provide them with electronic immortality - their brains will be scanned into an online computer system where they can live forever. The black market dealings attract the attention of an FBI agent, and since he is about to blow their cover, the mad scientists kidnap him and use him as their first \\"test subject\\". Of course, the process of scanning the brains also destroys the brain tissue, so his physical body is killed in the process. The bulk of the book focuses on the agent's struggle to adapt to his new existence and keep the mad scientists from destroying him, and on his wife's struggle to find out what happened to him -- with some help from the mad scientist's daughter. A little simplified, of course, but this is the jist of it.I probably would have enjoyed this book more had I not previously read another that did a far better job with the same topic - John Saul's 'Shadows'. In that book, the mad scientists in question are using the brains of genius but troubled children - creating a much more intriguing perspective on the events. 'Shadows' also does a better job with character development and providing a three-dimensional backstory."},{"Title":"The Silicon Man (Cortext.)","review":"and they will be hooked.

Our group had a great time looking at the absurdities the book raises about human intelligence, politics, and control over events in our lives.

This book so full of creativity is a phenomenon, this book flies &quot;like bricks don't&quot; as Dougkas Adams has been known to say. Such wit and of course the very English sarcasm.The story of Arthur Dent a rather pathetic figure whose house is about to be bulldozed to make way for a new highway bypass and is then rescued by his friend Ford Prefect (named after a car) and then attempts to halt the destruction by lying in the squelching mud in front of the bulldozers, is helped all the way by the bumbling foreman Mr Prosser who is, remarkably enough, a long distant descendant of Ghengis Khan and has a prediliction for litte furry hats and axes over his doorway, although the bravery of the great Khan has not been transmitted. This is how the story starts instantly enveloping the reader in a world of comedic joy with amazing creativity without becoming weak or slapstick in any way. The characters involved vary from the aforementioned Arthur, to Ford Prefect, Zaphod Beeblebrox, the erstwhile president of the galaxy a position of no power at all, Marvin the paranoid android a product of the hopeless Sirius Cybernetics Corporation whose largest department, which occupies the major portion of an entire planet, is its complaints division, the Vogons who like to spout shockingly bad poetry (the 3rd worst in existence) are callous and cruel and a host of other amazing creatures.Not only are the characters fascinating but the situations they get into are as well, eg the rescue of Arthur as Earth is being destroyed by the Vogons to make way for a new hyperspace bypass is miraculous because it happens as they are dumped unceremoniously by a Vogon guard through the airlock and wisked out of the vacuum by the Improbability drive ship stolen by Zaphod.Only an Englishman could come up with this sort of comedic treasure. Maybe something to do with the stiff upper lip and all that.A book read again and again and again and again ......"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"With a whole galaxy to choose from, 5 stars seems too limited!

Ford Perfect offers Arthur Dent the opportunity to come with him and be safe. Arthur has a hard time believing this but comes along. He discovers that Ford Perfect is an alien and a field researcher for the galactic travelogue &quot;The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.&quot; Things get really strange and hillarious from there!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"In The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Douglas Adams uses humor and sarcasm against a backdrop of science fiction to create a comic masterpiece. The main character in the book is Arthur Dent. He is miraculously rescued from Earth just moments before it is destroyed to make way for an interstellar bypass. His rescuer is Ford Prefect, a researcher for The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy who has been stranded on Earth for the past fifteen years. Unfortunately, the only ship available to escape on belongs to the Vogons who throw out the two hitchhikers when they discover them on the ship only after reciting horrible poetry to them. This should have been the end of these two adventurers, but by an amazingly improbable event, they are rescued by the starship Heart of Gold. This event was caused by the revolutionary propulsion system on the ship called the Infinite Improbability Drive, which makes the improbable probable. The occupants of the ship are Zaphod Beeblebrox, President of the Imperial Galactic Government who had recently stolen the Heart of Gold, Trillian, a woman originally from Earth and Zaphod's companion, and Marvin, an extremely intelligent and depressed robot. The party travels to the long lost planet of Magrathea where planets were once manufactured for the extremely wealthy. Zaphod believes that inside they will find countless riches, but are surprised to discover that it is still inhabited. Inside, Arthur discoveries many amazing things, such as the answer to life, the universe, and everything is forty-two, and the planet earth was manufactured as a computer to discover what the actual question to the answer is. The characters in the book are well developed. Arthur is the clueless one who is struggling to understand the events which have happened to him. Ford is the accomplished hitchhiker who answers Arthur's questions with responses which are so insane that they more often than not cause more confusion. Zaphod is a two-headed creature in search of adventure and Trillian is an intelligent and capable woman from earth. Through these characters, we learn to take ourselves a little less seriously. Although this book is full of humor, it also contains other aspects. It satirizes such subjects as capitalism, government, large corporations, organized religion, and militarism. The writing is full of irony and biting sarcasm as well. Adams' atheistic worldview is also displayed through his writing. I believe that Douglas Adams managed to write an excellent book which contains many strengths with very few weaknesses. This book is extremely funny and can be enjoyed as long as the reader is not expecting a serious sci-fi epic. The only possible weakness in the book is that the plot can become confusing at times. This, however, helps the reader relate to what Arthur is experiencing and eventually everything becomes clear if the reader pays attention. Overall, this is a fantastic book which is highly entertaining while still making some intelligent comments on life, the universe, and everything."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is the funniest book I have ever read in my entire life.This book contains some of the most entertaining dialogue and gags in a sci-fi book.

But a lot of weird coincidental things have happened in my life that has led on to both good and bad things to come. I have put some of these things into my own Sci-Fi Mystery Series, \\"Mammoth Towers Mysteries\\", because explaining them in real world terms didn't always make civilized sense.And that's what I got most out of Douglas Adams' words. In his willingness to be bigger than life with both his characters and plotting, he allows us to be smacked in the face by a subtext that mirrors our ridicules uncivilized real lives and not have our feelings hurt in the process, yet clears our thoughts and opens our minds to the probability of the truth that we are not really the highest form of life on this planet.At the time of my reading Adams' book I did not know a movie was in the works. But I do remember wondering how a film maker would turn this all into a Hollywood movie. After seeing the film, it improbability worked. And now as those images are beamed out into space, Douglas Adams will live on eternally in both space and Time as one of this galaxy's Infinite Improbability Driven Great Writers.

This isn't the end it is the beginning. Don't panic!It is science fiction as parody as science fiction. Although social commentary in science fiction is not new (indeed in my opinion one finds some of our best social critics to be writers of science fiction) Adams has a way of not only making it fun but creating one layer on top of another and the philosophies and barbs become as absurd as some of the polymorphous characters. The book presents a panorama of absurdity.This is book that could have only been written after the whiff of the 60s was still in the air but was not just for aging hippies. Some of it is indeed very silly and some of it bordering on the profound. Sometimes in reading this I was reminded of Lewis Carroll, not so much the Lewis Carroll of Alice in Wonderland but of Jabberwocky as the names and forms of some of the characters are very, well very \\"Jabberwocky\\" ( yes there is even a character in the book named \\"Zaphod Beeblebrox\\").Throughout Dent's travels, which read very much like comedy skits, the author sometimes steps back and explains bit of arcana of the universe which always has some sort of off beat dead pan joke behind it. When this book first came out I remember many of the catch phrases like \\"Don't panic\\" on everyone's lips.You will find Adams to be a great humorist. Even now as I refresh my memory by going over the book I read about 25 years ago I am laughing to myself. Adams is an original. At the time when I first read the book it sometimes seemed so breezy and its catch phrases so easily absorbed by the popular culture I wondered if it was just somewhat of a fad, something that struck a cord in a generation (and only for that generation). My doubts were unfounded.In my opinion the work has stood the test of time. It sounds like hyperbole but who knows it a hundred years this book might be considered a true classic."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Written by Douglas Adams, \\"The Hitch-Hikers Guide to the Galaxy\\" was first published in 1979 and is the first instalment of his legendary five-part trilogy. (Adams apparently attributed this to a poor grasp of arithmetic). The series started life as a radio show, before becoming a book, a television series, a play and a bath towel. After years of trying, it was finally adapted for the big screen in 2005. Douglas Adams was born in Cambridge in 1952 and died in May 2001, while working on the film's screenplay.Arthur Dent wakes up on a Thursday morning with a raging hangover. Having left London about three years before the book opens, he now lives in England's West Country. That, however, is about to change : the local council has decided to knock down his house to make way for a bypass. Although their plans had officially been place for around nine months, they had somehow 'forgotten' to mention it to Arthur until the previous day - hence, the raging hangover. In a very bad start to the day, his hangover is interrupted by a bulldozer trundling up the garden path.Things aren't about to get any better, either. Arthur's one-man protest is disturbed by Ford Prefect - a very good friend who drags him off to \\"The Horse and Groom\\", with the express intention of drinking several pints of bitter. The pair have been friends for around five or six years. So far as Arthur knows, Ford is an out-of-work actor from Guildford. In fact, he comes from a small planet near Betelgeuse, is a roving reporter from \\"The Hitch-Hikers Guide to the Galaxy\\" (imagine an interstellar Rough Guide) and has been marooned on Earth for about fifteen years. Unfortunately, it's come to his attention that the world is about to end : the Vogons, on behalf of the Galactic Hyperspace Planning Council, need to demolish Earth to make way for a hyperspace bypass. Fortunately, Ford has a way out and he plans to bring Arthur with him.After surviving the demolition and some Vogon poetry, the pair are picked up by Zaphod Beeblebrox - the two-headed, three-armed, renegade President of the Imperial Galactic Government and an old friend of Ford's. Beeblebrox has managed to 'acquire' a very stylish spaceship called 'The Heart of Gold' - a ship with a very improbable fuel source. The ship's crew is completed by Trillian, a human female, and Marvin, a paranoid android.This is an exceptionally enjoyable, extremely funny and very easily read book - Terry Pratchett fans, in particular, should enjoy this."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Imagine that one day you wake up hung over from the night before and learn the earth, the earth you've lived on for all of your life, is going to be demolished to make way for a new hyperspatial express route for traveling throughout the galaxy.

Along with other characters, Arthur travels, or hitchhikes rather, around the galaxy and encounters numerous obstacles along the way. Most importantly though, not without knowledge from the revised version of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy to aide him.This book is an excellent read for anybody into science fiction, or even somebody who is not but enjoys humor, because this book is a wonderful, funny, quick read you will never want to put down.

This sets the stage for an exciting adventure on a galactic scale. It has a wide and diverse range of imaginative characters ranging from the clueless human Arthur Dent, to the sulking depressed android Marvin. Douglas Adams has a very peculiar style of humor that guarantees a laugh on every page. Science fiction fans that are not afraid to laugh at some common clich&eacute;s will enjoy this book as it takes plenty of jabs at popular Sci-Fi series such as Star Trek and Star Wars. The plot revolves around the misguided adventures of Arthur Dent, who has his house demolished, his planet blown up, and is cast out into deep space all on the same day. Then he takes off with the two-headed president of the galaxy, Zaphod Beeblebrox, to find a long-lost \\"planet\\" that makes customized planets for wealthy clients. There is a dry sense of humor running through the book that relies very heavily on irony to show just how nonsensical science fiction is. Adams has shown here that Science Fiction doesn't always have to take itself seriously, and does it beautifully. This book has spawned almost 6 other books, all with the same characters, but still just as entertaining. I believe the argument of the book is that we should embrace our diversity while noticing each others quirks and habits. Adams shows this throughout the book with his funny descriptions of each characters personality. He is very good at making me laugh, and I recommend this book to humor and science-fiction fans."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Want to know the secrets of the universe?

He is at his best when he breaks sci-fi cliches to smithereens, making you snigger or laugh wildly, yet demonstrating a deep feeling of what is the real sense of wonder of space. So, pour example, you have the bickering between cynic Ford Prefect and enthusiast Zaphod about Magrathea...and be caught in awe in the perfectly evocative description of &quot;The fires of dawn! The twin suns of Soulianis and Rahm!&quot;. You'll laugh at the quirks of Eddie the Computer, be sympathetic whit poor Marvin, and you'll admire the curious clash of personalities serendipitously reunited...Ford the cynical and resourceful alien that can still be taken aback by an unexpected ruse by the insecure and shellshocked Arthur; the brash bravado of Zaphod,countered by the cool rationality of Trillian. The Planet Building Factory is a very original invention, and Slartibartfast is something of a Doctor Who mingled whit Obi Wan Kenobi...but lacking the self assurance of both. But the best moment of the novel is in the Story of Deep Thought and the Ultimate answer. This is pure Teather of the Absurd, and reminds us of Vonnegut's Sirens of Titan.

This loony masterpiece has made for a name for itself in everyway the previously defined book has not, and then some.Though a valid portrayal of the book would tell of an earthman jarred from his home to discover the mysteries of the galaxy, this hardly describes the novel for what it really is. With its chaotic plot and illogical meanderings, you can't help but get addicted to the totally unorthodox writing style of Douglass Adams. As the storyline shifts endlessly, there are innumerable investigations into the underlying truths of our home planet. Things like the fact that dolphins have been warning us of the end of the world for years are common throughout the novel. And with off the wall style comes off the wall humor in a book that will keep you laughing from cover to cover. If you've ever enjoyed a Daniel Pinkwater book you'll fall in love with the Hitchhiker's Guide.On a scale from 1-10, Douglas Adams' inane writing fashion gets a 10 from me.

Douglas Adams is the author. If you are into the \\"Star Trek\\" or just Sci-Fi, then this book's for you.The story is about two men: Arthur Dent who is man in his middle age and who you would say \\"out to space\\" type of guy. Also his friend Ford Prefect who is researching a book called \\"Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy\\". One day Arthur finds that his house is going to be torn down to be turned into a galactic highway. With much frustration, stress, and devastation. Arthur's great friend comes to save the day by taking him to the bar for relief. Minutes after he finds himself with ford in space. Not to give away the whole story. They adventure in space trying to survive by dodging bad guys or making friends.You like adventure, you like excitement, and weird stories. Check out this book and read it. You might not only like it but also get a different view of the universe. Thank you for your time hope you enjoy."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I saw the movie first so some the scenes where rememberable but like most books done by British author I do not get all the humor. I found this one harder to grasp at time then say a Terry Pratchett novel.The stuff I found funny was the stuff that I already knew the punchline like the meaning of life answer. When I think about this book now there really isn't much I like about it. The voices of the character in my head feel kinda of annoying.I guess I am just not a fan of British humor."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy written by Douglas Adams wasn't the best book I've read. This book was very confusing in many ways. Things happen a little to fast and then it gets confusing. Like when all of the sudden the earth blows up. It doesn't really explain why. Also, it has a lot of bizarre names and characters. If you're a person who likes nice simple books that puts everything out for you this isn't the book for you. A lot of things didn't make any sense. There were some real names of things such as McDonald's and London etc. Mostly made up like the Infinite Improbability Drive and the species in the galaxy.The Basic summary of the book is a person from Earth named Arthur Dent is rescued by a weird alien named Ford Prefect. He is rescued because Earth is disinagrating or overheating. They escape on a Vogon ship which they get shot out of an airlock into space. Then the President of the galaxy named Zaphod Beeblebrox, ship rescues them, and the they meet a very depressed robot named Martin. The title comes from a book in the story called The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy. It basically gives them tips along the way. There is some humor in this book. Mostly in the guide. Like Ford has a towel in his satchel all the time for various things. It says it in the guide too.This book wasn't the greatest thing I've read, I give it two stars. I am being a little generous. I am mostly giving this rating because it was confusing, not very exciting, didn't grab my attention, and it wasn't very clear on things. I liked it for the two stars because it kinda reminded me of Star Wars. I don't know why but it did. It was a sci-fi book that's probably why. I do not recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Before his death, Doug Adams gave an interview in which, among other things, he mentioned that he was surprised that people wanted more of the hitchhiker stuff because as far as he was concerned it was old hat and not funny. With him I have to agree and one has to be puzzled why people would read such drivel as this. The characters, the plot, the story, the background, the atmosphere, the landscape, the tone etc. is just awful, with little or no redeeming social or artistic value. Doug said as much in the interview, but indicated that he hated the idea of writing more of this stuff, but he needed the money. You'll save your eyes and your time and get more benefits by sleeping than by reading this book-like-object."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is the story of Arthur Dent, an man who survives the destruction of the Earth by hitchhiking with his friend Ford Prefect (who turns out to be an alien) onto the spaceship Heart of Gold, which is powered by an Infinite Improbability Drive.Spoilers ahead.The disconnect between the quality of the book and the rave reviews it has on Amazon is bewildering. I think it's a case of the emperor's new clothes--it's so hyped that people are afraid to not like it. In reality, it's trite and unfunny, and the author's ego radiates off of every page. The random details that Adams inserts, from the stream of consciousness from the sperm whale to Deep Thought's answer to the question of the meaning of life, remind me of a third-grader writing their first short story and reveling in how how awesomely ~random they are.Douglas Adams tries way, way too hard to come off as nonchalant, pithy and oh-so-subtly thought-provoking. I'm not sure why the 651 reviewers who gave this book five stars can't see how transparent those efforts are. In the end, it's a collection of random thoughts with no greater meaning--and no, I don't think it even points to how meaningless life really is, and how we should live in the moment, etc. I think it points to how meaningful Douglas Adams thinks this book is.The Hitchhiker's Guide is a book for lazy readers. It's easy to swallow and offers a seemingly deep conclusion. If you're interested in psuedo-enlightened theories and don't want to put in more than nominal effort, this is the book for you. If not, try an author like Haruki Murakami, who captures some of the same elements of meaninglessness and consciousness in a much more real way.Enjoying this book isn't a sign of your enlightened open-mindedness and intellectual superiority over others. It's a sign that you're not thinking for yourself."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I decided to read this novel because it is widely acclaimed as a contemporary science fiction classic. Douglas Adams' description of Arthur Dent, who is the lone man to survive the destruction of the planet earth, is consistently humorous and entertaining. Dent is set loose to roam the galaxy, accompanied with an alien friend who is thankfully equipped with the indispensable Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.As the novel progresses, it becomes evident that despite the superficial whimsical tone, Adams is dealing with deeper themes relating to the meaning and existence of human life. The absurdity created by his imagination is not just a matter of light-hearted sci-fi entertainment, but is a cloak which Adams uses to convey his philosophy of human life and his personal worldview.One needs to recall that this novel was born in the late 1970s, in the hey-day of technology and space travel, a time when there was a great deal of optimism and faith in science as the saviour of mankind. Adams mocks this human arrogance. The arrogance of Bent's fellow-humans in destroying his home, becomes a microcosm for the arrogance of humankind, and when it is applied to man's own home earth, results in man's own destruction. Adams' scorn for scientific arrogance is especially manifest when it appears that the rulers of earth are not scientists, but their own laboratory mice, who were secretly conducting large-scale experiments on their captors all along.Yet this novel achieves much more than a scoffing of scientific arrogance. It becomes painfully evident that something essential is missing from the universe described in the Hitchhiker's Guide: God. When questioned by man about his existence, God &quot;promptly vanishes in a puff of logic.&quot; God's absence from Adams' fictional universe corresponds to God's absence in Adams' personal worldview. The worldview which Adams believes in and portrays is a galaxy without a Creator. Adams is in fact a self-confessed &quot;radical atheist&quot;, and holds this position very seriously.But if Adam's universe is a world without God, this leads to an inevitable question: In such a universe, what is the meaning and purpose of life? Adams toys with this question when he describes the &quot;The Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything.&quot; After seven and a half million years of calculation, the super computer &quot;Deep Thought&quot; announces that the answer is &quot;Forty-two.&quot; This meaningless answer is incomprehensible, and is apparently so because we don't understand the question properly! Here Adams whimsically propounds his purpose for planet earth: earth is a gigantic experiment, because it is on earth that the question about the meaning and purpose of life is voiced, but never answered! The purpose of earth is to raise the question about its purpose.In Adams' atheistic worldview, the question about the purpose of life cannot be answered, because the existence of the very creator of the universe is denied. Such a question can only be asked, answered, and understood in a Christian worldview where the existence of the Creator is maintained, because apart from Him, creation is indeed purposeless. In this respect, the message of Adams' classic is the same as that of the Bible book of Ecclesiastes: there is no purpose and meaning in a world that rejects God. However, it is eternally unfortunate that Adams does not have the same conclusion as Ecclesiastes, where the premise of practical atheism is reversed, God's existence once again affirmed, and purpose discovered by serving and obeying God the Creator. Present day adherents of practical atheism who share Adams' empty worldview will discover that they will spend their life in the same way as Adams - in life whimsically hitchhiking an empty earth without God, and in death discovering that that God was always there, but that by their rejection of Him in the past, they will spend eternity without Him in the future. But then it will be too late. Because unlike the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, eternity without God has no room for frivolous laughter, but only for sorrow and regret.In portraying the emptiness of an atheistic worldview, Adams is outstanding. In endorsing this worldview, Adams is to be most pitied. May God spare us from echoing his endorsement."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"What a huge dissappointment! I found the book extremely boring. Maybe I've been spoiled by the recent fantasy/sf I've been reading, but I found the plot very slow moving, and generally uninteresting and uninvolving. I also disliked the extreme amount of humor and satire in this book. I prefer my novels to be more realistic. I like adult situations (complex relationships, betrayal, violence, etc), and I couldn't find any here. It felt as if I was watching one LONG episode of Futurama.There were good things, however. The book was extremely short. I got through it in one sitting (about three hours), and I don't think I've ever done that before. Also, I found the book slightly humorous in parts, which served to barely keep my interest for that 3-hour reading stretch."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I think that this book was one of the oddest I have ever read. I really found no joy in reading it and didn1t see the point of the story line. If I had known that this book was so absurd I wouldn1t have read it. While reading it I had to struggle to comprehend the characters1 bizarre surroundings and conflicts. If I had to give this book a rating I1d give it one out of five stars. I give it one star because there were some rare funny parts in the book. These parts really didn1t pertain to the book at all though."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"So where do I begin? I first tried to read this book many years ago, soon after it was initially released. I managed to get past the first few chapters before tossing the book aside in disgust. I tried again a few years later with the same result. Finally, I thought to myself, \\"Self -- why not force yourself to read it through so you can properly evaluate it.\\" After all, a lot of people like it. And many of them think it's really funny.So that's what I did. I forced myself to read every last chapter of this -- this -- thing. And you know what. It is just as big an abomination as I remembered it to be. It has no proper story line that one can follow and no character development. On top of that, it uses meaningless sentences and meaningless words to create an assault on the human brain and on the ability of humans to \\"reason\\" their way through a problem, all of which that makes me think the author must have been on a very bad acid trip when he wrote this piece of garbage. As for humor, well, in the whole book, I found only two lines that made me laugh. The rest of it made me want to puke. On the more positive side, the chapters are mercifully short, giving the reader many breaks between said assaults.If you like slapstick comedy that has no purpose, you may like this book, but count me out. If you're more into serious SciFi, walk away from this in a big hurry or find yourself screaming just to keep your sanity."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Where I work H2G2 (Hitchhiker's Guide To the Galaxy) is fairly popular and I have been told time and time again that I must read this book. Well, I finally read it. Overall it's not quite as good as I hoped, but still it was an interesting read.H2G2 is about an Earthling named Arthur Dent who is saved right at the last second by his friend from a planet near Betelgeuse, Ford Prefect. Ford convinces Arthur that the Earth is being destroyed and just in time they are saved by accident. This is the beginning of this wild (and I mean wild!) ride. Along this ride you meet some interesting characters including talking mice, a 2-headed, 3-armed ex-hippie president of the galaxy, a depressed robot and others.There's a lot to like about this book, but you have to enjoy this particular genre of comedy. For me the book was fairly interesting throughout, I was always curious about what craziness lurked on the pages that follow, however, oftentimes I was let down a bit and it's because a lot of the scenes in the book are just too crazy and they seem too random.I wont give away anything major but there are scenes such as Ford jamming a fish that translates languages in to Arthurs ear, rockets that turn into a whale and a bowl of petunias just before impact and absolute madness that involves ball-point pens. Douglas Adams is a good writer so he is able to paint these scenes in an interesting way. There are definitely a few scenes in the book that made me smirk, but overall I just didn't find much humor. It's almost as if you had a really good author, gave him a few hits of LSD and told him to write a book before he sobered up. I can see how this style of comedy is interesting to some people, but I guess it's just not my flavor.Perhaps I just don't have a very good sense of humor. Definitely check this book out though, there are so many people that really love this style of comedy and if you are one of these people then I'm sure you will find a lot of great laughs."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I could have loved this quirky book if there was a bit more plot.

Arthur Dent, your average ignorant human being, is lucky enough to hitch a ride with his alien buddy on a passing spaceship just moments before Earth is destroyed. Now I like a good laugh, but some of the humor in this book is just stupid. When Arthur convinces the man who is trying to demolish his house to actually protect it while Arthur leaves, I knew early on what kind of nonsense I was getting into. Some people like that kind of humor, but I find tiresome. You really have to appreciate British humor to like a book like this.

Needless to say I recomend this book to anyone who wishes to escape this world and join Arthur Dent on his pan-galactic journey through space, time, and morality.

He paints such vivid pictures its amazing.While reading his other books in the series he always finds a way to bring in an inside joke that you'd only know if you've read the previous book.So hold onto your hats, cause you're in for a while ride when you read this one!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is one of the best books i have ever read, read it!!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy is a very interesting book about Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect.

Saying that this was my favorite book ever doesn't really tell you anything unless you know my literary history. I read a lot. I have read most of the classics(I own the easton press library's &quot;100 greatest books ever written&quot; and have read 75% of them) , dozens of sci fi books, every scherlock holmes story ever, mystery novels, detective stories, tragedies comedies, adventure novels... you name it, I have probably read it. But few books have ever motivated me to read them for a second time, even fewer for a third, and the only books I have read 4 times or more are books by Mr. Douglas Adams. In particular the Hitch Hicker's trilogy (all 5 of them). I bought the books on tape, and heve literaly listened to one side of each tape nearly every night for the last 5 years. You may call it sick, I may call it love for the greatest book ever writen (or just the best insomnia cure I have found to date). Whatever it is there is something special about this book. &quot;more popular than the 'celestial homecare omnibus', better selling then ' 53 more things to do in zero gravity', and more contriversial then Oolon Colluphid's trilogy of philisophical blockbusters, 'where God went wrong', 'some more of God's greatest mistakes', and 'who is this God person anyways?'. For one of the funniest, smartest, most imaginative books ever written,whith unforgetable characters like Marvin:&quot; a depressed robot with an exeptionaly large mind 'sort of an electronic sulking machine'&quot;; Zaphhod Beeblebrox: &quot;President of the imperial galactic government, who is also adventurer, ex-hippie, good-timer, and, quite possibly, crook&quot;; and of course thhe seris's star Aurther Dent: &quot;for whom the adventure begins on a terrible thursday with the destruction of his house&quot; read &quot;The Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy&quot;!

Avoid the movie though, its not very good."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Let's say 4.5 stars.I reread this book because I am undertaking a novel where I wanted the humor to have a similar tone. This reading would serve as inspiration. Since the last time I read this series was in my teens, I thought it merited a second look.The teenage me loved this series, finding the tone and unfolding of events to be arch and wonky.The older me, well, I can see through some of the narrative tricks and the book sags in places. Now, it's still just such a fine piece of fiction with its humor veering from peacock-strut to ninja-stealth. Adams knows how to turn a phrase and the banter is just so gregarious and winsome.But he is sometimes too hot for tangents. Yes, I know most of the tangents pay off later, but the narrative coherency takes a beating here and there.With the book I'm writing, I want to make sure the main character is not lost in the spectacle of the wit and cosmic nature of the book's trappings. Arthur, sadly doesn't fair so well. He is bland and fades into the background for most of the novel. Yes, I realize the series will eventually evolve him, but it's still disappointing to see such a skeletal character as mere placeholder in such a lofty book.Quick Observations:Including additional information as footnotes is distracting and all could be eliminated without any enjoyment being robbed from the telling.The author really dislikes cheery futuristic doors that whish open and close.A paranoid and depressing robot-golden! More scenes, please!Mice could never be more menacing than here.Button-pushing cracked me up in this tale.For a book about hitchhiking through the interstellar vastness, there was a lack of wonder or variety in the settings. If one is thumbing through the cosmos, I'd expect a space bar, exotic alien jungle, lavishly expensive sets, but this one felt sparse.As I raced to the end, the humor flowed consistently throughout. I struggle with this in my own work as it seems my humor cuts out whenever I approach the climax.As if the apex of the story needs to be all serious and such. Well, this book reminded me that should be an area to focus on.The book did what it was supposed to do, it invigorated my desire to write funny. It also made me wonder what a space opera might read like if I ever stopped writing fantasies and took the interstellar plunge.I can guarantee one thing--it sure as Jupiter would feature a space bar. Maybe even in its opening scene."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I think I would have found this wildly funny in college, but reading it at this stage in my life, I found it mostly pointless and silly, with moments of humor.

To start with, the Kindle version seemed to have a few conversion mistakes in it. When there was text in italics, which happens a lot in this book, two words were sometimes joined together. It's like the space would be missing between them. Not a huge deal, but kind of annoying when reading.The story was fantastic. I thought it was really funny at points. I don't think I've read a book before that had as many funny moments as this. I enjoyed the book far more than the movie which I had seen a couple years ago.The story did wrap up very quickly, though, and seems to continue into another book which I haven't read yet. I was expecting the story to continue on, and then it just ended.The end of the book contains a long look at the making of the movie.

All his stuff is a must read in my opinion...if you like humor and can handle British humour.Great photos, write-ups, tid-bits, history.I miss the guy."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This was one of, if not the funniest sci-fi book I have ever read. It is also one of the easier reads I have read, however it being easy to read doesn't take away from the plot and the overall randomness of the \\"Hitchhiker\\" books (which I strongly recommend you read all of). Douglas Adams has created a masterpiece which will captivate even beginning readers will want to read this book because of the lack of hard words and fast paced plot line full of action and oddities. Here is a brief summary of what the book is about. However, don't be discouraged from reading the book because you think you know all that happened, the summary doesn't give more away then what you learn in the first few chapters.This book depicts Arthur Dent -a normal earthling- going about his morning when he notices a bulldozer in front of his house and lies down in the mud in front of it so it won't demolish his house. Then his friend Ford Prefect -an alien from the Betelgeuse star system- wisks him away from earth (about to be destroyed by the Vogons) by hitchhiking on a Vogon ship. Then he and Arthur travel all around the universe in search of the question for the answer of Life, The Universe, and Everything. On the way he meets Zaphod Beeblebrox -the crazy president of the galaxy- and Trillian -Zaphod's girlfriend from earth- who join Ford and Arthur in their quest to find the question for the answer of Life, The Universe, and Everything.If you are intrigued by the brief summary I have just given you, then this book is for you, and if you were not, well then just read it anyway and you will probably find something to laugh at and enjoy. REMEMBER, DON'T BE AFRAID OF IT BEING TOO HARD the words are simple and you should understand all or most of them. So for all of you who like a nice easy read go ahead and dive into the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy. For those more sophisticated readers out there you will love the complex themes Douglas Adams weaves into his book (but you beginning readers can just ignore them and still pretty much get what the book is talking about."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I was inspired to read the book when I saw the movie. I have not read the book since I was in high school, so I was very interested in seeing what would seem different. I was very, very surprised at the difference. What had been an amusing, but hardly nerve-shatteringly funny, was transformed into a very funny book indeed.The success in Adam's skills in seeing completely normal human life from a totally alien perspective is amazing. It is something that has been exceptionally noticeable the second time around. For example, the way in which mice were conducting experiments on humans and Slartibartfast marvelling at their genius in doing so.The book also takes a keen stab at human nature and our foibles in more than one way. From God \\"vanishing in a puff of logic\\" to \\"pan-dimensional beings\\" trying to find the answer to life, the universe and everything, and then finding that they needed to work out the question to the answer. Confused? So were the \\"pan-dimensional beings\\".All in all, \\"The Hitchhikers' Guide to the Galaxy\\" is a genius in comic, Monty-Pythonesque humour mixed with healthy doses of sci-fi. Even if you have read it before, it will entertain you for another run through it. I loved every part of it, and don't wonder that it is a classic."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchiker's Guide is hands down the funniest book ever written by an Englishman with the last name of Adams. It is also the most hilarious book I have ever read. I would even go so far to say that it is the most ridiculous book ever to stress the importence of towels. It's wonderful. Read it and see the movie."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This, the most famous book of the late Douglas Adams, is the first book in the five volume Hitchhiker's Trilogy. It is quite possibly among the funniest books ever written.Arthur Dent wakes up one morning to the sound of a bulldozer outside of his residence. His house is to be demolished to make way for a bypass. After a series of events he goes to a bar with his friend Ford Prefect--who reveals that he himself is not human. Ford tells Arthur that he is leaving Earth in order to escape its destruction (it is being destroyed in order to pave the way for an interstellar bypass).So begins the epic that is Adams' magnum opus.One reason I love The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (and the rest of the trilogy) is that it explores the theme of life as a journey towards hidden purposes. At the same time, it manages to show all the chaos along the way.It is within the pages that we first encounter the answer to the meaning of life, the universe and everything--namely 42. The search for the question to the answer is preoccupies much of the trilogy's later stories.After several readings of this first volume, the scene that sticks most in my mind is the internal conflicts that take place within the soul of the English bureaucrat (a direct male-line descendant of Ghengis Khan) sent to destroy Arthur's home. There are few scenes more hilarious in the rest of the series.I give the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy my full recommendation."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"'The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy,' by Douglas Adams, is a spontaneous comic adventure. To bring out the humorous characters and events, Douglas Adams uses a lot of satire to attract the reader's attention. A scene that brings out much of the satire is at the beginning of the book. Arthur Ford lies in front of bulldozer to stop the demolition of his house so the city can build a bypass. Arthur, having just found out the day before, is annoyed because the plans were buried from the public. To emphasize the satire, Adams destroys Earth to build an intergalactic bypass whose plans were also buried. This is all going on while the construction workers are trying to find a way to get more money out of their union for working with insane people. Adam uses this satire throughout the entire book to give it an added flavor and to persuade changes on earth with certain situations. As Arthur and Ford start hitchhiking their way around the galaxy to find the ultimate answers to life and the universe, they encounter worlds full of trouble.The story starts out with Arthur Dent protesting his house from being torn down for a bypass, when his friend Ford Perfect, an alien who has been posing as an out-of-work actor on earth for the past fifteen years, drags Arthur away to tell him the world is going to be destroyed. He warns his disbelieving friend Arthur that the planet is soon to blow up, and rescues both of them seconds before its destruction by hitching a ride from the Vogons. After Ford and Arthur are tortured by hideous poetry, Zaphod Beeblebrox, the president of the galaxy, and Trillia, the only other surviving human being, save them. Together they travel the galaxy to lead to the ultimate answers to life.I would say this book is Random. Sinister. Funny. 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy' covers everything from galactic space monsters to far-off planets no one has ever of. This completely random book has the reader on his toes from the very first page to the last. Totally unpredictable. If you want a joyful, whimsical ride through space, then read 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"A classic of absurd British humor in the tradition of Monty Python - mostly zany fun, but sometimes making a political or social point underneath the jokes, like a lot of great comedy of various styles. It also succeeds as unique science fiction."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I very much enjoyed reading the book. I would recommend this as a must read to anyone who links SiFi"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Overall an excellent book. Very funny. I was disappointed with the length, it was so short. Also the last 100 pages are a afterword written by one of the movie producers. I have never seen the movie and was uninterested in this portion of the book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is only the first in five books, and from the very first page, I already had a huge smile on my face while I sat there chuckling to myself. Douglas Adams managed to create a brilliant science fiction parody of life that will have you laughing whether you comprehend the scientific aspects or not.The basic storyline is that while Arthur Dent is trying to save his house from being demolished to make way for a new bypass, Ford Prefect is trying to save himself and his friend Arthur from being killed while the alien species, Vogons, demolish the Earth to create their own hyperspace bypass. Coincidence? In this case, probably. Ironic? Oh, most definitely.Arthur and Ford hitch a ride aboard the Vogon space cruiser, and from there on, begins their incredible, baffling journey in space.Adams writes this story in a way that brilliantly showcases his wit and sarcasm, while simultaneously coating it with underlying somber messages about the human race and life. It seems impossible and chaotic at time, but therein lies its charm. I believe this is one of the reasons the book is still as successful and popular as it is today. Despite the science fiction aspect of it, people get it, they relate to it, and they even find that they can laugh at themselves.The nonsensical situations and coincidences are so extraordinary, that one cannot help but be entertained. This is of course later on explained in the book through the Infinite Improbability Drive. The most compelling method of presenting wacky ideas is without embellishment because only then is the reader hit with the full impact of absurdity. Through a comical story and simplistic writing style, Douglas Adams creates a novel that will coax laughs out of everyone."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I read the Hitchhikers Guide, as well as all the other books by Douglas Adams years ago. Now I get to share that special Douglas Adams wit and complexity with my son.

I am happy to say that I still found it to be very amusing.It had an amazing impact when I first read it. Obviously it didn't have the same impact but I was aware of just how influential it has been.This is a very witty, amusing and often laugh out loud funny book. It is pretty short and it never outstays its welcome.It is very original and there is very little filler in it. The inventiveness of it all is astounding.There are some cracking characters in it and Marvin must be the greatest fictional Robot ever!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The title of this review is the next example of Gonzolit. It's perfect. Douglas Adams turns the English language into either the rantings of an existential crackpot -- or pure upside-down damn-the-rules poetry, the kind you find in Kids Say the Darndest Things, or Emma Donoghue's brilliant novel, Room.The only reason this book won't stand the test of time is if our species gets rid of all the digital watches.Okay. So what can be said about a book with 685 five-star reviews?And why would anyone review it now?Reviewers who wish to be seen hovering above the mass of grocery store lit are always peering into the higher shelves in search of something that challenges the general mediocrity of our fiction, a plot that explodes the senses, or a character sufficiently outrageous that the mind reels trying to grasp the nuances and diagnose the sickness of the author.Such a book The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is not.Well, all right, the spacy berserkitude of The Guide challenges mediocrity. One might make a case that Adams is an embarrassment to the 21st Century dumbing-down of the imagination. And what this book also does, or did in 1979, was to raise the bar for the acceptably weird. There was a time when weird was Last Exit to Brooklyn, or Ulysses, or One Hundred Years of Solitude, or going way back, Walt Whitman's magnificent and unpublishable Leaves of Grass. These books of course are literature. Douglas Adams would be the first to admit he did not create any literature. But what he did create was altogether nuts.Let's see... somewhere in the Galaxy, people are running a 10-million-year-long experiment in which the Earth is actually a giant computer. Five minutes before the experiment concludes, Vogons blow up the planet because it's in the path of a hyperspace by-pass and must be eliminated. Within days it is revealed that a new technology has superseded the need for the hyperspace by-pass! Wow! You gotta love it!This is my personal literary grail, devoutly to be sought: No Rules. No disbelief to suspend. No irony left unsmelted, no buckle left unswashed. Characters marching mindlessly through the narrative with or without balls or cause. And most crucial to Gonzolit, a sense of the absurd so delicious that no discerning reader can fail to appreciate it.That is why God gave us Douglas Adams."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Great dealer, great service: fast shiping and the book is in very good condition. I would totally buy there again."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Sale was perfect. On time. Product was as discribed. I would buy from this marketer again.

If there's one set of comic-themed scifi books that you ever get a chance to read, it should be this series. The one and only reason why I have rated this Kindle edition of the book so poorly is because they have disabled Text to Speech.I can understand audiobook companies weariness of highly intelligent, well designed text to speech software, but it doesn't excuse their actions. By disabling this software, (audio)book companies are only hurting their fans."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is absolutely marvelous! It's funnier than 'The Scarlet Letter'! It's longer than 'Chicken Little'! It's less poetic than 'Green Eggs and Ham'! And above all, it doesn't have near as many Greeks in it, well, anything by Homer, for instance. It is an incredible book. Based on the BBC radio series of the same name, this book follows the adventures of one Arthur Dent who, after discovering that his home and his planet are about to be destroyed to make room for highways, helps an odd humanoid from Betelgeuse name Ford Prfect write a book.This book, I swear to God, had me convulsing and near throwing up, I was laughing so hard. It's just freaking funny!!!! It even made my grandpa laugh, and he's Amish, illiterate, and dead. I have honestly never read or heard of a funnier book than HHGG, and the reason behind that is probably because such a thing does not exist.So, read this book. If you can't read, have someone read it out loud to you. If you don't have any friends who will read it to you, buy the book on tape. If you can't afford the book on tape, for heaven's sake sell your computer and buy it. If you're computer's an old Commadore and even when you sell it, you still don't have enough money, sell your semen to a sperm bank and move to distant planet where you can prepare sandwiches until a long lost friend shows up with your child she created using your sperm that she found at some distant sperm bank! I don't care how you do it! Go get this book!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Humor, and our perception of humor, is subjective. What is funny to one person isn't necessarily funny to the next. For example - I think Dave Barry is hilarious, and I think his first novel \\"Big Trouble\\" is a laugh riot - but I found the movie \\"Big Trouble\\" pretty tedious, and not very funny.A friend turned me onto the Hitchhiker's Guide 20 years ago, and I laughed until I cried, and couldn't wait to move on to the next book, \\"The Restaurant At The End of the Universe\\".I see LOTS of reviews of this book trying lamely to describe the \\"plot\\" of the story, which would give a reader as much reason to read the book as it would to give a potential movie-goer the \\"plot\\" of \\"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\\". The story isn't the point. The enchantment lies within Adams' incredibly witty descriptions of the mundane and the extraordinary.----------------------------------------------------------Here is an early passage where our hero discovers that his friend is not English at all:\\"Alright,\\" said Ford. \\"How would you react if I said that I'm not from Guildford after all, but from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse?\\"Arthur shrugged in a so-so sort of way.\\"I don't know,\\" he said, taking a pull of beer. \\"Why - do you think it's the sort of thing you're likely to say?\\"---------------------------------------------------Consider this exchange a few chapters later when space traveling Ford prepares earthling Arthur for his first travel in hyperspace:\\"You'd better be prepared for the jump into hyperspace. It's unpleasantly like being drunk.\\"\\"What's so unpleasant about being drunk?\\"\\"You ask a glass of water.\\"------------------------------------------I remember, reading the book for the first time, thinking \\"this book hits my funny-bone much the same as the movies of Monty Python.\\"So - if THAT style of witty/wacky British humor hits your funny-bone as well, and you HAVEN'T yet read Douglas Adams, I say:Don't Panic. You're in for a treat. You may also want to scout around - there are many editions of these stories, including at least two \\"series\\" books that include ALL of the Hitchhiker's Books in a single volume."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Twenty years ago this book came into my hands and for one entire week I laughed my head off. This is one of the most beautiful pieces of holographically insane literature I've ever read. The fact that it is science fiction is almost irrelevant. Some pages are so nutty/funny I'd be left gasping for air after each paragraph trying to smother uncontrollable laughter. Other pages, whilst not as funny, were so absurdly pedantic that you were left adrift in amazement. One of the most successful literary attempts at psychedelic writing in my 40+ years of reading. The book is miraculously manic; I hope you enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Douglas Adams' book begins with our protagonist, Arthur Dent, facing the destruction of his house to make room for a new highway. This is all well and good until Arthur's friend of many years and closet alien, Ford Prefect, tells Arthur that their life on Earth is about to end, because an alien race wishes to make an intergalactic highway and Earth is in it's way. This is just the beginning of Adams' satire. He shows us that most of our problems are small and petty once put in comparison with something more substantial. The story continues with the President of the Galaxy, Ford's friend from his alien home planet, steals the most powerful ship in the galaxy, the one sporting the Improbability Drive, and takes it for a joy ride. Adams keeps the reader interested throughout the course of the book, giving the answer to Life, The Universe, and Everything, reasons why towels are a hitchhiker's best friend, and reveals the fact that Humans were only the third smartest animals on Earth, next to dolphins and mice, which come from another dimension. This book grips the reader's attention from start to finish, sending him on the most exciting adventure through the galaxy that he has ever been on. With only a few dull moments, and heaps of humor, wit, and sarcasm, Douglas Adams' has written a real winner."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"How can anyone be so closed-minded as to not enjoy this book? I'll agree, this book requires a fair amount of attention to get into, but that's the beauty of it! You need to have brains to enjoy it! You need to be, in the least bit, SMART! In short, Douglas Adams has created a literary masterpiece. Smart, funny as hell, and just insane. I've read it 3 times and I'm still not tired of it. The open-minded will appreciate this. If you did not enjoy this, there's probably something wrong with your reading glasses, or even worse, your brain."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"One is cheaper than the other but contains many many typos. There are two just in the downloadable sample so beware.

For some it's meaning, for others it's a place in the universe, and for the rest of us, it's a digital watch. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy really illustrates that unsure feeling that we all have. Arthur Dent was lost enough on Earth, but after it's demolished, he in desperate need of finding a speck of understanding throughout the rest of the Galaxy. Good luck without your towel there, buddy boy.I really dug this book. It didn't take you straight from point A to point B, as some novels do. It had twisty unpredictable swerves that gave you a glimpse of points X, Q and H, along the way, even though Q and H had nothing to do with anything. They were there for appreciation. For example, a nuclear bomb makes a quick transformation to a sperm whale before any damage is done. The reader is fully exposed to the Sperm whales thoughts and inner ramblings... all thirty seconds of them. It's beautifully absurd, and I loved it.I fully enjoyed the nonsense and the silliness of the book. Little details, especially. An incredibly depressed robot, the hailing of digital watches, eager to please doors; all these things didn't necessarily prove incredibly important on the character's quest, but amusing, nonetheless. Without the silliness, this may have been another book about post-Earth days and the last thing we need is just another book about post-Earth days. Have no fear, this is not just another book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The thrilling yet hilarious book Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, by Douglas Adams, includes an exciting plot, great characters, and very cool ways of looking at the galaxy, as a human named Arthur and an alien named Ford travel though space in search of adventure. Ford is sent to do research for the book Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, an electronic book that tells information about the galaxy. Ford and Arthur sneak away on a passing space ship, just as Earth is destroyed. They attempt to hide from the captain of the ship, but fail and are jettisoned into deep space! Knowing that they only have 30 seconds left of air, they try to find some way to save themselves. Just as they are about to die a passing ship picks them up, but Arthur and Ford aren't ready for the adventures that are about to happen to them. One reason someone should read this book is because it is extremely funny. The book has very humorous ways of looking at earth and the galaxy from an alien's point of view. One example is in the beginning when the aliens describe earth as &quot; An utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea.&quot;(1) Another example of humor is when the aliens are describing Jesus: &quot; One man had been nailed to a tree for saying how great it would be to be nice to people for a change&quot;(2) There are many more funny jokes and comments about people and things through out the book. Another reason to read this book is because the adventures that Ford and Arthur have are very exciting and action filled. One example is when Arthur, Ford, Zaphod, Trillen, Veet, and the robot Marvin discover the lost planet, Magrathea, which is rumored to not exist. When they come closer to the planet they are shot down with missiles and crash into the planet, and discover strange creatures and buildings on the planet. Another example is when Arthur, Ford and the gang get into a shoot out with police when they get caught with a stolen ship. The adventures and jokes that Douglas Adams comes up with are so funny it makes you want to read this book again. One reason why someone might not like to read this book is because if one reads the book too fast you might miss a transaction and be confused. The book as weird ways of saying things you might skim one thing and think it means something different then it really means, so you must read kind of carefully. This reason is not a good reason to not read the book because is a great book. All one need to do is read a little carefully and the only problem with the book is gone. If one does not read this book this will be missing out of all the funny adventures that Ford and Arthur go on. This book is defiantly a must read, you will have many hours of enjoyment reading this book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book was given to me for christmas one year ago.

Along with his poor bewildered earthling pal Authur Dent, Ford manages, but just barely, to get away from Earth right before it is destroyed. Now without a home planet, Authur, armed with nothing but Ford, a towel, and The Hitchhiker's Guide is off on a hilarious galactic adventure full of strange places and even stranger people including the three headed president of his girlfriend Trillian who Arthur once met at a cocktail party.This is one of the funniest books I have ever read.

Douglas Adams' irreverence makes this whimsical stuff a kind of profound Pythonism (not that the Pythons themselves weren't profound). Pretty much all the books in the expanded \\"trilogy\\" are terrific, but maybe because this was the first, and because I heard it in its original incarnation as a radio broadcast before ever cracking open the book, it remains the ultimate classic of the group, the one where it all began, as we so like to say. From the splendid monologues about things like probability drives to the coolest guy in the universe, Zaphod Beeblebrox, this book and its offspring will stand tall for the next hundred years--as an Alice in Wonderland for the Space Age."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is the very first Kindle book I downloaded, because it only seemed fitting. The Kindle is the ultimate incarnation of the Hitchhiker's Guide. The story is very tongue-in-cheek British humor which has developed a cult following since it came out in the mid-1980's. It is too difficult to try and explain here, but to give you an idea of the humor, this is the first book in a trilogy of five (yes, 5!) books. The only explanation I can give is either you get it or you don't.The Kindle version is easy to read: no gaps in the text, no obvious spelling mistakes and no pictures that appear only in greyscale. My only wish is that someone would contact Douglas Adam's estate and get a skin or cover to make Kindle look like the HHGG (large, friendly letters on the cover spelling out, \\"Don't Panic!\\") That would be perfect (or Prefect, depending oh how your Babel fish translates it). Now, where did I leave my towel?"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"What can you say about an author who wrote a 5 book trilogy? One hilarious read, for one thing. I'd read Adams many years ago and wanted to return to read him again only this time a little more critically to see if the material still worked for me. It did.Douglas Adams really started something when he wrote this parody of one genre, and in so-doing he started his own genre and others have followed in his footsteps such as Robert Aspirin, Terry Pratchett and even Piers Anthony could be counted among those who have emulated this tongue in cheek, irreverent treatment of what had in the past come to be a science fiction genre that took itself very seriously indeed. It's not hard to see in Adams' acerbic and dry English sense of humor strong ties to the style of humor made so famous by the Monty Python crew of the late 60s and early 70s.Reading this the second time in the Kindle version, I found that it didn't lose anything for the change in medium. It really is a remarkably short little book for the impact it had. This kindle version included an addendum that provides the background to the production of the movie by the same name that was finally produced following Adams death in 2001. This addendum is fully one third of the length of the actual novel. It didn't need to be in my opinion, but others might find it entertaining and informative.This is one of the standards in science fiction, fantasy and satirical writing and well worth the time and effort to procure and read. Beware though, once you've finished it you'll want to go on and read the remaining 4 volumes of this famous trilogy.5 stars.bart breen"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Guide explains that it is the exception which proves the rule. It goes on to give this example.Long ago, the Gloops of Alpha Nucleii, sited on the far side of the Galacticus Quadrant, were in thrall to the Thargs of the Grand Imperial Empire of Maxorphius. On the last evening of every bi-millennium cycle of the two Suns of Antiochus, which was, The Guide explained, the equivalent of two standard solar system weeks, Thargs from the Empire would arrive to tax the poor Gloops of all wealth produced since their last raid.This left the Gloops permanently overdrawn at Grimgolds, the Galactic Bank, and the Gloops were pretty fed up about it.\`What can we do?' wailed the Gloops to each other after the most recent raid. \`We have tried resistance, we have tried reason, we have tried running away, nothing works. \`The Thargs are a zillion times stronger than us, will no more listen to reason than the putrefying sponges of Planetoid Desolatoria, and win all the running Golds in the Pan Galactic Olympics. They can never be defeated. The Thargs rule us; the Thargs rule everyone. The Thargs shall rule us for evermore.'And so, the tyrannical reign of the Thargs continued.The Guide flicked to the next screen and continued the tale.Eventually, having exhausted all possible ideas for freeing themselves from the ravenous Thargs, the Gloops turned to the lawyers.\`You see,' explained the Gloops, \`the Thargs are all powerful and shall rule us and everyone for evermore. What can we do?'\`Pay us in advance,' the senior lawyer demanded. The Gloops were ready for this, and had booked their lawyers' appointment the day before the Thargs were due, so as to have the necessary legal fees. These, they handed over.The lawyers retired and deliberated. In due course they emerged from their chambers.\`Can you help us?' pleaded the Gloops. The lawyers turned to each other and nodded knowingly.\`Yes, we can.'The Gloops were overjoyed, but a little cautious, for the Thargs were all powerful.\`How can you help us? The Thargs rule us; the Thargs rule everyone, the Thargs shall rule us for evermore.'The lawyers looked down at the Gloops and explained.\`The Thargs rule, you say. They rule everyone. They are stronger, deafer and faster than you. It follows that if you refuse to be ruled by them you will be the exception.'\`Go on...' encouraged the Gloops.\`...And it is forewritten in all the Good Books that it is the exception which proves the rule.'\`...er...'\`So when the Thargs turn up tomorrow to tax your wealth once more, you must defy them.'The Gloops shivered.\`Defy them? They will turn on us with their all-powerful whirlyblaagblasters, and eviscerate us to extinction.'The lawyers smiled the smile of those who chose the right career.\`No they won't. You see, it is written that it is the exception which proves the rule, so by defying them as no one else would dare, you are the exception which proves they rule. If they continue to rule over you they will no have an exception to prove their rule, and will consequently no longer rule over anyone.' The lawyers beamed. \`You've got them, see?'The Gloops did not see, but they trusted the lawyers. Next day, when the Thargs arrived with their taxing ledgers, the Gloops defied them.\`We've got you,' the Gloops exulted. \`We are the exception which proves that you rule. If you attempt to rule us we will no longer be the exception and your rule will not be proven.'The Thargs turned on the Gloops with their all-powerful whirlyblaagblasters and eviscerated them.What the lawyers had forgotten, the Guide concluded, was that if it is the exception which proves the rule, there must be an exception to this.The only exception, states the Guide, to the rule that it is the exception which proves the rule, is that the lawyers always get their fees up front."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"One of the finest books ever written! It's funny, and edgy, and thoroughly enjoyable. I recommend it to everyone, though some people do not seem to enjoy the slightly dryer English humour. This is a re-read for me, as it does start off my very favorite five-book trilogy. And contains my all-time favorite quote: \\"Ford, you're turning into a penguin - stop it!\\" Basically, the book begins with the destruction of the planet Earth and ends at The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, with a lot of great adventure (and insight) in between. You really should read it, you'll be glad you did. And if you don't like it, well, you're just a mutant..."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"In my opinion, this is one of the funniest, intelligent books that has come out in a long time. While there is not much in the way of plot, that is, rising action, climax, and falling action, it is still worth it to buy and read many times over. The characters are memorable, each with their own unique personality and view of the world. My favorite is Marvin, the 'paranoid android.' He is a manic depressive, and has the best insight into everthing. The humor is intelligent, a kind that makes people think about what the joke is, not the kind of crass humor that is so popular today, like Austin Powers or Blue Collar TV stuff. I am currently reading the second book in this series, The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, and am enjoying it as well. I give The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy a high recommendation to all."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Goofy, dry, and unrelentingly funny. The prose has a type of swagger about it. It's a compulsively readable; I finished it in one 2 hour sitting. Found myself laughing outloud on numerous occasions. The only bad thing that I can say about it is that it ended far too quickly. Will be immediately following up with the sequel."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy written by Douglas Adams was a \\"wholly remarkable book\\" that shows that you can't know what an answer means without a question.The hitchhiker's guide it says in the book that Douglas Adams wrote (way I'm writing this in is because in that book he includes a book called the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy) is a wholly remarkable book. That because the hitchhikers guide is the standard repository of all knowledge. That's what I think of the book Douglas Adams wrote. Not the knowledge part but the wholly remarkable part.It's got plot twists left and right. It has weird creatures, mind bogglingly useful fish that you stick in your ear, and incredible descriptions for towels. Completely impossible ways of travel through the galaxy. Depressed robots est..... mainly it's got everything. That's just in the beginning. Except the ultimate question.To bad but I still think it's a great book"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Do you feel that the Earth is utterly insignificant? Douglas Adams uses his book, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, to get you thinking about how small the Earth is compared to the size of the galaxy and universe. Upon comparing these sizes, it could be said that it would not make a major difference in the galaxy if the Earth was not there; however, nobody would say this if they thought that the Earth might not actually be there someday. In fact, most people would say that this would be impossible. In this book, Adams changed the life of Arthur Dent forever by performing this impossible act: vaporizing the Earth. Arthur woke up one morning worried about his house being destroyed; however, he later realized that this was the least of his worries when the planet he called home, Earth, was vaporized by a group of aliens called Vogons. This sent Arthur into a world that he had only dreamt about and forced him to learn the ways of the galaxy. By performing this major feat, Douglas Adams created a masterpiece that I would give a five star rating."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I read this when I was in elementary school and thought it was funny. But, not great. Since the movie was coming out I thought I would re-read it. Reading it as an adult I have a lot more understanding and find more humor in it. This has to be one of the best science-fiction books ever written. It really is the hitchhiker's guide with out of this world characters and jokes about bureaucracy around the galaxy. And never forget ... all you need to hitchhike anywhere ... is a towel!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, a book you should read unless you need a well defined plot and no laughs. The plot is well hidden by the randomness, a description of the Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster, an alcoholic drink that it seems the author had the first of on Earth before writing it, the introduction of the Hitchhiker's Guide that begins &quot;Space is big. Very big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind boggling big it is.&quot;, and the theory of where all the ball point pens go. There is also a part where a character turns into a penguin. There is some plot but more randomness. I would recommend this book to everyone who has a sense of humor. If you are someone who is ready for a laugh grab a towel and get ready for a story that is out of this world."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The random details that are found on every page of this book are really what make it THE BEST BOOK EVER!There is a story behind every little detail- and always a funny one. At first, with all of the jumping from galaxy to galaxy, it is hard to follow, but after a while you learn which details you should remember and which are just funny little things you can laugh at and then forget. This is definately the best sci fi book I have ever read! I found it interesting that some of the events made me kind of protective toward the earth, like how you feel patriotic on July 4, but this was pride for the whole planet. Almost every book anyone has ever reccomended to me I've thought was boring, slow, etc... but this one hit the jackpot. I wish somebody had told me about it sooner!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The book The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a book that I believe the reader will enjoy thoroughly. Douglas Adams wrote this book and it contains a sense humor that only Douglas Adams could bring. The humor in this book is somewhat random, yet is highly entertaining. The book has a somewhat hidden plot, but I believe that the theme is: \\"What if it were like this?\\" But even though an ironic book it is, it still keeps the reader turning the pages until it's finished. If you like this book, then read all of the books in the series, except the third one. I did not enjoy the third one as many people have, but found its humor old and boring. But I can tell you now The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is one of my favorite books."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Before reading The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy I was informed that it was a laugh-out-loud funny book, which would be impossible to put down. Some of those who recommended it to me said this book was the funniest piece of literature that they ever read. With a report such as this, how could I resist reading The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy when opportunity stuck. And I was disappointed after opening the first page. The book just was not as incredibly funny as I had heard, and could not draw a chuckle. Now, I am not saying that it was not a good book, the satirical elements, while once again, not laugh out loud funny, did portray the ups and downs of human life with impeccable accuracy.The satirical portion of this book made me enjoy it as a discussion of the human condition. In the beginning of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, the earth is destroyed to make room for a galactic highway, just as our the protagonist's house on earth is destroyed to make room for a terrestrial highway. After the protagonist leaves earth with a n extra-terrestrial friend, the reader discovers that the universe is a micro, well, macro-chasm for their planet. and thus the satire takes off. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy serves to ridicule everything from the political system on the earth, to natural history, monetary exchange, and the intellectual supremacy of humans in its short two-hundred sixteen pages, while the main characters zip around the galaxy in a starship powered by an \\"infinite probabilities drive.\\" And the action really takes off when our heroes land on the richest planet in the universe, a planet so rich that it would make planets out of pure gold and silver for clients who were wealthy enough. But don't expect me to tell you what happens therecyou'll have to read this book yourself!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy is the absolute funniest book that has ever been written. From start to finish, it keeps you laughing. Douglas Adams is an absolute genius for all the hilarious and creative plot lines and scenes that he has written in this satirical novel. Being a high school student, reading is not usually the thing that gets me excited or keeps me entranced, but the sense of humor in this book kept me glued to every word. The fact that the one piece of suspense left in the entire book was whose shoulder was hurt when a missile crashed with a space ship, but all the other events of the book are revealed, is miraculous. Why would anyone ever want to write about what a flower pot was thinking when it was falling from a space ship to the ground? And also why would anyone want to read about it? But the fact that Adams could think of and write about such a random thing is amazing and, oddly enough, hysterical. It's so refreshing to read a book that goes into space and could potentially be complete sci-fi, but is actually pages filled with jokes. It takes your mind off the real world and brings you into the unknown; where Adams completely writes like an insane man, but comes off as a genius. There's no need to look deeper into the satirical writing. You can just take the jokes as they come and literally laugh out loud after every page. The only problem with this book is that it ends. After 200 pages of laughing out loud, the book abruptly ends, but the good news is that it's part of a trilogy and you can continue with the next book, The Restaurant at the End of the Universe. Adams keeps you wanting more by ending the book so suddenly. But don't let that stop you. If you haven't had a chance to read this book yet, run to the nearest book store and buy it. Actually, buy all three books in the trilogy! Because you definitely won't want to stop after the first."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I absolutely loved this book from the moment I read the first page. Perfect for rainy days or when you are just feeling down. Definately a must read! Probably what I liked the most about it was that it was fun and enjoyable to read, and was not at all a heavy or hard book to read, unlike some other sci-fi books I have read. The characters and the plots are also very funny, and my personal favourite character is definately Ford Prefect. All of the characters are loveable in their own sense. You do not really dislike any of the characters that much, which is, in its own sense, pretty refreshing. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to read something humourous, refreshing, and fun. Though if you are looking for a serious, hard core, sci-fi book this is not for you. Recommended for Monty Python fans (as I am one)! Terry Jones from Monty Python actually wrote a book based on this, called: &quot;Douglas Adams's Starship Titanic&quot; which is another good read as well."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"If, like Douglas Adams, you happen to adamantly disbelieve in God, and if you spend your days and nights brooding on the absurdity of the universe, I suggest that you run immediately to the nearest bookstore and grab a copy of the The Hitchhiker's guide to the Galaxy!!

The very opposite in fact...the Hitchhiker's Guide is a BIG FAT FARCE, a satirical and completely twisted comedy about \\"life, the universe and everything.\\" I am amazed at the extent of Adam's talent...he has a flair for the insane and his entire book is a series of ridiculously whacko adventures in space...a totally nutty must-read!!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is definatly one of the best ever written.

But more than that, it is a story about a human being, stranded in the middle of the galaxy, on the most technologically advanced alien starship of the time, The Heart of Gold.Arthur Dent is that human of the Heart of Gold, along with Ford Prefect, Zaphod Beeblebrox, the ex-president of the galaxy, and the only other survivor of earth, Tricia McMillian. Nobody on the ship knows where they are headed, except for the most incompetent of them all, Zaphod. Even then, he still has no idea why he is heading there, until he subjects himself to a self administered brain scan, which reveals that there are two initials burned in to his brain, but whose are they? Meanwhile, Arthur Dent is trying to cope with the fact that his planet was blown up by a group of blood thirsty aliens to make way for a hyperspace bypass. But the biggest shocks of them all to Arthur, comes when Ford Prefect reveals that he is not from a city on the outskirts of London, as he once said, but is a field researcher for \\"The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy\\" and is the cousin of Zaphod Beeblebrox, and that Zaphod was the person who flew off with Tricia McMillian at a party in London. Apparently it is a small UNIVERSE after all. But when The Heart of Gold reaches its destination, nobody seems to believe him that it is the legendary planet of Margarathea in which half of the wealth of the universe is supposed to be buried in the underground tunnels of the legendary planed surrounded in myth. But will an ancient defense system keep them from reaching their goal?Everybody on the ship is there for some reason or another. For Arthur, it is the fact that him and Ford hitchhiked onto the alien ship that blew up Earth. For Ford, it is the same reason, but he is enjoying the thrill of being \\"on the road again\\" as he said it. In the case of Trillian (Tricia McMillian), it is the fact that she left the planet a few months earlier with Zaphod at the fancy dress party in London that he crashed. And finally for Zaphod, it was the mysterious orders that were what was burned in his brain to allow him to become president of the galaxy, and steal The Heart of Gold so that Zaphod can fulfill the requirements of the directions that continually pester him.The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, has a very complex plot, in which every lady, gentlemen, and its, make a difference in this story.

I decided this would be a good chance to listen to a recording of an old favorite that I've never heard in audio form before. Browsing through the library, it was an easy decision to pick this new recording of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.Within minutes, I could tell that I'd made a winning choice as I listened to Stephen Fry brilliantly share his voice to add texture to this intriguing story. Between the accents and the humorous references to irony, I was enthralled. I found myself wishing that the recording was a longer one.When you read The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, it can come across a little simplistically in places. Those spots work much smoother in this audio version.In fact, if you haven't read the book, I recommend that you listen to this recording instead. I think you'll enjoy and appreciate the book more in its more dramatic version here.If you don't know the story, Arthur Dent finds himself awakening with a hangover determined to save his home. Only problem is, while the demolition crew looms, he's also about to lose his other home, the Earth. Aided by his alien friend, Ford Prefect, Arthur is soon off hitchhiking his way through the galaxy in a most improbable set of circumstances that will amuse and delight you. You'll meet Zaphod Beeblebrox, one of the most memorable aliens in anyone's fiction.

This book was about a guy named Arthur and his friend Ford. Arthur was a normal guy, with a normal job, and a normal life. He lived in London in a pretty small house. One of his bosses was trying to bulldoze his house but Arthur staked out in front of his house, to save his home. When Arthur was just sitting there, Ford came up and said that they really needed to talk. Ford made him come to their local pub. When they arrived to the pub, Ford told Arthur that the end of the world was coming. At first Arthur did not believe him, but then he knew that Ford was serious. He got all the stuff that Ford made him bring. Then a giant space ship came and told every one what was happing. People were in chaos and then a beam came. Just before the bean hit, Ford grabbed Arthur and they teleported to a different space ship, that was close to earth. Earth was destroyed. What happened to Ford and Arthur on board this new ship? Will Arthur ever see his family and friends again? Is Ford really an alien? These are some questions that you could only get the answers by reading the book.I really liked this book. I thought this book was very exiting and very funny. I thought it was exiting because with all the conflicts, like almost getting hit by nuclear missiles, keeps you on your toes. I also thought this book was hilarious because Arthur and Ford always had really funny and random conversations. I was able to feel like I was in the book, because the author, Douglas Adams, always showed the characters emotions very easily. He also described the settings very vividly. I thought there really wasn't a main conflict, but there were lots of mini conflicts. I liked the book better with lots of conflicts then just having one main one. It made the book not at all boring. I could never put the book down, because it was so interesting! I thought that Arthur was a very realistic character because he was just a normal guy from London, who just happened to be the only survivor of the destruction of the planet Earth. I thought the books' ending was really good. It left of at a strange place, but Douglas Adams did a really good job of wanting you to read his next book.Douglas Adams hade a happier, more energetic voice through out the book. He always had funny stuff to say, witch made the book really interesting. I thought the author used a pretty large verity of vocabulary. He did not use a lot of super hard words, but he used some words that I have never heard before. I thought he used the right amount of vocabulary words in his writing. I thought the author had a very unique style of writing. His style was a lot more comic and had a lot more humor in his writing. I thought this made the book more interesting and not at all boring. I thought the author used a great amount of dialogue and the perfect amount of description. I liked it how there were more conversations in it, and how the book just doesn't describe the setting for hours and hours on end. I also thought he had the perfect tone through out the book. The author always had a positive attitude about stuff and he never made it ever seem droll and boring. I cannot think of anything this author needs to add to his book, I like it so much that I could not find anything wrong with it! I think this is probably the best book I have ever read!I believe that this was one of my best books, or even the best book I have ever read. It was filled with excitement and it had a lot of funny stuff in it. I believe this book deserves a 10 out of 10 because of how awesome it was. I think that his other books will be just as good, or maybe even better! I think this book is good for both boys and girls, but I think only people who are older then 11 or 12 should read this book, because it could be hard to understand for little kids. I think this is a great book and that every one should read it. If you like funny books and excitement, then this is a good book for you to read!I believe that The Hitchhiker's Guide To the Galaxy was a great book. I truly believe that Douglas Adams did a phenomenal job on this book. I think this book deserves 10 out of 10 stars. There was never a dull moment in the book. It all ways kept you on ur toes at some parts, and at other parts it made you want to laugh out loud!

The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy is no exception. The Hitchhikers Guide starts as Arthur Dent is saved from the destruction of earth by his alien friend posing as an out of work actor. The book really takes off when they are picked up by the president of the galaxy, Zaphod Beeblebrox. The main idea of the story is to find the ultimate answer to the ultimate question. The book does not really have a solid theme that can be identified, it is mostly random facts from the guide that ties into the story, and sometimes not at all.

This story strangely begins when the earth is destroyed by a Vogon construction fleet clearing the way for a hyper space express way.

Inside they meet up with Zaphod Beeblebrox, the two headed, three armed president of the galaxy, Trillian, an Earthwoman who Arthur failed to pick up and wnt with Zaphod, and Marvin, a parinoid android.

Space ships, galaxies, worlds constructed by large companies, petty government officials, petty ALIEN government officials all play their role.As a writer, and an older one at that, I am accustomed to books with a beginning, middle and end. I like to look at character development, story arc, and so on. This book has not so much a story arc as a story serpentine.I thought I might try out this random style of writing and found it is very difficult to achieve. People of my generation seem to want to make order out of chaos. However, chaos is what we have. And, one should at least consider writing about the world one has than about the world one would like.Adams is, I think, a pioneer of this random style.The book is very difficult to put down, once you start reading. It is entirely unpredictable. Yet the writing is polished, the text is well-proofed, and it is all perfectly clear.Now, what are the chances of it becoming the best-seller it became? Slim to none. I'd like to know how that was done."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This novel is about a human, Arthur Dent, on a quest through space to find the answer to life, the universe, and everything after he narrowly escaped the destruction of earth. Adams' takes the point of view of an alien so he makes everything humans do seem ridiculous. It apeals to science fiction readers along with those interested in philosophy. Don't pick up hitchhikers, but definitely pick this book up at your local bookstore....or on amazon."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"What can I say? Just read the book.This book is mandatory re-reading every few years (at least). I have no idea how many times I have read The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. I can tell you, however, that each and every time it is as funny, witty and cathartic as the first time. I constantly discover new things about it as I age, and I never lose interest.Since its initial launch as a radio show on the BBC in 1978, this creation by Douglas Adams has been an instant classic. In the course of its evolution, HGTTG has been a television show, a series of books, a film and a stage play. I like the book the best (with the original radio show a close second) and would recommend it to nearly everybody.This book is a must-read for virtually everyone. Don't forget your towel, and don't forget to read it either."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"It's not often that a book begins with the destruction of this planet we call home, but in this case it's the perfect introduction. It serves to illustrate that we Earthlings have been looking at the universe much too narrowly, and that its quite apparent that we are not the only living beings in the universe, or even the most intelligent.The story begins with the tale of Arthur Dent, a Briton and the only surviving remnant of human life on Earth. He was saved from termination by his old friend Ford Prefect, actually an undercover alien reporter so to speak, who he had always found to be a bit odd. The two find themselves in the bowels of a giant Vogon destroyer once they depart from Earth. As it turns out the Vogons we merely destroying Earth to accommodate the new intergalactic highway they were building. The papers were even filed at town halls if anyone cared to read them. From here it is one harrowing experience to the next with only one most important book as their guide, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.I really enjoyed this novel for its creativity and outlandishness. Some of the ideas are extremely surreal, and it keeps itself from becoming a cheap sci-fi story by incorporating scientific fact and semi-plausible physics."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I bought it as a gift and my 17 year old son loved it and wanted to give it to his friends."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is humorous and a bit advanturous. I can't say anything in comparison to the movie as I never saw it, but the book is nice. If you look you'll see that this author wrote other books, this one is just the first one of many."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Famous fiction books have traditionally contained certain elements; such as underlying meanings, morals, heroes and villians, allusions to previous works, parallels to situations in the world at large, etc, etc... This is even true for many of the early famous science fiction works such as those by Jules Verne, Isaac Isamov, and H. G. Wells. And then we have this book by Douglas Adams. Probably the most famous science fiction book in recent memory, it contains none of these elements. There are main characters, but one really can not categorize them as heroes and villains. There are conflicts, but not like those we think of that deal with the themes of greed, honesty, honor, loyalty, etc... And there are parallels to events that really occur, but they tend to be too obvious for anyone to miss. It is one of these parallels that begin the book; Arthur wakes up to find that his house has been scheduled to be demolished to make room for a new freeway. Before noon, he and the world discover that Earth is about to be demolished to make room for an interstellar highway. From there the story only gets more interesting and nonsensical. The \\"bad guys\\" are more laughable than scary, such as the poetry-reading Vorgons. The \\"heroes\\" Arthur and his Prefect friend are more \\"going along for the ride\\" than really fighting against or for something. And no-one really gets hurt in the story. The overall theme of the book is anyone's guess, though my guess is that there is no theme, much like life in the modern, industrialized world. The book itself is quite funny to read; any tears shed by the reader are those due to laughter. The best way to describe it is a marriage of dry English humor with science fiction and travel writing. Overall, I recommend reading this book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The book \\"The Hithhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\", by the imaginative Douglas Adams, is one of the most famous science-fiction pieces of modern literature. It tells the hilarious and ironic story of the destruction of the Earth, and the cosmic adventure of its only survivor, a regular British man named Arthur Dent, to the dead planet of Magrathea.Arthur escapes the total destruction of his planet, by a fleet of alien spaceships who intended to build a hiper road, thanks to his friend, Ford Prefect, a friendly alien disguised as an unemployed actor on Earth who's acutally a writer for the new edition of the \\"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\". After that, they go through the most improbable things that could ever happen in the whole galaxy, and, most improbably, get out of them alive.That's the strongest aspect of the book: the improbability. Douglas Adams catches the reader through the most absurd scenes, and makes the passage between those scenes very quickly, what makes the plot sound even more absurd. But that's not a bad thing, it makes the reader unable to stop reading the book, always anxious to know what could happen next, and it also adds a lot of humor, which is also very strong (and effective) in the book.\\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\" is a thrillig , exciting and hilarious book, but it is also full os reflections about the meaning of existence, and can really make the reader think. A must have to all science fiction lovers."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Douglas Adams' first masterpiece, first conceived while he was drunk, forgotten for six years, and then remembered again, broadcast as a radio show, and finally published.Online satire MMORPG Kingdom of Loathing has quite a few references to this hilarious book, such as the \\"awful poetry journal,\\" and using it will cause a reference to the terrible poetry of the Vogons. It goes something like this: \\"You read the awful poetry journal. In a desperate attempt to save humanity, your large intestine attempts to strangle you from inside. You lose 20-24 hit points.\\" It was a funny reference to an already funny Hitchhiker's Guide tidbit. And inside a probably random room of improbability, you just might see a whale and a bowl of petunias. Although having no reference to the number 42 that I have noticed, still it has many more satirical references to satire itself.Arthur Dent is the main character in this story, and his friend Ford Prefect (a humorous reference to a Ford car that many thought was a misspelling of Perfect) warns him of *gasp* impending doom. The Earth is about to be destroyed, so they hitch a ride on a Vogon spacecraft, (thanks to the Dentrassi cooks, the Vogons don't allow any hitchhikers on) but are immediately chucked off by the Vogons after going through hyperspace and listening to \\"An Ode to a Turgid Bee.\\" At least I think that's what it was.Floating in space for 29 seconds, they are \\"improbably\\" rescued by The Heart of Gold, a spaceship recently stolen by Ford Prefect's two-headed friend, Zaphod Beeblebrox. Having many mini-escapades, such as discovering the \\"meaning of live, the universe, and everything,\\" or just trying to find a place to eat, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a great, indispensable book that people from age 10 to 100 will like to read. (Although the younger sorts may not get the humor of it.)"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is pure fun! It's a great trip. The only problem I had was that at the beginning of the book I kept trying to follow and understand every little detail...which is difficult (if not impossible!). I read the first few pages over and over again trying to figure out what the heck was going on; it was very confusing. For people who are very detail-oriented and get frustrated easily, this is not the book for you. But, if you allow yourself to get lost in Adam's world you will throughly enjoy The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a uniquely humorous journey of a normal man, Arthur Dent, who finds himself wandering through space after the world explodes. Arthur and Ford (the man that saved him from the earth) find their lives twisted with coincidence as they travel with the Galaxy's president on the universe's continuously improbable ship, The Heart of Gold. As they discover legendary planets, escape genius mice, and fly at the very dangerous speed of R17, Arthur finds himself rambling through the endless adventure that is the universe.This story is amusing, but sometimes too witty for young reader, like myself, who are just becoming familiar with advanced books such as this one. Confusing phrases are omnipresent throughout this well-told tale, sometimes making reading slow and difficult. I know that when I read this book, I didn't even realize some advanced jokes, but sometimes I had to think about some of the wording and was forced to read on with these troubling terms in the back of my mind. One of these points was when Arthur and Ford first find themsleves on The Heart of Gold when the ship's improbability drive is on. Everything is random as I found out when a group of monkeys asks them if they would read their copy of Hamlet. This saying was troubling me until I found that it came from a saying stating that if 50 monkeys were put in a room, one would produce a writing as brilliant as Hamlet. This story may be hilarious, but sometimes Douglas Adams terminology goes over the heads of less expierienced readers.The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is surely one of the most entertaining books I've read, but it is also the most confusing and advanced book by far. The story may be at level too high for most Junior High/ High School Students, but for me, the laughs in this book far out weighed the confusion in it. The characters in the book were exceptional and the setting was incomparable, even for a less- savvy reader like myself. Every day I looked forward to uncovering a new chapter in this masterpiece.I reccomend this book to less-skilled readers looking for challenges, but mainly to clever readers seearching for absurdity and fun. Anyone who is a Monty Python fan will love the book, even if they're young, but it'll take an older advanced reader to fully taken in hidden coincidences, jokes, and metaphors featured in this book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"i really enjoyed this book. the movie was good so i read the book and i am pleasantly surprised that the book was a good laugh. i love dry humor so this is perfect for me. highly recommended"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Being a reader who\`s read a lot of thrillers lately, I have spent some time looking for something different. I have found that in this book. This masterpiece of a book has Good descriptions, funny jokes, tension, interesting characters, memorable places, and the most thought-provoking story of all time. And what more could you possibly want from a book?"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I decided to go back an read this series of books now that I am a little older and wiser (maybe); and I can not remember anything about them as it has been 20+ years since I last read them. It definitely consists of that type of weird British humor (e.g. Monty Python, etc.) that I have always been attracted to. It's a great combination of science fiction and dry humor that makes for a very entertaining read. It's also nice to know that the answer to the universal question of Life, The Universe and Everything is...42. Unfortunately, nobody remembers what the question is. This book is a fast and often hilarious trip across the galaxy. So grab your towel and remember...Dont Panic!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The best piece of pop culture of our century. A mix of sci-fi, Monty Python, irony and non-sense. Douglas Adams mixes everything in a way that the result is nothing but a masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"\\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\" is one of the funniest, most joyously quirky, quotable novels I've ever read. This dizzying satire takes place just after some outer space bureaucrats seize the Earth through eminent domain and blow it up to make room for an interstellar highway. Two humans survive the wreckage and travel through a Wonderland-like vision of the universe.The characters, situations, dialog and bizarre turns of phrase are all brilliant. I've read it a half-dozen times over the last 30 years and it cracks me up every time.The first two books of the series (\\"Hitchhiker's Guide...\\" and \\"The Restaurant at the End of the Universe\\") are by far the strongest. I also highly recommend the original BBC radio series from the 1970s that started it all."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"What can I say that hasn't already been said about this masterpiece of science fiction, fantasy, humor, and just plain brilliance? Not much but I can say that this book will never grow old for me. I've read it countless times, listen to the audio book read by Stephen Fry over and over, and laugh every time at the appropriate parts, and at some of the inappropriate ones. The Hitchhiker's Guide is a book that fans of fiction in general should at least try. I'm sure it's not for everyone though. There are several sections of the book that are confusing to say the least but I love that about this book and the entire series. It is one of my top ten favorite books and I am sure it will always remain there. If you read this and don't like it, at least you can go away with a few interesting facts such as how useful a towel is, how to hitchhike the galaxy for less than thirty Altarian dollars a day, who the smartest beings on Earth actually are, the purpose of Earth, and the answer to life, the universe, and everything. And let's not forget Vogon poetry, the Infinite Improbability Drive, Marvin, Arthur, Ford Prefect, and Thursdays. Just read it."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I usually don't fall in love with a book so quickly, but this one stole my heart and captured my attention right from the off. Its zany humour and imaginative characters really won me over, so much so that I intend to buy the entire series as soon as I possibly can. I borrowed this one from the library.)Arthur Dent is just your average man living on Earth whose house is about to be demolished. Naturally, he's very upset about this, so his friend Ford Prefect takes him down to the pub to converse and try to cheer him up. Oh, and also to tell him the entire Earth is about to be demolished, so his house is really nothing to worry about.The story then quickly moves into the far reaches of space with Arthur and Ford meeting many delightfully quirky characters when travelling throughout the universe. To name a few, there's Zaphod Beeblebrox, an ex-galactic president with two heads and three arms; Trillian Astra, a human who is well-versed in mathematics and astrophysics; Marvin, a manic-depressive robot; and Slartibartfast, an elderly alien from the planet Magrathea.Interspersed within the chapters are excerpts from the actual 'Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy', which aims to help wandering intergalactic hitchhiker's with certain rules and tips. These are just as wonderful and hilarious to read as the main story and it never feels as though the focus is being torn away.The pacing of this story is wonderful; it's always exciting and never boring, and if you're anything like me, you'll become so heavily involved in it that you'll find it hard to ever put it down.The only downside is that at just 220 pages, it's rather short, and the story does end rather suddenly -- which is why I'm anxious to get my hands on the next books to finish off the tale.In the end, if those are the only two negative things I can think of, 'Hitchhiker' is easily one of the best novels I've read.*****/*****"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"It was one of the most brilliant books I've read, but I wish one more person could give it 1 star!

In no way did it help me to fall alseep, but I loved the story, loved the reader's wonderful voices, and didn't worry about anything in my quest to sleep.The story is this, for those unfamiliar: Arthur Dent is an ape-decended mammal from the planet earth who's house is about to get demolished for a bypass to, well, pass through. Shortly after this but before the earth itself is demolished for an intersteller bypass, he unwittingly is hitch-hiked off the planet by one of his friends, who happens to be a roving research for the wholy remarkable book, The Hitchhicker's Guide to the Galexy, from the vacinity of Betelguse.Thus begins Arthur's journey across time and space, with the aide of a wholey remarkable guide.

I was sitting here reading the reviews and I decided to write my own review of the book. I think people who said it was too confusing had good reasons for saying it, but I think the confusion is the whole point of the book. Life is confusing, and this book is just a twisted version of life. I think people who said it was &quot;juvenile&quot; didn't really get the book. The point is that the whole world is &quot;juvenile&quot; and insane. Adults in the world don't always behave like sophisticated mature people, some of them behave like little kids or just generally act like idiots. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is just a version of the way Douglas Adams sees the world- an insane, messed up place where you never know what will happen next.I'm not saying The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is deep reading, but people don't need to read deep, thought-provoking books ALL the time. Last year I went on a seven-week trip and The Hitchhiker's &quot;Trilogy&quot; (all five of them) were the only books I brought that weren't &quot;deep&quot;. I don't know why I said that.I can't really judge how good it is as a sci-fi book. It probably isn't the best, but I've hardly read any other sci-fi books so I can't really tell.

Arthur Dent is an earthling who has had everything go wrong with him. His house is about to get torn down when he sees his old friend Ford Prefect, an alien that has lived on earth for fifteen years doing research on his revised Hitchikers Guide. Prefect comes at no better time because the world is about to end in eleven minutes. Just before the world comes to total anialation, the are picked up and travel around the universe. They arrive in Magrathea, which is just a factory planet for building planets for rich people. The people of Magrathea were woken up to build another earth because the previous earth, our earth, was a giant computer that's program was to find the answer to Life, the Universe, and Everthing. Magrathea was going to build another earth because our earth was destroyed just minutes before the answer was questioned. Since everyone wanted to know the question, they decided to re-build another earth to find it out. Once the mice, the secret rulers of earth, find out that there is an earthling alive, they wanted his brain. Arthur runs away and the mice are stuck with nothing. They make up a question and everybody is happy, or are they? This book opens your thoughts to many different questions we have about the universe and that we would like to know.

Douglas Adams does an encredible job of combining off-the-wall science-ficton with an amazing sense of humor. I recommend this book to anybody and everybody I come in contact with. The Hitchhiker's Guide series begins with an amazing twist. The main character, Arthur, comes in contact with an old friend of his, Ford prefect (really an alien form the vicinity of betelgeuse) who hitchhikes him off the planet right before a race of Vogons, (cruel aliens who write bad poetry) blows up the earth to build an intergalactic highway. But it doesn't end there. Arthur and Ford hitch their way, by pure luck, onto the Heart Of Gold- a spaceship with the latest in Alien technology, an amazing device called the &quot;Improbability Drive.&quot; The Improbability Drive, as it's name indicates, makes the improbable probable; and that is how Arthur and Ford end up cruising the galaxy, searching for the question to the Ultimate Answer..... Of Life, the Universe, and Everything....... with an ex-girlfriend and a long lost acquaintance with two heads.

I bought it, and it was one of the best books I have ever invested money in. I think, that this book is only for people who have a very (un?)healthy sense of humour... the logic in this book is less than non-existant, and it is even wackier than the Pythons most zany trips. This will be all."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"hey everybody,you really should read this book.."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This was the first really funny book I ever read.

I wish I had another one to start on today!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy by Douglas Adams is absolutley one of the funniest books I have ever read. The Adventures of Arthur Dent in this book are extremely hilarious. I picked up this book for school and could NOT put it down. Unfortunately, the sequels are not as good, but I recommend them anyway. This is definitely one of the greatest books of all time."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book was so funny that, though it isn't very long, it took me forever to read; every time I laughed so hard I cried, I had to put the book down. It's quirky, it takes unexpected turns, the characters are laws unto themselves, and it makes you start to wonder just what all of this is about."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I recommend the first and second books in this series. After that, I lost interest. Maybe it's just me. Anyway, it's a pleasure to read so long as said reader isn't dependent on plots, development, meaning, or other pretentious, out dated literary cliches. Just read it already. For something in the same vein, but with a message, i suggest 'The Sirens of Titan' By Vonnegut; a funny book that makes you THINK."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I read this book in the early 80's when I was in middle school. I just picked it up again for the second time in Jan 1999. I think I even enjoyed it better the 2nd time. This is the Monty Python for galactic travelers. Three things I've learned from this book: 1. A towel is quite a useful tool 2. In the scheme of things, digital watches are NOT that big a deal 3. Have faith. Don't Panic! This book is such a fun and light escape from reality, as are the rest of Douglas Adam's books."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"A brilliant piece of storytelling, Adams weaves his tale with ease...considering the fact that the book spills over to a complete trilogy (in four parts!). The brickbats, couched in the form of seemingly improbable events, are aimed at those of us who take Life a trifle seriously. The conclusion especially is marvellous!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Never in our time has a book of such caliber been written... and sustained such a following. The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy should be required literature class reading, as it is one of the greatest books of the 20th century. This is one book that noone should overlook."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The first thing Arthur Dent sees as he opens his eyes one morning is a bulldozer heading staight for his home. Of course, the destruction of his house becomes less of a worry to him as the day goes on. When you find out your best friend is from another planet, and Earth is about to be destroyed in order to make room for a hyperspace bypass, one tends to stop thinking about their destroyed dwelling. This book is histerical from start to finish. So grab your towel, sit back and start reading The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"As anyone can tell from looking at the other 500 some reviews here, this is a masterpiece of modern American Literature. Even though it's British. However, there are a few small problems I have wih this edition. Firstly, where's the green-alien-smiley-faced hitchhiker that adorned the covers of all previous editions? Secondly: well, acutally that's my only comment. However, just this book will leave you wanting more. I suggest the &quot;Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide&quot; which is all 5 in the increasingly inaccurately named &quot;Hitchhiker's Trilogy&quot; in one neat little package, complete with green-alien-smiley-faced hitchhiker."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I read this book two years ago and it's been my favorite ever since.

One day, the man is leading a so-called &quot;normal&quot; life, working, drinking, and just generally minding his own business. Then one moment later, everything he has known to be true no longer is so. He discovers that his best friend, Ford Prefect, is even stranger than he previously thought. The hitchhiking alien is about to take Arthur on the most amazing, not to mention life-saving, journey of his life through space and time. All this trouble is because some Vogons had been assigned to demolish planet Earth, which coincidentally, was also simply minding its own business.Genius Douglas Adams tells of Arthur's travels with a &quot;cast&quot; of hilariously absurd characters, like Marvin, the paranoid android, and Zaphod Beeblebrox, the president/most-wanted fugitive of the galaxy."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"For those of you that are core sci-fi fans, you won't find what you want here. For those of you that enjoy sci-fi and enjoy humor, this is for you. With the brilliance of any man alive, Douglas Adams combines characters with words and creates the funiest sci-fi related series of books known this side of the galaxy. This, of course, is the grand-daddy of them all.

All of them were great.Arthur Dent had just got up in the morning to see a big yellow bulldozer in his front yard. He then went to go lie in front of it. His friend Ford Prefect showed up and convinced Arthur that they had to talk and that it was more urgent then the matter at hand.

Besides the strange plot about a man who is taken from the earth seconds before it is destroyed to built a intergalatic highway. By his friend from another planet in another universe (betleguse) and then searching for a planet that makes other planets (one of them being earth) and then going to the cafe at the end of the universe. It really is the end as in the big collapse. There are also great charectors.

It still makes me laugh and other books pale in comparison. The great names, the references, dialogue, everything makes this book loved by almost anyone who reads it. Quit reading this and go get a copy. Otherwise life might have no meaning. I'll give it away now though. It's 42"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Ever since they were born, I have been reading to my two kids at night. Well, I no longer read to my 15 year-old, but continue to read to my 13 year-old. He and I both still enjoy the time together. Currently, we are starting on the 4th of Douglas Adams' triology, The Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy. I read the series and all of the other Adams books I could find years ago, completed the 5 part triology with my older son three years ago and am thoroughly enjoying reading the books out loud for the 3rd time. While the books are so comic as to send us into hysterics routinely, the great humor is built upon real human problems and ideas which are important for family discussion. I find that I can discuss things such as the ultimate meaninglessness of money and digital watches to the depth that my children wish to take the discussion. There is nothing in the books to upset them or me. Adams even has the decency to warn his readers when in the 4th book, a particularly mushy part comes up. In short, they are a great read for the family"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Unless, of course, you read the other books in Adams' Hitchhiker series, which you will not be able to avoid once you read this one. Not just one of the funniest books ever written, THGG is also full of bits applicable to everyday life (at least if your life is like mine). You will get a new perspective on everything after reading this one - or you may find your perspective perfectly suited to being transported on board a passing spaceship just seconds before your planet is demolished for a hyperspace bypass (and that's just the first 36 pages!). Just as enjoyable in a parallel way are &quot;The Original Hitchhiker Radio Scripts&quot; from the original BBC Radio series (ISBN 0-517-55950-1, Harmony Books 1985, may be out of print) and the 6 episodes of the BBC TV adaptation of THGG, which is still great even though it was made in 1981 (available from CBS/FOX Video in a boxed set with the paperback and two VHS tapes, ISBN 0-7939-5767-2). Try these if you've been through the series 20 times, like I have. If you're new to Adams' world, try the book - and don't forget your towel"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is about a guy who goes with his frend on a journy into space and try to be saved. The reason they want to be saved is because they find out they are on the enemys ship. I can't tell you any more because then I would give the book away."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"A highly entertaining novel. Extremely original and probably the funniest book I've ever read. I love British humour. I'm not a fan of sci-fi, but I'm not exactly sure if this qualifies for that genre. If you don't think it's funny, then you just don't get it. Can't wait to see the movie."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Now, I won't go into detail, but I will say this: This. Is. The. Best. Book. Ever. Written. It's totally original, but mostly funny. Yeah, the humor is definitely there, with tons of cultural refrences. You do have to be smart enough to understand the jokes, though (like the Ford Prefect joke, which most Americans don't get). Well anyway, there's my rant. Hope it inspired you to read this, or at least think about it."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is about an Earthman named Auther Dent.

The plotline of space travel is unique and fascinating. Tis book also tries to answer life's big questions in a very humorous, light-hearted fashion. One big problem I had with the book was the very abrupt ending that not only caught me by surprise, but was very anti-climatic. Also, there were some fascinating characters that we were superically introduced to that I wish the author had explored a little more. Overall a very enjoyable read, yet had some key elements missing."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I only give it less than four stars because it's so short and a bit disjointed. A throughly funny read, however, and well worth picking up, it should be rated four and three quarters or so.I read it again so I could go see the movie with the novel freshly on my mind. The last time I read the story was many years ago, and I have heard it as a book on tape (which was really good too).The humor is definately more clear as an older adult, if you read this book back in the eighties, like I did, and haven't read it since, it's time to pick it up again. It's not long and can be read in a few hours, it's worth a few laughs and at the very least will prepare you to see the movie that just came out.Cheers, and thanks for all the fish."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams is a very exciting novel about an ordinary man named Arthur Dent who is rescued by his best friend Ford Prefect before Earth is destroyed by the Vogons. Ford Prefect reveals one of his biggest secrets that he is an alien who is from a planet called Betelgeuse. Arthur and Ford then go on an extraordinary adventure in space with their companions Zaphod Beebelbroxe, Trillian, and Marvin. Zaphod is te ignorant president of the Galaxy with a second head and third arm. After stealing the Heart of Gold space ship, he is now a criminal. Trillian is a girl who Arthur once met and fell in love with but ran away with Zaphod. Marvin is a depressed robot with a brain the size of a planet. As you can see, Douglas Adams is very creative in this book and also has a sense of humor. The satire in this book is great."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Interesting,enjoyable book. I found it to be quite funny most of the time. It was hard to put it down once I started reading it. I have always enjoyed the \\"Man's sense of anomie, one person trying to fit into the culture of others\\" kind of scenario whether it be in books or movies.Dent is clearly that kind of person in this book. I like Adam's unusual sense of humor and his characters. The pictures he paints are vivid. The stories are implausible yet enjoyable. The characters are realistic in an unrealistic sort of way.To sum up: The book holds your attention, it has interesting, funny characters that were not formulaic,the story was fresh,and the visuals that he painted were good. All in all a good experience"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is, without a doubt, the most hilarious book I have ever read. It is a perfect sample of the genius of Douglas Adams, and his intense wit. A must own for lovers of sophisticated humor."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Well actually,i read the first 3 books in the serias about 2 years ago and i really don't remember that much,but i remember the names and the events,and i must say i laughed alot from this one and the other two after him,the serias is a funny Sci-Fi,the people who will enjoy it very much is a people with alot of humor,and Sci-Fi fans that don't really like all the drama Sci-Fi with all the understandable science facts,that is what this book is all about.it has a funny plot,characters and events all over it. the reason i only gave it 4 stars is because it's too damn short! i'm used to read books with 300-600 pages! what i'm gonne do now is buy the whole serias (i already got the second one and the third),and read it in a raw like a one book,maybe u should try it!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"No, fifteen stars, and an aditional two-thumbs-up for extra humor.

I can't believe how accuratey Mr. Adams described the world of a hitchhiker. Ford Prefect and I, yes, Ford is real, thoroughly enjoyed this enlightening tale of the galaxy.

Read the reviews by people who rated this book only one or two stars. If your impression of those people isn't that you'd rather kill yourself than sit next to them on a plane, don't read this book. Otherwise, pick up the Guide and find yourself back here and giving it five stars within a week."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"It didn't suck, it wasn't in the least bit boring, ball point pens ARE funny, and you're an idiot."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy is one of the books you'll never forget you've read. Whether you like it or hate it, you'll be reminded of it everytime you hear about a vogon, or why people on earth think that a digital wrist watch is something to be proud of. The Guide will give its reader a new perspective on a bunch of things. Being a science fiction story, it's as much a scietific story.In the book, we meet Arthur Dent. Arthur is a completely normal Brit living an hour outside London. His life is turned upside down the day when he finds out his beloved earth, his house, the pub is right in the way of the new intergalactic highway. We get to meet Ford Prefect, Arthurs friend since 15 years, who turns out to be much more than just a human being.The Hitchhikers Guide will test your nerves. Douglas Adams seems to be amused of the details surrounding life. I often found myself laughing at things I do everyday but never thought of before. I would say the book degrades mankind a little bit. But I'm glad I read it."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Overall, an interesting book, especially if you're into dry British humour, science fiction, things which happen for No Obvious Reason, inside jokes, et cetera. But as a story itself, the book gets average reviews...it was originally a radio serial program, and it sometimes shows. Worth a look, though."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"There is not much left to say about the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy - just to thank Douglas Adams for having such a piercing wit and being able to make us laugh at ourselves and everything around us. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys science fiction and humour."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Numerologists, time-travellers and sociologists - you will chuck in your profession having read this opus.All ignorant questions ever going to be asked by you are led ad-absurdum by this more than mystic genius, the answer is 42 and geleology! Reading this book was addictive, but the aftershock is extensive. NO book before gave me such a deep impression of real understanding what happens in this curious existence. A new outlook on life- has anyone declared a new philosophy naming Adams as founder? Stephan S."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I loved this book. At first I was skeptical because I'm not really into Sci Fi, But I was hooked from page one. Totally Awesome."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy is an impressive work of fiction. It's hard to write a heartwarming and hilarious book that begins with almost total apocalypse. But Adams pulls it off flawlessly.More than anything else, I think the Hitchhikers Guide is all about the absurdities of everyday life. All these things we take for granted, like mice and potted plants and fancy dress parties. What if they weren't normal at all? And what if they had more significance than we ever could imagine? Those are the sorts of questions Adams is asking.Arthur, Trillian, and Zaphod run into some interesting things as they try to determine the answer to the question of life, the universe, and everything, but it wasn't what they were expecting. Read this book, you might discover something unexpected as well."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Do you LOVE British humor, like Monty Python or Black Adder? There is a lot of dry humor in this book, so be prepared. Me personally, I loved reading this again. And because of it's portable size, it's easy to take anywhere, which means if you're afraid of people hearing you laugh hysterically from the bathroom, then don't take it in there. Be sure to look up Ford Prefect on Wikipedia if you don't know what one is. Neologisms abound in this culture-impacting, geek-required, hysterical masterpiece. The movie barely follows this story, and when you read the book, you'll discover just how challenging it would be to make a film as funny as the book and be the same story."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I liked this book -- maybe not as much as I thought I would, but still not bad. It felt like a book your strange friend from high school wrote -- the kid on the stage crew who would never miss an episode of Star Trek and who was designing web pages before most people had e-mail. The funny thing is that Hitchhiker's Guide was one of the first of its kind and had many imitators (like my strange friend).I was actually belly-laughing at some parts -- Adams is very good with humor. How else could you laugh at a book that begins with the needless destruction of planet Earth?!?For all super-intelligent shades of the color blue out there, this book's for you."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"By the strangest coincidence I left this classic at the office and was stuck at home reading Hemingway short stories. Hemingway writes about drink, and war, and illness. Adams, on the other hand, writes about drink, and war, and illness. One thing's for sure: Hitchhiker's Guide is not science fiction. It is also not science. Probably not fiction either. What it is is really weird, like the front page of the daily newspaper, only more enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"It has been said that Adams writes in one-liners. This is an unfair criticism (there are, in fact, hardly any one-liners here), but there is an element of truth to it: his writing is rather episodic. He tends to write scenes in not because they logically advance the plot or fit into the story, but simply to harp on some issue. He can also be fairly redundant. A good example of both these points is the unjustifiably lengthy scene with the cops--we get it, Adams, cops are dumb!All of these problems, however, improve significantly in later books in the series. And this book has great virtues also. Adams has a brilliant wit, and his dialogue is particularly excellent. His use of science in the book has been justly praised, though the line is blurry between when he's satirizing the more bizarre theories of science, or when he actually accepts them and just thinks they make for amusing situations.Personally, I actually thought the recent movie version was better than the book, as it preserved its virtues (the witty dialogue, etc.) and strengthened some of its weaker areas (the sketchy plotting, etc.). I know some purists who've been fans of the book for years will think this is blasphemy, and I can understand that, but it's kind of a silly objection for a story that's been through so many permutations in so many different media already."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Let me start by saying that I LOVED the movie. Usually, when you enjoy a movie you are bound to hold to the old cliche \\"the movie was good but the book was better\\". In this case, although the book was okay, I thought the movie was much better.The book was funny in parts and obviously was the inspiration for a hilarious movie, but on the whole, I was disappointed with the book. If you enjoyed the movie, I would recommend the book just for a different slant on the story.Apparently, people have been talking about this book for years. I guess I just don't understand how the book falls so flat with such a great writer. The story, the characters, the imagaination, all was well done, but at the end of the book, I was just left feeling empty. I couldn't believe it. The book just ended abruptly. There was no real climax and no resolution. Maybe you have to read the other \\"Hitchhikers\\" books to get the whole story. I don't know if I will take the time.So, just an average read that was made in to a fantastic movie."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This has to be one of the funniest books ever written. Why? Because it's filled with absolutely wonderful stream-of-consciousness style humor. And I mean humor! The kind that is legitimately funny. This will make you smile, even laugh. If you like wacky, off-beat, often surreal gags, you have to buy this book.Okay, so if it's so good, why not 5 stars? Why only 4? Because, truth to be told, there isn't that much of a story. It's kind of like a sitcom - the characters are so wonderful and throw out such gloriously funny lines, you barely notice that there's very little actually happening and you don't really care that much. Well, this book is like that. A series of 'incidents' that are really neither here nor there, but presented with a sharp, surreal wit, not least in the narrative, let alone the dialogue. Okay, everthing eventually ties in, but the joy in reading this is not in the world-building and grand storytelling scale of the likes of Lord of the Rings, but in the sheer delight of it's comedic value.It's an old book now, probably given a new boost of life by the recent movie (unfortunately, not that good an adaptation). If you enjoy wacky humor, you won't be disappointed here."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is by far one of my favorite books! It's just so well written and so funny. Great for \\"getaway\\" summer reading!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Many people who haven't yet discovered Douglas Adams' science-fiction comedy series are probably feverishly racing to finish this first novel in time for the movie's opening (as I did). This book has been on my reading list for a long time, and I'm grateful to the movie for giving me a kick in the butt and finally getting me to sit down and read it (which I did in about three days---it's a remarkably fast read). I can't imagine how they're going to adapt it to the screen, as the book is a goofy, surrealist jokefest that never once takes itself at all seriously. You can tell Douglas Adams was making things up as he went along, not pausing along the way to make sure anything makes a whole lot of sense. The story--or at least the book's main premise--is probably familiar to anyone who's reading this comment, so I won't bother with a summary (which I'm not sure I could do anyway). If you sat Woody Allen down and asked him to write a season of Dr. Who, \\"Hitchhiker\\" is what you'd get. I really enjoyed it without really loving it. I'll probably go on to read the other stories, but these books serve the same purpose for me as do P.G. Wodehouse's \\"Jeeves\\" series. They're the literary equivalent of junk food---they satisy a craving, but leave me wanting to move on to something a little more substantial."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhikers Guide was a novel unlike most i have read before. Along with intellectual inferences, came a light mood and un-used setting. How often do you read a comical story that deals with outer space, and the life that may exist out there? Douglas Adams knows his audience, and can appeal to everyone that is able to read. Being older, a reader may have more understanding of the scientific inferences, like the improbability drive for example. However, no matter how old the reader is, anyone can feel relieved when a missile is turned into a whale while in midair. This novel may have been humorous, but at the same time, a more educated reader can come away questioning all the universe really has to offer. Is there more out there? Adams writes this novel as a way to get across his ideas about the universe, and changes it from a science fiction, into a comical, yet throught-provoking literary work. I would reccomend it to anyone who needs a laugh."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"When I first set my sights on this book and after reading short synapses and positive reviews of what the book was mainly about, I thought it would seem interesting. This, I believe was the Fiction book I had decided to read for my reading class. After having finally read through it, it turned out unbelievably bad. I'll admit that it sounded interesting to begin with. Or the subject at hand sounded mildly interesting. And the cover kind of drew me in. But it became intolerable to a point. There were too many random things in the book. It was difficult to answer questions about the book, like the hidden meaning behind its entirety. I don't think there was a point to it. But then again, I guess you could call it an &quot;adventure&quot; book more than a &quot;self discovery&quot; book. Although the part that humored me the most was the depressed robot. I guess you can say I'm not a sci-fi fan. As much as I like watching the sci-fi channel, my feelings towards it is just like any other. It was dull and boring. Too much random junk in it, I like books that have plots and so forth. But if this is what you fancy, then so is it. By all means, read the book. But for those who share the same feelings as me will strongly agree that it was terribly made. I personally, don't see how it is considered one of the best books ever. Along with a few other books I've read who to me, weren't quite up to par either. Who judges that anyway? Its randomness not only made me bored out of my mind, but it also made me confused, talking about the &quot;Golden Heart&quot; and whatnot. I hope I don't have to read this book again. The book in a few parts seemed a bit repetitive. What I didn't like the most was when it talked about nothing. Seriously, it said, in a certain part that it had nothing to do with the story, or plot in particular. Which was more than a waste of my time.

The book shows how far the author can expand his realm of wittiness about aliens and outter space but one couldn't fail to notice the disorientation caused in the process. The invention of odd words, pronouns, and situations only makes it far from intriguing unlike it was intended to be. Not worth the hype given to it."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is marginally funny, at best. At its worst, it's just plain boring. I bought this book because I heard it was on the same level as Monty Python, nothing could be further from the truth, Monty Python has jokes, funny ones, this book relies on lame puns. Most of the time the book is just plain weird, some of it doesn't make a lick of sense, a hippie with three arms is president, people can understand any language in the universe by holding a fish to their ear, the meaning of life is 42, what the hell is that all about? Is this supposed to be funny? Seems there are only two schools of thought on this book, people who think it should outsell the Bible and people who use it for kindling.

In the end, I was truly disappointed. In no way did i find that this book was good. It attempts to make fun of the creation of Earth, praises the \\"intelligent\\" mice and most shockingly, pokes fun at the High and Almighty God. In the end, of course, the author, Douglas Adams fails miserably...except for the part where he worships the lowly mice. In no apparent way is this \\"wholly remarkable book\\" remarkable, or even close to being satisfactory. The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy is an absolute failure as a satire piece, and could not have been any worse as a sci-fi novel. How do you save yourself from something that is utterly boring - and miserably disgraceful?The plot is pointless, the characters aren't developed, and the setting...the setting is just messed up. There is no theme, no meaning for this book. The book is a complete failure and should not be recommended to anyone who does not want to be scarred for life, as I was."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The book begins with the hero sitting down in front of his house in order to stop it being demolished to make room for a highway. He's lucky he wasn't Rachel Corrie, an American who was killed by an Israeli driving a bulldozer. Her death didn't receive one per cent of the publicity accorded this book, which descends into a cycle of abstruse stupidity.

They won't make a fool of you."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"A friend recommended this book to me and, being an avid SciFi reader, I followed her advice. I eagerly read and re-read the back of the book, thinking that I was in for a real treat. I was wrong.It is hard to tell whether the author was intending the book to be science fiction or comedy. After re-reading passages several times that (supposedly) explain some of the 'scientific' elements of this book, some shreds of logic are able to be discerned, though this can prove difficult at times. While a few parts were admittedly funny, there wasn't nearly as many as I would have expected from all the hype.The characters were underdeveloped, and the plot nearly non-existent. You go through the book in a total state of confusion, and just when the plot looks starts to make sense, it falls apart again.I have a feeling that if you were to get a writer from Looney Tunes to create a SciFi book, this would be the result.Besides the major literary flaws, this book struck a nerve for me too. I get the impression that the author does not have a high opinion of Earth or the human race in general. It was Roddenberry's belief (the creator of Star Trek) that humans were the most remarkable species in the galaxy. While I realize that it would be arrogant and ridiculous for every SciFi work to hold this sentiment, in most we at least have a shred of respect.In The Hitchhiker's Guide, however, humans are dull (and if you're using Arthur Dent as a reference, I can see how you would come to this conclusion) and the only recognition Earth has are the words \\"Mostly Harmless.\\" \\"Mostly Harmless?\\" If they had given us just a few hundred more years to develop interstellar travel, we would have shown them \\"mostly harmless.\\"All in all, I would say that if you want a good SciFi read, with understandable plots, excellent character development, and plenty of laughs to go around, check out Animorphs (by KA Applegate).

I'm worried that if you let your children read this, it will make them think the world really works like this, and that you can talk to mice like they are people (no kidding -- it says that). Good luck teaching kids right from wrong after they've had their brains scrambled by this rubbish. At times I could not tell if Mr. Adams was trying to be funny or if he really thinks this way. I suspect maybe he needs professional help or something. I shudder at the thought of encouraging people to publish this sort of insane rambling as if it were a travel guide to outer space. I certainly didn't get any good, practical travel advice from this book.

If you want a quick read that has comedy try reading this short novel by Douglas Adams.The book puts in the universe threw Douglas Adams imagination. He does this unique style of writing where he uses another books passages and tells them threw the reading. By doing this you start to understand everything going on while your reading.The time that this book was published makes it hard for me to understand some of the jokes. So readers that where around in the early 80's might enjoy the book more than I did. Don't think that every joke is out of date, while I was reading it I was laughing inside. Adams made things obvious seem hilarious!The Flow of the book starts off slow and gains pace which makes you want to read on and never put it down.My overall opinion to this novel is that: it's easy to read, very comical, short, full of excitement, and has a shocking ending!

Frequently the silliness is true to life in that it is tied to burocracy (The sequel to the Hithchhiker's Guide computer game was titled Burocracy.) and the oddities in modern life. The story starts as Arthur Dent, a normal English man, wakes up one morning to find bulldozers outside his house. His house had been scheduled for demolition for several months and he hadn't realized since the plans were posted at the county office. A few chapters later we find that the entire Earth has similarly been scheduled for demolition by aliens who wish to install an interstellar expressway. So Arthur with no house and soon no planet is taken to outer space by his friend Ford Prefect, who it turns out was an alien. What follows is travel through outer space which turns out to be as absurd as earth. Irony abounds.The book was adapted from a radio show and this yields some awkward results. The pacing is very ADD. Seasons of radio went into the book, so originally this would have been spread out over a longer period of time. However the going stays coherent and jokes are fit to plot not the other way round as can happen.This is a book that you will love or hate. I loved it and I think it would be worth trying out."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams is one of the more odd but hilarious and intelligent books I've read. It makes you think about the way we live our lives and how we as people view everything. The book shows the importance of a towel and how the galaxy works in general and it was quite hard to put this book down. The majority of my time reading this book I was literally laughing out loud. The characters in this book are well thought up like the Earthling/main character Arthur Dent who just starts his day trying to save his house from being demolished so there can be a on-ramp built for a freeway. Also Ford Perfect, a researcher, who saves Arthur Dent from being blown up on Earth, since the Earth was in the way for an intergallatic freeway. The two characters go through amazing adventures in the galaxy and meet many other interesting characters such as the president of the Galaxy, Zaphod Beeblebrox, and Marvin, a robot who is extremely depressed yet very intelligent. If you want a good book to read that won't bore you or waste your time, I highly suggest this book for you to read."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Grab your towel, stick your Babel Fish in your ear, and set off with Arthur Dent on his tour of the galaxy. Still fun after all these years and the father of a million bad puns, this satirical sci-fi spoof is nothing but fun. A pity we've lost Douglas Adams, but his priceless sense of humor lives on. The man was as funny as his work - I had the privilege of meeting him at a convention where he was booed only once. He admitted to wearing a digital watch.

Many objects that seem insignificant turn up later, revealing their significance in the big scheme of things. The story, although funny, isn't necessarily an easy read. It reveals many details relating to other points carrying on throughout the novel and the whole series of novels. Douglas Adams take his readers through his points of view about the universe, which often leaves the reader saying, \\"What the crap?\\" However one can't help laughing at how ridiculous the situation is. The book is definitely difficult to put down.All who like science fiction will love Douglas Adam's Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. One does need to keep an open mind while reading the novel because Adams makes fun of most aspects of the creation of the universe that are popular to most people. If in general you have no idea what you believe and you do get offended is your own damn problem. After all, it's just science fiction. It's not like he means it! In closing, \\"life, we apologize for the inconvenience.\\""},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The downside of any audio book is that it does not give you the chance to pause for reflection. However, I fully recommend this book for two reasons: First, you could not pause during the reading of this book if you wanted to; it's that good. Second, Douglas Adams has a wonderful voice. It's a rare treat to hear an author read his own material and it casts a different light on a book than you might get just from reading it. It is an even rarer treat when an author is doubly blessed with a talent for writing and oration. If you enjoy this audio book, consider &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot; by David Sedaris, read by the author."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Suddenly a thousand gallon vat of custard upended itself upon them. This is just one of many unconceivable thoughts and events that occur during the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. If improbable and uncanny is your type of book I have one right here that you will love.As the first book in a series of unbelievable futuristic books, you are taken on a wild ride as the Earth is destroyed. Just don't forget your towel. As it is stated in the Universal Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, \\"There is a man who really has his towel.\\" Because of this, a person is likely to give a hitchhiker anything you want or need. During this adventure Arthur Dent is an unexpected human who, by chance or luck, is saved just in the nick of time. During his adventures he is taken all over the galaxy and ends up on a planet unknown to everyone, on a ship that was stolen by the President of the Imperial Galactic Government. This man may be the most unintelligent being around. The planet Arthur Dent is on is the planet on which live the makers of extremely expensive private planets. The ending will blow you away.I like the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy because it is unpredictable. Just when you thought it was over something completely strange and unbelievable happens and changes the whole story. Douglas Adams is constantly throwing curveballs at me. Strange as this book is, it presents a lot of problems that a person faces in life.If you like entertainment, this book is for you. The wild adventures and the inconceivable events continue to pile up, but don't stop there. As you read you begin to get a feeling of what Arthur Dent is going through. You become entangled with the characters and the plot. You are swept away with the mind-boggling chance occurrences that continue to pop up suddenly as though they were lurking in the dark waiting to pounce.Douglas AdamsThe erratic nature of this book, the immense entertainment value, and the qualifications of the author are my reasons for you to read this book. If that isn't enough, just think of the unbelievable quotes that you can rattle off while walking down the hall. If people didn't already think you were crazy they will now. So I leave you with a question to ponder; when faced with the dilemma of what to do when earth is destroyed, will you have your towel?"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is another one of those books I'd long heard about and meant to get around to reading at some point. Finally I was at the bookstore to get some gifts and decided to just buy the thing and read it. Since my edition was only 215 pages it didn't take very long. This is the kind of book you could read at the airport while waiting for your plane or in an afternoon at the beach, if you aren't too afraid of people judging you harshly for reading a sci-fi book on the beach.Anyway, a concern of mine was that this book would turn out to be too British. By that I mean British humor is often so dry and strange that it's hard for people from other countries to understand it, like when I recently watched \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" and it just didn't seem that funny to me. I have to say there probably is some of that stuff I just didn't get, but there was also enough I did get for it to be a hilarious read.In the universe according to Adams, poetry can be used as a weapon, Earth is demolished to make room for a new galactic superhighway, and mankind is only the third most intelligent species behind dolphins and another species I can't reveal without giving too much away.As for the story, Arthur Dent is a typical suburban Britisher whose house is about to be torn down to make room for a new road. This parallels Earth's fate as a race of ugly bureaucratic aliens swoop down to announce Earth is to be demolished to make room for a new galactic highway. (The plans were available in Alpha Centauri for decades. Didn't we get the memo?) Arthur is narrowly saved by his friend Ford Prefect, an out-of-work actor who's actually an alien. At the same time, the president of the galaxy Beetlebrox and his lovely human companion Trillian steal a new ship that runs via the Improbability Drive, which seems to cause highly improbable things to happen whenever it's used. The two storylines become intertwined in the search for the Ultimate Question.The Improbability Drive was the one thing I really didn't fully grasp in this book. The rest of the sci-fi terminology was easy enough to understand if you've ever watched \\"Star Wars\\" or \\"Star Trek\\" or anything like that. So it's not really a challenging read that way. The real challenged as I mentioned is picking up on the subtleties and nuances I'm sure are buried in there. Some scholars out there I'm sure have broken down all the novel's symbolic elements and all that.The only real problem I have with this book is that it's too short. I didn't feel like I got a good enough grasp of the main characters, their conflicts, and relationships. Because the book is only 215 pages it seemed like we only got an overview of Arthur, Ford, Beetlebrox, Trillian, and Marvin without delving any deeper. I suppose that will be for the sequels to delve into. At some point I'll have to read those as well. (I haven't seen the recent film version either because I was afraid it would spoil my eventual reading of the book.)Still, as mentioned this novel is a hilarious read and since it takes so little time to breeze through there's really no excuse to keep putting it off if it's been on your list.That is all."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I read the Hitchhiker's series for the first time when I was about 14 years old.

For interstellar travel, the single most important thing for anyone to remember to pack is ... a towel?Yes, it's that kind of book. The amazing thing is, Douglas Adams can really make a case for the Towel Argument, and he does. THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY is the funniest thing he--or most anyone else this past 100 years--ever wrote. It's highbrow, lowbrow, and ever-so-intellectual silliness that makes the book so entertaining. I'll never forget the dolphins evacuating Earth before its destruction (via a preconceived plan) and leaving behind the message to all the doomed humans: \\"So long, and thanks for all the fish!\\"GUIDE is also a textbook example of books that completely lose all of their power when adapted by high-budget, vacuous Hollywood movie churners.

Not because his verbal wit is matched only by his intelligence. Not because his characters are so oddly interesting. Douglas Adams is an incredible author because he takes abstract concepts of life and uses the science fiction genre to make them somehow understandable. I cannot count the number of times where I have been trying to describe an abstract concept usually relating to science or philosophy and I have used Adams' work as an explanation. Religion, space travel, time travel, the human body, and even tea have all been meticulously broken down by Adams razor-blade wit. The concepts that lie within are more than a story, they are a man's view of this world and the things in it. That man just happens to be a genius."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I just reread this book after ten yesrs. The first time I read it was in the summer after 8th grade. I wanted to see if this was as good as I rememder it and I can honestly say that I was surprised that this book is just as funny to me now as it was then. I don't think a book exists with funnier asides and narration in the entire corpus of the written word. This book is not about characterization it--if you are looking for that go read Orson Scott Card. This book is about blatant and unabashed mind-boggling creativity that with amaze even the most creative among us. Adama is truly a master at taking seemingly minute and trivial plot details and workign them back into the novel in meaninful and hilarious ways. That is why i like this--it is random, but not for the sake of being random, something I overlooked when I first read it.

After that they leave the pub and and a giant fleet of vogons are coming to demolish the planet, but aurthor and his friend hich a ride on one of the ships and are saved from total annihilation, then their journey begins.My favorite part of the book is when aurthor wakes up in the morning and starts getting ready for the day, and in every mirror there is a bulldozer getting ready to demolish his house. When he finally notices it he is sitting down eating breakfast. Then the next thing you know he is outside lieing down in front of a bulldozer that is getting ready to totally demolish his house.

His buddy Ford prefect, who he thought was human, but turns out to be an alien wisks him off of the earth just in time for an even worse termination.

The man who brought him there happens to be his friend, Ford Prefect, who happens to be an alien himself. Throughout the story he and Arthur travel the Milky Way having ridiculous and idiotic adventures with the President of the Galaxy, his girlfriend, and a depressed robot named Marvin.I found this book hilarious, and, though none of it made too much sense, that was precisely why it was funny. It had plenty of references to actual things, made fun of them, and actually made you think about what was happening to the human race,and that we really aren't quite as smart as we think we are. One of the key points of the book's plot is an amazing spaceship that belongs to the President of the Galaxy, called \\"The Heart of Gold\\". It actually zips around the galaxy using the prospect of \\"Infinite Improbability\\" in which strange and often ridiculous things happen, but return to normal once it's turned off. During one event in the book, The Heart of Gold is being tracked by two missiles, and seconds before impact, Arthur pushes the Infinite Improbability button without turning it off afterwards. The result is that one missile is turned into a sperm whale, the other is turned into a bowl of petunias, and the ship's interior becomes a garden, and is completely unharmed.Overall,I found this book, interesting, quite funny, and something that really makes you stop, look around an think to yourself, \\" What am I really doing here anyway?\\" I would really and truly reccomend this book to anyone who's seen Monty Python, called it stupid, and still laughed at it. I would definetly not reccomend this book to anyone who can't laugh at themself, or gets angry when they're confused. A word of warning to anyone thinking about reading this book: I had to read some parts of this book twice to really get what was going on, and despite this, I would really advise anyone resding the book to keep going if you get confused. The book usually explains what went on after it mentions it. Personally, I believe that if everyone who read this book and some of the ones after it got as much out of them as I did, they could at least be a little smarter about how they live, deal with the government, and think about the environment."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I can't believe I put off reading this for so long! Think with all the hype I just didn't want to be disappointed when I actually got to it, but I was surprised to find that it was even better than what I'd heard. It's kind of hard to describe what exactly The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy really is. I tend to agree with some of the criticisms that there's not very much focus on plot development or story here and that mostly it's a collection of really witty, punny, and sarcastic observations about humanity and the universe, but that doesn't really detract anything from how clever it is. Adams wrote this at a time when really there was nothing comparable. It's hard to describe the exact flavor of Adams work, it's certainly unique, but it does echo a lot of things that modern readers should be familiar with. Imagine, if you will, throwing Monty Python, Kurt Vonnegut (specifically Slaughterhouse V), and Chuck Palahniuk in a blender - and that about captures it. In short, by the end, I found myself reading not to find out what happens, but just for the sheer pleasure of listening to Adams.HItchhiker's is funny, light-hearted in spite of the backdrop of the story being the destruction of the Earth, and extremely well-crafted. Adams uses language masterfully, examining nuances and the connotation of words and facts about us that seems like an insanely chaotic metacognitive philosophical treatise with a thread of humor all the way through. To be sure, this book is nerdy and geeky in the extreme - I think a basic knowledge of physics is definitely required to fully appreciate all of the humor in here - even to appreciate all of the scientific creativity. Reading this as late as I have, I was astonished to see just how much of a cultural impact the book has had, from Babel fish to Deep Thought.Will definitely read again."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a science fiction novel by Douglas Adams. After Earth is destroyed, Arthur Dent finds himself on a space ship with his Alien friend Ford Prefect, the president of the Galaxy Zaphod Beezlebub, and former Earthling Trillian. They set out to find the mythical planet of Magrathea and have some fun adventures.This book is really amusing. There isn't really much of a plot, but the writing is very clever and humorous. As a science fiction nerd, I found a lot of it hilarious, and the characters are interesting and funny. The plot is interspersed with excerpts from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, a literal how-to guide, which give the reader amusement and an idea of the universe they've been thrown in to. I think this is the first book of four, which explains why there isn't really any resolution and many questions are left unanswered.The book spends much of the time focusing on why the universe exists. The second smartest computer in the world decides the answer is 42, but what really is the question? Adams says that humans are actually the third smartest species on Earth, after mice and dolphins. The whole book seems to be saying that you have to find out your reason for existing yourself. Go out there and hitchhike and find something to do with your life. The answer isn't the problem, it's the question.

But Ford Prefect, a friend and alien from Betelgeuse, gets Arthur out by hitchhiking a ship.They then travel the galaxy in the most improbable manner and become involved in the quest of vastly hyperintelligent pandimensional beings who seek answers to questions such as, \\"Why are people born? Why do they die? What is my purpose in life? Does it really, cosmically speaking, matter if I don't get up and go to work?\\"To review this book, I'll be answering the five following question: Is it entertaining? Is it educational or thought inspiring? Does it have an engaging literary style? What audiences is it or not recommended for? Would I read it again?Is it entertaining?This book is full of creative random, ironic, and cynical humor. If you looking for a good laugh, you'll enjoy this book.Is it educational or thought inspiring?For a comedy, it is surprising how educational and thought inspiring it can be. I learned several new words that I had to look up in the dictionary. Douglas Adams humorously targets topics that typically matter to most people; challenging and giving new perspective that can cause one to ponder.Does it have an engaging literary style?Douglas Adams doesn't suspensefully catch attention of the readers where they feel like they can't put the book down. Nor does he go into imaginative detail. Each chapter are short and meant to humor the reader. Two reasons make this book engaging: humor and the easiness to pick up where you left off.What audiences is it or not recommended for?I would recommend this for all general audiences except two: Children, and those who cannot stomach cynical humor, especially with sensitive topics such as religion, which sensitivity is what gives me reason to drop this book to four stars.Would I read it again?Yes.I hope this review helped you, and if you ever want the answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything, read the book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Stretches your imagination, but never loses its sense of humor. Fans of \\"Monty Python's Flying Circus\\" will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"One of my all-time favorite novels. Adams did some great editing work on early Dr. Who episodes before creating this masterpiece of science fiction humor. No one comes close to his quips! The characters from Zaphod to Marvin are hysterical. There really isn't any other author who even comes close to this style. Appropriate for all ages and a real page turner! This is one you will want to read more than once.NetherWorld"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"\\"There's an infinite number of monkeys outside who want to talk to us about this script for Hamlet they've worked out\\"Arthur Dent wakes up to find a construction crew outside his house, waiting to demolish it for a bypass. Little does he know, a Vogon construction fleet is outside his planet, waiting to demolish it for a hyperspace lane. Fortunately, Arthur's friend, an alien from a planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse, Ford Prefect, lends a hand and the two hitchhike away from Earth moments before its destruction. This is their journey.I Liked:The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a classic, the perfect blend of comedy and scifi fun. Adams is acutely aware of scifi stereotypes and what makes people laugh and has blended them to perfection.Our protagonist/hero, Arthur Dent, is a complete deconstruction of the \\"hero\\", the man who can elbow his way into everything and come out on top with ladies fondling him. Arthur is completely at the whims of chance and his friend, Ford. It's delightfully funny to see his reaction to being the third most intelligent life form on Earth and how positively useless he is to the Heart of Gold.Ford Prefect is a delightful \\"sidekick\\", who ends up being way more helpful and useful than most sidekicks. It is he who saves Arthur Dent, it is he who attempts to find ways out of scrapes, it is he who sticks his neck out on the line.Zaphod Beeblebrox is a kick in the pants to those who are interested even passingly in politics. I find it a riot how his job as president is to focus attention AWAY from those who have power. My absolute favorite line of his is \\"If there's anything more important than my ego around, I want it caught and shot now.\\"Trillian is your stereotypical damsel in distress/buxom lady, only she isn't either. A passing comment suggest she may be a physicist and a mathematician--far better than Arthur, whose only job is to \\"whine about Earth\\" (my poor attempt to render the book's words) and restate the obvious. She is competent, adventurous, smart, and not another objectified woman (though she certainly wasn't ugly, her beauty is not the primary attribute she has).The story seems rather simplistic, but I found it a riot, which is what I believe was Adams intent (that, and a satire to our world). Arthur worrying about his house being destroyed when Earth is minutes from destruction makes him seem rather petty; seeing Zaphod race after Magrathea for the sole purpose of fame and money shows his shallowness and makes a funny statement to our constant pursuit of the purpose of life. Having mice manipulate humans shows how we are so eager to make ourselves more important than anyone else and our inability to see out of the box of our self-importance.I Didn't Like:The ending is a bit abrupt and kind of hokey. But then, you really can't critique the ending, given what the purpose of the novel is. When I listened to the audiobook, I found it challenging to figure out the Hitchhiker's entries and the story.Dialogue/Sexual Situations/Violence:Mild profanities.Trillian is Zaphod's girlfriend and travels with him on the Heart of Gold. Arthur attempted to go after her, but Zaphod whisked her away.Earth is destroyed. Vogons torture people with their poetry.Overall:If you want to laugh, if you like British humor, if you have read a lot of cheesy/70's scifi books, you need to read this book. Heck, if you like to laugh and like scifi, you at least need to try this out. It's funny, it knows what it is picking on, and it is clever. I also recommend listening to the audiobook where Douglas Adams himself reads the book. It's a delight to see how the author intends the book to be read.Brought to you by:*C.S. Light*"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is a fantastic book for the teenage mind, especially if you have appreciation for mathematical or scientific concepts (but you don't need any background in either subject, just appreciation for it) -- and when your mind gets many years older, you will indubitably find yourself reading it again, as most of us have. This is the food your mind is craving, but didn't know what it was. It's not like other books you will find (unless you find a recent book that borrowed ideas and style from this). The style of reading is amazing, and the humor pops in at just the right (which is often unexpected) places. This was originaly a 4-book series, ending with So Long and Thanks for All the Fish, but if you get that far, you should also read the fifth book, Mostly Harmless. The second volume is my favorite, The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, which has the alternative meaning that you probably don't expect, and the fourth book, So Long and Thanks for All the Fish, is definitely worth the read. The author's works outside of this Hitchhiker's series are considerably different in nature -- maybe you'll like them, maybe not, but it's worth knowing that they are not more of the same. You can see that I'm trying not to give away the content. If you find another Hitchhiker fan, just answer 42 when they ask you a question, tell them not to panic, or ask them why they left their towel at home, and they'll understand completely. This series is a great conversation piece among those who have read it, and they often like to challenge one another's Hitchhiker trivia. You know it's an exceptional book when you love discussing it for many years after you read it."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Really enjoyed the book.

The jokes in this book are well executed, and some are the punchline to the whole book. It's pretty short, so if you're a regular reader, you'll finish it in probably less than a week at most, but it's definitely worth its hardcover. Great book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"i really love this book, adams is the master of wit7 comedy, and sataire in this book. it literally had me laughing out loud. this book iwll not leave you dissapointed in the least.:)"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is a perfect combination of science fiction and comedy. If you like these two genres then you are sure to love this book. I sure did."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Hilarious and entertaining, Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is an enjoying read. Filled with irony and amusing parts, the book is good for relaxing and taking your mind out of reality.Some of the characters in the story are outrageously funny. I especially love the contrast between the average normal human, Arthur Dent, and the rest of the relaxed and carefree characters. Arthur Dent is your average, don't have any idea what in the world is going on type of guy. Then there's Zaphod Beeblebrox. I mean how cool is that name?! Although he is the type of person you want to knock out because he is so idiotic. Even compared to Arthur Dent who does not have a clue what is going on, Beeblebrox appears to be THE loser of the galaxy. Last but not least, there's Marvin- one of the best if not the best character in the book. He steals the whole show away with his depressed mood. The thing he says and does is so ridiculous that I am on the floor laughing half the time. I mean when he plugs himself into another computer and the computer commits suicide- now that is hilarious.Douglas Adams' style is very simple and direct. It is as if he is discussing the story with the reader. While using sarcasm and jokes to make statements about life in general, Adams keeps readers entertained with his simple straightforward language.Filled with dynamic and entertaining characters and species, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is easy to read and one of the funniest science fiction novels I have read in my entire life."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Hitchhikers Guide is indisputably one of the funniest if not the funniest books ever written. While still sticking by science fiction standards Douglas Adams creates scenes of hilarity not only to make us laugh but to give us different perspective about this silly thing we call life.Though the story line is a bit complicated the first time around, this provides for multiple readings of enjoyment. We start with our main character Arthur Dent, who is having his house demolished to make way for a bypass and is then suddenly saved as the world is about to end by his friend Ford Prefect. Sound simple so far, well it's not that simple, in fact it's quite complicated. It turns out that his planet is being destroyed by the poetry-telling Vogons and that his friend Ford Prefect is actually from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse. From here Ford and Arthur are thrust into a world of obscurities and random events.With items such as the Babel fish, the Infinite Improbability Drive, and a spaceship named the Heart of Gold it's hard to go wrong. Adam's characters are especially unique. From the clueless Arthur Dent, who really just wants a nice cup of tea, to Zaphod Beeblebrox, the president of the galaxy who has three arms and two head, to Sartibartfast, the planet building man responsible for making the fjords on earth, Adam's presents an all-star lineup. One character not mentioned, but who deserves recognition is Marvin the Paranoid Android whose wholehearted depression makes the story even funnier.The whole story is not in complete narrative format, instead there are random moments in which Adams choose to insert random facts about universe as written in the Hitchhikers Guide, a wonderful book with the words Don't Panic written in nice friendly letters. Here Adam's true comedic genius shines and his style is evident through is humor. He uses short sentences to make understatements \\"space is really big\\" as well as long sentences to go off on tangents on topics such as Vogon poetry or the existence of Magreathea.In Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy not only will you find the answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything thing, but you might also find yourself rolling on the ground laughing. And who knows maybe one day you'll get to visit the restaurant at the end of the universe."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is brilliantly witty at every turn. You just never know what to expect next but you know it will be funny. Adams is a master of the dry sense of humor and communicates it in such a way that you can't help but laugh out loud. There is just enough plot and character development to keep things moving, but the real lure here is Adams' sheer gift for humor. I recommend this book highly to all who refuse to take life (or themselves) too seriously--you will be delighted as you laugh your way through this one."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Read the series and then watch the original BBC broadcasts on DVD, or listen to a copy of the radio series. This book is a classic and I suspect that we will never see its like again. Even though the author was given credits in the latest movie of the same name (he died some time ago), I hope that you will see the humor that made this a classic. Read and enjoy, if you do not get it the first time then read it again."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book made me laugh so much. It was great but the only bad thing was it was such a quick read."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"With characters like the liberal cops, the sperm whale, deep thought, the Vogons, the improbability drive and especially Marvin, how can a book go wrong? I have nothing negative to say about this book- it was pure, knee-slapping, laugh-like-a-toddler-being-tickled entertainment. I am not well read by any means, but Douglas Adam's books have made me laugh more than any other book (Joseph Heller's Catch 22 is the only thing I've read that comes close). The comedy genre is a difficult one to be successful in, but this author is clearly talented at using the pen to make people laugh. This book is the first in a series of five, and by far this book is the better of the bunch.I include my review of movie free of charge. It was horrible. Not only did it deviate far from the book (which isn't necessarily bad). But the plot, character development, attempt at humor and acting were terrible. I only finished watching the movie out of respect for my appreciation of the book.One last thing- where can I buy a Babel fish? It would save three or four years of my life (I am a missionary struggling with language study.)"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I've had friends and acquaintances recommending this book to me for years and I finally decided to read it before going off to see the movie version. Though the book might seem a bit disjointed, there is a plot to the events the occur. Arthur Dent is a typical middle-aged British male that awakes to find that his home is in the process of being destroyed to make room for a national interstate. Moments later, Arthur is saved from the planet Earth by his friend, Ford Prefect, just seconds before the planet is destroyed to make room for an intergalactic freeway. Talk about the irony.And that's pretty much how the whole book moves along. There are some wonderful witty lines spoken and keen observations stated about human nature. These are what make up the book's core. However, in all the witty nonsensicalness, don't loose sight of the plot: that this is a movie about a lost man trying to find his place in the universe. So, so long and thanks for all the fishes."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Guide is surely one of those books best enjoyed between the ages of 15 and 20, but I still had a great time with it at 25. Douglas Adams' genius is in gently but decisively subverting a genre while staying true to its best and purest roots. Thus, he dispenses with the dorky obsessiveness to which sci-fi is susceptible, using humor and non-stop action,The Guide is a tribute to science fiction and a paean to its great patron saints. Exploring space and time travel in an infinite yet incomprehensible universe, Adams offers a view of the universe without the self-importance and Earth-centered myopia of the human race. Yet just when the Earth is detroyed, we take comfort in the realization that the rest of the galaxy turns out to be populated solely by other creatures very similar to ourselves. No stone is left unturned, no nasty trait of humankind is immune from Adams' sharp, yet not quite caustic, wit.At a rudimentary level, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy appeals to the fantasy-addicted, carefree spirit of our inner child--the mystery and wonder of space and time surrounding us without all the baggage of the adult who has ceased to dream and look into the stars, content to rest on his laurels and in his certainty of death and taxes."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is quite a hilarious look at life, and if you haven't seen the movie yet I would advise you to read the book first - if not only to read the book and not see the movie, reason being that you will miss out on intricate details which are undoubtedly the best parts to the whole story ! If you dont have a good sense of humor, or understand why one would pass out if Mc Donalds was suddenly no more - this book is not for you."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I must admit that I went about this backwards - I saw the recent movie before reading the book. Having done so, I think the movie did an admirable job in portraying the story at heart; but reading the book is an even more enjoyable experience. Douglas Adams' sci-fi satire is a blend of all the best of every world.\\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\" is the story of Arthur Dent, an earthman who discovers one Thursday (while trying to keep his house from being bulldozed) that his close friend, Ford Prefect, is from another planet, and that in a matter of minutes, Earth will be destroyed. The two hitchhike a ride on the Vogon ship that destroys Arthur's home planet just as said destruction is taking place. What follows afterwards is a wild ride through the universe with the President of the Imperial Galactic Government, Zaphod Beeblebrox, an earthgirl whom Arthur struck out with at a party, and the robot Marvin, who has been given a Genuine People Personality, and is therefore depressed by everything. Their travels bring them to find out who was behind the destruction of Earth, the answer to Life, the Universe and Everything, and just who happened to be the most intelligent being on Earth before it was destroyed.There's no doubt why Adams' classic satire has become such a classic. The story is witty, laugh-out-loud funny and, oddly enough, one that readers can identify with. I look forward to reading the books that follow for more instructions on how to not panic."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book was one of the best I have ever read! The humor and suspense are both very powerfull. It defineately makes you wonder. A great read!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Now I know that this book is supposed to be a \\"trilogy in five books\\" but I can't help but feel a little cheated by the way this one ends. There is little in the way of closure and all I got from the ending is speculation. This doesn't mean that I hated the book though. Far from it, I enjoyed this book thoroughly. Douglas Adams really has a knack for writing in a drool manner that I found to be very amusing. The humor is very good and, I suppose, very British. The story shouldn't be taken seriously, but I guess that's where appreciation ends and geekdom officially begins. All I'm saying though is that I didn't get everything I could possibly want in terms of story but that's okay. Because I can't wait to get my hands on the next couple of books."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy is a great book for all ages. Arthur Dent is about to get his house knocked down, which he is very mad about. Then his friend, Ford Perfect who is from a different planet, tells Arthur that the Earth is going to be destroyed, to make way for a space highway. Ford Perfect is a researcher for the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, and he wants to update the book to be more up-to-date. Arthur and Ford hitch a ride with the Vogons, rights before the world explodes, and are almost immediately thrown out. They hitch another ride, with the president of the galaxy, who stole the fastest space ship ever made, coincidentally, Arthur finds his friend Trillian aboard too, he had met her one day at a party. After that they go on many journeys and mishaps, which make the book incredibly funny. Every character in this book is great, and adds humor to every page, Arthur who is a regular human, Ford Perfect his friend, and Zaphod Beeblebrox. Zaphod Beeblebrox is one of the most interesting characters because he ahs 2 heads, and 3 arms. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a book full of humor, and also a reader who enjoys reading science fiction books."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is hilarious! It's about two people who live on Earth named Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect, but Ford Prefect is from a distant planet. Moments before the Earth gets blown up to make way for a galactic freeway, Arthur and Ford hitch a ride from some aliens and escape annihilation. When the aliens dump them into space, they get picked up by another spaceship. That spaceship was called the Heart Of Gold, the most technologically advanced spaceship in the universe. Before Arthur and Ford got pickied up by the Heart of Gold, the ship was stolen by the president of the galaxy who is a two headed, three armed ex-hippie named Zaphod Beeblebrox. On the ship there is a genius but clinically depressed android named Marvin. In my opinion he is the funniest and most memorable charactor in the book. Together, Arthur, Ford, Zaphod, and Marvin go on a hilarious adventure full of excitment, thrills, and laughter. The ending is something that you would never expect and you will have to read the book to now what it is. This is just the first book in the series of 13 books written by Douglas Addams."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a novel that could be enjoyed by anyone of all ages. I thought this book was exciting and full of energy. I felt it was upbeat and amusing. The characters are realistic in an unrealistic sort of way. I like Adam's unusual sense of humor and his characters. Author Dent was a quiet and normal human living on earth. Author never really adjusted to being a hitchhiker. He was satisfied with the way he existed on earth. Then there was Zaphod Beeblebrox. He was an alien that was a joking, reckless President of the Imperial Galactic Government. Zaphod was rather full of himself and never seemed to have a worry. Another character is Marvin. He is a depressed robot that never had a positive outlook on anything. Also there was Ford Perfect. He was the easygoing semi-cousin to Zaphod. He is just a guy that went with the flow of things.It was hard to put the book down once I started reading it. The pictures he painted were vivid and creative. The stories are unlikely yet extremely enjoyable. I loved the jokes about bureaucracy around the galaxy. I have never read a book that had such original ideas and characters. The storyline kept me guessing and I was always pleasantly surprised. It seems, to me, that it appeals to \\"nerdy\\" people. Besides that, I thought the book was outstanding. Everyone I know that has read it loved it just as much as I did.

I can't stand reading more than one book twice. Something about how the plot is given away; there is no surprise. Douglas Adam's Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy is one execption to this rule of mine. I must have read this book 20 times, and delight in reading it yet again. There is something about the wit put into it, the way the words are set up... This irresistable book is certainly one that I can't put down again and again.All of his books are full of orginality and humour like no other. The literature captures my attention and never lets it go, something that is truly remarkable. The detail emitted into each page is brilliant. The way that this author could add random stories about creatures of the galaxy, add different quite random items to the plot, and still have it make sense is a pure mystery to me. The characters are relateable, the plot is capturing, and the end leaves you craving for more.This book is good for all ages by me.

The hero, Earthling Arthur Dent, is rescued by researcher Ford Prefect, just before Earth is blown up to make way for the building of an intra-galactic superhighway. No matter that the myriad forewarnings were placed in a location absolutely no one on Earth ever heard about.

The jokes are very humorous and make fun at things like poetry and pessimistic behavior. I like the humor even more because Douglas Adams puts it in when Ford and Arthur are in a perilous situation. Even if the humor were taken out, it would still be a good book. There is a lot of adventure that Ford and Arthur endure. All in all it is one of the books that I have actually liked.

Not having a lot of time on my hands to read (although I enjoy reading very much), I am rather selective about what I do read. I have found it very difficult to put this book down. I read it in bits and pieces throughout the day, taking it with me wherever I go. I've read it at home, in the Doctor's office, sitting in my car while waiting to go into a company for a job interview, and just about anywhere else.

You're having a bad day - and it's going to get worse.As you lay in front of the bulldozer trying to block its path, your best friend, Ford Prefect, who you always thought was an out-of-work actor, pops up and reveals that he really is an undercover alien from the star Betelgeuse. But wait -- things are going to get even worse.Ford tells you that a rocketship conducted by evil aliens called Vorgans are going to blow up Planet Earth in five minutes to make way for a galactic freeway.That's how one terrible, horrible, no-good, very bad Thursday begins for chronic worrier Arthur Dent, a 30-year-old Brit bored with his job at a local radio station. When we meet him in the book The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Arthur Dent suddenly has no reason for boredom and every reason to worry.So what does he do? Following the advice of his friend the undercover alien, he sticks his thumb up to hitchhike aboard the spaceship that belongs to the evil, nasty Vorgans. Arthur and Ford are smuggled in by the Vorgans' servants -- but the Vorgans, who hate hitchhikers, find them and throw them off the ship and into probable death in outer space.The two happen to be carrying a copy of a book called the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, which warns them that life can only survive 30 seconds in space without air. On the 29th second, they are picked up by another ship -- and there's something special about this ship. It has the magical ability to change your atmosphere, turning illusions into reality - for example, transforming two missiles into daisies.This ship is named The Heart of Gold, and it's been stolen by ex-hippie Zaphod Beeblebrox, who was born on the Star Betelgeuse. He has three arms and two heads and is the spacey president of the galaxy. Also on the ship are his girlfriend Trillian and a chronically depressed robot named Marvin.The ship sails to Planet Magrathea. The planet that created all other planets. There they go through many illusions, being knocked out by walls closing in, jetting at the speed of light down narrow hallways in mini-spaceships, and many other exciting adventures.At the end we find out that mice have run Earth for an experiment and are about to steal Arthur's brain, but they soon defeat them.This book is a cliffhanger that leaves its characters stranded on Planet Magrathea. - a sure way to make readers want to continue reading the sequels in the trilogy."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the GalaxyI got this book a few weeks ago from my school library and finished the book in about a fortnight around all my school work and playing football, that just shows you how much I loved this book.

The general idea of this book is bizzar; mice are running the planet earth, aliens that can write poetry, and spaceships that commit suicide. I don't know where to begin. Well first, structurally the book is terrible. Adams jumps from character to character and finally by page 215 (out of 216 pages) it becomes apparent that this book is just going to end abruptly. (This may actually be the only good thing about the book, is that it is short, and a long ending that makes some sense would simply be tedious to read). Adams obviously wrote these 216 pages to make 5 jokes maybe 2 of which are truly funny. However, to hear these jokes are not worth sacrificing your time to read all the trash encompassing the random stabs at humor. In order to completely \\"understand\\" the complex world which Adams has created, you must read page long \\"history lessons\\" to get the background of different types of aliens, planets, and spaceships.I must admit I was misled from the beginning, I thought that this book was actually \\"The Guide to the Galaxy.\\" However, I was disappointed to find that Adams's book is only referring to a made up book that explains useless knowledge to ficticious characters. Therefore making this book even more useless!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"i was deeply disappointed with this book, it does not live up to all the hype i have read and heard about this book for years. i found it silly and contrived. not at all thought provoking as it is suggested. don't buy much less read it."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I'd give this a NEGATIVE 5 star rating if I could.

It was an easy, quick read and was a good way to pass some time at my boring job. However, this book also had a lot of shortcomings. For one thing, the concept of literally Hitchhiking across the galaxy is cheesy, especially when the hitchhiker just uses a device to latch onto a passing spaceship. Also, the dialogue was terrible. The humor was nothing but bad British wit which the flimsily constructed character's angrily spewes at one another. However, the book was fun to read, so I won't be too harsh. There was more good than bad. I don't plan on reading the rest of the series though."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"There is one, and only one, word to describe this book and that is insane, beyond all reason I might add. I have just got done reading angels and demons and two of the books in the dune series and this was a nice break. It was a rollercoaster that throws your head into an intoxicated spin of laughter and pure ludicrous adventure, but without the glare of the sun and the long lines. I highly suggest this book for anyone with a few hours to spare, since once you pick this book up you can not stop reading it. For all of you that wish for supposedly \\"cultured\\" and \\"intellectual\\" reading don't read this book please and give an abhorring review as some have done.

Only Douglas Adams could make me laugh at astrophysical jokes and satire. His vision is spastic, ridiculous, and fantasticly clever.

One of the last of the two remaining humans happens to hitch a ride on a vogon space ship(the vogans destroyed the earth).

It is worth it."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I picked A Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy off of a list of classic novels or something like that, having no idea who Douglas Adams was or how significant the book was. I was pleasantly surprised, and now know where several popular phrases originated.The book begins with humanoid Arthur Dent waking up and finding a bulldozer in his yard about to demolish his house to make room for a highway. Arthur is understandably upset, but this doesn't really matter considering the fact that unbeknownst to the human race, earth is about to be destroyed to make room for a hyperspace bypass. Arthur is rescued from the fate of earth by his friend Ford Prefect, who it turns out is an alien who knows how to hitch rides on spaceships. With their jump into space, Arthur and Ford are launched into a round of interstellar escapades, accompanied by the egotistical but lovable Zaphod Beeblebrox, his girlfriend Trillian (who happened to have come from earth), and Marvin, the perpetually dismal android with a &quot;brain the size of a planet&quot;.A Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy makes an interesting combination of two genres- science fiction and comedy- and it works marvelously. The plots moves along quickly, making it an easy read, and also providing opportunities for multiple readings to catch all the humor. A Hitchhiker's Guide is imaginative, witty, and in places downright hilarious. In addition to this, the writing is very intelligent without being overbearing; the book gently prods at several of our own silly social conventions in a comical and lighthearted way. A Hitchhiker's Guide was a delightful read, and I heartily recommend it- to sci-fi lovers and non.One word of advice; don't waste precious mental energy trying to understand how an Infinite Improbabily Drive works, or any of the many other gadgets in the book, because this isn't the sort of book where it matters whether you understand how things work or not. I realized about a quarter of the way through the book that I was taking things much too seriously and that the ludicrous descriptions were placed there mostly for comic effect."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, by Douglas Adams, is the first in a five-book trilogy. (Yes, a five book trilogy.) In this book, an average Englishman named Arthur Dent learns of a plan to blow up the Earth to make way for an intergalactic bypass. His friend, who is from Betelgeuse Seven (and not Guildford as he claimed) helps him hitchhike off to the spaceships that destroy Earth. He then goes on a wild series of adventures, which are chronicled in this book.I like this book because it has a very strange sense of humor, and yet it has its own logic, which can be understood if one tries hard enough. It also has a cast of unique and semi-realistic characters. I also like how Adams uses some very strange analogies, such as \\"he felt like a man getting mugged in a meadow.\\" These analogies are not only comical and awkward; they also fit perfectly into the moment. They also perfectly convey the meanings. This book, in conclusion, is a very interesting read for anyone who likes anything related to hitchhiking, space, or any form of comedy whatsoever."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by the late Douglas Adams is perhaps one of the most indescribable books that I've come across in my readings. Douglas Adams in decidedly brilliant. His droll wit and sense of humor will definitely put a smile on your face.The story is somewhat complex. Without giving much away, human Arthur Dent is rescued from Earth just minutes before it's destruction by his friend Ford Prefect, an alien from somewhere in the area of Betelgeuse VI. Arthur and Ford (after some very funny encounters) come across Zaphod Beeblebrox (the two headed, three armed President of the Galaxy) and Trillian (aka Trisha McMillian, Zaphod's human girlfriend and a girl who Arthur had tried to pick her up at a party on Earth) and Marvin, a manically depressed robot.Adams' humor is more of the ironic sort then the laugh out loud type. Adams will give you a seemingly random excerpt from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (the encyclopedia which, in the novel, is a central component) or a very detailed description of the thoughts of, say, a potted plant, which has seemingly no relevance to the story. But never fear, Adams brings everything together in an exciting and funny climax to the first novel of his increasingly inaccurately named series.From an analytical standpoint, the novel is a satire on the sterotypical british character - dull, complacent, emotionless. Arthur Dent can be classified as any of those. His only true emotional outbreaks come when his life is endanger (which it quite often is). The reader will enjoy watching Arthur's character grow and change. Fortunately, his character does not change too much over the course of the novel (his character is still the well-meaning but accident prone, unemotional hero that you will come to know and love).Again though, it's hard to describe The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. As is said in the book, space is big. Like really big. Like really really mind boggingly big. It's like so big that it's just unimaginable. And so is Douglas Adams novel.I would like to take this moment to thank Douglas Adams for his work and to say &quot;God rest his soul.&quot; We will miss you."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I have read The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy and I thought it was hilarious. The Guide uses a genius blend of comedy and action to create a great flow of a story. Douglas Adams uses many large and complicated words so the reader has to figure out what these funny words say. When Earth is destroyed, the two friends Ford and Arthur must hitchhike throught the galaxy. The story follows these two friends and the hardships thay endure in there journey through the galaxy. I liked this book was very good and I recomend it for all who love a good laugh."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Adams exposes the truth: &quot;In the beginning, the universe was created. This made a lot of people very angry, and has been widely regarded as a bad idea.&quot;What else matters after this revelation?The incomprehensible world makes perfect sense as you follow Arthur Dent around the galaxy, just a step ahead of becoming galatic roadkill in a sidesplitting tour de force!Grab your Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster, strap yourself in, and enjoy the ride... Oh, and don't forget to bring a towel!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Douglas Adams did a stunning job writing a sci-fi humor for radio production.I recommend buying the individual paperbacks instead of the compendiums for a variety of reasons. Basically, Adams is a humorist best savored in small chunks - watered down with a pan-galactic gargle blaster.I also recommend you obtain the audio version as played on BBC."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is definately one of my most favortie books. Like a good movie, you can read it again and again and find something new to love about it every time. Be careful reading this in public. People might think you're a little strange as you keep laughing out loud every minute or two. If you've never read this book, make sure you give it a try. I'm sure you'll love it too."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is amazing! Douglas Adams is an amazing writer. It's funny and intelligent at the same time. I've never laughed out loud while reading before this book. I recomend this book to anyone that enjoys a good laugh. It gets confusing at times with the whole concept of space travel, but stick with it and it's worth it. It really makes you think and there are few books that can be funny at the same time. And if you like this one, you'll love the other sequels even more. The books get funnier as you go too. Everything about this book is great. Especially the manic depressive robot, Marvin. To give a glimpse into the amusing nature of this trilogy, the man that really rules the universe says, &quot;I think fish is nice, but then I think that rain is wet, so who am I to judge.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Every field of cultural endeavor has its own mischievous sprites: Ogden Nash in poetry, Andy Warhol in art, Alan Sherman and Randy Newman in pop music, Blake Edwards and the Farrelly brothers in cinema. Douglas Adams, whose improbable initials were DNA, would have to be regarded as one literature's mischief-makers, and his escapades begin with THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY, a classic that's as much about humor as science fiction.Consider the underlying plot circumstances: the world's most powerful computer has spent seven and a half years determining that The Answer to the great question of \\"life, the universe, and everything\\" is 42, but that same computer admits it cannot determine what the question is. The planet architects of Magrathea are enlisted to design a planet, Earth, that will become the centerpiece of a 10 million year experiment to find the question. Unfortunately, five minutes before the experiment is completed (and the question found by a girl sitting alone in a small caf&eacute; in Rickmansworth), the Vogons demolish the planet Earth (unnecessarily, as it turns out) to clear a path for the hyperspatial express route through the outer reaches of the galaxy.Thus begins the adventures of one Arthur Dent - a perfectly ordinary Earthman and the sole human survivor of the demolition - and his friend Ford Prefect (named after a late 1940's Ford automobile), who turns out to be a field researcher for the indispensable Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Along the way, they meet one Zaphod Beeblebrox, President of the Galaxy who has just become a hunted thief for stealing the Heart of Gold, the most improbably remarkable car in the galaxy powered by an Infinite Improbability Drive.Of course, all this science fiction foolishness is just a cover for Adams's real purpose, to satirize every sacred cow in our culture from religion and philosophy to evolution and technology. Nearly every page contains a droll comment, a cutting remark, or just an offbeat observation about the inherent oddity of life. Most of them will make you smile, and some may even make you laugh. Added to all this, Adams gives us talking white mice, a terminally depressive android named Marvin, a universal language translator in the form of a Babel fish, and a planet builder named Slartibartfast who specializes in fjords and got an award for designing Norway.THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY is great fun, sort of a reader's Monty Python. It's a bit like reading a comic book without the pictures, a guilty pleasure that's difficult not to enjoy as a break from more serious work. Then again, Doug Adams's greatest accomplishment may have been being serious without seeming to be, telling us not to take ourselves so seriously. Who else could have had the Earth's population of dolphins escaping the planet just before its destruction, saying goodbye to humanity with the message, \\"Goodbye, and thanks for all the fish.\\"Buy a copy, bring a towel, and \\"Don't Panic!\\" Just like Earth, it's \\"mostly harmless.\\""},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"yes sir, this is a jolly good read, from a very creative British mind, the one, the only Douglas Adams.Guaranteed to make you laugh, and also philosophize. The universe has never been so much fun and so wacky.Great characters. My favorite was Slartibartfast, from the planet Magrethia. Good stuff. And of course Marvin the Robot is irresistible in his depressing way. Arthur Dent is a favorite Earthman hero, finding out that reality is a bit bigger than he had previously imagined.Read this, and make sure you bring a towel. This guide will teach you how to be a hitchhiker, and how."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"If you're looking for something that will make you laugh, don't hesitate- get this book and the rest of the trilogy. Simply some of the flat out tears-in-your-eyes-laugh-out-loud funniest books ever written. Classic science fiction in Adams' British humor. Made into a (now rarely broadcast) made-for-TV film in the '70s, and soon to be released on the big screen (think massive special effects blockbuster), Don't Panic!- you can still read these before you see it! Also produced as a very entertaining series of radio programs...or should that be 'programmes'?"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy was a book I honestly never had thought about reading. I started reading it because of the movie coming out...which only when I was only five pages from the end did I realize wasn't even based on. BUT....I am glad I read this book...and although like someone else stated some of the parts I was like \\"huh\\" and other parts I was like why didn't they finish explaining. I enjoyed them. I laughed hard at the beginning and even though not the most exciting book I ever read there was a compassion factor that made me keep reading to find out what happened to Zaphod and Trillian and Ford and Arthur. I actually am starting to read the next book because I want to know what happens with the mice, with the number 42 and what happens to the main characters. It is a quick read I finished it within a week-with work and college and many other things going on. So it is great for that. I am not disappointed that I read it. I actually am glad."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Never had I read a book which made me laugh so. Friends, family, and co-workers all expressed concern for my mental health as I would giggle, quite beyond my ability to control, at random intervals and for painfully long periods of time.The humor in the book is the ultimate in satire, and nothing is spared, religion, history, sociology, psychology, philosophy . . . the list is expansive.The characters are interesting enough and fleshed out enough that the reader develops an interest in them and a slight concern for their well being, although from the moment we are introduced to seemingly any character we must question their sanity. The characters aren't enough to be loved, as that would cause for us to be far too concerned with their well being to the point that we would object to the abuses that they are put to. Think of jesters, give them names, faces, and imagine that they're distant associates, like loopy high school classmates.The galaxy itself is a satire of the galaxy as represented in almost any other popular science fiction. The Hitchhiker's Galaxy is crazy. Physics has apparently taken a rather long coffee break, and many of the characters that you meet will make the main characters appear quite sane. I have yet to identify anything in the galaxy that isn't a joke.The story reads quickly, an afternoon of reading and you should easily cruise through this book, yet you'll experience the pain in your gut from the laughing for days thereafter, or longer if you continue in the series.Great for those who are looking for gratuitous and plentiful humor. If you're a Trekkie or a Warzie looking for a meaningful and linear series to fall into, this is not the place to look. However, if you're a Trekkie or a Warzie looking for some lighter fare, you've found the right place."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I first heard this story on the radio in England, bought the first two books and watched a cheesy fun BBC TV version. I laughed so hard I about peed my pants! Some of the humor is strictly British, and some of that dated to the late 70's early 80's, and some of it you have to have an understanding of some science to get the jokes. That doesn't matter though because if you read it you will still laugh, and that is the point. So get your towel, and a pack of peanuts, you can even put your head between your knees,(it won't help but you can do it if you like)And open this book and Restaurant at the end of the universe. You will be glad you did. Now the other books have some funny stuff too, but you have to read a lot of not so funny stuff to get to it. The new movie version comes out soon... I can't wait!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"All it was made out to be by reviews I read -- a very very amusing book. One of the few books I have read that made me laugh out loud. The book has the credibility to pick it up and read it without reading an intro/summary to see if you will like it (I thought it was much better reading it without knowing much/anything about it -- this is why I am refraining from saying any specifics).Bottomline, this book is humor at its best. Not a romance and will not cause the slightest amount of stress (it has suspense, but not the kind that stresses the reader). \\"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\" was not written the way most stories are, which makes it so great."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"In a bizarre twisted universe, when one human escapes the planet, what does he do, he goes...... sight seeing. I thought that this book was funny, but odd.The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a hilarious book written by Douglas Adams. It is an excellent story if you like the book that \\"explains\\" why things happen in the universe. Arthur Dent was on earth within seconds before it was destroyed to make a galactic highway. His odd friend that is an alien, named Ford Perfect, mentors him about the universe.While this has happened, the president of the galaxy has just stolen the Heart of Gold, which is a ship with state-of-the-art technology. These two groups somehow intercepted and have a very funny adventure with each other.As I wonder what was going on inside Douglas Adams's head when he made this book I admit that it may be one of my favorites. Over all it is a hilarious book with a surprising and yet, strange, ending."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I originally picked this book up after seeing both my sister and father read it and constantly laughing at it. I can see why they were laughing. The way he makes fun of our normal ways of life, such as \\"the movement of tiny green pieces of paper\\" as he so well put, and he even makes fun of the intelligence of pretty much anybody and everything. Including sperm whales even.Overall i would say that The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy's concept is the funniest part of the book. Earth was destroyed in order to make a path for an intergalactic highway, the plans were in the Alpha Centurai hall for months. And all this happened just as the main character, Arthur Dent, faced a strikingly similar situation with his house.Douglas Adams's writing style and humor is a rarity among books, sometimes a chapter will be nothing more then a few words, or sometimes, only a page long. He will also go off explaining his galaxy through the use of \\"The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy\\" It contains knowledge of just about everything, from the incredible use of towels, to the discription of earth, \\"Mostly Harmless\\". Of course this is before earth is destroyed.All in all, The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy remains as one of my favorite books of all time, and as hard as it is to believe, the series of 8 books, gets funnier and funnier as it goes on."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I really liked this book. It's tongue and cheek humor reminded me of Seinfeld, with \\"it's show about nothing attitude\\", except on a galactic scale. Author, Douglas Adams, really showed what day in the life of a universal hitchhiker would be like. Ford, Authur Dent, Zaphod, Trillian and Melvin are all lovably characters and I could relate to them. They reminded me of people I know or who I have met before. Who doesn't know someone who is cronically depressed. I truly wish that I could trade places with Arthur Dent and just spend one day in his shoes."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhiker's guide to the Galaxy is the funniest science fiction brief novel I've ever read. Dialogs are funny, descriptions are comic and the argument is hilarius. Most of all, this is a smart novel where the casuality is masterly managed. Actually, nothing that happens in the novel is casual but just very, very improbable. These very improbable events produce a world where, for example, humans are only part of a ten million years long experiment done by the most intelligent species in the universe: mice, of course.I'm looking forward to read the other two parts of the &quot;incresingly inaccurately named Hitchhiker's Trilogy&quot;."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is very well written. It includes action, mystery, and most of all, science fiction. Douglas Adams is a genius in the writing world. This book has astounded me and has tingled my intrest in science fiction novels. Adams has created a masterpiece, something that I would read over, and over again to myself and my children. It would intrest anyone. From grades four(kind of hard for them) to eigth. Anyone who has any kind of an intrest in science fiction, fantasy, or just regular fiction, would be very interested. It is short but sweet, it ends very quickly, but covers a giant time period. In such a short time, Adams has created one of the greatest books I have ever read. My favorite character s an alien from the Beltigeuse Galaxy, who had done a report on Earth. But as time went by, he got stranded on Earth. His Earthian name was Ford Prefect, and he plays a stupid alien( at times), and also a genius to the alien Galaxy. Aurter Dent is the main character, and he goes through a lot of difficulties in the giant Universe. This is one of the greatest books I have ever read, and if you like this book, you should read the whole trilogy by Douglas Adams."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is by far the funniest book ever written. Between the action, the characters, and the dialogue, there is hardly a paragraph that dosen't get a laugh. With Ford Prefect (ha) and Arthur Dent in the main spots, a romp across the galaxy is a great form of entertainment. I don't want to give away too much of the rudimentary plot, seeing as there's not that much to give away in the first place, so I'll end the review here."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"If you like science fiction-or even if you don't-you have to read this book. It is hilarious right from the first chapter. I was never really into the whole Aliens-are-taking-over-the-planet thing until I read this. I got all six stories in one album (The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy) and tried to read all six books at my average rate, about two weeks for all six. Big mistake.

The whole series is downright brilliant. Douglas Adams, tragically passed away earlier this year, was a fantastic writer, who could make you laugh, cry, wonder, etc. in just a few pages. The book is a combination of Science, Science Fiction, Humor, Romance and a bit of suspense. It tells the story about a guy, whose house will be destroyed, and at the same time, the Vogons are just above the earth, in order to destroy the earth. Both places must be destroyed, in order to make room for a highway.The choise of words, the similarities, everything gives you a feeling of recognition and believe in all the strange things that happens in the book.Specially for everyone in ICT, like myself: the whole series in mandatory literature !"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"\\"Infinite: Bigger than the biggest thing and then some.

These novels are one constant adventure through the ENTIRE universe, except at times where there isn't any adventure, which is a very small amount (I'll get to the characters later). Adams creates random but not entirely unrelated thoughts from the ever-famous Hitchhiker's Guide - thoughts like: \\"the knack [of flying] lies learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss.\\" He creates theories, one that states \\"that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable\\" and \\"another theory which states that this has already happened.\\"Arthur Dent is Adam's central character; basically each novel revolves around his life. Arthur is an earthling who just barely escapes not only the demolition of his house but also the demolition of his planet, thanks to Ford Prefect and a few alcoholic beverages. Ford Prefect works as a \\"researcher for the revised edition of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.\\" Just seconds before the earth is destroyed which happens immediately in the first novel, he saves Arthur from near death by hitching a ride on one of the ships that destroyed the earth. Zaphod Beeblebrox is Ford Prefect's cousin. While he is president of the galaxy, he acquires the starship, Heart of Gold, which runs on pure improbability. Trillian, formerly known as Tricia McMillan, rides the Heart of Gold with Zaphod after she was plucked of the earth a few years prior to its destruction. Marvin is a persistently depressed robot with intelligence beyond any known race or any race mentioned in the trilogy. Slartibartfast joins the strange crew, then departs, then joins again. This man from planet Magrathea is in the planet making business, which all Magratheans are, or more accurately were. Slartibartfast is very fond of fjords.Together, this crew, equipped with the Heart of Gold, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and eventually the starship Bistromath, explore the Universe for \\"the Question,\\" \\"the Answer,\\" and everything in-between.Adams writes in a sarcastic, satirical, random, paradoxical manner, showing new ways to perceive concepts formerly thought of as dull. The most hysterical and repetitive example in the three novels is the extreme importance of tea. At one time in the continuous story known as \\"The Hitchhiker's Trilogy,\\" \\"Arthur blinked at the screens [of the Heart of Gold] and felt he was missing something important. Suddenly he realized what it was. \`Is there any tea on this spaceship?' he asked.\\" If you've enjoyed the sarcastic, satirical, random, paradoxical writing of this review, you'll definitely LOVE \\"the increasingly inaccurately named Hitchhiker's Trilogy.\\""},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"To put it simply, this book moved me.

The creativity was outstanding. I would not classify this book as humor, although there is quite a bit of it there. I think of the book as more of a mind stetch. The book is not to be taken seriously, and because of this and the humor contained, Adams is capable of creating text that is unlike any other I have read.

Imagine that &quot;Men in Black&quot; meets &quot;Monty Python&quot; and you'll begin to see the way these tales are put together.Also, I LOVE Zaphod. Ohhh, what a hunk! Too bad he wasn't in the last two books. (sniffle)"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I first picked up HHGTTG on an older friend's recommendation when I was about 12. I thought it was funny then, but after many years and many rereadings, I am further convinced that this novel is the work of true genius. As I age and (hopefully) gain wisdom, I see more of the subtle commentary on life that this book provides. Adams' ability to weave such convoluted subplots into a final big picture is absolutely amazing. He has been criticized for this, but I've found these critics often do not have the patience and/or comprehension level to really understand the _point_ Adams' is often trying to get across Regardless, the result of weaving all these microcosmic views of the world together is both a celebration and a criticism of our small human lives on Earth...and we have the priviledge of laughing all the way through it. Buy this book. It is some of the most brilliant humor (and philosophy) ever put on paper."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Rest of the book is pretty good too."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Arthur Dent is a human on earth and Ford Perfect is an alien from a different planet. Ford had the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy witch told the Visigoths were going to blowup the earth for an express root. So Ford and Arthur hitched a ride from the Visigoths, and they didn't like hitchhikers. So the Visigoths throw out them in to space and Ford's friend Zaphod Beedlebrox who had two heads peaked them up. And Zaphod was with Arthur's friend Trillian. Arthur and Ford where in a room in their ship, and Trillian sent Marvin a depressed robot to get them. They reunited and they went to planet to get an improbability drive. And Zaphod had to give him one of his heads so Zaphod would get him a gun. Zaphod couldn't think with his one head. And on the planet the Visigoths captured Trillian. So Arthur, Ford, and Zaphod went to free her, and left the Vogon. And went to a planet called magrotha and on the planet they went to a super computer to find the meaning of life.And on the planet Arthur left behind went Ford, Zaphod, and Trillian went though a portal. So Arthur met a guy were he was. This was a contractor who built planets. So this man took Arthur around the planets they where building. Arthur found out that the built earth. Mice paid for it and designed it. So the man took Arthur to his home. When Arthur walked in the door Ford, Trillion, and Aphid was there. Then they fell a sleep and Arthur was awake and the mice. Started expeofmenting on him so he killed them. They all went outside on the Vogons where out ready to take Zaphod. And Marvin was out there and a gun that in super computer made and wiped out the Vogons. Arthur deseeded to travel space instead of staying on earth. THE ENDThe book wasn't fun and funny as some books I read.It was exicuting to read.It is a good book and has a lot about spaceIt wasn't that good because they spent too much time in one place.They spent a lot of time on earth which made it disappointing."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"WARNING This review may contain information that reveals major plot points. If you do not wish to have those points revealed, PLEASE DO NOT READ ANY FURTHER.Douglas Adams's The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (THGttG) begins innocently enough with the pending destruction of Arthur Dent's home outside of London, England. The only thing keeping the wrecking crew from demolishing the house is his lying in front of their heavy equipment. It seems that the &quot;powers that be&quot; wish to knock down his house to make way for a much needed highway bypass. Arthur's one-man lie-in is interrupted by a visit from his friend Ford Prefect, an out of work actor. Unknown to Arthur, Ford Prefect is actually an alien field researcher for the galactic travelogue &quot;The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.&quot; Ford has been accidentally exiled on Earth for the past 15 years.Arthur, with the aid of Ford Prefect, stows away on board the starship sent to destroy the Earth. It seems that our planet is in the right-of-way for the new hyper-spatial bypass. After stowing away, the following bizarre events happen in rapid succession: Ford and Arthur are tortured by bad poetry, they are hurled into the vacuum of space, they are rescued from said vacuum by Zaphod Beeblebrox (the renegade Galactic President) and his sidekick Trillian (the only other surviving Earth human). Needless to say these turn of events lead to some very interesting and very funny reading.I liked THGttG. I didn't love it but I did like it. This is my second reading of the novel in 10 years. THGttG was an enjoyable if not a light almost fluffy read. Adams' light and bouncy writing style made it easy to breeze through the text. I finished the book over a 2-day period. Adams' dialogue and scene descriptions were punchy and witty, much like radio dialogue from which it was taken. The book's humor is definitely British (funny bordering on the absurd). Watchers of British comedies will know what I mean by this assertion. If fact, as I read I would hear John Cleese's (Monty Python, Fawlty Towers) voice in my head doing the narration.Although I enjoyed the book's style and tone, its story was not as enjoyable or at least not as satisfying as it should have been. At a novel's conclusion I expect most if not all questions raised during the narrative to be answered. This didn't happen with THGttG. The book left many important questions unanswered: What happens to Slartibartfast, the caretaker of Magrathea? Do the Authorities ever catch Zaphod and punish him for stealing the Heart of Gold? Why were his brains surgically altered anyway? What is the question for which &quot;42&quot; is the answer? What will the mice do now? I saw the Public Television mini-series (a combination of THGttG and it's sequel The Restaurant at the End of Time) when it came out in the Eighties, so I know the answers to my own questions. But for the readers who have not seen the series not answering these questions is too great a flaw to overlook.All in all, THGttG is an enjoyable book because of its wit and humor but it leaves too much to be desired when it comes to tying up loose ends. If you wish to enjoy the book and understand what everything in it means, read THGttG and The Restaurant at the End of Time in immediate succession. If not, you'll find yourself greatly disappointed. ---------- Mario N.

Full of futuristic gimmicks, some funny and some, well, just plain silly, including Marvin the Paranoid Android, who just by talking to a ship computer causes it to commit suicide is pretty much the humor involved. Although the plot is pretty much nonsense, it is an entertaining read. Things like the meaning of life being the number 42 are what make this book either hilarious or nonsensical. You be the judge."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hichhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a book about two friends. One of these friends is from outer space and the other one does not know it. A spaceship apears and is going to blow up earth, so the friends hitch a ride with the spaceship and travel off into space.My favorite part of the book is in the begining, when the town wants to knock down Arthur's house and the costruction workers are outside his house wating to knock it down. Then his friend Ford comes and tells him that they need to talk but, Arthur does not want to move. So Ford confuses him and gets the head construction worker to take Arthur's spot and lay in the mud in front of the house until they get back. Next Ford brings Arthur to the bar and tells him that the world is going to get blown up by aliens.I don't recommend this book. For any body under the age of 15 or 16 because it was confuising and hard to follow. Most of the jokes I did not get and the ones I did get weren't that funny. The book skipped around a lot with out saying it. In a few years I will read this book again and I might get more of the jokes and understand it more but until then I really don't like this book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I rarely meet another sci-fi fan who dislikes this book; everyone seems to love it, but I barely made it through. I did really enjoy the beginning of the book, but as it progressed I found that every time the situation was getting interesting, and about to require some work on the part of the author to figure out the ramifications of whatever new world the characters were in....oops! randomness drive kicks in, and we're off to somewhere else!I ended up frustrated with the author for copping out every time I was getting interested. As a strictly comic book, this might be OK, but don't read it expecting true sci-fi. Your time would be much better spent with Orson Scott Card or Timothy Zahn."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Finally read it again after 10 years to see if my impressions had at all changed. They haven't. Utter nonsensical, drunken silliness. Come on - Adams could not have possibly had any idea where this book was going from the moment he typed his first word. There is no cohesion, no destination and (almost) no point - unless the point is that extra-terrestrial life would be as brainless and stupid as Earthlings are."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book made me laugh; but it left me wondering what on earth the point was! Just laughter? Laughter, with a thin plotline wonven in to help it make any sense at all? Well, OK, that's nice: the world can use a whole lot more laughter overall. So if you're looking for an amusing afternoon read, this book will do nicely. But if you're looking for any kind of plot at all...choose something--anything--else."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is very very funny, I will give it that much. It had me laughing out loud almost the entire way through. Adams has a very droll, dry sense of humor, and a great feel for the outlandish. But I was expecting so much more from this book than merely bringing the funny. It was on one 100 Greatest Books of the 20th Century list. The story is OK, but nothing groundbreaking, aliens and earthlings adventuring through space. And as for climax...this book ends so suddenly, I wasn't even sure what the whole point was. Nothing was tied up or remedied. Characters didn't change or evolve, more than a few questions went completely unanswered. I guess this book is part of a series. It's best feature...it's short, so I didn't waste much time, and now I can say I've read it, for whatever that's worth. I am sure there is some great sociological theme somewhere in this book, but I can't be bothered.3 stars for the laugh factor."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Not the kind of book to read if you are into thoughtful S.F like Frank Herbert or Asimov. The only good thing I can say the author is totally original and there is now way someone can figure the story line (there isn't one), every page is a surprise."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Maybe the movie ties it together better. Reading this book was a complete disappointment. I will not be reading anymore of this series."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Arthur Dent is your typical Londoner. He has a house, a job, and heads out to the local pub on a regular basis. Ford Prefect, is not your typical Londoner. He is an inter-galactic hitchhiker who stopped off for a quick stop on Earth and found himself stranded there for 15 years. But now he's off again and he's decided that rather then let his friend Arthur blow up with the rest of Earth as it's demolished to make way for a freeway, to take him along for the ride. What happens next is enough to blow Arthur's mind, which he very nearly looses while ldiscovering the Answer to Everything.The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is an amusing little book but it's not at all what I was expecting or hoping for. The characters lacked any real depth, the plot was practically non-existant, and the conclusion came very abrubtly as if it shouldn't have ended when it did. I seriously have to question it's consideration as one of the best books written or it's inclusion as one of the 1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die.At 224 pages it should have been a quick diversion, but for me it was anything but. It took me two weeks to complete and a full week to get even 80 pages in. I will likely read the follow-up books eventually as I can't leave a series I've begun uncomplete, but I doubt I'll be doing so anytime soon."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is about a guy whos planet is destroyed[earth]and how he survives in space.this guy has a freind whos really a alien and him and his alein freind hich a ride. then they meet up with the aliens freind and travel the universe and have really funny adventures.My favriot part in this book was when the two smartest life forms[rats] create a super computer that can answer anything. They ask the computer 'what is the answer to life and everything'then the computer answers'i cant answer this question you must build a smarter computer then me''. The computer gives them the plans on how to build it. Finally after they built it they asked again what is the answer to life and the computer said it needed 200,000 years to think.Wow, now again the great great great great great grand children of those rats came and the computers answer was 42. Everyone was in awe and could not understand it. I was laughing for ever it was so random and funny.This book was very funny to me but it was hard to read, i pesonally loved this book at times and hated it at times. i would recomend this book to people who like nepolean dynamite or monty python. If you like random books that dont have to have a point and are funny then this is for you. But if your looking for more of a serious book with a theme and climax then i would not recomend this book. Also this book has some hard big words in it so i would not recomend it for people in elementry or middle school unless your a really accelerated reader. So like i said before it really depends on what kind of reader you are do you like books with lots of funny moments that make no sense at all. Or a book with a actual point to it if so you will hate this book it will make you bang your head against the wall trying to understand what just happened and why, every page you read."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"As the late writer Douglas Adams explains in the introduction \\"A Guide to the Guide\\" (\\"The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide\\" edition) \\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\" has appeared in different forms and in different medias -- not two of them are alike. That is very interesting and one more proof of the author's apparently unstoppable creativity. You may not enjoy either his sense of humor, or his ideas, but you can't deny he is smart and creative.I approached \\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\" is suspicion. I have never been very fond of science fiction -- and I never understood all those complicated physical and mathematical stuff--, I have always preferred something more intellectual. And I wasn't sure how comedy would work along with science fiction. To make matters worse, I've never got into books that are published in series, and become a fever, with people who can discuss them as if they were talking about the weather. \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is a nightmare for me. So I decided to read Adam's first book and see what happens.Little did I know that I would fall for it before I reached page 20. In other words, before Earth is destructed. Although I can't recommend the whole series yet, I have to confess that I loved the first book and found it one of the funniest things I've ever read. And, it is not an easy job to make me laugh. Adams is witty and fast. So are his characters -- albeit a little crazy.My favorite character certainly is Marvin, the bipolar robot -- or paranoid android, pick one. He has some of the funniest lines in the novel. At some point, the reader may wonder whether he/she (the reader) is really crazy or Marvin is really involuntarily funny. I'd pick the second. My second favorite character is Ed, the hyperactive computer. These machines are dead funny.One can't expect realism in a science fiction comedy. Since \\"The Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy\\" is a fantasy, it is not a heresy to find a robot and a computer with more feelings that human beings or talking mice. This is supposed to entertain and, after all, this is food for thought, raising questions about what life is about, what is happening to the Earth and things like that. At some point, why not consider this novel sort of eco friendly?\\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\" is a sort of \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" written by \\"Alice in Wonderland\\"'s Lewis Carroll. Strange creatures act as if they were not strange; unusual situations are tackled as if they were usual; and a towel is the most important thing one must carry. What a (wonderful) world!I'll certainly read the following books in the series. I only hope they are as good, as funny, as witty and as fast as \\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\". This light book is a good choice to read between to heavy and highbrow books. This is certainly one of the best treats readers any age can have."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"There are books that you should read, re-read, and re-re-read. This, unfortunately, turned out not to be one of those books, at least for me.When I first read this as a teenager, the whimsical English humor, sudden digressions, metafictional interruptions, and probing satirical questions kept me in stitches. This novel (such as it is), held together by a singular smart-assery, profoundly appealed to my own new found sense of adolescent rebellion. Coincidences, meaningful and otherwise, non sequiturs, and bureaucratic balderdash leavened the side-splitting dialogue and made it impossible to put down.Alas, upon re-reading the novel at the conclusion of 2006, I was struck by how much of the writing didn't strike me anymore. To say that the plot of the book is thin would be a compliment, and to call the characters, well, characters, would be a stretch. Most of the jokes just weren't as funny this time around, and the few that did crack me up were tinged with the bittersweet recognition that they would never be groundbreaking again.Because I read the 25th anniversary edition, perhaps it is fitting that it conjured up such mixed emotions. The author, Douglas Adams, had died three years before this edition was published, and so many of the extras in this volume involve tributes from luminaries like Terry Jones and Neil Gaiman. The introductory chapters are also chocked full of reproductions of flyers, book covers, and other such emphemera that will only be important to die-hard fans of the book, radio show, and/or movie.Remember, though, that this review is just my opinion. Whatever you do, Don't Panic."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"It's not really my place to judge a classic that is older than I am, but I didn't find this all too exciting. The story itself was rather dry and predictable and so was the humor. If you like British humor, than this is definitely for you. I don't know, I guess I was expecting more realistic science fiction, in which case this book certainly doesn't deliver.

Now I do for nostalgia's sake, and some of the references no longer hold true (I suppose we can replace our fascinations of digital watches with iPhones now). The thing that makes HGTTG such an extraordinary funny book is the absurdity in the writing, the way that Mr. Adams can turn a phrase and paint the word picture.There are things I wish I would've known before hand that got lost on this American reader when I first got started (like Ford Prefect was named after a car, I don't know why in the American version they just didn't rename him Ford Escort or Ford Crown Victoria), but it didn't detract from my utter enjoyment.If you have some time, read this book, it is truly wonderful.

The book follows Arthur Dent, an Englishman, or former Englishman I should say as the Earth has just been destroyed to create a galactic bypass, and his Betlegeuseian friend Ford Prefect as they traverse the galaxy with their supplies: a towel(the most widely useful object ever to be invented) and of course the fabulous Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, a book in the form of a computer because if it were in regular page form, the carrier would have to lug around seven inconveniently sized buildings full of paper. The pair meet wierd aliens, robots, and other creatures. Don't be confused at first with the names: Zaphod Beeblebrox, for example, is a main character who's name you'll easily catch on to. This book is just flat out hilarious. It's Brazil (the 1984 spoof, not the country) meets Star Wars. Douglas Adams is more or less the master of confusing but hilarious plot as well as dialouge. Now, I'm not just writing this review because I love all sci-fi books. In fact, I read very few, about 20%, sci-fi books, although I still like the genre.

The main character, Arthur, comes in contact with an old friend of his, Ford prefect (really an alien form the vicinity of betelgeuse) who hitchhikes him off the planet right before a race of Vogons, (cruel aliens who write bad poetry) blows up the earth to build an intergalactic highway. But it doesn't end there. Arthur and Ford hitch their way, by pure luck, onto the Heart Of Gold- a spaceship with the latest in Alien technology, an amazing device called the &quot;Improbability Drive.&quot; The Improbability Drive, as it's name indicates, makes the improbable probable; and that is how Arthur and Ford end up cruising the galaxy, searching for the question to the Ultimate Answer..... Of Life, the Universe, and Everything....... with an ex-girlfriend and a long lost acquaintance with two heads. If you are looking for an amazing series that keeps you entranced, then this is without doubt the series for you. Once you start reading the first book, you've got to read them all!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I'm not usually a fan of sci-fi, but this was a recommendation of a friend (plus I saw the movie). What a fantastic book! It's cleverly written with hysterical commentary on human (and alien) life. Many sci-fi books are written with technical jargon, using words only the most geeky of geeks could understand. Instead, this is written with an everyday tone so even the common man can stowaway for the adventure."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is, without a doubt, one of the funniest books I have ever read. Adams' science fiction-humor masterpiece is as imaginitive as it is hilarious. The story begins on the worst Thursday ever as Arthur Dent awakens to find a wrecking crew about to demolish his home in order to make way for a bypass. Arthur is approached by his longtime friend Ford Prefect, who turns out to be an alien field researcher for The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Ford tells Arthur that the Earth is about to be demolished to make way for a hyperspace bypass. The two hitch a lift aboard a Vogon spacecraft, and there the fun begins. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is the first of five hilarious novels (and one short story) in Douglas Adams highly acclaimed Hitchhiker's series, and it is also the best. I've enjoyed H2G2 in all of its forms so far (books, TV & radio versions, etc.), and I look forward to the Hitchhiker's Guide movie which opens in theaters April 29th. Read the book and laugh your butt off, then go and enjoy the movie!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a unique book all in itself. It is hard to compare it with any other book because there is nothing like it! It is the tale of Arthur Dent as he escapes Earth's destruction with his friend, Ford Prefect. This would not be possible if Ford himself had been born on Earth; he was from somewhere in the vicinity of Beetlejuice. They manage to get on board one of the construction ships that is destroying Earth to make room for an intergalactic superhighway. From there, the adventure just gets more intersting in later books, traveling through time as well as space, from the dawn of man to the end of the universe in a five star resteraunt. Douglas Adams describes every little thing to great detail, making every little oddity worth reading. This first book of the series is in every way one of the best books I have ever read. It even brings about the meaning of life, the universe, and everything; 42. But what is the question? Read the book to find out."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This novel is Douglas Adams' best ever. Here is his true wit, his British humor, his, well, hoopiness! The book picks you up, drives you to the movies, and never lets you go! Ford is hilarious with his insane logic. Trillian is a wonderful as the only really sane one on board the Heart of Gold. Marvin is so pathetic that he makes you cry every time you read the book. And through it all, the hapless Arthur Dent just tries to understand what is happening. The plot involves the earth being blow up to make a hyperspace bypass, which everyone should have known about if they had checked the record hall in Alpha Centauri. The plans had been on display for fifty years. Can't complain about it now, can you? Anyway, throw in an ancient race of planet builders, some towels, a stolen space ship, and a restaurant at the end of the universe, and you get the first novel in one of the best sci-fi series ever. A must read for any science fiction fan or fans of British comedy"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This little treasure is probably one of the most outrageous and ridiculously hilarious books ever written. With a flawless knack for humor, Douglas Adams brings to life his satire of our own universe, devilishly illustrating how much nonsense we're really surrounded by. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy takes us on a wild ride through the four corners of the final frontier, introducing us to dozens of one-of-a-kind personalities. Among them are Earth civilian Arthur Dent and galactic hitchhiker Ford Prefect, two of the most colorful characters one could ever hope to meet. You'll never forget the time you spend with these guys; it may even bring a tear to your eye to turn that very last page (thank GOD for sequels!). But the experience is worth it. Just be prepared to finish up with a lot of unanswered questions crowding your mind, and don't count on any guarantees that you'll be able to restrain yourself from reading the rest of the saga! Yes, although a very light read, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy boasts a kind of zany &quot;philosophy&quot; that'll keep you perplexed and intrigued and -- more than anything -- totally addicted. I'm telling you I can't wait to get started with the next one! If you think you're finally ready to learn the answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything, don't hesitate. $5.59 is a petty price to pay for such gleeful enlightenment."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The first pages of this book were pretty stupid, but Adams seems to have the same problem as I do--a little bit of trouble beginning stories. Once it's in full swing, you'll love it. This is one of the few books that I literally didn't want to put down until it was finished. I tore through it in two days--thank goodness for sequels. NOTE: If you aren't a fan of silly humor, you might not like this book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I've read many books in my day, mostly for my own pleasure but never until now have I read a book that made me laugh out loud. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, is a story about Arthur Dent, his friend Ford Prefect, and their adventures in outer space. Ford Prefect, an alien from the planet Betelgeuse V was on earth, in disguise to complete research. Ford is a reporter for the encyclopedia known as The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. This guide is a giant encyclopedia stored in a small computer that contains important information for intergalactic hitchhikers. When Ford discovers that the Earth will soon be destroyed, he alerts his friend Arthur Dent. Ford urges Arthur to leave Earth with him and they soon hitch a ride on a Vogon spaceship. But as Arthur soon finds out, Vogon's aren't friendly beings, and the captain of the ship wasn't to happy they came aboard. The Vogons tortured the two with horrible poetry and then dumped them into space. Now according to the Hitchhiker's Guide, a person can hold his breath in space for 30 seconds before he dies. 29 seconds later Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent were recued from space. They now found themselves on a ship called the Heart of Gold with the president of the universe, Zaphod Beeblebrox and his friend Trillian. Douglas Adams is a comedic genius and does a wonderful job of satirizing the human race. Humans are considered to be primitive, the third smartest species on Earth, and Earth is considered &quot;mostly harmless\\". Unlike many books I have read The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy kept me interested and wanting to read more. I definitely recommend this book and I will most likely begin reading the other books in this series. If you enjoy science fiction books and have a good sense of humor, you would definitely enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"One of my all time favorites books. I was lucky enough to see Douglas Adams speak right before he died. Some SF authors are great speakers, Ray Bradbury and Arthur C. Clarke come to mind. Barry Maher, the guy who wrote Legend, is an outstanding speaker. Writers like these can really wow an audience in person. Douglas Adams certainly couldn't. He was clearly uncomfortable on stage. For the first 15 minutes, he was one of the worst speakers I've seen. Then he relaxed and inspite of being uncomfortable, his humanity, his weird perspective and his humor took over. It became a wonderful session. Almost as wonderful as the Hitchhiker books. Don't see the movie until you're read the books, all the books. You don't even have to see the movie then."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Douglas Adams is brilliant. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy \\"trilogy\\" is Adams' gift to sci-fi fans of all ages and backgrounds. Though not necessarily a direct spoof of any particular sci-fi book or film, this books pokes fun at the many hackneyed cliches of the genre, yet somehow creates something altogehter original AND funny. The brilliance comes from the fact that you do not need to be a sci-fi fan to enjoy the story and comedy. This is one of the few books that deserves to be read multiple times--and no matter how many times you read it, you will find yourself laughing out loud. If you enjoyed this book, you must read the rest of the \\"trilogy.\\" My personal favorite is So Long and Thanks for All the Fish, though hard-core Guide fans may tell you it is the weakest of the five book. Though not as funny as the others, it has the best story and character development. So, if you happen to find yourself actually caring about Arthur Dent by the end of this book, you must read So Long... If you like Adams, I also recommend The Great American Novel; Or Random Start, by Eliot Stafford--it's not sci-fi, but displays a similar sense of humor and will keep you laughing for days."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I was walking down the hall, being perfectly innocent, when a friend of mine shoved a book in my hands with an exclamation of, \\"You have got to read this!\\" It was entitled The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. I was skeptical at first, because I had never been much of a science fiction fan, but by the time I had finished the first chapter, it had become my favorite book of all time. The rest of my week was spent following Ford Prefect, a field researcher from Betelgeuse Five, who accidentally got stuck on Earth for fifteen years, and his friend Arthur Dent, an advertising executive from Islington, as they escape the end of the world by jumping aboard the most highly sophisticated spacecraft ever made, which just so happens to have been stolen by Ford's step-cousin, Zaphod Beeblebrox and his girlfriend Trillian, who Arthur once met at a party.During their travels, these humorous characters must battle evil aliens, interstellar police, and white mice to find out the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything. This truly insane tale could only have been thought up by the truly insane Douglas Adams, who came up with the idea while lying drunk in a field in Innsbruck, Spain. Through his eyes, readers are able to laugh at all the things they know are wrong with the world, rather than feel depressed about not being able to fix them. This really is a wonderfully enjoyable book, and I would recommend it to all who enjoy quality entertainment and a touch of wackiness."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"A while back I decided I didn't like parody. This was after being disappointed by \\"The Color of Magic.\\" I choose, in fact, not to review that book because I felt that I was simply missing the whole point, and wasn't qualified to have an opinion.However, when I found out Douglas Adam's work was being made into a movie, I decided to try it. I was quickly enthralled. It works in many ways \\"The Color of Magic\\" didn't. For one thing it's one story, not a group of related short-stories about the same characters. For another reason, things are there for a reason. It's true the characters are silly, and unrealistic, but they're humorous characters, not humorous plot devices. All the jokes actally factor in to what's going on, rather than just being there to be funny. When the missiles were being fired at the Heart of Gold it actually managed to produce both humor, and drama, and the thoughts of the whale and bowl of petunias, since they were a way to resolve the problem, were certainly acceptable.Overall, I guess it's just that the jokes worked for me, more than \\"The Color of Magic.\\" I found this book very funny, and am looking forward to the movie."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I just needed to leave a review, despite the fact that there are, what, 400 others? I haven't read any of them, but I just need to share my input on the book or I'll explode.This is definately a class in the Science-Fiction genre. There's sarcasm, humor, wit, and everything in life I love and cherish--well, pretty much. I thought it was hilarious."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"With Douglas Adams it really doesn't matter if your a miserable old bat who hates fiction or a fun loving freak who loves it; his books can appeal to all. They have a bit of everything in them, a bit of sci-fi, a bit of nature conservation, a little bit of adventure and LOTS of humor. They even have the nice little moral at the end to boost up your spirits when you finish the book.I first found this book years ago and I'm still unable to figure out how i lived without it. the seqeuls and other books that come next in the series are just as fun and Adams has managed to spread his wit evenly out throughout the whole series. any other author would've given up and returned, mentally exhausted, to dry writing after the first page.The characters are original and fun, the scenery and setting ever-changing, the plot dances around and the dialogue will leave you in tears. Marvin the Paranoid Android ended up being one of my favoirte characters, as did the Vogons and psycologists, and their unique outlooks on life and 42 are new.There are only a few things readers attempting to read this book must have:-a sense, however lame it might be, of humor-a large mug of really hot tea-a few packets of peanuts-and, finally, a really comfortable sofa"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitch Hikers Guide is an amazing book; it ensnares the mind and doesn't let go. The book takes you all the way from the last seconds of earth to the end of the universe, and all in a strange and humors way. The book uses backwards logic and at some points makes so little sense that it makes perfect sense. I loved the variety of characters, the detail, and the abstract thoughts. The book takes and explains the secrets of the universe and even better how to travel it. In this book you will find the answer to the meaning of life, how to get a lift from a space ship, and why no hitchhiker should ever be without a towel.I recommend this book to anyone who thinks of the abstract or abnormal, or for that matter anyone who has an inkling of creativity in their minds. Recommended to ages 15 and up."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The planet Earth is destroyed by an evil alien race called the Vogons in order to make way for a hyperspacial bypass. Fortunately, one bewildered Earthman named Arthur Dent is rescued from the Earth's destruction at the last possible moment by his friend Ford Prefect, who turns out to be an alien from the planet Betelgeuse. They stow away on a Vogon freighter, and are eventually rescued by the whacked-out Zaphod Beeblebrox &amp; his Earthwoman companion, Trillian, in their absolutely fantastic ship, the Heart Of Gold. From here on out, it's outrageous shenanigans in space, as Arthur and friends discover what the true purpose of the planet Earth was for, that it's always important to know where your towel is, and that the answer to Life, The Universe &amp; Everything is &quot;forty-two&quot;.... It began life as a BBC radio play, and then it spun off into something much bigger, including comedy albums, a TV miniseries, and, of course, the books. &quot;The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy,&quot; by the late, absolutely great Douglas Adams, is a true comedy classic of the literary world, and is a must-read for all fans of not only science fiction, but off-the-wall British comedy, which Adams gleefully, and cleverly, blends into one. I first read the books as a young teenager some twenty odd years ago, and, re-reading them now, they still make me laugh just as uproariously as they did back then. This book, Part One in the &quot;Hitchhiker's&quot; saga (five books in all), gets things off to a flying start, with many great, hilarious chapters &amp; characters, not only Arthur, Ford, Zaphod &amp; Trillian but also Marvin the paranoid android, and the old wise man, Slartibartfast. Douglas Adams was a comic genius, gifted with a tremendously clever wit &amp; sharp writing style, which he worked to maximum effect with the &quot;Hitchhiker's&quot; books. His wonderful observations &amp; short stories sprinkled throughout about Life in the Universe are also a great treat to read. There's more intergalactic misadventures for Arthur &amp; the gang in Book Two, &quot;The Restaurant At The End Of The Universe,&quot; but &quot;The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy&quot; is a marvelous opening book to this legendary sci-fi comedy saga. It is extremely funny, extremely clever, and extremely classic. God bless you, Douglas Adams, wherever you are."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is one of the greatest books to me. It starts serious, you can just imagine someone reading aloud, then you get to this sudden, simple line, and you are rolling on the ground. One of the things that really got to me was that I thought of someone reading very well, completely serious, and all the jokes and simple one liners seem like they are completely normal in their world (universe), but they really stick out. It is brilliantly written, and though when you get into the series it is a bit hard to follow, it's worth reading multiple times. It kinda makes you realize that our simple lives could easily get so complicated, or just stop, and you think &quot;God am I glad I'm not him, but that would be so fun&quot;."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"There's not a lot you can't say about the series of science-fiction/comedy books [and the miniseries] left by the late, great Douglas N. Adams. I think it's this book that really makes me laugh still, the most. The others in the series are fantastic in their own rights, but this book is the one I can go back to, any time, and still laugh at. It's just so absurd that you never get used to it the way you can with some other books in the genre.For example in the Red Dwarf books, you begin to accept the quirks of Lister and Rimmer and the crew, but you really start to laugh at them because it's just SO Rimmer to do whatever or say whatever. It begins to get, in all fairness, a little less funny, and a little old. But DNA's silliness never seems to lose its sharp cutting edge. The characters, too, always feel new, though eventually you start to see all of them, even Vogons, as friends in a way, like you know them a lot, and you like them.This is a book that changed my life, in a number of ways, and has kept me laughing for many years."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I have heard so many references to this book recently that I had put it on my list of books to fill in between the more challenging reading I have to do. The last straw was when a visiting minister to our pulpit used this guide as a jumping of point to explaining the our religious practices to newcomers. So of to the on-line store and soon this nifty little volume was at my doorstep.What a blast! The antics of Arthur Dent and Ford Perfect are so zany that they have to make you chuckle if not laugh outright. And the perpetually sad robot, Marvin, infuriates the reader as quickly as the other characters in the book. So if you want a break and a thoroughly enjoyable romp through the Universe, this is the best place to start. I'm bound to pick up the rest in this series in order to continue to partake in this dry English humor."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Having listened to my brother rave about this book for years, I finally decided to pick it up and read it. I'm glad I did. I laughed out loud a number of times. Each sentence has the reader wondering what the next sentence could possibly say. It has a Monty Pythonesque quality to it, and you can almost hear Eric Idle or John Cleese delivering the punchlines as you read.Arthur Dent's misadventures begin with a yellow bulldozer and don't stop until mice, monkeys, a depressed robot, the number forty-two, and language translating fish all come into play.I'd recommend this book, even if you don't happen to be a fan of science fiction. And now I'm off to the Restaurant at the end of the Universe!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to The Galaxy is truly a masterpiece.

From Arthur Dent's charcter to Ford Prefect's to Slartibartfast's to the WORSHIPED Marvin - I've never read such a clever , humoristic writing. You don't even get a break , you read a new joke every sentence. If you want to breath , you'll have to put the book down.And another thing , you won't be able to stop reading , so if you buy the book , make sure you have a couple of days off before you read the first word.I envy those of you who read this review and decided to buy the book , for you are going to read it for the first time - a thing I wish I could do again.

He also teaches us some great quotes to use from time to time. My favorite being &quot;The secret of flying is to throw yourself at the ground and miss.&quot;.

However, it's far too short and moves far too fast for me, though I could readily keep up with the plot. The ending was far too abrupt, and his description of some scenes was nonexistent (at best), though I appreciated him letting the reader create his own \\"Heart of Gold\\" and picturing what each of the character's look like, with a little bit of direction.The nostalgia factor (though this was my first time ever reading Adams' work) definitely helped me like this book because all my friends still speak fondly of it.Whatever the case, I am a fan of Adams: I may not think he is greatest author (I disagree with some of style), but he is a damn funny one. The man must have been a stand-up comedian, because he knows how to make someone laugh. He's got comedic timing down for pat. So, if you're reading the book for the first time, I say (especially if you have a Kindle) get the sample first. Personally speaking, you won't be disappointed.After all, the answer to Life, the Universe, Everything is... well, you'll just have to read to find out."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Soooooo Long and thanks for all the Fish.... well...

There is another theory which states that this has already happened.\\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is full of quotations such as this, which stimulate thought and the funny bone of anyone who understands British humor. Indeed, the adventures of Arthur Dent, the thoroughly confused Earth-man, are full of bits of satire and comedic dialogue. When Dent is rescued from going up in smoke with the Earth, so begins a journey that takes him from the bowels of a dead planet to the deck of a spaceship made to do the improbable. Alien wrecking crews, insane presidents, manically depressed robots, and a confused sperm whale all tie into the story, all with hilarious effect. The interaction between characters is often done with tongue in cheek, and it is genuinely hard to stop from laughing. Arthur's confusion leads to hilarious dialogue, often after he has failed to take in a situation. Though short, this book is a staple in the diet of any comedy science fiction reader. If you think the movie will be a perfect replica of the book to film, prepare to be disappointed: Hollywood had its way with the script, and the second half of the movie is thoroughly edited. I recommend this book to anyone who can appreciate British humor, or anyone who loves and understands satire.

This summer, I re-read Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy for the sixth or seventh time. Obviously, as I am a fan of this novel, and the rest that follow in the series, this review will not be critical.Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy chronicles the exploits of Arthur Dent, a human, Ford Prefect, Arthur Dent's friend who, posing as a human on earth, was collecting data for the actual Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Zaphod Beeblebrox, the Galactic president, and other eccentric characters, including Marvin, a manic depressive robot. This novel is amazing, and so are the others in the series. Read them.One of the main strengths in this book is the comedy throughout. Sometimes dry, sarcastic humor, sometimes slapstick, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a funny book. Everything from the characters' names (e.g., Ford Prefect, Zaphod Beeblebrox) to the omniscient and sarcastic narration (e.g., the head of the construction crew at Arthur Dent's house at the start of the novel being a descent of Genghis Kahn) makes this novel difficult to overlook. Also, if so inclined, the reader can look deeper than just the superficial hilariousness of this novel, and actually gain something from Douglas Adams' view of everything, which is intelligent and insightful. Still, it is not Camus, but I am fairly sure Douglas Adams knows that.There are few weaknesses in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy because, this being a sarcastic and comedic view at the way things works, a reader either likes sarcasm and irony or they do not. For me, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is not only a funny novel, but full of insight which I have actually benefited from, but I guess there are some people who do not have a sense of humor that parallels the sense in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.As far as addressing one of the \\"essential questions\\" is concerned, I wouldn't use Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy as a reference point for \\"fine art,\\" at least not traditionally (note: I am trying to avoid the debate of what is \\"fine art,\\" \\"art,\\" etc..), but I think the novel is \\"timeless and universal\\" (i.e., no. 6) because the story does not feel dated, and the concepts throughout are universal and still reflective of contemporary culture. In fact, it is the timelessness and universal qualities of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy which make it so appealing. Being read this novel when I was little, many of Douglas Adams' concepts have stayed with me my entire life, and whether or not it is a good thing, I judge many things I hear with the concepts I found so universal and appealing in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"\\"On top of the cliffs stood a reception comitee.

The conflict in this colorful science fiction cliche is generally controlled by the infamous Six Degrees Theory. The theme when you get down to its very core is to live life to its fullest and take whatever life throws at you head on. I think this is a great book for anybody looking for a comical science fiction that isn't extremely confusing. It is a good light readand an incredible Introduction to an incredible series, I had hoped for another great series by Mister Adams but saddly he passed away in May of 2001 of a sudden heart attack at the age of 49.

It's a really weird kind of book about two survivor's of Earth's destruction and the journey they face.

It is a sci-fi, alien meets man, adventure story which you will enjoy (but you'll never know why)."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I have to say that this novel caters perfectly to my sense of humor. Its really something when I'm inclined to say that about anything, much less a book, in a science fiction setting. Adams confidently strides into absurdity and I couldn't ask for more. I didn't know what to expect out of this book outside of general greatness (through word of mouth), so I have to say it was a pleasant surprise. I'll be venturing out to see the movie soon now as well.However, I can't say as I appreciate the attached 'Making Of...\\" featurette. That's the unpleasant surprise with this particular copy of the book. The book's screamingly abrupt ending was rendered especially sharp by, what was it...92 pages of this non-sense? I suppose I should have realized that it was included in advance, but there's no way I could have anticipated the (lack of) ending, and its effect was only worsened by having so much more of the bulk of book ahead of me.

He awakes to find a team of bulldozers parked outside of his house. He soon finds out that his house will be demolished to build an overpass. His friend Ford persuades him to relax and have a drink. He'll need it. Soon, a giant cube comes out of the sky. This is a Vogon ship, Vogons are ugly alien creatures with almost no compassion. They are here to destroy earth, to build an overpass. One minute later, Arthur finds himself aboard one of the ships with Ford. Ford turns out to be a humanoid from another planet who reports for a virtual book called the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy. Arthur is beginning to understand things until they are found by the Vogons. The Vogons then subject Ford and Arthur to the most horrible torture imaginable, poetry. Worst of all, they are thrown into space where they are rescued by Zaphod Beeblebrox, the president of the galaxy, his girlfriend Trillian, and Marvin, a very depressed robot on the starship Heart of Gold. On this ship, they go on an amazing adventure and discover the meaning of life, the universe, and everything. To find out more, read The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy.I really loved this book because it gets you to think about how simple yet complex life can be. This book also has a very strange sense of humor. The plot involves multiple twists and turns. This book is part of a series that I am in the middle of. This is also a complex book that will entertain anyone. So in the end, I would recommend this book to anyone, not just sci-fi addicts."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is about a perfectly normal man named Arthur Dent. His life is changed completely when his house gets bulldozed down and Earth gets blown up,to make room for an intergalactic highway. He and his alien friend Ford Prefect are picked up by the spaceship Heart of Gold and go on to completely improbable adventures around the universe.My favorite part in the book is when Ford and Arthur have just got picked up by the spaceship and a crowd of monkeys trying to write a Shakespearean sonnet attack them. I also like when they get to the planet Magrathea and are informed that the world is run by mice and that Earth is a planet manufactured for rich idiots.I would only recommend this book to people who get the point of not needing an explination for everything in life. I found it entertaining, since I like Monty Python, but some people might not get it at all. I will always remember one part in this book, and that is that the universe is always safer if you bring a towel."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"In The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Douglas Adams illustrates a vast universe in an extremely humorous light. Much of the novel revolves around a particular book called The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, which, instead of a novel, is actually what its title prescribes. The book follows the life of an extremely perplexed human, who one day awakens to find the Earth being destroyed by Vogon Constructor ships. He is then carried of into one of these ships by a long time friend who happened to be an Alien all along stranded on Earth. From this point on, he is constantly making new discoveries of the universe as he hitchhikes his way through vast amounts of space. The narration throughout this novel is clever and random and often lectures on completely irrelevant but increasingly comical facts. For example, the narrator at one point in the story explains the most popular drink in the galaxy, the Pangalactic Gargle Blaster. The effects of which, are like having one's brain smashed out with a lemon wrapped around a gold brick. The narrator finds deems it worthy to bestow the reader with these tidbits.The story is page-turning and exciting. Around every page there is a surprising new outlook on the fast developing story. Though there is a sharp lack of visual details, the dialogue paints a very visual image of the chemistry between the main characters. Some of which include a manically depressed robot and a two-headed galactic president. Each character has something excellently amusing to offer, and each have drastically distinguishing characteristics that make for an excellent combination of conflicting personalities. There is even a character named Slartibartfast.Adams takes on a very innovative tactic in this novel by making the narrator extremely personable and pointedly witty. The narration is what really makes this book such an entertaining read. Several times the narrator will read excerpts from the real Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Many of which are seemingly educational but are of course only relevant to one traversing the galaxy with nothing but a towel. According to the novel, a hitchhiker's towel is his most important possession. This is because when someone picks up a hitchhiker and they have a towel, it is automatically assumed that they also have a toothbrush, washcloth, soap, tin of biscuits, flask, compass, map, ball of string, gnat spray, wet-weather gear, space suit., etc.Adams' approach to antagonists in this novel is more than likely supposed to be the mice. According to the novel, humans are third most intelligent beings on Earth behind mice and dolphins. The mice are pandimensional beings that commissioned, paid for, and ran Earth. Ultimately they were seeking the ultimate question to the ultimate answer of forty-two, and earth was a 10 million year project to compute this question. The entire plot is comically sinister and complex and creative to boot. Adams did a fantastic job in illustrating an imaginary universe and concocting a very interesting tale for the human imagination."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I LOVED this book! It was one of the best books I have read. If I could give it six stars i would. Douglas Adams is such a brilliant writer. He puts all the right combinations of humor and sarcasm in all the right situations. It was very intelligently written book that makes you question everything that is! And that British humor! You have to love that British humor! This book keept me laughing till the very end! I would recommend this book to anyone who is even remotely interested in reading anything. Well I'm going to go read the other three now."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"First of all, let me say that this review is for the book itself, not for any given edition or printing.That being said, let the plaudits begin. When I say that this is where it all began, I mean it. The (very-innaccurately named) trilogy, the cult surrounding the books, my sense of humor and consciousness of the world around me; everything. (Of course, to be totally precise, the BBC radio show preceded even the book, but why split hairs.)I have probably read this book (as well as the other 5 in the series) at least 7 or 8 times, and it gets better with every read. There is so much in it, that every time I read it I can come at it from a different angle, and find something new, laughing the whole time.\\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\" can't be called \\"irreverent,\\" because people usually use that word to describe pointless diatribes made up of bad logic, poorly worded; Adams' prose is impeccable, clever, and strong. He makes fun of humanity, and all that that entails. Nothing is sacred. And yet, Adams' brand of very British nihilism is so charming, one can't be offended.I won't tell you the plot, because this is a review, not a synopsis. But the premise, the idea, of this book, is to take a man, place him in totally alien environments, bounce him around the unfamiliar and frequently noisome universe, in order to draw out (and then skewer mercilessly) that which makes him, well, a man. Like all truly great science fiction writers, Adams succeeds in using the fantastic and whimsical to magnify the particularities of the personal. He doesn't beat you over the head with his philosophy at the end of it all, either; no proseletyzing here. He just shows you humanity in a petri dish.If all of this pretentious posturing sounds a little too cerebral for you, don't worry; this book works on many, many levels. At its heart, it is an adventure story of a man, his Betelgeusian friend, the girl he once loved, the 2-headed rock star who stole her away...ad infinitum. Each of the myriad characters in this bizarre galaxy is as colorful (and often delightfully despicable) as the last. Adams' masterful writing carries you through the travails of his protagonists as quickly and surely as their starship, the Heart of Gold, carries them through this vast universe we call home.In short, this book is funny. Very funny. (If you like Monty Python, you are bound to love this book. If you don't like Monty Python, there's still a pretty good chance you'll like this book.) And, if you let it, it can be profound as well.If you've ever wondered about the meaning of it all, the answer lies here. (Literally.) Buy this book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Well, folks, it turns out that man is NOT the most intelligent species on Earth, after all.

Premise sound stupid? No, it's really the best in British humour (not humor!) that I have come across. Only a Brit could pull this one off successfully; and he did.Adams's approach is quite novel: combine comedy with science fiction.

Hyperbole, metaphor, didactics, truisms and sarcasm fly in hyperspeed as Dent copes with the needless demolition of his house (and planet) and hitch hikes his way with the freelancing writer for The Hitch Hiker's Guide To The Galaxy. It might not all make sense, but hey it is a big galaxy after all and the tidbits from The Guide and the universal translators known as the Babel Fish seem to help - well kind of.The absurdity of everything, anything and nothing all come under the cosmic microscope as we take in the busy, bizarre business of the universe.
