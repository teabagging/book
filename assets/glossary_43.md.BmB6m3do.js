They are also the reason for this book. I have written about the fear and greed I faced in trying to bring my discovery to light. What follows is an account of events that resulted in the decision to write this book. When I made my surprising discovery that popcorn can remove trace contaminants from water and air, I was overwhelmed. I was discreet when speaking with my trusted colleagues, who were senior professors and administrators at my home university. We all thought it would be a good idea to arrange a meeting with the president of the school. In the fall of 1996, we saw this discovery as an opportunity for the university to develop a research program to explore new frontiers on popcorn's ability to clean water and air. Meanwhile, the college could raise funds to support research work based on my discovery. For many reasons, not least of which popcorn is perhaps the most famous American snack, my colleagues and I thought the discovery would generate interest from environmental and industrial communities, as well as from the public. The invention turned out to be a novel discovery. After years of research work and help from individuals and small companies, I had enough data to apply for United States and Canadian patents. During these years, I contacted a few popcorn-processing companies in the USA and Canada to interest them in this discovery. The outcome was one of enthusiastic reinforcement. These companies conducted tests that validated this genuine discovery. At a meeting with senior officers from one of these companies, I was asked \\"how is it that we who are in the popcorn business did not make this discovery, and you did\\"? My answer was simply, \\"I was inspired.\\" As time went by I was granted two US patents based on my breakthrough, in addition to a few patent pending applications. Over the last number of years I have come to feel that the \\"David and Goliath\\" story was becoming my own. This struggle is one shared by many independent individual inventors with limited financial resources when their inventions are disclosed to big corporations. Once revealed the great danger becomes infringement, which requires large financial resources and a great amount of time to fight. The big corporations know it, and can afford the resources required to endure litigation. My family and I discussed the merits of continuing negotiations with interested companies, or making my discovery public. My joy of publishing this book are thrice. First, by placing this knowledge in the public domain I hope to preempt any malicious corporate efforts to develop this work. Second, I hope to generate interest by those who would work with me to develop and exploit this breakthrough for the good of our environment. Finally, I wish for my readers to remember the potential health and environmental benefits of popcorn even when it is enjoyed in its popular form as America's favorite snack. It is my personal hope that this book will encourage environmental and health conscious researchers to look deeper into new frontiers and wonders of the great American snack, Popcorn.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=F1yM7k1QYugC&dq=POPCORN+CLEANS+UP&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The sun also rises (The Modern library of the world's best books)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4g9wtQEACAAJ&dq=The+sun+also+rises+(The+Modern+library+of+the+world%27s+best+books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Clever Quilts: Making the Most of Panels, Borders, and Theme Prints","description":"Easy techniques showcase how to make everything from detailed scenes to novelty motifs in your quilts using \\"preprinted\\" fabrics.

Bond helped develop the theory of saturation diving and the techniques and dive tables used by divers around the world. In this edited journal made public for the first time Bond offers a lively account of his work with the U.S. Navy s first manned undersea habitats, the Sealab experiments of the 1960s. Dubbed  Papa Topside  by the media who followed his work with Navy aquanauts, Bond gives a colorful eyewitness account of what today are considered benchmarks in the history of diving. This is a candid, personal record of Sealabs I, II, and III, and the FISSH experiment, the finale of Bond s career. The picture that emerges is one of a brilliant, larger-than-life figure who, though often difficult to get along with, earned the respect and affection of his peers. The book draws on the editor s interviews with Bond s fellow researchers and divers as well as Bond s daily logs and correspondence. Always frank and to the point, he describes his frustrations with the Navy brass, his friendly competition with Jacques Cousteau, and his spirited relationship with aquanaut/astronaut Scott Carpenter. As the only full-length book written about U.S. aquanauts and their undersea exploits, it is an important historical document.

Taking the work of Jacob Moreno as its starting point, the book provides an up-to-date and accessible understanding of how children develop social competence in different environments, from school to cyberspace. It is informed by a cross-cultural perspective that examines how peer relationships vary in different cultures, as well as among children who have migrated to a new culture, and provides increased coverage of how bullying is perceived and managed within peer groups. The book is informed, too, by new research techniques, both qualitative and quantitative, which mean we know far more about how children relate to each other than ever before. Childhood Friendships and Peer Relations is a fascinating and very timely overview of what we know about making friends and enemies in childhood, showing how these relationships can have lasting effects. It will be essential reading to all students of Developmental Psychology and Educational Psychology, as well as anyone training towards a career working with children and young people.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Ehu4CwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Women, Feminism, and Aging (Springer Series, Focus on Women)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Oliver!

It was marked by an extraordinary diversity of military and naval operations, including fleet engagements, cavalry raids, amphibious landings, pitched battles, and the two longest sieges in American history. Every existing type of naval vessel, from sailing ship to armored ram, played a role, and military engineers practiced their art on a scale never before witnessed in modern warfare. Union commanders such as Grant, Sherman, Farragut, and Porter demonstrated the skills that would take them to the highest levels of command. When the immense contest finally reached its climax at Vicksburg and Port Hudson in the summer of 1863, the Confederacy suffered a blow from which it never recovered. Here was the true turning point of the Civil War. ? This fast-paced, gripping narrative of the Civil War struggle for the Mississippi River is the first comprehensive single-volume account to appear in over a century. Vicksburg Is the Key: The Struggle for the Mississippi River tells the story of the series of campaigns the Union conducted on land and water to conquer Vicksburg and of the many efforts by the Confederates to break the siege of the fortress. William L. Shea and Terrence J. Winschel present the unfolding drama of the campaign in a clear and readable style, correct historic myths along the way, and examine the profound strategic effects of the eventual Union victory.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Jn4GV1waNW8C&dq=Vicksburg+Is+the+Key:+The+Struggle+for+the+Mississippi+River+(Great+Campaigns+of+the+Civil+War)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Four Centuries of Jewish Women's Spirituality","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"ABRAHAM LINCOLN: THE WAR YEARS [complete set].","description":"This definitive, single-volume edition of the Pulitzer Prizewinning biography delivers  a Lincoln whom no other man . . . could have given us  (New York Herald Tribune Book Review).

Mendlesohn posits four categories of fantasy portal-quest, immersive, intrusion, and liminal that arise out of the relationship of the protagonist to the fantasy world. Using these sets, Mendlesohn argues that the author s stylistic decisions are then shaped by the inescapably political demands of the category in which they choose to write. Each chapter covers at least twenty books in detail, ranging from nineteenth-century fantasy and horror to extensive coverage of some of the best books in the contemporary field. Offering a wide-ranging discussion and penetrating comparative analysis, Rhetorics of Fantasy will excite fans and provide a wealth of material for scholarly and classroom discussion.

From the delicate interplay of human experience to the surrender to Christ and the embrace of Christian community, that journey of Christian spirituality is explored and celebrated here in each eloquent, thoughtprovoking passage, \\"The table is one of the most intimate places in our lives. It is there that we give ourselves to one another. When we say, 'Take some more, let me serve you another plate, let me pour you another glass, don't be shy, enjoy it,' we say a lot more than our words express. We invite our friends to become part of our lives. We want them to be nurtured by the same food and drink that nurture us. We desire communion.... Every breakfast, lunch, or dinner can become a time of growing communion with one another.\\" Intimately personal and inspiring, Bread for the Journey is a daily feast of fresh insight into the challenges and deep joys of a life lived in close communion with God. Nouwen is a wise, loving companion who invites us along as he finds joy in the community of loss, true freedom in forgiveness of others, and hope in surprising places. Each daily meditation is a steppingstone along a path of private discovery, offering Nouwen's seasoned yet fresh ideas on kindness, love, suffering, and prayer, the Church as God's people, and the importance of Jesus in one's lifereflecting, as a whole, Nouwen's own 'personal creed.'

Probing more than eight centuries of Persian, Greek, and Roman rule, Seth Schwartz reaches some startling conclusions--foremost among them that the Christianization of the Roman Empire generated the most fundamental features of medieval and modern Jewish life. Schwartz begins by arguing that the distinctiveness of Judaism in the Persian, Hellenistic, and early Roman periods was the product of generally prevailing imperial tolerance. From around 70 C.E. to the mid-fourth century, with failed revolts and the alluring cultural norms of the High Roman Empire, Judaism all but disintegrated. However, late in the Roman Empire, the Christianized state played a decisive role in ''re-Judaizing'' the Jews. The state gradually excluded them from society while supporting their leaders and recognizing their local communities. It was thus in Late Antiquity that the synagogue-centered community became prevalent among the Jews, that there re-emerged a distinctively Jewish art and literature--laying the foundations for Judaism as we know it today.

Ayla, the independent heroine of The Clan of the Cave Bear and The Valley of Horses, sets out from the valley on Whinney, the horse she tamed. With her is Jondalar, the tall, handsome, yellow-haired man she nursed back to health and came to love. Together they meet the Mamutoi the Mammoth Hunters people like Ayla. But to Ayla, who was raised by the Clan of the Cave Bear, they are  the Others.  She approaches them with mixed feelings of fear and curiosity. Talut, a powerful bear of a man with bright red hair, a booming laugh, and a gentle heart, and his tall, dark-haired sister, Tulie, are the leaders of the Lion Camp of the Mamutoi. It is here that Ayla finds her first women friends, but some among the Mamutoi dislike Ayla because she was raised by  flatheads,  their name for the people of the Clan. Ayla is haunted by her memories of the Clan because Rydag, a child of mixed parentage living with the Mamutoi, bears so strong a resemblance to her own son, Durc. It is the Mamutoi master carver of ivory dark-skinned Ranec, flirtatious, artistic, magnetic who fascinates Ayla. She finds herself drawn to him. Because of her uncanny control over animals, her healing skills, and the magic firestone she discovered, Ayla is adopted into the Mammoth Hearth by Mamut, the ancient shaman of the Great Earth Mother. Ayla finds herself torn between her strong feelings for Ranec and her powerful love for the wildly jealous and unsure Jondalar. It is not until after the great mammoth hunt, when Ayla s life is threatened, that a fateful decision is made. This eBook includes the full text of the novel plus the following additional content: ?

In that brutal summer, Vincent's beauty and precocity captivate two men: Marcel, thirty years his senior, a writer and celebrated socialite; and Arthur, the twenty-one year old son of one of the servants, who is now a soldier at the front.

Like her other, perhaps better known tales, such as Five Children and It, the story takes quite ordinary children of the time and plunges them into fantastical adventures. In this book, two children, with the interesting Saxon names of Edred and Elfrida, aged 10 and 12 respectively, discover that due to the death of a distant relative, young Edred is now Lord of Arden. The estate consists of not much more than a little money, a crumbling castle, and an attached house. An old retainer tells them of a legend regarding the Lord of Arden and a buried treasure. Naturally they are eager to locate the treasure, which may help them restore the castle. They discover a way to summon up the mascot of the House, a white mole or  mouldiwarp,  who enables them to travel back through time in search of the treasure.

Family Treasures is a tool for all different types of individuals and families to better understand the qualities of strong families: appreciation and affection, commitment, positive communication, successful management of stress and crisis, spiritual well-being and enjoyable time together. Written in conversational style, Family Treasures empowers families to assess their own strengths and to develop a plan for building upon their successes. Within each chapter are family inventories and a variety of family-tested activities that can be used to enhance the quality of the family. \\"Family Treasures is one of those great resources that has strong research at its base and can be used by a variety of disciplines. The assessment tools and activities can be readily used by professionals and families to strengthen family relationships.\\" Linda Skogrand, Ph.D. Assistant Professor Extension Specialist Utah State University","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZEAR0S36L9kC&dq=Strong+Family+(Life+Topics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Impro Improvisation and the Theatre","description":"Keith Johnstone's involvement with the theatre began when George Devine and Tony Richardson, artistic directors of the Royal Court Theatre, commissioned a play from him. This was in 1956. A few years later he was himself Associate Artistic Director, working as a play-reader and director, in particular helping to run the Writers' Group. The improvisatory techniques and exercises evolved there to foster spontaneity and narrative skills were developed further in the actors' studio then in demonstrations to schools and colleges and ultimately in the founding of a company of performers, called The Theatre Machine. Divided into four sections, 'Status', 'Spontaneity', 'Narrative Skills', and 'Masks and Trance', arranged more or less in the order a group might approach them, the book sets out the specific techniques and exercises which Johnstone has himself found most useful and most stimulating. The result is both an ideas book and a fascinating exploration of the nature of spontaneous creativity.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EVmminvaWDQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lion (Pocket Pals (Safari Ltd))","description":"When a high-spirited little girl is caught being particularly naughty and is sent to the time-out chair, she imagines what it would be like if she was really wild, like a lion or a bear.

James Oakes, New York Review of Books  Superb...A remarkable achievement, by far the best general account of the war now available. It is critical, insightful, and rooted in a wealth of archival sources; it brings far more of the Mexican experience than any other work...and it clearly demonstrates the social and cultural dynamics that shaped Mexican and American politics and military force.   Journal of American History It has long been held that the United States emerged victorious from the MexicanAmerican War because its democratic system was more stable and its citizens more loyal. But this award-winning history shows that Americans dramatically underestimated the strength of Mexican patriotism and failed to see how bitterly Mexicans resented their claims to national and racial superiority. Their fierce resistance surprised US leaders, who had expected a quick victory with few casualties. By focusing on how ordinary soldiers and civilians in both countries understood and experienced the conflict, The Dead March offers a clearer picture of the brief, bloody war that redrew the map of North America.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jsIyDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"25 Mini-Lessons for Teaching Writing (Grades 3-6)","description":"Each ten-minute lesson in this guide offers proven methods for strengthening a wide variety of writing skills.

These books powerfully evoke the desires of gardeners: they show us gardeners who, like poets, imagine not just what is but what should be. In particular, the earliest English garden books, such as Thomas Hill's The Gardener's Labyrinth or Hugh Platt's Floraes Paradise, mix magical practices with mundane recipes even when the authors insist that they rely completely on their own experience in these matters. Like early modern \\"books of secrets,\\" early gardening manuals often promise the reader power to alter the essential properties of plants: to make the gillyflower double, to change the lily's hue, or to grow a cherry without a stone. Green Desire describes the innovative design of the old manuals, examining how writers and printers marketed them as fiction as well as practical advice for aspiring gardeners. Along with this attention to the delights of reading, it analyzes the strange dignity and pleasure of garden labor and the division of men's and women's roles in creating garden art. The book ends by recounting the heated debate over how much people could do to create marvels in their own gardens. For writers and readers alike, these green desires inspired dreams of power and self-improvement, fantasies of beauty achieved without work, and hopes for order in an unpredictable world not so different from the dreams of gardeners today.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=26FhDwAAQBAJ&dq=Plants+in+Garden+History:+An+Illustrated+History+of+Plants+and+Their+Influence+on+Garden+Styles-From+Ancient+Egypt+to+the+Present+Day&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Witches Brew a (A magic kingdom of Landover novel)","description":"An acorn falls far from the tree Former Chicago lawyer Ben Holiday was very proud and quite happy. And why shouldn t he be? The Magic Kingdom which he ruled as High Lord was finally at peace. He was free to lie back and watch as his new daughter grew. And grow she did by leaps and bournds, shooting through infancy in a matter of months. She took her first steps and learned to swim in the same week. An amalgam of magic and heredity, Mistaya was born a seedling, nourished by soils from Landover, Earth, and the fairy mists, come into being in the dank, misty deadness of the Deep Fell. She was as lovely as her mother, the sylph Willow, with dazzling green eyes that cut to the soul. Ben wished he could enjoy his daughter's childhood and his happy kingdom forever. Alas, those idyllic days were not to last. For Rydall, king of lands beyond the fairy mist, rode up to the gates of Sterling Silver and shattered peace of Landover. His armies were poised on the border, ready to invade unless Ben accepted a challenge: Rydall would send seven champions to face Ben, each in a different form. If Ben triumphed over all seven, Rydall would then abandon his claims to the kingdom. Some counseled the High Lord to refuse Rydall's challenge, but Holiday could not, for Mistaya had been snatched from her guardians by foul magic.

It envisaged the separation of the monetary and credit functions of the banking system, by requiring 100% reserve backing for deposits. Irving Fisher (1936) claimed the following advantages for this plan: (1) Much better control of a major source of business cycle fluctuations, sudden increases and contractions of bank credit and of the supply of bank-created money. (2) Complete elimination of bank runs. (3) Dramatic reduction of the (net) public debt. (4) Dramatic reduction of private debt, as money creation no longer requires simultaneous debt creation. We study these claims by embedding a comprehensive and carefully calibrated model of the banking system in a DSGE model of the U.S. economy. We find support for all four of Fisher's claims. Furthermore, output gains approach 10 percent, and steady state inflation can drop to zero without posing problems for the conduct of monetary policy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eFUZEAAAQBAJ&dq=On+the+valuation+of+deposit+institutions+(Working+paper)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ultimate Aikido: Secrets of Self-Defense and Inner Power","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Hodgepodge: A commonplace book","description":"Presents short observations, quotations, and facts on subjects including art, actors, fashion, drinking, names, gambling, and old age","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Y1xiPQAACAAJ&dq=Hodgepodge:+A+commonplace+book&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Executing Mozart","description":"Harvard, England, the monarchy, and a double helix of music and politics are the chords that reverberate through this literary thriller.

While others were exploring the external world, they turned inward - to explore consciousness itself. In the changing flow of human thought, they asked, is there anything that remains the same? They found that there is indeed a changeless Reality underlying the ebb and flow of life. Their discoveries are an expression of what Aldous Huxley called the Perennial Philosophy, the wellspring of all religious faith that assures us that God-realization is within human reach. The Upanishads are the sages' wisdom, given in intense sessions of spiritual instruction in ashrams, in family gatherings, in a royal court, in the kingdom of Death himself.

Such men are independent thinkers, craving open air and wide-open spaces, which meant than an obsession with escape was almost inevitable' - John D GreshamBetween dusk and dawn on the night of March 24th25th 1944, a small army of Allied soldiers crawled through tunnels in Germany in a covert operation the likes of which the Third Reich had never seen before.The prison break from Stalag Luft III in eastern Germany was the largest of its kind in the Second World War. Seventy-nine Allied soldiers and airmen made it outside the wire  but only three made it outside Nazi Germany. Fifty were executed by the Gestapo.Jonathan Vance tells the incredible story that was made famous by the 1963 film The Great Escape. The escape is a classic tale of prisoner and their wardens in a battle of wits and wills.The brilliantly conceived escape plan is overshadowed only by the colourful, daring (and sometimes very funny) crew who executed it  literally under the noses of German guards.From their first days in Stalag Luft III and the forming of bonds key to such exploits, to the tunnel building, amazing escape and eventual capture, Vance's history is a vivid, compelling look at one of the greatest 'exfiltration' missions of all time.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uMyNDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Story and Verse for Children","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"HOPI KACHINA DOLLS WITH A KEY TO THEIR IDENTIFICATION","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"365 Bible Prayers for Children","description":"A collection of children's prayers for each day of the year, inspired by Bible passages from Genesis to Acts.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=X7kCAAAACAAJ&dq=365+Bible+Prayers+for+Children&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Story Road to Literacy","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tRZexQEACAAJ&dq=The+Story+Road+to+Literacy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dun & Bradstreet's Guide to Doing Business Around the World","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Defying Gravity: How to Win at Weightlifting","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wTYVPQAACAAJ&dq=Defying+Gravity:+How+to+Win+at+Weightlifting&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"No Murder too Small","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Every Tenant's Legal Guide","description":"Every Landlord's Legal Guide makes landlords  jobs easier by putting everything they need to legally and successfully run their business in one package.

Well known for the historic missions that he helped establish all along the coast from San Diego to San Francisco (21 in all), Father Serra is even recognized by the secular society of the United States government as the Founder of California . As one of the pioneers who created the United States of America, his larger than life-size statue stands in the hall of the U.S. Capitol. Archbishop Couve de Murville presents an historical and spiritual biography of Serra from his childhood and student days in Majorca, Spain, to his time in Mexico, and to his great missionary work in California. Regarded as a great teacher by his order, his superiors initially made Serra a professor of theology at the Lullian University in Palma, Spain. After teaching for five years, he answered the call to be a missionary to the New World, and embarked on a ship to Mexico in 1749. For the rest of his life he worked tirelessly as a preacher and a missionary in Mexico and California, his motto being Always forward, never back. Canonized a saint by Pope Francis in 2015, Father Serra s presence and work are still very much alive though the beautiful missions that are visited by millions of people every year. This deluxe edition includes numerous illustrations, most in color, of the life and work of Serra, especially of the missions that dot the landscape of California, many gloriously restored to their original beauty. At crucial moments in human affairs, God raises up men and women whom he thrusts into the roles of decisive importance for the future development of both society and the Church. We rejoice all the more when their achievement is coupled with a holiness of life that can truly be called heroic. So it is with Junipero Serra, who in the providence of God was destined to be the Apostle of California. St. John Paul II Junipero Serra is a great example for Catholics. He dedicated his life to the mission of evangelization, to bringing the good news of the Gospel to America. He understood that the purpose of the Church is to help us all grow as human persons and to respond to God s call: to love God and love others.

Moreover, Roman is reunited with his bride, Chataine Deirdre, who is pregnant with their first child. But while Galapos is consumed with the task of rebuilding war-torn Lystra, Deirdre allows herself to be lured away from Roman's protection. Immediately after giving birth in a cave, she is sold into slavery and taken to another province. Upon her mysterious disappearance, Roman undertakes a futile search for her, not knowing that her redemption has already been ordained, nor the terrible price that must be paid to free her.

Sylvester Stallone's actionoriented program for getting fit and eating right is also a revealing portrait of one of Hollywood's biggest stars. Sly Moves is more than just a handbook on fitness and nutrition. It's a provocative and candid inside look at the trials and triumphs of one of Hollywood's most famous stars. Throughout his career, Sly has always been body conscious, and as he experimented with intense training methods for various films, he has learned  often the hard way  what works and what definitely doesn't. His goal here is to help readers change harmful fitness habits, learn to counter reckless eating, and appreciate who they are even when they don't feel much like action heroes. Part 1 is a history of Sylvester Stallone's physique, as the Rocky star shares stories about his being bullied as a child, finding comfort and strength at the gym, and then later, the wild ride of fad diets, crashtraining regimens and workout disasters that fringed on obsession. Part 2, The Sly Moves workout, outlines four exercise programs: classic, advanced, women's and hardcore. The workouts only require a commitment of about three hours a week (exactly the same amount of time Sly works out). The Sly Moves eating plan (Part 3) is Sly's nutrition guide, highlighted by a unique meal plan for a lifetime of good eating. Part 4 gives Sly an opportunity to inspire and encourage readers to make Sly Moves part of a longterm picture of health, fitness and wellbeing, with tips on everything from keeping goals and relaxation techniques to lessons learned from The Contender.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sGRw-Yj8wYQC&dq=Sly+Moves+:+My+Proven+Program+to+Lose+Weight,+Build+Strength,+Gain+Will+Power,+and+Live+your+Dream&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Help!

Before Garrison Keillor and Spalding Gray there was Jean Shepherd: a master monologist and writer who spun the materials of his all-American childhood into immensely resonant--and utterly hilarious--works of comic art. In God We Trust: All Others Pay Cash represents one of the peaks of his achievement, a compound of irony, affection, and perfect detail that speaks across generations. In God We Trust, Shepherd's wildly witty reunion with his Indiana hometown, disproves the adage \\"You can never go back.\\" Bending the ear of Flick, his childhood-buddy-turned-bartender, Shepherd recalls passionately his genuine Red Ryder BB gun, confesses adolescent failure in the arms of Junie Jo Prewitt, and relives a story of man against fish that not even Hemingway could rival. From pop art to the World's Fair, Shepherd's subjects speak with a universal irony and are deeply and unabashedly grounded in American Midwestern life, together rendering a wonderfully nostalgic impression of a more innocent era when life was good, fun was clean, and station wagons roamed the earth. A comic genius who bridged the gap between James Thurber and David Sedaris, Shepherd may have accomplished for Holden, Indiana, what Mark Twain did for Hannibal, Missouri.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cHpM9jx9roIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Apollo","description":"On January 27, 1967, astronauts Gus Grissom, Ed White, and Roger Chaffee climbed into a new spacecraft perched atop a large Saturn rocket at Kennedy Space Center in Florida for a routine dress rehearsal of their upcoming launch into orbit, then less than a month away. All three astronauts were experienced pilots and had dreams of one day walking on the moon. But little did they know, nor did anyone else, that once they entered the spacecraft that cold winter day they would never leave it alive. The Apollo program would be perilously close to failure before it ever got off the ground. But rather than dooming the space program, this tragedy caused the spacecraft to be completely overhauled, creating a stellar flying machine to achieve the program s primary goal: putting man on the moon. Apollo 1 is a candid portrayal of the astronauts, the disaster that killed them, and its aftermath. In it, readers will learn: How the Apollo 1 spacecraft was doomed from the start, with miles of uninsulated wiring and tons of flammable materials in a pure oxygen atmosphere, along with a hatch that wouldn t open How, due to political pressure, the government contract to build the Apollo 1 craft went to a bidder with an inferior plan How public opinion polls were beginning to turn against the space program before the tragedy and got much worse after Apollo 1 is about America fulfilling its destiny of man setting foot on the moon.

Dubay explores the reasons why all of the most eminent physicists of the twentieth century agree that beauty is the primary standard for scientific truth. Likewise, the best of contemporary theologians are also exploring with renewed vigor the aesthetic dimensions of divine revelation. Honest searchers after truth can hardly fail to be impressed that these two disciplines, science and theology, so different in methods, approaches and aims, are yet meeting in this and other surprising and gratifying ways. This book relates these developments to nature, music, academe and our unquenchable human thirst for unending beauty, truth and ecstasy, a thirst quenched only at the summit of contemplative prayer here below, and in the consummation of the beatific vision hereafter.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CCatd0e4jg4C&dq=The+Evidential+Power+of+Beauty:+Science+and+Theology+Meet&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Breve historia contempornea de la Argentina (Spanish Edition)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Head Case: A Novel","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Hawaiian Antiquities (Moolelo Hawaii) (Bernice P.

Drawing on primary sources, personal narratives, and anecdotes, Gerard Koeppel demonstrates how quickly the shallow wells of Dutch New Amsterdam were overwhelmed, leaving the English and American city beleaguered by filth, epidemics, and fires. This situation changed only when an outside water source was finally secured in 1842--the Croton Aqueduct, a model for urban water supplies in the United States. As the fertile wilderness enjoyed by the first Europeans in Manhattan vanishes and the magnitude of New York's water problem grows, the reader is introduced to the plans of Christopher Colles, builder of the first American steam engine, and of Joseph Browne, the first to call for a mainland water source for this island-city. In this vividly written true-life fable of the \\"Fools of Gotham,\\" the chief obstacle to the aqueduct is the Manhattan Company. Masterminded by Aaron Burr, with the complicity of Alexander Hamilton and other leading New Yorkers, the company was a ruse, serving as the charter for a bank--today's Chase Manhattan. The cholera epidemic of 1832 and the great fire three years later were instrumental in forcing the city's leaders to finally unite and regain New York's water rights. Koeppel's account of the developments leading up to the Croton Aqueduct reveals it as a triumph not only of inspired technology but of political will. With over forty archival photographs and drawings, Water for Gotham demonstrates the deep interconnections between natural resource management, urban planning, and civic leadership. As New York today retakes its waterfront and boasts famous tap water, this book is a valuable reminder of how much vision and fortitude are required to make a great city function and thrive.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XGE9EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"SOLAR LOTTERY.","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"101 Words You'll Probably Never Need to Know but Can Use to Impress People","description":"The book is a humorously illustrated vocabulary-building resource.

It focuses on the analysis of variance and regression, but also addressing basic ideas in experimental design and count data. The book has four connecting themes: similarity of inferential procedures, balanced one-way analysis of variance, comparison of models, and checking assumptions. Most inferential procedures are based on identifying a scalar parameter of interest, estimating that parameter, obtaining the standard error of the estimate, and identifying the appropriate reference distribution. Given these items, the inferential procedures are identical for various parameters. Balanced one-way analysis of variance has a simple, intuitive interpretation in terms of comparing the sample variance of the group means with the mean of the sample variance for each group. All balanced analysis of variance problems are considered in terms of computing sample variances for various group means. Comparing different models provides a structure for examining both balanced and unbalanced analysis of variance problems and regression problems. Checking assumptions is presented as a crucial part of every statistical analysis. Examples using real data from a wide variety of fields are used to motivate theory. Christensen consistently examines residual plots and presents alternative analyses using different transformation and case deletions. Detailed examination of interactions, three factor analysis of variance, and a split-plot design with four factors are included. The numerous exercises emphasize analysis of real data. Senior undergraduate and graduate students in statistics and graduate students in other disciplines using analysis of variance, design of experiments, or regression analysis will find this book useful.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BGPgi7MSUA0C&dq=Introduction+to+Analysis+of+Variance:+Design,+Analyis&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Greatest Sedition Is Silence: Four Years in America","description":"'Passionate, informed, important: William Rivers Pitt helps us see what's wrong with American politics today.

From the bestselling author and master of narrative nonfiction comes the enthralling story of the sinking of the Lusitania  Both terrifying and enthralling.  Entertainment Weekly  Thrilling, dramatic and powerful.  NPR  Thoroughly engrossing.  George R.R. Martin On May 1, 1915, with WWI entering its tenth month, a luxury ocean liner as richly appointed as an English country house sailed out of New York, bound for Liverpool, carrying a record number of children and infants. The passengers were surprisingly at ease, even though Germany had declared the seas around Britain to be a war zone. For months, German U-boats had brought terror to the North Atlantic. But the Lusitania was one of the era s great transatlantic  Greyhounds  the fastest liner then in service and her captain, William Thomas Turner, placed tremendous faith in the gentlemanly strictures of warfare that for a century had kept civilian ships safe from attack. Germany, however, was determined to change the rules of the game, and Walther Schwieger, the captain of Unterseeboot-20, was happy to oblige. Meanwhile, an ultra-secret British intelligence unit tracked Schwieger s U-boat, but told no one. As U-20 and the Lusitania made their way toward Liverpool, an array of forces both grand and achingly small hubris, a chance fog, a closely guarded secret, and more all converged to produce one of the great disasters of history. It is a story that many of us think we know but don t, and Erik Larson tells it thrillingly, switching between hunter and hunted while painting a larger portrait of America at the height of the Progressive Era. Full of glamour and suspense, Dead Wake brings to life a cast of evocative characters, from famed Boston bookseller Charles Lauriat to pioneering female architect Theodate Pope to President Woodrow Wilson, a man lost to grief, dreading the widening war but also captivated by the prospect of new love.

If Hitler had been stopped at Munich then World War II as we know it could not have happened. The subject has been thoroughly studied in British, French and German documents and consequently we know that the weakness in the Western position at Munich consisted in the Anglo-French opinion that the Soviet commitment to its allies - France and Czechoslovakia - was utterly unreliable. What has never been seriously studied in the Western literature is the whole spectrum of East European documentation. This book targets precisely this dimension of the problem. The Romanians were at one time prepared to admit the transfer of the Red Army across their territory. The Red Army, mobilised on a massive scale, was informed that its destination was Czechoslovakia. The Polish consul in Lodavia reported the entrance of the Red Army into the country. In the meantime, Moscow focused especially on the Polish rail network.

NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY The Guardian ? New York ? Refinery29 ? Kirkus Reviews In this achingly beautiful graphic memoir, Liana Finck goes in search of that thing she has lost her shadow, she calls it, but one might also think of it as the  otherness  or  strangeness  that has defined her since birth, that part of her that has always made her feel as though she is living in exile from the world. In Passing for Human, Finck is on a quest for self-understanding and self-acceptance, and along the way she seeks to answer some eternal questions: What makes us whole? What parts of ourselves do we hide or ignore or chase away because they re embarrassing, or inconvenient, or just plain weird and at what cost? Passing for Human is what Finck calls  a neurological coming-of-age story  one in which, through her childhood, human connection proved elusive and her most enduring relationships were with plants and rocks and imaginary friends; in which her mother was an artist whose creative life had been stifled by an unhappy first marriage and a deeply sexist society that seemed expressly designed to snuff out creativity in women; in which her father was a doctor who struggled in secret with the guilt of having passed his own form of otherness on to his daughter; and in which, as an adult, Finck finally finds her shadow again and, with it, her true self. Melancholy and funny, personal and surreal, Passing for Human is a profound exploration of identity by one of the most talented young comic artists working today. Part magical odyssey, part feminist creation myth, this memoir is, most of all, an extraordinary, moving meditation on what it means to be an artist and a woman grappling with the desire to pass for human. Praise for Passing for Human  In its ambition, framing, and multiple layers, [Passing for Human] raises the bar for graphic narrative. Even fans of [Liana Finck s] work in the New Yorker will be blindsided by this outstanding book.  Kirkus Reviews (starred review)  A sure hit for readers of graphic memoirs, this explores feeling different while recognizing sameness in others and making art while embracing being a work-in progress oneself.  Annie Bostrom, Booklist  This story is as tender as it is wry. . . . Becoming human is a lifelong task but Finck illustrates it with humor and panache.

When the lines you thought existed simply vanish? How do you plant your feet to make a stand when you no longer know what side you re on? The war has come home. For over forty years, Art Keller has been on the front lines of America s longest conflict: The War on Drugs. His obsession to defeat the world s most powerful, wealthy, and lethal kingpin?the godfather of the Sinaloa Cartel, Ad n Barrera?has left him bloody and scarred, cost him the people he loves, even taken a piece of his soul. Now Keller is elevated to the highest ranks of the DEA, only to find that in destroying one monster he has created thirty more that are wreaking even more chaos and suffering in his beloved Mexico. But not just there. Barrera s final legacy is the heroin epidemic scourging America. Throwing himself into the gap to stem the deadly flow, Keller finds himself surrounded by enemies?men who want to kill him, politicians who want to destroy him, and worse, the unimaginable?an incoming administration that s in bed with the very drug traffickers that Keller is trying to bring down. Art Keller is at war with not only the cartels, but with his own government. And the long fight has taught him more than he ever imagined. Now, he learns the final lesson?there are no borders. In a story that moves from deserts of Mexico to Wall Street, from the slums of Guatemala to the marbled corridors of Washington, D.C., Winslow follows a new generation of narcos, the cops who fight them, street traffickers, addicts, politicians, money-launderers, real-estate moguls, and mere children fleeing the violence for the chance of a life in a new country.

He is larger than life, from his bulging muscles and multimillion-dollar contract to his huge homes and hot cars. And he is as handsome a man as she has ever seen. But his sprawling house in Florida becomes her gilded cage when Jose is on the road, hitting home runs and bedding women in American League cities from Anaheim to Boston. Jessica blames herself and does everything she can to keep Jose faithful nose jobs, new breast implants, and even going so far as to bring other women into their home for threesomes. But it wasn't enough. It was never enough. Through it all, she breaks through the icy stares of the wives and girlfriends of Jose s teammates and learns to honor the code of the baseball sorority -- If you see a ballplayer with another woman, keep your mouth shut! While Jose, author of Juiced -- the #1 New York Times bestseller about steroids in baseball -- seems intent on self-destruction, Jessica willingly goes along for the ride. Their turbulent relationship careens from steroids to pregnancy, from marriage to the birth of a precious baby daughter, from private investigators to divorce attorneys -- with a black eye. This is the story of a beautiful young woman who falls in love with a hugely successful professional athlete, and who becomes addicted to him and to everything that his success seems to represent. It is also the story of a woman who spends the better part of ten years trying to beat that addiction, and who finds her true self in the process.

From the Pulitzer Prizewinning author of The Emperor of All Maladies a fascinating history of the gene and  a magisterial account of how human minds have laboriously, ingeniously picked apart what makes us tick  (Elle).  Sid Mukherjee has the uncanny ability to bring together science, history, and the future in a way that is understandable and riveting, guiding us through both time and the mystery of life itself.   Ken Burns  Dr. Siddhartha Mukherjee dazzled readers with his Pulitzer Prize-winning The Emperor of All Maladies in 2010. That achievement was evidently just a warm-up for his virtuoso performance in The Gene: An Intimate History, in which he braids science, history, and memoir into an epic with all the range and biblical thunder of Paradise Lost  (The New York Times). In this biography Mukherjee brings to life the quest to understand human heredity and its surprising influence on our lives, personalities, identities, fates, and choices.  Mukherjee expresses abstract intellectual ideas through emotional stories [and] swaddles his medical rigor with rhapsodic tenderness, surprising vulnerability, and occasional flashes of pure poetry  (The Washington Post). Throughout, the story of Mukherjee s own family with its tragic and bewildering history of mental illness reminds us of the questions that hang over our ability to translate the science of genetics from the laboratory to the real world. In riveting and dramatic prose, he describes the centuries of research and experimentation from Aristotle and Pythagoras to Mendel and Darwin, from Boveri and Morgan to Crick, Watson and Franklin, all the way through the revolutionary twenty-first century innovators who mapped the human genome.  A fascinating and often sobering history of how humans came to understand the roles of genes in making us who we are and what our manipulation of those genes might mean for our future  (Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel), The Gene is the revelatory and magisterial history of a scientific idea coming to life, the most crucial science of our time, intimately explained by a master.

He shows how this process, which played itself out most visibly and poignantly in the Dutch Reformed Church between 1664 and the American Revolution, illustrates the difficulty of maintaining non-English cultures and institutions in an increasingly English world.

Over the course of a weekend, several guests turn up, shocked to encounter a three-hundred-some-pound, surly white woman in a sari. Then a series of Hindu-Muslim murders leads to a citywide curfew, and they unwittingly become her captives. So begins a period of days blending into nights as Natraja and her Indian cook become entangled in a web of religious violence, and their guests fall under the spell of this ancient kingdom--at once enthralled and repelled by the begging children, the public funeral pyres, the holy men bathing in the Ganges at dawn.

Information Grids should allow for the effective access, extraction and linking of dispersed information. Currently Europe s coporations spend over 10 Billion  to deal with these problems. This book will demonstrate the applicability of grid technologies to industry. To this end, it gives a detailed insight on how on-tology technology can be used to manage dispersed information assets more efficiently. The book is based on experiences from the COG (Corporate Ontology Grid) project, carried out jointly by three leading industrial players and the Digital Enterprise Research Institute Austria. Through comparisons of this project with alternative technologies and projects, it provides hands-on experience and best practice examples to act as a reference guide for their development. Information Integration with Ontologies: Ontology based Information Integration in an Industrial Setting is ideal for technical experts and computer researchers in the IT-area looking to achieve integration of heterogeneous information and apply ontology technologies and techniques in practice. It will also be of great benefit to technical decision makers seeking infor-mation about ontology technologies and the scientific audience, interested in achievements towards the application of ontologies in an industrial setting.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yc_B3yKwKKEC&dq=Information+Integration+with+Ontologies+:+Experiences+from+an+Industrial+Showcase&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fire at Peshtigo","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Blue Book on Information Age Inquiry, Instruction and Literacy","description":"Presents key terms in a working theoretical model that can be used in understanding the role of information inquiry in instruction and includes practical applications.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=En_gAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Blue+Book+on+Information+Age+Inquiry,+Instruction+and+Literacy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Merlin a Novel","description":"A young boy who has no identity nor memory of his past washes ashore on the coast of Wales and finds his true name after a series of fantastic adventures.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=04vyDwAAQBAJ&dq=Merlin+a+Novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Medieval Galician-Port Poetry (Garland Library of Medieval Literature)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Treasury of Wedding Poems, Quotations, and Short Stories","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9-AauAEACAAJ&dq=Treasury+of+Wedding+Poems,+Quotations,+and+Short+Stories&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Keynes's Monetary Theory: A Different Interpretation","description":"In this rigorous study of John Maynard Keynes's views on economic theory and policy from 1920-1946, Professor Meltzer argues that some of Keynes's main ideas have been ignored or misstated.

And you can use it to guide you in the actual process of construction. After a ten-year silence, Christopher Alexander and his colleagues at the Center for Environmental Structure are now publishing a major statement in the form of three books which will, in their words, \\"lay the basis for an entirely new approach to architecture, building and planning, which will we hope replace existing ideas and practices entirely.\\" The three books are The Timeless Way of Building, The Oregon Experiment, and this book, A Pattern Language. At the core of these books is the idea that people should design for themselves their own houses, streets, and communities. This idea may be radical (it implies a radical transformation of the architectural profession) but it comes simply from the observation that most of the wonderful places of the world were not made by architects but by the people. At the core of the books, too, is the point that in designing their environments people always rely on certain \\"languages,\\" which, like the languages we speak, allow them to articulate and communicate an infinite variety of designs within a forma system which gives them coherence. This book provides a language of this kind. It will enable a person to make a design for almost any kind of building, or any part of the built environment. \\"Patterns,\\" the units of this language, are answers to design problems (How high should a window sill be? How many stories should a building have? How much space in a neighborhood should be devoted to grass and trees?). More than 250 of the patterns in this pattern language are given: each consists of a problem statement, a discussion of the problem with an illustration, and a solution. As the authors say in their introduction, many of the patterns are archetypal, so deeply rooted in the nature of things that it seemly likely that they will be a part of human nature, and human action, as much in five hundred years as they are today.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FTpxDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THIEF OF LIGHT.","description":"When his top forgery artist is murdered, underworld art dealer Adrian Sellers is forced to flee for his life from an aggressive Japanese mob while confronting his heroin addiction and falling in love with a compassionate colleague","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=w6qjgzwkDmcC&dq=THIEF+OF+LIGHT.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What is the Maoist Internationalist Movement","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=b6X9GwAACAAJ&dq=What+is+the+Maoist+Internationalist+Movement&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Reiki: A Piatkus Guide (Piatkus Guides)","description":"The Piatkus Guide to Reiki is a clear and accessible introduction to an increasingly popular healing art.

The lifestyle of the mountain men could be harsh, existing as they did among animals, and spending most of their days and nights living and camping out in the great unexplored wilds of the Rockies. Life outdoors presented many threats, not least among them Native Americans, who were hostile to the mountain men encroaching on the area for their own purposes. For a certain kind of pioneer, this risk and more were outweighed by the benefits of living free, without the restrictions and boundaries of  civilized  settlements. In The Adventures of the Mountain Men, editor Stephen Brennan has compiled many of the best stories about the mountain men the most daring exploits, the death-defying chances taken to hunt big game, the clashes with the arrows of Native Americans, and also the moments when the men were struck by the incomparable beauty of the unsullied, majestic Rocky Mountains.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=X7f-DQAAQBAJ&dq=The+Lives+of+Mountain+Men&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Afoot & Afield in San Diego County (Afoot & Afield Portland/Vancouver: A Comprehensive Hiking Guide)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Off the Chart : A Novel","description":"Finding himself homeless on a bitterly cold night, former mental patient Jerome Coe makes his way to New Orleans, where he makes an assortment of eccentric new friends, experiences occasional psychotic breaks, and contemplates two chances for happiness.

From the highly praised author of The Child Finder and The Enchanted comes The Butterfly Girl, a riveting novel that ripples with truth, exploring the depths of love and sacrifice in the face of a past that cannot be left dead and buried. A year ago, Naomi, the investigator with an uncanny ability for finding missing children, made a promise that she would not take another case until she finds the younger sister who has been missing for years. Naomi has no picture, not even a name. All she has is a vague memory of a strawberry field at night, black dirt under her bare feet as she ran for her life. The search takes her to Portland, Oregon, where scores of homeless children wander the streets like ghosts, searching for money, food, and companionship. The sharp-eyed investigator soon discovers that young girls have been going missing for months, many later found in the dirty waters of the river. Though she does not want to get involved, Naomi is unable to resist the pull of children in need and the fear she sees in the eyes of a twelve-year old girl named Celia. Running from an abusive stepfather and an addict mother, Celia has nothing but hope in the butterflies her guides and guardians on the dangerous streets. She sees them all around her, tiny iridescent wisps of hope that soften the edges of this hard world and illuminate a cherished memory from her childhood the Butterfly Museum, a place where everything is safe and nothing can hurt her. As danger creeps closer, Naomi and Celia find echoes of themselves in one another, forcing them each to consider the question: Can you still be lost even when you ve been found? But will they find the answer too late?","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=T4t_DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tomies Little Christmas Pageant","description":"Text and illustrations retell the story of the Nativity as performed in a children's Christmas pageant.

The new edition also includes a bibliographic essay by Thelin covering significant works in the field that have appeared since the publication of the first edition.

In response to this disaster the complete array of military and civilian investigative and judicial procedures ran their course. After almost two years of investigation with virtually unlimited resources, no culprit emerged, no bad guy showed himself, no smoking gun was found. This book attempts to make sense of this tragedy--a tragedy that on its surface makes no sense at all. With almost twenty years in uniform and a Ph.D. in organizational behavior, Lieutenant Colonel Snook writes from a unique perspective. A victim of friendly fire himself, he develops individual, group, organizational, and cross-level accounts of the accident and applies a rigorous analysis based on behavioral science theory to account for critical links in the causal chain of events. By explaining separate pieces of the puzzle, and analyzing each at a different level, the author removes much of the mystery surrounding the shootdown. Based on a grounded theory analysis, Snook offers a dynamic, cross-level mechanism he calls \\"practical drift\\"--the slow, steady uncoupling of practice from written procedure--to complete his explanation. His conclusion is disturbing. This accident happened because, or perhaps in spite of everyone behaving just the way we would expect them to behave, just the way theory would predict. The shootdown was a normal accident in a highly reliable organization.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mve2cTSin1sC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Crow-Girl: The Children of Crow Cove","description":"A timeless novel about the kindness of strangers Near a little cove where a brook runs out to the sea live a girl and her grandmother.

He finds answers by applying attachment theory in the tradition of Bowlby and Ainsworth, and object relations theory in the tradition of Klein, Jacobson, Mahler, and Kernberg, to case studies of bizarre and unusual homicides. These idiographic portraits illustrate erotomanic delusional disorder, chronic catathymia, the psychopath as love object, and assassination as a form of pathological attachment. He elucidates the ways in which certain psychodynamics that inexorably move toward murder can only exist within a fixated or regressed preoedipal personality structure. Such individuals are organized at a borderline or psychotic level, and most often utilize defenses of projection, projective identification, and omnipotent control. This book is written for psychotherapists, psychologists, psychoanalysts, psychiatrists, and social workers in clinical or forensic practice. Biological foci include concepts about the deep limbic structures of the brain and the biochemistry that inhibits or disinhibits such violence. Psychological patterns include both psychoanalytic constructs and the specific psychological test data from the case studies that support such constructs. Social factors include the behavior of the victim and, in the case of assassination, the political acts that contribute to predatory violence. Dr. Meloy emphasizes the crucial need for mental health professionals to go beyond descriptive diagnoses and find the motivation and meaning of such acts. The professional's causal and purposive formulations about such violent attachments lead to more effective evaluation, treatment, and intervention, and perhaps testimony in subsequent criminal and civil litigation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yZjjcZJxAt8C&dq=Violent+Attachments&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Siempre te querre (Spanish Edition)","description":"Spanish translation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oDpuPwAACAAJ&dq=Siempre+te+querre+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Making paper flowers, (Little craft book series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EogjnQEACAAJ&dq=Making+paper+flowers,+(Little+craft+book+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gunsmoke in Nevada, (A Signet book)","description":"Includes Part 1, Number 1: Books and Pamphlets, Including Serials and Contributions to Periodicals (January - June)","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZB0hAQAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I'm in the Tub, Gone","description":"We now live in a time of comfort, convenience and opportunity such as mankind has never known. With all the great things we are provided, we also get many side effects that some thrive on and others do not welcome. Some of these are expectations, added or unwanted responsibility, inconvenience, or extreme supervision to name a few. We all deal with these pressures in a different manner. Then we add another factor, our personal lives. Most people have the ultimate goal to make their personal lives better. We want a happy, normal life at home, no matter what our status is in the community. Some choose suicide as an option to get relief. These are true stories of those final thoughts. Could they have been helped? We will never know. Can we help others in desperate need? Maybe, if we provide a little kindness and understanding.

And he provides the most careful, lively, and up-to-date introduction to the physics of time and the structure of the universe.He guides us step by step through relativity theory and quantum physics, introducing and explaining the ground-breaking ideas of Newton and Boltzmann, Einstein and Schroedinger, Penrose and Hawking. We zoom in on the behaviour of molecules and atoms, and pull back to survey the expansion of the universe. We learn about entropy and gravity, black holes and wormholes, about how it all began and where we are all headed. Lockwood's aim is not just to boggle the mind but to lead us towards an understanding of the science and philosophy.

Alden Weir, and their followers. These artists and writers came together to work in the modest Cos Cob section of Greenwich, Connecticut, testing new styles and new themes in the stimulating company of colleagues. This beautiful book is the first to examine the art colony at Cos Cob and the role it played in the development of American Impressionist art. During the art-colony period, says Susan Larkin, Greenwich was changing from a farming and fishing community to a prosperous suburb of New York. The artists who gathered in Cos Cob produced work that reflects the resulting tensions between tradition and modernity, nature and technology, and country and city. The artists' preferred subjects -- colonial architecture, quiet landscapes, contemplative women -- held a complex significance for them, which Larkin explores. Drawing on maritime history, garden design, women's studies, and more, she places the art colony in its cultural and historical context and reveals unexpected depth in paintings of enormous popular appeal.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=736hEjF-D2cC&dq=The+Cos+Cob+Art+Colony:+Impressionists+on+the+Connecticut+Shore&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fichte's Theory of Subjectivity (Modern European Philosophy)","description":"The first book in English to elucidate the central issues in Fichte's work.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=irc-PGbn-iEC&dq=Fichte%27s+Theory+of+Subjectivity+(Modern+European+Philosophy)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kaputt","description":"Curzio Malaparte was a disaffected supporter of Mussolini with a taste for danger and high living.

Trauma-informed initiatives tend to focus on the challenging behaviors of students and ascribe them to circumstances that students are facing outside of school. This approach ignores the reality that inequity itself causes trauma, and that schools often heighten inequities when implementing trauma-informed practices that are not based in educational equity. In this fresh look at trauma-informed practice, Alex Shevrin Venet urges educators to shift equity to the center as they consider policies and professional development. Using a framework of six principles for equity-centered trauma-informed education, Venet offers practical action steps that teachers and school leaders can take from any starting point, using the resources and influence at their disposal to make shifts in practice, pedagogy, and policy. Overthrowing inequitable systems is a process, not an overnight change. But transformation is possible when educators work together, and teachers can do more than they realize from within their own classrooms.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9nsqEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stories (The) of Muriel Spark","description":"Four brand new tales are now added to New Directions' original 1997 cloth edition of Open to the Public.

Robots are entering the mainstream. Technologies have advanced to the point of mass commercialization Roomba, for example and adoption by governments most notably, their use of drones. Meanwhile, these devices are being received by a public whose main sources of information about robots are the fantasies of popular culture. We know a lot about C-3PO and Robocop but not much about Atlas, Motoman, Kiva, or Beam real-life robots that are reinventing warfare, the industrial workplace, and collaboration. In this book, technology analyst John Jordan offers an accessible and engaging introduction to robots and robotics, covering state-of-the-art applications, economic implications, and cultural context. Jordan chronicles the prehistory of robots and the treatment of robots in science fiction, movies, and television from the outsized influence of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein to Isaac Asimov's I, Robot (in which Asimov coined the term  robotics ). He offers a guided tour of robotics today, describing the components of robots, the complicating factors that make robotics so challenging, and such applications as driverless cars, unmanned warfare, and robots on the assembly line. Roboticists draw on such technical fields as power management, materials science, and artificial intelligence. Jordan points out, however, that robotics design decisions also embody such nontechnical elements as value judgments, professional aspirations, and ethical assumptions, and raise questions that involve law, belief, economics, education, public safety, and human identity. Robots will be neither our slaves nor our overlords; instead, they are rapidly becoming our close companions, working in partnership with us whether in a factory, on a highway, or as a prosthetic device. Given these profound changes to human work and life, Jordan argues that robotics is too important to be left solely to roboticists.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=22M4DQAAQBAJ&dq=Robots&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Governing the hearth: Law and the family in nineteenth-century America (Studies in legal history)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Cambridge Companion to Jewish American Literature (Cambridge Companions to Literature)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Every Landlord's Tax Deduction Guide","description":"Rental real estate provides more tax breaks than almost any other investment.

This fact suggests that world investment demand rather than world consumption demand may be an important yet neglected determinant of U.S. exports. This paper documents a remarkably robust statistical relationship between U.S. exports and world investment demand, and shows that controlling for world investment changes other aspects of traditional export demand equations. To the extent that world investment behaves differently than world consumption, this finding may lead to a revision of current thinking about the ultimate determinants of U.S. exports and the mechanisms through which world economic shocks are transmitted to the U.S. economy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8tm3AAAAIAAJ&dq=Does+world+investment+demand+determine+U.S.+exports+(International+finance+discussion+papers)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"G.I.

I have sung about the beauty of love. I have tried to let you hear the sighs and sobs in silence of struggling and suffering people. I have expressed my concerns about our planet and the need to keep it clean and green. I have written about the bond between God and man and his despair despite the prayers he raises. I have also shown the dark side of humanity wondering how man can oppress, exploit, enslave and kill others and sadly, try to justify it. Here, you can hear the muffled, dying cries of a new born girl child. Some songs are my thoughts that loved to wander far on the wide wings of the flying wind. Through most of the poems on social themes I am appealing to the conscience of the people to abandon violence particularly against women, children and the weak and to build a beautiful world of peace and love. May the humorous poems bring a smile on your face and laughter in your soul.

Of that book Mr A.G. McDonnell wrote in the Observer: \\"It is an Indictment, a Philipic....I know of no books to compare with this since Winwood Reade's Martyrdom of Man\\" But if \\"The Great Trade Route\\" was the destructive onslaught on dubious aspects of contemporary civilisation, \\"Provence\\" is the celebration of what might have been and what, according to Mr. Ford, may still yet be - contrasted with what is. For in that triangle of sun-baked , wind-swept, austere yet generous land, bounded as to its base by the Mediterranean and as to its sides, by the Rhone and the Alps, Mr Ford sees all the pride of past European splendour, the small healthy core of Europe's ailing present, the only promise for her future.

Differentiating between place and space, this book argues that place has very much more influence upon human experience than is generally recognised and that this lack of recognition, and all that results from it, are dehumanising. John Inge presents a rediscovery of the importance of place, drawing on the resources of the Bible and the Christian tradition to demonstrate how Christian theology should take place seriously. A renewed understanding of the importance of place from a theological perspective has much to offer in working against the dehumanising effects of the loss of place. Community and places each build the identity of the other; this book offers important insights in a world in which the effects of globalisation continue to erode people's rootedness and experience of place.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UwpBDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Making Dollars With Pennies: How the Small Investor Can Beat the Wizards on Wall Street","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Secret Places of the Lion","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Oxford Guides to Chaucer: The Canterbury Tales.","description":"Written by a group of internationally renowned scholars, the Oxford Guides to Chaucer offer complete summaries of all that is known about Chaucer's work and include fresh interpretations based on recent advances in both historical knowledge and theoretical understanding.

Six years ago, when the White Flash washed over planet Earth, it left behind an unbelievable legacy: A small number of people changed -- some instantaneously, some months or years later -- giving them superhuman abilities. Sadly, most of these paranormals have chosen to use these gifts for their own selfish goals. Only a handful have joined the Paranormal Control Agency to help stop these rogues, with even fewer choosing the path of the hero. But the Paranormal Effect was not the only astonishing change to take place. Within 24 hours of the White Flash's appearance, SETI detected its first extraterrestrial radio signal ... and then another ... and then another. At any other time in history, this would have been the biggest news of our generation, but for the majority of the global population, the superhumans among us took precedence over voices drifting from light-years away. Except some of those voices are getting closer. A lot closer. Now Vortex, Powerhouse, Lieutenant Takayasu and Shockwave must deal with more than superhuman criminals.

This authoritative biography sets out to examine his life in careful detail--to move beyond hearsay and sensationalism to explain how and why he accomplished so much. Former Blue Grass Boy and longtime music journalist Tom Ewing draws on hundreds of interviews, his personal relationship with Monroe, and an immense personal archive of materials to separate the truth from longstanding myth. Ewing tells the story of the Monroe family's musical household and Bill's early career in the Monroe Brothers duo. He brings to life Monroe's 1940s heyday with the Classic Bluegrass Band, the renewed fervor for his music sparked by the folk revival of the 1960s, and his declining fortunes in the years that followed. Throughout, Ewing deftly captures Monroe's relationships and the personalities of an ever-shifting roster of band members while shedding light on his business dealings and his pioneering work with Bean Blossom and other music festivals. Filled with a wealth of previously unknown details, Bill Monroe offers even the most devoted fan a deeper understanding of Monroe's towering achievements and timeless music.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-RhvDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Juan Belmonte: Killer of Bulls","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VrUzAAAAIAAJ&dq=Juan+Belmonte:+Killer+of+Bulls&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jupiter 6","description":"Although this book is a work of fiction, it is based on actual events.

Part three features some of the different settings in which child and youth care is practised in North America, such as substitute care, family work, intervention in schools, social media, research, and ethics training and supervision, and examines the unique ethical challenges in each of these settings.

Knox's \\"A Gringo Like Me\\" contains poems at once raucous and sexy, tender and raw. Knox has collected dramatic monologues, personal lyrics, and even screenplays together in a single energetic volume for a genuinely surprising debut. In favorites such as \\"Hot Ass Poem, \\" \\"Cruising for Prostitutes, \\" and \\"Chicken Bucket, \\" Knox's quirky characters appear ornery, hickish, misogynist, or worse, but each elucidates a truth worth knowing, even if it's not always welcome. In poems like \\"A Common American Name\\" and \\"Freckles,\\" Knox's lyrical voice charms readers. Between the poles of her unique range, Knox straddles and tames what she may yet prove to be an artificial divide in American poetry: she's a former slam champion, but also a two-time contributor to \\"The Best American Poetry\\"; she's a hilarious performer on stage, but also a deeply intellectual and formally disciplined poet.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OxZBPgAACAAJ&dq=A+Gringo+Like+Me:+Poems&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Handmade Alphabet (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","description":"Presents the handshape for each letter of the American manual alphabet accompanied by an object whose name begins with that letter.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_owAAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Handmade+Alphabet+(Turtleback+School&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"More Unbeatable Chess for Juniors","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Best of Tales: Volume One (Dragonlance Anthology) (Vol. 1)","description":"Edited by bestselling authors and frequent collaborators Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman, this collection contains some of the most well-known and popular stories published in Dragonlance anthologies over the past 15 years.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AJSjHAAACAAJ&dq=The+Best+of+Tales:+Volume+One+(Dragonlance+Anthology)+(Vol.+1)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The New York Times Book of Language and Linguistics","description":"A linguist s entertaining and highly informed guide to what languages are and how they function. Think you know language? Think again. There are languages that change when your mother-in-law is present. The language you speak could make you more prone to accidents. Swear words are produced in a special part of your brain. Over the past few decades, we have reached new frontiers of linguistic knowledge. Linguists can now explain how and why language changes, describe its structures, and map its activity in the brain. But despite these advances, much of what people believe about language is based on folklore, instinct, or hearsay. We imagine a word s origin is it s  true  meaning, that foreign languages are full of  untranslatable  words, or that grammatical mistakes undermine English. In Don t Believe A Word, linguist David Shariatmadari takes us on a mind-boggling journey through the science of language, urging us to abandon our prejudices in a bid to uncover the (far more interesting) truth about what we do with words. Exploding nine widely held myths about language while introducing us to some of the fundamental insights of modern linguistics, Shariatmadari is an energetic guide to the beauty and quirkiness of humanity s greatest achievement.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WyafDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Child from the Village (Middle East Literature in Translation)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Plan de Paris par Arrondissement: Paris Street Guide by District (English and French Edition) Cover comes in four different colors (Multilingual Edition)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"How to live with a cat","description":"Do cats worry about retirement?

A lo largo de estas p ginas asistimos al alumbramiento de una de las geograf as literarias m s poderosas y perdurables de nuestro tiempo, esa Barcelona de posguerra escrita en el quieto contraluz del recuerdo. Y nos encontramos tambi n con dos personajes cuya larga y feliz convivencia con varias generaciones de lectores les ha convertido en mitos, en ideales encarnaciones de su tiempo: Teresa, una universitaria rebelde e izquierdista, hija de la burgues a catalana, y un inmigrante murciano, un atractivo chava conocido como el ?Pijoaparte?, viven una historia de amor que refleja todas las contradicciones de una  poca, el esplendor y la miseria de las clases sociales, la ingenuidad del compromisof cil y la amargura y el resentimiento de los perdedores, habitantes de un exilio interior en el que, forjados en tantas derrotas, sue?an todav a como ni?os. El autor ha dicho: ?Mis relaciones actuales con Teresa, despu s de estos a?os de convivencia, no s lo son buenas sino incluso m s estimulantes de lo que yo hab a supuesto. La novela ha pasado a ocupar el rinc n menos sobresaltado de mi conciencia y all  fulgura suavemente, igual que un paisaje entra?able de la infancia.

[...] Si en atenci n al premio otorgado a esta novela [el Biblioteca Breve], o a otras circunstancias especiales, se considera oportuno proceder a su publicaci n, deber  someterse el texto a una revisi n detenida que le libere, al menos, de los aspectos m s hirientes de inmoralidad y clasismo.? La cr tica ha dicho: ? ltimas tardes con Teresa es una obra maestra. Y lo es porque sobrevive a su tiempo y, en cierto modo, al autor mismo. [...] La historia de la ni?a de buena familia catalana y el joven charnego no qued  atada a su contexto temporal; y eso es lo que ha hecho posible que envejezca, si tal es la palabra, con la solera y la autoridad de las grandes obras.? Arturo P rez Reverte ?Con el tiempo, se ha ido adue?ando del mundo de Mars  y de su estilo narrativo una sabidur a que solo est  al alcance de los mejores.?

Antonio Mu?oz Molina ?No solo es un libro bueno, sino tal vez el m s vigoroso y convincente de los escritos estos  ltimos a?os en Espa?a.? Mario Vargas Llosa ? ltimas tardes con Teresa fue el resplandor. [...] Para cruzar esa l nea que divide la sombra y la luz y hacerla literatura hacen falta vida y experiencia, mucho camino urbano, un don de la observaci n que s lo se da entre los que se fijan m s de la cuenta y por eso acaban siendo grandes novelistas, como el maestro Juan Mars .?

The Internet now houses a multitude of resources that nontechnical professionals such as attorneys and realtors access and implement on a daily basis. However, these professionals are trained in aspects of law and commerce that do not provide the proper education and experience to interpret and evaluate their land boundary information discoveries correctly. As a result, their analysis is often erroneous and the data misapplied ultimately leading to confusion and costly litigation. Professional Surveyors and Real Property Descriptions attempts to bridge the ever-widening gap between the users of land boundary information and the land surveyors who produce it. An expert team of authors integrates the historic and legal background of real property interests with fundamental concepts of the surveying profession in a manner accessible for average readers. These provide the basics for both properly comprehending older descriptions and competently constructing complete and modern real property descriptions that foster better communication. Highlights in this book include: An in-depth exploration of historic descriptions and how to read them Coverage of the widely accepted ALTA/ACSM Land Boundary Survey standards and associated property descriptions A diverse collection of examples and practice scenarios An overview of the latest issues related to the use of GPS and GIS Written in easy-to-understand language, this practical resource assists nontechnical professionals in understanding exactly what a surveyor does and does not do, and serves as a valuable tool for obtaining the most satisfactory, accurate, and complete real property descriptions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xN0LfHqd3s0C&dq=Land+survey+descriptions&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tall, Dark & True (Harlequin Romance)","description":"A recovering witch and manager of Wisconsin's premier occult bookstore, Garnet Lacey finds herself drawn to her gorgeous customer, Sebastian Von Traum, despite the troublesome fact that he is dead.

It is a clarifying analysis as relevant today as when it first appeared. A major methodological problem for clinical psychology concerns the relation between clinical and actuarial methods of arriving at diagnoses and predicting behavior. Without prejudging the question as to whether these methods are fundamentally different, we can at least set forth the obvious distinctions between them in practical applications. The problem is to predict how a person is going to behave: What is the most accurate way to go about this task? Clinical versus Statistical Prediction offers a penetrating and thorough look at the pros and cons of human judgment versus actuarial integration of information as applied to the prediction problem. Widely considered the leading text on the subject, Paul Meehl's landmark analysis is reprinted here in its entirety, including his updated preface written forty-two years after the first publication of the book. This classic work is a must-have for students and practitioners interested in better understanding human behavior, for anyone wanting to make the most accurate decisions from all sorts of data, and for those interested in the ethics and intricacies of prediction. As Meehl puts it, \\"When one is dealing with human lives and life opportunities, it is immoral to adopt a mode of decision-making which has been demonstrated repeatedly to be either inferior in success rate or, when equal, costlier to the client or the taxpayer.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ix6HmAEACAAJ&dq=CLINICAL+VERSUS+STATISTICAL+PREDICTION%3B+A+THEORETICAL+ANALYSIS+AND+A+REVIEW+OF+THE+EVIDENCE.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Nineties: What the F**k Was That All About?: The Music the Culture the People the Decade","description":"Seminar paper from the year 2012 in the subject English - Miscellaneous, grade: 1,7, University of Bonn (Institut f r Anglistik, Amerikanistik und Keltologie), language: English, abstract: People all over the world have been identifying with music for years.

And the world is still reaping its rewards.  So begins this inspiring chronicle of a humbly born Holocaust survivor who parlayed natural marketing smarts and vision into a major position in recent American sports. He started the New York City Marathon, an event that transformed footracing from an elite, austere sport into a wildly applauded, attainable pursuit for all. Forging a path across the city s five boroughs, the marathon covers a daunting 26.2-mile course. Ron Rubin s fascinating book tells how Lebow popularized the race. With a stroke of marketing wizardry he turned it into the world s largest block party: a gritty mixture of urban theater and kindly entrepreneurship. This event has honored the spirit of the moment, imbued competition with joy, and celebrated play. It put winning within the realm of every man and woman and became a race for all runners. Lebow mainstreamed the notion of marathoning into popular culture; some half-million Americans now participate in the events. Equally significant, the book describes how Lebow scored his greatest personal victory by running in the marathon he created after being diagnosed with brain cancer.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Gj_hvDM1g7EC&dq=Anything+for+A+T-Shirt:+Fred+LeBow+and+the+New+York+City+Marathon,+the+World%27s+Greatest+Footrace+(Sports+and+Entertainment)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hadrian the Seventh","description":"The titlular character of Hadrian the Seventhis inextricably entangled with his creator, Frederick Rolfe, the self-titled Baron Corvo. Both were Catholic converts and unsuccessful candidates for priesthood, who led bitter, misunderstood lives, betrayed (they thought) by friends, bishops and prelates. Both were at times struggling writers and failed inventors, their brilliance (they believed) insufficiently recognized, who lived alternately extravagantly and in squalor. Rolfe put all his obsessions, all his hate and suffering, his dreams and fantasies into George Arthur Rose, the outcast who through a bizarre sequence of events is elected Pope. Hadrian VII, the first English pontiff in five centuries, is a mass of contradictions- infallible and petulant, ascetic and corrupt, humble and despotic, he empties the Vatican's coffers to feed the poor and reshapes nations in a bid for world peace. With this blend of satire and self-knowledge which runs through the pages of this, his finest novel, Rolfe both vindicates and condemns himself. A new introduction by Richard Davenport-Hines untangles the many deceptions of this most autobiographical of fictions, and those which surround its author.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Fq57tAEACAAJ&dq=Hadrian+the+Seventh&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Scleroderma: The Proven Therapy that Can Save Your Life","description":"Scleroderma, which affects as many as 400,000 Americans, starts off like skin cancer but is far more deadly.

Since the birth of modern totalitarianism, in country after country, secret political police have been the predominant instruments of power, used to consolidate power, neutralize the opposition, and erect a one-party state. Yet, when these same totalitarian regimes have liberalized or collapsed, the secret political police have often managed to survive and even remain relevant. Dismantling Tyranny: Transitioning Beyond Totalitarian Regimes provides a groundbreaking exploration of this survival tendency in seven formerly communist regimes in the former Soviet Union and Latin America - and the lessons these transformations hold for future democratic revolutions. But Dismantling Tyranny is also much more: it is a guidebook designed to empower, inform, and guide future transitions toward democracy for those political leaders with the initiative, and courage, to embark upon such a visionary path.

These myths hamper efforts to apply reason to our problems and foster violent conflicts that threaten global security. Myths of the Tribe illustrates how the belief systems of all major religions have become a detriment to clear thinking, rational conduct, and wise public policy, suggesting we substitute a rational analysis of all problems in the light of objective scientific evidence, a system of ethics that allows complete individual liberty constrained only by the principle of harming no one else, taking personal responsibility for one's own welfare and actions, and the absence of government control over the pursuit of happiness.

Opposition has ranged from being mild with degrees of acceptance to malicious attacks. Certain extreme elements have gone so far as to brand those who follow a madhhab [school] as mushrik [polytheist]. Much of the opposition has been a result of misunderstanding the realities of this concept.The first part of this book seeks to clarify certain aspects of taqlid that have been misunderstood and gravely distorted. It sheds light on the necessity of taqlid, its history, and its role in todays world. The second part includes several chapters devoted to issues regarding salat [ritual prayer] according to the Hanafi school of law. Through illustrative examples and detailed discussions, the chapters on prayer sufficiently demonstrate the sophisticated legal philosophy employed by the Hanafi school (indeed all the madhhabs) in their derivation of legal rulings from the source texts of Islam.All rulings have been supported with evidentiary proofs from the Quran and Hadith. The author delivers an even-handed presentation of arguments throughout the book.

The \\"barinia\\" left the veranda, where she had come for this conversation with the old servant of General Trebassof, her husband, and returned to the dining-room in the datcha des Iles, where the gay Councilor Ivan Petrovitch was regaling his amused associates with his latest exploit at Cubat's resort. They were a noisy company, and certainly the quietest among them was not the general, who nursed on a sofa the leg which still held him captive after the recent attack, that to his old coachman and his two piebald horses had proved fatal. The story of the always-amiable Ivan Petrovitch (a lively, little, elderly man with his head bald as an egg) was about the evening before. After having, as he said, \\"recure la bouche\\" for these gentlemen spoke French like their own language and used it among themselves to keep their servants from understanding after having wet his whistle with a large glass of sparkling rosy French wine, he cried: \\"You would have laughed, Feodor Feodorovitch. We had sung songs on the Barque* and then the Bohemians left with their music and we went out onto the river-bank to stretch our legs and cool our faces in the freshness of the dawn, when a company of Cossacks of the Guard came along. I knew the officer in command and invited him to come along with us and drink the Emperor's health at Cubat's place. That officer, Feodor Feodorovitch, is a man who knows vintages and boasts that he has never swallowed a glass of anything so common as Crimean wine. When I named champagne he cried, 'Vive l'Empereur!' A true patriot. So we started, merry as school-children. The entire company followed, then all the diners playing little whistles, and all the servants besides, single file. At Cubat's I hated to leave the companion-officers of my friend at the door, so I invited them in, too. They accepted, naturally. But the subalterns were thirsty as well. I understand discipline. You know, Feodor Feodorovitch, that I am a stickler for discipline. Just because one is gay of a spring morning, discipline should not be forgotten. I invited the officers to drink in a private room, and sent the subalterns into the main hall of the restaurant. Then the soldiers were thirsty, too, and I had drinks served to them out in the courtyard. Then, my word, there was a perplexing business, for now the horses whinnied. The brave horses, Feodor Feodorovitch, who also wished to drink the health of the Emperor. I was bothered about the discipline. Hall, court, all were full. And I could not put the horses in private rooms. Well, I made them carry out champagne in pails and then came the perplexing business I had tried so hard to avoid, a grand mixture of boots and horse-shoes that was certainly the liveliest thing I have ever seen in my life. But the horses were the most joyous, and danced as if a torch was held under their nostrils, and all of them, my word! were ready to throw their riders because the men were not of the same mind with them as to the route to follow! From our window we laughed fit to kill at such a mixture of sprawling boots and dancing hoofs. But the troopers finally got all their horses to barracks, with patience, for the Emperor's cavalry are the best riders in the world, Feodor Feodorovitch. And we certainly had a great laugh!

Covering American history from the founding of Jamestown through present day, these volumes explore far beyond the dates and events of a historical chronicle to present a moving illumination of the ideas, opinions, attitudes and tribulations that led to the birth of this great nation. The French and Indian War: 1660-1763 covers much more than the few years during which the English and French fought over the division of the North American continent in one of the most neglected periods of American history. In this volume in The Drama of American History series, authors Christopher Collier and James Lincoln Collier trace how England's other rivals for control of America were eliminated over this period until the only source of conflict left would be between the British and their own colonists. This series offers a fairly unique approach to American history by focusing on core content rather than a blizzard of names and dates, giving listeners a good sense of not only what happened, but why, as England eliminated its competition.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=H3d1DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Oh!

Now, for the first time in decades, readers in the United States can read the books of Dance as they were originally published as twelve individual novels but with a twenty-first-century twist: they re available only as e-books. Casanova s Chinese Restaurant (1960), the fifth book, finds Nick marrying Isobel Tolland and launching happily into family life including his new role as brother-in-law to Isobel s many idiosyncratic siblings. But even as Nick s life is settling down, those of his friends are full of drama and heartache: his best friend, Hugh Moreland, is risking his marriage on a hopeless affair, while Charles Stringham has nearly destroyed himself with drink. Full of Powell s typically sharp observations about life and love, Casanova s Chinese Restaurant offers all the rewards and frustrations, pleasures and regrets of one s thirties. \\"Anthony Powell is the best living English novelist by far. His admirers are addicts, let us face it, held in thrall by a magician.\\" Chicago Tribune \\"A book which creates a world and explores it in depth, which ponders changing relationships and values, which creates brilliantly living and diverse characters and then watches them grow and change in their milieu. . . . Powell's world is as large and as complex as Proust's.\\" Elizabeth Janeway, New York Times \\"One of the most important works of fiction since the Second World War. . . .

Susan Schaller, then a twenty-four-year-old graduate student, encountered him in a class for the deaf where she had been sent as an interpreter and where he sat isolated, since he knew no sign language. She found him obviously intelligent and sharply observant but unable to communicate, and she felt compelled to bring him to a comprehension of words.

David Milgaard spent 22 years behind bars; the victim of a rush to judgement that saw him, at 17, wrongfully convicted of murder. This powerful book, packed with all the drama of a novel, takes the reader back to the fateful morning of January 31, 1969, when a young nurse s aide was found stabbed to death in a Saskatoon alley. As the months passed, police became increasingly desperate to solve the mystery of who killed her. Then, after they posted a reward for information, someone came forward with a name  David Milgaard s. No physical evidence linked Milgaard to the crime. Moreover, police seemingly ignored any connections the case may have had with the actions of a serial rapist then on the loose in Saskatoon. Later, statements made by supposed key witnesses  statements that appeared to point to Milgaard as the killer  were tainted by contradictions, retractions, and charges of police harassment. Joyce Milgaard, David s mother, always believed in her son s innocence. Through her s and others  efforts, new evidence finally came to light  evidence that pointed the finger at the most likely suspect. When Justice Fails, is a shocking take of justice gone completely awry.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nrsyPQAACAAJ&dq=When+Justice+Fails:+The+David+Milgaard+Story&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Petroglyphs of Hawaii","description":"by Likeke R.

Schaller s two years of travel and observation of gorillas in East and Central Africa in the late 1950s, high in the Virunga volcanoes on the Zaire-Rwanda-Uganda border. There, he learned that these majestic animals, far from being the aggressive apes of film and fiction, form close-knit societies of caring mothers and protective fathers watching over playful young. Alongside his observations of gorilla society, Schaller celebrates the enforced yet splendid solitude of the naturalist, recounts the adventures he experienced along the way, and offers a warning against poaching and other human threats against these endangered creatures. This edition features a postscript detailing Schaller s more recent visits with gorillas, current to 2009.  Whether the author is tracking gorillas, slipping past elephant herds on narrow jungle paths, avoiding poachers  deadfalls, or routing Watusi invaders, this is an exciting book. Although Schaller feels that this is  not an adventure book,  few readers will be able to agree.

But while the famous question, \\"Are you now or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party?\\" resonated in the halls of Congress, security officials were posing another question at least as frequently, if more discreetly: \\"Information has come to the attention of the Civil Service Commission that you are a homosexual. What comment do you care to make?\\" Historian David K. Johnson here relates the frightening, untold story of how, during the Cold War, homosexuals were considered as dangerous a threat to national security as Communists. Charges that the Roosevelt and Truman administrations were havens for homosexuals proved a potent political weapon, sparking a \\"Lavender Scare\\" more vehement and long-lasting than McCarthy's Red Scare. Relying on newly declassified documents, years of research in the records of the National Archives and the FBI, and interviews with former civil servants, Johnson recreates the vibrant gay subculture that flourished in New Deal-era Washington and takes us inside the security interrogation rooms where thousands of Americans were questioned about their sex lives. The homosexual purges ended promising careers, ruined lives, and pushed many to suicide. But, as Johnson also shows, the purges brought victims together to protest their treatment, helping launch a new civil rights struggle. The Lavender Scare shatters the myth that homosexuality has only recently become a national political issue, changing the way we think about both the McCarthy era and the origins of the gay rights movement. And perhaps just as importantly, this book is a cautionary tale, reminding us of how acts taken by the government in the name of \\"national security\\" during the Cold War resulted in the infringement of the civil liberties of thousands of Americans.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ivCo3yph63QC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Mind for Pool: How to Master the Mental Game","description":"Pool is largely a mental game.

Weyerhaeuser Book Award As a central figure in the American wilderness preservation movement in the mid-twentieth century, Howard Zahniser (1906-1964) was the person most responsible for the landmark Wilderness Act of 1964. While the rugged outdoorsmen of the earlyenvironmental movement, such as John Muir and Bob Marshall, gave the cause a charismatic face, Zahniser strove to bring conservation's concerns into the public eye and the preservationists' plans to fruition. In many fights to save besieged wild lands, he pulled together fractious coalitions, built grassroots support networks, wooed skittish and truculent politicians, and generated streams of eloquent prose celebrating wilderness. Zahniser worked for the Bureau of Biological Survey (a precursor to the Fish and Wildlife Service) and the Department of the Interior, wrote for Nature magazine, and eventually managed the Wilderness Society and edited its magazine, Living Wilderness. The culmination of his wilderness writing and political lobbying was the Wilderness Act of 1964. All of its drafts included his eloquent definition of wilderness, which still serves as a central tenet for the Wilderness Society: \\"an area where the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain.\\" The bill was finally signed into law shortly after his death. Pervading his tireless work was a deeply held belief in the healing powers of nature for a humanity ground down by the mechanized hustle-bustle of modern, urban life. Zahniser grew up in a family of Methodist ministers, and although he moved away from any specific denomination, a spiritual outlook informed his thinking about wilderness. His love of nature was not so much a result of scientific curiosity as a sense of wonder at its beauty and majesty, and a wish to exist in harmony with all other living things. In this deeply researched and affectionate portrait, Mark Harvey brings to life this great leader of environmental activism.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EdsTCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shared Dreams: Martin Luther King, Jr. and the Jewish Community","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Introducing Logic","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"A Conspiracy of Nations","description":"Why are Americans today so fascinated by the X-Files? How did rumors emerge about the origins of the AIDS virus as a weapon of biowarfare? Why does the Kennedy assassination provoke heated debate nearly forty years after the fact, and what do we make of Hillary Clinton's accusation of a \\"vast right-wing conspiracy\\" against her husband? The origins of these ideas reveal important facets of American culture and politics. Placing conspiracy thinking at the center of American history, and challenging the knee-jerk dismissal of conspiratorial thought as deluded and sometimes dangerous, Conspiracy Nation provides a wide-ranging survey of conspiracy theories in contemporary America. In the 19th century, inflammatory rhetoric about slave revolts, the well-publicized specter of the black rapist, and the formation of the Ku Klux Klan all worked as conspiracy theories to legitimate an emerging sense of national consciousness based on an ideology of white supremacy. Today, panicked responses to increasing multiculturalism and globalization yield new notions of victimhood and new theories about conspiratorial plans for global domination. Offering up a provocative array of examples, ranging from alien abduction to the novels of DeLillo and Pynchon to Tupac Shakur's \\"paranoid style,\\" Conspiracy Nation documents and unearths the workings of conspiracy in the contemporary moment. Their conclusions, sometimes startling and always compelling, have much to say about the nature of identity and anxiety, imagination and politics, and the state of the American psyche today.

Chesterton on the Arts","description":"Here is a new look at imagination and the arts from the point of view of one of Western civilization's most insightful observers - G.K. Chesterton. Gilbert Chesterton had the rare gift of being able to understand situations from the \\"inside\\" - that is, to see through the hidden assumptions, lapses in logic, and other follies of even his own social and occupational situations. He was a journalist, and yet an unsparing critic of journalism. He was a poet, a story-teller, a novelist, a playwright, and an illustrator. Among the most imaginative of men who ever lived, Chesterton had much of value to say about the arts, imagination, and the Christian faith. Thomas Peters takes the reader on a guided tour of Chesterton's observations and opinions regarding human imagination and its various manifestations in the arts. Using ample quotations in order to let Chesterton speak for himself, Peters explores the master's views on imagination, culture, and faith, as well as his fascinating opinions on everything from styles of painting to meter in poetry, from bohemian lifestyles to materialist philosophy, from singing at the bank to waiting for the train.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yonYAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Christian+Imagination:+G.K.+Chesterton+on+the+Arts&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Do you dream?","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Bernard Darwin On Golf","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Traitor?: A Jew, a book, a miracle : an autobiography","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=R6sOt4uJB3oC&dq=Traitor%3F:+A+Jew,+a+book,+a+miracle+:+an+autobiography&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bridge of Dreams (Selling Water by the River)","description":"For a thousand years, the great city of Sund stood impregnable while its enemy, Maras, remained outside the walls.

It is the perfect disguise for a predator to access and devour the flock one lamb at a time while proclaiming himself as their protector and guardian. The result is spiritual devastation, broken congregations, and even destroyed churches. Darrell Puls attests from experience that the enemy has infiltrated the North American church through pastors with dangerously high levels of narcissism. These pastors hide under layers of the sacred, but it is always an illusion of smoke and mirrors. Puls has experienced this reality from the inside as a staff pastor under a narcissist, and from the outside as a church consultant. He carefully unpacks toxic narcissism in everyday terms, and lets the victims tell their own stories.

What did the Messenger mean when he said, The differences of my Umma are a source of mercy?Using examples from the Messenger of Allah , his Companions, and their Followers, The Differences of the Imams answers these puzzling questions in a thorough and concise manner. In a clear and lucid style, the author illustrates the various ways in which different narrations seem to contradict one another and how the Companions and the Imams of jurisprudence have reconciled these apparent differences. This work is an excellent resource for anyone seeking to better understand some of the deeper issues of hadith and jurisprudence: how these two disciplines come together to form the basis of Islamic law [Shari'a], why it is necessary to follow a school of Islamic law, and what the basic principles of hadith scholarship are.Praise of the Author from Distinguished ScholarsShaykh and honorable Imam; jurist and noble scholar of hadith; fragrant flower of India and Arabia; master of spiritual realities [haqiqa] and allusions [majaz]; our leader and our blessing (from Allah).Shaykh 'Abd al-Fattah Abu Ghudda, Halab, SyriaIt is evident to one who takes a look at his works that he had a brilliancy, both in knowledge and with the pen, like that of Ibn al-Jawzi and Imam Ghazali.

In this era of big data and the Internet of Things, it is essential that we have the tools we need to understand the data coming to us faster than ever before, and to design databases and data processing systems that can adapt easily to ever-changing data schemas and ever-changing business requirements. There must be no intellectual disconnect between data and the software that manages it. It must be possible to extract meaning and knowledge from data to drive artificial intelligence applications. Novel NoSQL data organization techniques must be used side-by-side with traditional SQL databases. Are existing data modeling techniques ready for all of this? The Concept and Object Modeling Notation (COMN) is able to cover the full spectrum of analysis and design. A single COMN model can represent the objects and concepts in the problem space, logical data design, and concrete NoSQL and SQL document, key-value, columnar, and relational database implementations. COMN models enable an unprecedented level of traceability of requirements to implementation. COMN models can also represent the static structure of software and the predicates that represent the patterns of meaning in databases. This book will teach you: the simple and familiar graphical notation of COMN with its three basic shapes and four line styles how to think about objects, concepts, types, and classes in the real world, using the ordinary meanings of English words that aren t tangled with confused techno-speak how to express logical data designs that are freer from implementation considerations than is possible in any other notation how to understand key-value, document, columnar, and table-oriented database designs in logical and physical terms how to use COMN to specify physical database implementations in any NoSQL or SQL database with the precision necessary for model-driven development","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UmzQCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My home in Tasmania,: During a residence of nine years","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lBS8AQAACAAJ&dq=My+home+in+Tasmania,:+During+a+residence+of+nine+years&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Edible Wild Plants of Eastern North America (Gray Herbarium of Harvard University, Special Publication)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=r0e1AAAAIAAJ&dq=Edible+Wild+Plants+of+Eastern+North+America+(Gray+Herbarium+of+Harvard+University,+Special+Publication)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jewish liturgy and its development","description":"Classic study surveys the 3,000-year history of Jewish worship and liturgy from ancient times to the 19th century, and describes the nature and ritual of both public services and private devotions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9Yy5wAEACAAJ&dq=Jewish+liturgy+and+its+development&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Utilitarianism, Hedonism, and Desert: Essays in Moral Philosophy (Cambridge Studies in Philosophy)","description":"Fred Feldman is an important philosopher, who has made a substantial contribution to utilitarian moral philosophy. This collection of ten previously published essays plus a new introductory essay reveal the striking originality and unity of his views. Feldman's version of utilitarianism differs from traditional forms in that it evaluates behaviour by appeal to the values of accessible worlds. These worlds are in turn evaluated in terms of the amounts of pleasure they contain, but the conception of pleasure involved is a novel one and the formulation of hedonism improved. In Feldman's view pleasure is not a feeling but a propositional attitude. He also deals with problems of justice that affect standard forms of utilitarianism. The collection is ideally suited for courses on contemporary utilitarian theory.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=G8wFSS8NLk4C&dq=Utilitarianism,+Hedonism,+and+Desert:+Essays+in+Moral+Philosophy+(Cambridge+Studies+in+Philosophy)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Speech of acceptance of the Republican Party's nomination to the Vice-Presidency, delivered at Northhampton, Mass., July 27, 1920","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wSdEAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Seven Lives, Seven Games","description":"Could it happen?

Anaximander and the Architects opens a previously unexplored avenue into Presocratic philosophy the technology of monumental architecture. The evidence, coming directly from sixth century B.C.E. building sites and bypassing Aristotle, shows how the architects and their projects supplied their Ionian communities with a sprouting vision of natural order governed by structural laws. Their technological innovations and design techniques formed the core of an experimental science and promoted a rational, not mythopoetical, discourse central to our understanding of the context in which early Greek philosophy emerged. Anaximander s prose book and his rationalizing mentality are illuminated in surprising ways by appeal to the ongoing, extraordinary projects of the archaic architects and their practical techniques.

A strange combination of witty cosmopolite and melancholy introvert, he spent years writing under a series of fantastical pseudonyms, lavishing all the splendor of his magnificent mind on a seldom-appreciative world. He had a tragic love affair with a young girl, was dominated by an unforgettable Old Testament father, fought a sensational literary duel with a popular satiric magazine, and died in the midst of a violent quarrel with the state church for which he had once studied theology. Yet this iconoclast produced a number of brilliant books that have profoundly influenced modern thought. In this classic biography, the celebrated Kierkegaard translator Walter Lowrie presents a charming and warmly appreciative introduction to the life and work of the great Danish writer. Lowrie tells the story of Kierkegaard's emotionally turbulent life with a keen sense of drama and an acute understanding of how his life shaped his thought. The result is a wonderfully informative and entertaining portrait of one of the most important thinkers of the past two centuries. This edition also includes Lowrie's wry essay \\"How Kierkegaard Got into English,\\" which tells the improbable story of how Lowrie became one of Kierkegaard's principal English translators despite not learning Danish until he was in his 60s, as well as a new introduction by Kierkegaard scholar Alastair Hannay.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=r0fN5xVaVcwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Atlas Of Descriptive Histology","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"UNCLE VANYA (Methuen's Theatre Classics)","description":"Along with Three Sisters and The Cherry Orchard, Uncle Vanya is credited as one of Chekhov's masterpieces and a significant precursor of modern drama.

The major dynamics between the characters themselves are centred on two obsessive love affairs that lead nowhere and a flirtation that brings disaster.

How -- in the face of the carnage of war, the no longer merely threatened destruction of the natural world, the faceless threat of spiritual oversimplification and reactive fear -- does one retain one's capacity to be both present and responsive? And to what extent does our capacity to be present, to be fully ourselves, depend on our relationship to an other and our understanding of and engagement with otherness itself? With what forces does the sheer act of apprehending make us complicit? What powers lord over us and what do we, as a species, and as souls, lord over? These are among the questions Jorie Graham, in her most personal and urgent collection to date, undertakes to explore, often from a vantage point geographically, as well as historically, other. Many of the poems take place along the coastline known as Omaha Beach in Normandy, and move between visions of that beach during the Allied invasion of Europe (whose code name was Operation Overlord) and that landscape of beaches, fields, and hedgerows as it is known to the speaker today.

Austin and Chancogne provide students with a collection of four tutorials that cover concepts in modern engineering computations, and engineering programming in Ansi C, Matlab Version 5, and Java 1.1. The text gives practical guidance on selecting the best programming language for a project through a large number of working examples. With the help of these examples, students will learn how to design, write, and execute engineering programs using these programming languages. By incorporating Ansi C, Matlab, and Java into one text, students will quickly learn the strengths and weaknesses of each language. They'll do this with the help of the 56 case study programs and 115 programming exercises integrated throughout the book. A small suite of basic engineering problems is also implemented in each of the three programming languages. The four tutorials featured in the book include: * Modern Engineering Computations - covers hardware components in a simple computer, operating systems, networks (including the Internet and World Wide Web), and an overview of programming languages. * C Tutorial - teaches students how to write multi-function C programs. Topics include basic data types, operators and expressions, program control, functions, dynamic memory allocation, and input/output. * Matlab - shows students how to solve simple matrix programs with simple graphics. This tutorial also demonstrates how MATLAB programs can be much shorter than equivalent implementations in C or Java. * Java - explains how Java got started, about object-oriented program design, and how to write Java programs with platform-independent graphical user interfaces that can operate across the Internet.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=N44hAQAAIAAJ&dq=Introduction+to+Engineering+Programming:+In+C,+Matlab+and+Java&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ss-Gb","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Eye Signs Pb","description":"Be ready to prescribe and administer drugs safely and effectively, with the fully updated Pharmacotherapeutics for Advanced Practice, 5th Edition.

Text is paragraphed by theme and theme is written in the margins on each page for easy reference. Its features include - (1) Field Testing the Communication of Divine Message: The unique feature of this translation is its field testing for over 3 1/2 years to improve the communication and understanding of the Divine Message. Translation passages were given to the New Muslim and Non-Muslim high school and college students for reading under the supervision of various Ulema (scholars). After reading, the person was asked to explain as to what he/she understood from the passage. If his/her understanding was the same as is in the Arabic Text of the Holy Qur'an then we concluded that we have been successful in conveying the Divine Message properly. If his/her understanding was different than what the Qur'anic verses were stating, we kept on rewording the translation until those verses were understood properly. It was tremendous patience on part of the participants. May Allah reward them all. (2) Simplicity: In this translation Simple Language and Direct Approach is used for appealing to the common sense of scholars and common people. (3) Understandability: There are no foot notes to refer and no commentary or lengthy explanations to read. All necessary explanations have been incorporated right there in the text with italic type setting to differentiate from the translation of the meanings of Qur'anic Arabic Text. (4) Outline of Pertinent Information: Before the start of each Srah, information relating to its Period of Revelation, Major Issues, Divine Laws and Guidance has been presented as an outline. Then a summary of the preceding events has been tabulated for the reader to understand the histo! rical background to grasp the full meaning of the Divine Message. (5) Reviews, Input and Approvals: This project was started in 1991 and initial draft completed in 1994. Then the Translation was sent to different Ulema (Scholars) in Town and throughout United States for their review and input. After their reviews and input it was sent to Jme Al-Azhar Al-Sharif in Egypt, Ummal Qur in Saudi Arabia and International Islamic University in Pakistan for their review, input and approval.

On November 4, 1979, a group of radical Islamist students, inspired by the revolutionary Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini, stormed the U.S. embassy in Tehran. They took fifty-two Americans captive, and kept nearly all of them hostage for 444 days. In Guests of the Ayatollah, Mark Bowden tells this sweeping story through the eyes of the hostages, the soldiers in a new special forces unit sent to free them, their radical, na?ve captors, and the diplomats working to end the crisis. Bowden takes us inside the hostages  cells and inside the Oval Office for meetings with President Carter and his exhausted team. We travel to international capitals where shadowy figures held clandestine negotiations, and to the deserts of Iran, where a courageous, desperate attempt to rescue the hostages exploded into tragic failure. Bowden dedicated five years to this research, including numerous trips to Iran and countless interviews with those involved on both sides. Guests of the Ayatollah is a detailed, brilliantly recreated, and suspenseful account of a crisis that gripped and ultimately changed the world.  The passions of the moment still reverberate . . . you can feel them on every page.   Time  A complex story full of cruelty, heroism, foolishness and tragic misunderstandings.

Written in an accessible and jargon-free style, this engaging volume tells the story of humanity from our beginnings in tropical Africa up to the advent of the world's first urban civilizations. A truly global account, World Prehistory surveys the latest advances in the study of human origins and describes the great diaspora of modern humans in the millennia that followed as they settled Europe, Asia, and the Americas. Later chapters consider seminal milestones in prehistory: the origins of food production, the colonization of the offshore Pacific, and the development of the first more complex human societies based, for the most part, on agriculture and stock raising. Finally, Fagan and Durrani examine the prevailing theories regarding early state-organized societies and the often flamboyant, usually volatile, preindustrial civilizations that developed in the Old World and the Americas. Fully updated to reflect new research, controversies, and theoretical debates, this unique book remains an ideal resource for the beginner first approaching archaeology. Drawing on the experience of two established writers in the field, World Prehistory is a respected classic that acquaints students with the fascinations of human prehistory.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SCplxgEACAAJ&dq=World+Prehistory:+A+Brief+Introduction+(5th+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Grace and Truth","description":"Christians trying to model their lives after Jesus may find that He gets buried under lists, rules, and formulas. Now bestselling author Randy Alcorn offers a simple two-point checklist for Christlikeness based on John 1:14. The test consists of balancing grace and truth, equally and unapologetically. Grace without truth deceives people, and ceases to be grace. Truth without grace crushes people, and ceases to be truth. Alcorn shows the reader how to show the world Jesus -- offering grace instead of the world's apathy and tolerance, offering truth instead of the world's relativism and deception. Grace or Truth or Both? Truth without grace breeds self-righteousness and crushing legalism. Grace without truth breeds deception and moral compromise. Is it possible to embrace both in balance? Jesus did. Randy Alcorn offers a simple yet profound two-point checklist of Christlikeness.  In the end,  says Alcorn,  we don t need grace or truth. We need grace and truth. And for people to see Jesus in us, they must see both.

And, with humor and authenticity, he shares his own faith journey in order to help readers understand and work through their own. For those who are tired of scratching their head in confusion or frustration about how their Catholic background may influence their walk with Jesus, and why on earth their Catholic family believes they ve gone off the deep end, Holy Ground offers vast insight and practical help. More than providing historical perspective, theological reflection, and practical lessons, it shows readers how to emulate the grace and truth of Jesus Christ in relating to the Catholic people whom they love.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VKanKAnRSzgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE MCGRAW-HILL GUIDE TO THE PMP EXAM","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Dt5bcYowRKwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Life Is Short.

Within the gated grounds of the convent of The Sisters of the Holy Redemption lies one of the city s Magdalen Laundries. Once places of refuge, the laundries have evolved into grim workhouses. Some inmates are  fallen  women unwed mothers, prostitutes, or petty criminals. Most are ordinary girls whose only sin lies in being too pretty, too independent, or tempting the wrong man. Among them is sixteen-year-old Teagan Tiernan, sent by her family when her beauty provokes a lustful revelation from a young priest. Teagan soon befriends Nora Craven, a new arrival who thought nothing could be worse than living in a squalid tenement flat. Stripped of their freedom and dignity, the girls are given new names and denied contact with the outside world. The Mother Superior, Sister Anne, who has secrets of her own, inflicts cruel, dehumanizing punishments but always in the name of love. Finally, Nora and Teagan find an ally in the reclusive Lea, who helps them endure and plot an escape. But as they will discover, the outside world has dangers too, especially for young women with soiled reputations. Told with candor, compassion, and vivid historical detail, The Magdalen Girls is a masterfully written novel of life within the era s notorious institutions and an inspiring story of friendship, hope, and unyielding courage.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MebwCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Engineering Design with SolidWorks 2001PLUS","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Cities and the Health of the Public","description":"The essays commissioned for this book analyze the impact of city living on health, focusing primarily on conditions in the United States.

And mothers and fathers everywhere are listening. In what is sure to become a much-discussed blockbuster, Dr. Grosshans reveals why she believes nearly a half-century of parenting advice--with its emphasis on talking, exalting children s self-esteem, and time-outs--is largely to blame for today s lack of discipline. Her innovative ideas and techniques challenge this prevailing culture, proving that power and authority are as essential as love and good intentions to effective parenting. She persuasively explains why kids can only grow up healthy and strong when firmly led by their parents  experience and better judgment, and provides a clear, easy five step program to follow. She enables parents to look at themselves clearly and identify their child-rearing style; they are often shocked to discover how their own behavior has inadvertently caused an imbalance in the family s structure. Reading Beyond Time-Out is akin to sitting with Dr. Grosshans in her clinical office--and her core truths about healthy parent-child relationships are timeless.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VzwJlMASJ6QC&dq=Beyond+Time+Out&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Good-bye to all that (Doubleday anchor books, A123)","description":"Bruccoli Great War Collection at the University of South Carolina: An Illustrated Catalogue provides a reference tool for the study of one of the great watershed moments in history on both sides of the Atlantic serving historians, researchers, and collectors.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qk4A89LB07UC&dq=Good-bye+to+all+that+(Doubleday+anchor+books,+A123)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Shyness Breakthrough","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Strange Attractors","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Desert Triangle: Anything Can Happen in Las Vegas","description":"Today s Las Vegas welcomes 35 million visitors a year and reigns as the world s premier gaming mecca.

In the 20th century, it was Americanized. Now, in the 21st century, the world is being Asianized. The  Asian Century  is even bigger than you think. Far greater than just China, the new Asian system taking shape is a multi-civilizational order spanning Saudi Arabia to Japan, Russia to Australia, Turkey to Indonesia linking five billion people through trade, finance, infrastructure, and diplomatic networks that together represent 40 percent of global GDP. China has taken a lead in building the new Silk Roads across Asia, but it will not lead it alone. Rather, Asia is rapidly returning to the centuries-old patterns of commerce, conflict, and cultural exchange that thrived long before European colonialism and American dominance. Asians will determine their own future and as they collectively assert their interests around the world, they will determine ours as well. There is no more important region of the world for us to better understand than Asia  and thus we cannot afford to keep getting Asia so wrong. Asia s complexity has led to common misdiagnoses: Western thinking on Asia conflates the entire region with China, predicts imminent World War III around every corner, and regularly forecasts debt-driven collapse for the region s major economies. But in reality, the region is experiencing a confident new wave of growth led by younger societies from India to the Philippines, nationalist leaders have put aside territorial disputes in favor of integration, and today s infrastructure investments are the platform for the next generation of digital innovation. If the nineteenth century featured the Europeanization of the world, and the twentieth century its Americanization, then the twenty-first century is the time of Asianization. From investment portfolios and trade wars to Hollywood movies and university admissions, no aspect of life is immune from Asianization. With America s tech sector dependent on Asian talent and politicians praising Asia s glittering cities and efficient governments, Asia is permanently in our nation s consciousness. We know this will be the Asian century. Now we finally have an accurate picture of what it will look like.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nbj3yQEACAAJ&dq=ASIAN&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Vacant Possession","description":"Ten years have passed since Muriel Axon was locked away for society's protection, but psychiatric confinement has only increased her malice and ingenuity.

The Boston fire of 1760 set the stage for the American Revolution. The Pittsburgh fire of 1845 opened the way to larger scale industrial plants. Out of the ashes of the Chicago fire of 1871 came the modern skyscraper, the Haymarket Riots, and the Pullman Strike. The Baltimore fire of 1904 showed how a city's downtown, utterly destroyed, could re-invent itself after a catastrophe. The Detroit fire of 1967 forced politicians to concede what people of Detroit already knew that racism and racially-based deprivation were not changed by the civil rights movement. The Oakland Hills tragedy demolished a landscape of private privilege and imperiled the dream of leisure living in natural settings. Apart from their domestic and global political implications, the fires of 9/11 have prodded a complacent nation to admit to itself that twentyfirst century emergency services, and the urban lifestyles they protected, have to be thoroughly rethought. Told through gripping narrative chronicles of the catastrophic events, memorable portraits of historic figures, and incisive, thought-provoking analysis, Seven Fires reveals a nation and a people at its best and worst and illustrates how disasters teach lessons that, if we grasp them, can help us better our society.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yCbuwAEACAAJ&dq=Seven+Fires:+The+Urban+Infernos+that+Reshaped+America&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cathedral (Star Trek Deep Space Nine: Mission Gamma, Book 3)","description":" Addison Cain's writing blows me away each time!

Although algorithms have been designed and are notorious among researchers, computer programs are either not implemented on computers or very difficult to obtain. The purpose of this book is to provide a source of FORTRAN coded algorithms for a selected number of well-known combinatorial optimization problems. The book is intended to be used as a supplementary text in combinatorial algorithms, network optimization, operations research and management science. In addition, a short description on each algorithm will allow the book to be used as a convenient reference.

Set in the fictitious Midlands town of Middlemarch, the story revolves around the lives of its inhabitants in the years leading up to the Reform Act in 1832, particularly those of Dorothea Brooke, Tertius Lydgate, Nicholas Bulstrode, and Mary Garth. The novel deals with a variety of themes and issues including marriage, religion, hypocrisy, education, political reform, and the status of women. Although published to mixed reviews, Eliot's  Middlemarch  is now widely considered to be one of the greatest novels ever written in the English language.

This type of system is part of a larger study that helps researchers understand if properties of a matrix can be determined from combinatorial arrangements of its elements. In this book, the authors present the diffuse body of literature on sign-solvability as a coherent whole for the first time, giving many new results and proofs and establishing many new connections. Brualdi and Shader describe and comment on algorithms implicit in many of the proofs and their complexity. The book is self-contained, assuming familiarity only with elementary linear algebra and graph theory. Intended primarily for researchers in combinatorics and linear algebra, it should also be of interest to computer scientists, economists, physicists, chemists, and engineers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ha3xzQEACAAJ&dq=Matrices+of+Sign-Solvable+Linear+Systems+(Cambridge+Tracts+in+Mathematics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Textbook of Mineralogy with an Extended Treatise on crystallography and Physical Mineralogy Fourth Edition","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Medical Cell Biology","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"On Top of Concord Hill (Little House: The Caroline Years)","description":"Just when nine-year-old Caroline is feeling settled in her new house in Concord, Wisconsin, a cholera epidemic sweeps the state and it is up to Caroline to pull her family together during this hard time.

Named Sophie, the infant chimp was taken home and hand-reared by Vince and his wife. Six months later another new baby arrived: Oliver, their son. A Chimp in the Family is the compelling and entertaining account of Sophie's life. Vince Smith vividly describes the parallel upbringing of Sophie and Oliver through her early years with Vince and his family, her traumatic journey back to the zoo and her unsuccessful efforts to socialize with other chimps, her repatriation to Africa and reunion with her human foster family, and her integration in a semi-wild group of chimpanzees. A book both humorous (a family outing with both babies to the local pizzeria) and ultimately heartbreaking, A Chimp in the Family provides fascinating photographs and insights into the nature of our closest-living relatives as well as the nature of human development.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6UTiwAEACAAJ&dq=A+Chimp+in+the+Family:+The+True+Story+of+Two+Infants--One+Human,+One+Chimpanzee--Growing+Up+Together&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Parallel Distributed Processing, Vol. 2: Psychological and Biological Models","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wmCazgEACAAJ&dq=Parallel+Distributed+Processing,+Vol.+2:+Psychological+and+Biological+Models&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Buying and Selling a Business: A Step-by-Step Guide","description":"A twenty-first-century update to the modern business classic . . .
