It can stand on it's own."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I commend Doubleday for making this foundational scripture of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints more readily available to the reading public. I first read the Book of Mormon over forty-five years ago. At that time it inspired me to try to become a better disciple of Jesus Christ. It continues to help me understand God and His dealings with His children. I hope this new edition enables people everywhere to enjoy this wonderful book."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I am not exaggerating about the title of this review. If that is true, there must be something to it. I enthusiastically read all the holy scripture from all religions which I can get my hands (\\"Mormons\\" should, too; when it comes to ideas, one must receive in order to give). For me, none of them has the impact, usefulness and--above all--implications that the Book of Mormon does. In the interest of brevity, I will let the reader discover those implications.I try to 'give back' a fraction of what I've gained in so many ways from this book by letting \\"those who have ears\\"--curiosity or an intuition--hear.Aside from the quality of the content itself, one of the most amazing things about the BOM to me is that there are no contradictions or flaws within its own story. The vicious \\"anti's\\", who will scrapple for any way to detract, conspicuously ignore going at this, but pro's overlook this too. The BOM is the most complex book I have ever read, even tho it was dictated to at least 4 different scribes during the course of translation. Even 2-hour movies have contradicions in their storylines. While that does not prove its veracity, and I realize that they did clean up the text to make a printer's copy, which still exists, even then there was no punctuation or formatting. The original dictation leaves still exist, but Emma Smith's decision to hide & leave them in a cornerstone led to the visible disappearance of the text during the ensuing decades and floods until it was uncovered. Perhaps advanced spectroscopy will someday reveal the text and bolster my observation.For newbies: the BOM is one of the most difficult books to intellectually \\"get\\". Once it \\"clicks\\", though, and you \\"get it\\", your life may change dramatically, no matter what religion, if any, you choose to associate with, or to what level. It is difficult to recommend a religion which has dealt so contemptuously with myself and others with long hair; the wrong skin color; or works-producing faith in the Book of Mormon's, Doctrine & Covenants', and New Testament's mandate of plain dress. However, one cannot be abused or harrassed simply reading a book. People who find the BOM difficult to read have not had the \\"click\\"; I used to be one of those people. Reading the middle of 3 Nephi and also starting at the beginning of the the true story text were breakthroughs for me. I've met many people who say, \\"Yeah, I read the B.o.M., I read that, the whole thing, and wasn't impressed.\\" I invariably ask them to \\"tell me one thing about the Book of Mormon\\". Not how it came about, but actually one thing from the text of the actual Book of Mormon--one name, one story--anything. They invariably can't even give me one firsthand bit of info. I say, \\"Surely, if you read an entire book, you'll remember one name, one story--even anything about the book itself. You never read it, and I suggest you do, even if only to understand others who are your friends or neighbors.\\"For olbies: I strongly recommend any Book of Mormon enthusiast get ahold of a photographic reprint of the BOM's first (1830) edition, and actually read it. It is indeed a moving experience, especially for someone who might be raised as LDS and took for granted the Book of Mormon, its current sophistication of formatting, printing, and extensive footnoting (not my case). You see a Book of Mormon with no verse separation--paragraph form--with no chapter headings, except the few which were surprisingly literally part of the translation/abridgement (it's difficult to articulate such subtle hidden blessings). Firsthand, you see how obvioiusly the typesetter had no clue regarding the content of the Book of Mormon, as you see the results of his struggle & haste to insert punctuation into a manuscript which had none whatsoever. You see the misspellings, the rudeness of the formatting, but that makes the text of the work shine through. Because the words and text are the same, familiar, and recognizable. Sure, \\"a-coming\\" was changed to \\"coming\\", etc., but the exaggeration of detractors' shrilly-announced list of changes becomes visibly demonstrated in a personal way. You gain a connection to the reality of the story behind this text on a visceral level, even in just a few pages, and the effect is even more powerful if you become fortunate enough to crack open an extant original. And keep in mind through all these faults of men that the 1830 version was a high-end book & print in its day; leather-bound, large, and costing an equivalent of well over a thousand dollars in today's money. Many people gave them away to strangers at their own personal cost--not because of some dogmatic pressure, but quite the opposite; those people were hugely going against the flow at the time.Photographic reprints are available in print as \\"Joseph Smith Begins His Work: Book of Mormon 1830 First Edition: Reproduced from uncut sheets\\" self-published by the he late, great Wilford C. Wood, but still available (print seems slightly larger than original, including fascinating memoranda); from the RLDS's Herald Publishing House (good bit smaller than the original--ISBN 0-8309-0025-X); and on CD-ROM as the \\"Octavo Edition\\" (ISBN 1-891788-08-6) in the form of color photos, page-by-page.It even took awhile for the general body of the original LDS church and even post-Smith-martyrdom sects (including the \\"Brighamites\\" (Utah/largest sect), to \\"get it\\". The members, even at the highest levels--all converts--publicly employed the Book of Mormon relatively little compared to today, being more familiar (and oftentimes more confortable with the concept of) the Bible, but also having no acces to similar Biblical formatting, concordance, and research tools which are all ridiculously accessible today but which were available in that day for the Bible.The potential benefits range from a better understanding of others & history to something on the order of Pascal's Wager: if it is false, there is little wasted and considering the fundamental extreme positivity of the Book of Mormon's exhortation, still a tremendous lot to be gained for a person of conscience. If it is true, the potential benefits, and the end thereof, cannot be measured. Despite the numerous mistakes of both extant and extinct theological branches which claim Joseph Smith, Jr. (the seer-translator) in their ancestry, the Book of Mormon remains as arguably the most pristine jewel of the entire theological world.On Library of Congress's top 20 list of most-influential books in America, any self-educated reader puts themself at a disadvantage if they cognizantly avoid this book."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"All I can suggest, if you're curious about this book, is to read it with a grain of salt. As you can plainly see by reading over all the \\"five star\\" ratings, there are some satisfied Mormons out there. That's a wonderful thing.Please note that if you were shopping for a Ford, you would look for other opinions other than those of satisfied Ford drivers and from Ford itself. You would also choose to talk to those who have driven Fords and find out why they chose another car. You'd read reviews that were also less than pro-Ford. Religion definately takes more thought than what car you drive.This being said, if you are interested in the Book of Mormon as a fictional book... or as an \\"inspired by\\", yet not quite historically correct book, you may enjoy getting a better understanding of your Mormon friends and neighbors. If you're looking for entertainment, you'd be better off finding a decent author. This is definately not on par with Dickens, Twain, Steinbeck, or Hugo. If you are planning on looking at this book as if it is cold hard fact, I suggest that you pick up some accompanying books on DNA research, \\"New World\\" archeology, world religion, and philosophy.Basically, I just suggest looking at this with a serious grain of salt. I'd also suggest reading over the Koran, the Sutras of Buddhism, the Talmud, and other \\"holy\\" writings. Treat this book the same way you would treat any of the others. Know that some view it as a holy scripture, and will try to tell you to view it the same way."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"It is hard to write a book review about a book like the Book of Mormon. I find the same to be true for any religious text, as these books are not written with the intention to entertain or demonstrate impressive literary skills in the authors. These books are written with the intention to present truths that help the readers to live more fulfilling lives with greater happiness.I gave this book a 3 rating for the sole purpose of illustrating my opinion that the value of this book is completely personal. You'll notice that the reviews tend to be a 5 or a 1. This book seems to bring out extreme emotions either for or against it.All I can do is echo what many others have said, and that is to read it and follow the promise towards the end, to pray and ask if its true and receive an answer for yourself.Some people claim that the promise is rigged because it says you must pray with \\"real intent\\", thereby covering the bases.. thus if you don't get an answer that it is true, then you must not be righteous enough or sincere enough. I can certainly understand complaints of this nature.Let me share my own personal opinion from what I have learned in my life. It is that our Father in Heaven does not teach you something unless your heart is prepared to hear it. Why? Because he loves us SO much. He is not some dictator that wants things his way or the highway. He is our Father, and he knows the natural rules that lead to a society of true peace and happiness for all its members. In order to achieve such a society, there are ideals and behaviors that must be learned and followed by everyone. If we choose to follow our own selfish desires and impulses which would ultimately prove destructive to the perfect happiness of those around us, then we cannot be a part of the perfect society in Heaven. God is our father, he loves us more than we can comprehend and longs dearly for us to return to him. However, we have our own free agency and must make our own decisions - God understands that he cannot force us to do what's right or it would defeat the entire purpose of our coming to earth.Anyway, my point is that He knows if we are ready to receive certain truths, and until we are, he won't give them to us. This is because, if we receive a truth, we are held responsible to behave accordingly. If we don't, we are condemning ourselves. God is VERY careful not to give us truths we aren't ready for, because he does everything in his power to avoid our condemnation. (Being condemned means that we cannot dwell in Heaven).Thus, the purpose of praying with true intent. If we read the Book of Mormon, or any text, without being humble and teachable and willing to act in accordance with the truth we set out to learn, then we will not receive an answer as to its truthfulness. However, if we do have true intent to follow what we learn, then you will receive an answer as to the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon, this promise applies to anything you want to know the truth of. God is there, helping us as much as we allow him to, and if you are sincere about wanting to do what is right, you will receive answers to your prayers about the truthfulness of all things.Thus, read the Book of Mormon if you really want to know the truth, either way. Not if you are already certain of its falsehood and have no intentions of making a change in your life IF you did end up feeling that it was true.As for me, this book gets a 5. I believe it to be a true book of God, regardless of the human imperfections of its authors. It teaches a person to draw closer to God, be loving towards their neighbors, to be kind, patient, full of charity towards all men. In my opinion, anything that teaches these principles is of God, regardless of which religion it belongs to."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"There are those out there trying to dispute The Book of Mormon,but you have the opportunity to know for yourself if the book is true.

I always wanted to see proof of these people.

If these people lived , then where is the proof? Also why not let others see the plates so they could be part of the whole scam! I have not read the whole Bible , but I've read enough to know the Book of Mormon is a big rip off of it! As for the story itself it has many grammer error, many far fetched possible situations(like when Nephi kills a big powerful man(where's this guy's bodrguards? ) or when Christ comes everyone good for 200 years? (If I was a society that good, I'd rebel against it! ) These are two example of the far fetched situations one finds when reading this material! I've read this book several times in my life and I still want proof from the Mormons that these people lived!"},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"...which have been given of it, this is the testimony, last of all, which I give - that the Book of Mormon is a 19th century document created by Joseph Smith from many personal and published sources, and is not a volume of scripture. It's initial goal was to establish his credentials as a gifted finder of buried treasure and later to set him up as a gifted spiritual leader to enrich himself on other people's money as he had already demonstrated a determined dislike for serious physical labor (though I can't say I blame him). I congratulate him on a creditable job, but don't waste your time looking at it as a book of scripture.As a lifelong member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (which would be more accurately called the Church of Joseph Smith of the latter-day duped) I must give this book one star. Its religious/spiritual quality is zero (since the whole thing was made up by Joseph Smith - a man with a serious reputation as a treasure hunter during the time he was waiting for the angel to give him access to the plates), and who used magical devices (such as his peepstone) used in his hat to \\"translate\\" the Book of Mormon. A device he also used to locate buried treasure for gullible clients. He was also a devotee of magic and the occult (about which I learned in church history at Brigham Young University). The book's historical impact is two stars though, as mormonism has had some impact on the direction US history and played a prominent role in settling the western frontier; though as mormonism appears to be in great trouble due to substantial falloff of new converts over the past decade, the growing number of people leaving the church, and the constant pleas for tithing coming over mormon pulpits indicating the church's financial stress, perhaps in 50 to 100 years its historical impact may be much smaller.This book reads much like the Bible (including its attempt at King James Bible style English) but is full of incredible and fantastic stories mimicking both the Bible and the world of Christian revivalism as seen by Mr. Smith in early 19th century America. A small sampling of these fantastic, scripturally unprecedented or fantastically embellished, and even morally dangerous stories follows: Nephi's God-directed cold-blooded murder of Laban, the keeper of the brass plates in Jerusalem (Since God supernaturally gave Smith the gold plates, gave Lehi's party the Liahona, gave some Book of Mormon prophets some fantastic powers and information, it makes me wonder why instead of instructing Nephi to murder Laban for his plates, God didn't just give Nephi a copy of the brass plates - or give Nephi the contents of the brass plates by revelation.); the magical Liahona guiding Lehi's party through the wilderness of the Arabian peninsula, Nephi and other Book of Mormon characters being told by God the exact year of the future birth of Jesus Christ, even the Messiah (since Christ and Messiah are the same word in different languages, seems somewhat redundant, but it seems Smith was ignorant of this when he produced the book); the amazing account of the release of Alma and Amulek from prison by an earthquake (like Paul in the New Testament); the existence and arguements of deceptive and unprecedented ancient world doubters/atheists Nehor and Korihor (Thomas Paine); Nephite missionary Ammon cutting off only the arms of a bunch of Lamanite sheep rustlers; the fainting and trances (like a Christian revival) of almost all members of King Lamoni's court during Ammon's visit; the story of the unkillable 2000 2nd generation converted Lamanite warriors under the Nephite general Helaman; a later Nephi's unprecedented God-given power to cause a famine among the wicked Nephites till they repented, the \\"day and night and a day\\" with no darkness to commemorate the birth of Jesus in Jerusalem; the Jaredite barge/submarines, the battles to the last man (almost) fought in the Jaredite and Nephite/Lamanite wars - again a story that strains credulity as such battles to the last man are unprecedented in the history of the world - except in the Book of Mormon; etc. In fact, the Book of Mormon borrows liberally from some books of the Bible such as large sections lifted almost verbatim from Isaiah and Matthew (though making the same translation mistakes made by King James scholars in the Book of Isiah). Smith did this since Ethan Smith, author of \\"Views of the Hebrews\\" (a book published in two editions in the 1820s) predicted that someday Indian scriptures would be discovered and would contain writings of Isaiah.All of these bizarre things in the Book of Mormon are defended by mormons as a last resort as tests of faith. You must believe in a capricious, mean-spirited God who is a respecter of persons (especially of the righteous and powerful Nephite super-hero prophets) to believe the wild stories in this book.Even more fantastic, the Book of Mormon has almost no influence on mormon theology, as it strongly condemns polygamy in several places (a practice near to the heart of mormonism for over 70 years), condemns secret combinations and oaths (which is integral to the temple endowment of mormonism), and clearly teaches the doctrine of the trinity (which mormons have not believed since the early 1840s due to Smiths publication of the 13 articles of faith with proclaims the \\"godhead) to name the most striking,\\" And of course, there is not one shred of archaeological, historical, cultural, linguistic, genetic, or geographic evidence to support the claim that the people of the Book of Mormon ever existed, and overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Check it all out on the internet.Finally, as a mormon I read this book cover-to-cover three times. Once in seminary, once before I went on a mission for the mormon church, and once while I was out on my mission. I took up the challenge in the last chapter of Moroni to pray about the book on all occasions, and I felt nothing, absolutely nothing about this book. Mormons will say that I did something wrong to not get an answer, but this is not the case. So save yourself the trouble of going down this dead-end. It was written by Smith and is not worth any serious consideration."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"The Book of Mormon tells all of our beliefs. It will not flat out tell you what we believe in terms you will understand. You need to find the truth for yourself.

Such arguments have been going on regarding the Bible for thousands of years. To this day half of the Bible (the New Testament) is disregarded as an unauthorized addition by Jews who reverence the Torah. See, Deut 4:2.The Book of Mormon from its title page purports to be one thing--Another Testament of Jesus Christ. New scripture from a God who is following the same pattern He has followed for generations; new scripture to complement the old. The Book of Mormon is for persons who wonder why the Bible stopped--who wonder where the prophets have gone. For a good long time the world wasn't ready to have a prophet. In the 1830's, in a country with unlimited possibility and unprecedented religious freedom, God again revealed Himself to a prophet. I find it curious that people who revere prophets such as Moses, Abraham, Daniel, the Apostle Paul and others will not test claims of a modern prophet. I wonder if Isaiah had trouble distributing his book--it demands a close reading, was doctrinally controversial and probably disturbed the governing orthodoxy. But that is the way God works, He allows us to decide whether to read the book.The Book of Mormon is the means given by God to test the veracity of the man who brought it forth--Joseph Smith. It is a test--no more no less. The Book of Mormon itself at Moroni Chapter 10 (the last chapter of the entire work) at verses 3-5 is instructive: \\"Behold, I would exhort you that when ye shall read these things, if it be wisdom in God that ye should read them, that ye would remember how merciful the Lord hath been unto the children of men, from the creation of Adam even down until the time that ye shall receive these things, and ponder it in your hearts. And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost. And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things.\\"So, instead of engaging in argument, test the Book. Read it and ask God whether it is true. I have. It is."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"Anyone interested in American Religous history must read this book. The Book of Mormon recently voted one of the nations top 20 most influential books, Joseph Smith is Americas greatest religious reformers. Anyone who is a believer in the divinity of Jesus Christ should find this a very inspiring book. The book is very Christ centered which certainly shows Joseph Smiths very deep belief in Christian ideas. The book is highly complex and shows forth astounding consistency (with some acceptions). Although some of the stories are shallow and not really entertaining and the characters fit into simple categories of being good guys or bad guys, the story as a whole is complex and captivating. I have seen that many people bring up the fact that Mark Twain was not impressed with the book. I believe that Mark Twain was likely jealous that he could not produce something this complex. Tom Sawyer and Hucklberry Finn are great but nothing in comparison with the Book of Mormon. Nor can those who bring this up write anything close to it. And I know some superstitious people think the Book of Mormon is inspired of Satan, that is as superstitious as an astrologer. I would recommend the mountain of recent studies done on the Book of Mormon. From a very pro-Mormon point of view I would recommend the works done by the Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies (FARMS). They are many times apolegetic and fall into the same ridiculous category as Christian apologists that actually think religious claims can be verified with physical evidence, but they have produced a mountain of interesting literary studies into the Book of Mormon. From a more secular view of the Book of Mormon I would recommend works that have been published by Signature Books. I also want to bring up one more point about this book. I have seen a lot of people bring up the recent DNA studies showing that the American Indians come from Asia and not the Middle East as the book claims. Although this is true I find it odd most of these people are strict Bible believers and don't realize that the same type of DNA studies show that humans are much older than Adam and Eve and DNA also helps in verifying organic evolution.

Here are some of the important lessons found in this book:If you own brass plates, don't show them off. Keep it low key, especially around the local prophet guy. If the local prophet guy asks you about your brass plates say, lie for your own protection. Say, \\"Brass Plates? What brass plates? I don't own brass plates.\\"If someone orders you to hand over your brass plates, especially the sons of the local prophet guy, and you don't want to give them to them, just say no. You own them. If they insist you give them your brass plates, call the cops.If after calling the cops, the perpetrators get away, hire bodyguards to watch over you and your plates.

If you accidentally open the wrong hole and notice water rushing in, just stop up the hole real quick and open the other hole.If you are building a barge to travel across the sea do not put windows in your barge. It is unrealistic to expect the windows to survive the crashing waves of the sea. If you want light, use glowing rocks instead.If you are building a barge to travel across the ocean, be sure to bring lots and lots of food and fresh water because the trip will take 344 days. If you need to go to the bathroom, do it over the side of the barge because the holding tank can only hold a few days worth of human waste.If you find yourself on the battlefield fighting your arch nemesis, and you chop off his head and he falls to the ground, do not be alarmed when he lifts himself up and gasps for air.

After much reflection and analysis, I now believe the church is primarilty a socioeconomic organization that masquerades as a religious cult. The foundation of the church's atypical Christian belief is the Book of Mormon, a product of the vivid imagination of Joe Smith and ample plagiarism from the Bible.The book purports to be a history of a large society that was visited by Christ around the time of the Biblical resurrection. Where these people lived is unknown, although Mormons generally feel the events happened in South or Central America. For some unexplained reason, the book is written in King James English just like the Bible, and contains numerous references to religious issues that were common to the period. What did Joseph Smith claim? That an Angel revealed to him a record written on gold plates, after which Smith translated the plates into the Book of Mormon. After the translation, the angel took the plates back - never to be seen again. (Yes, Mormons actually believe this.) With the aid of a few others Smith started a new religion and soon developed into an egotistical leader, engaging in polygamy, starting his own bank, writing numerous other &quot;scipiture,&quot; and even running for President. The LDS church has gone to great lengths to &quot;revise history,&quot; surpress many of Smith's foibles, and portray him as an uneducated boy who ultimately became a martyr. (Smith died in a gun battle.)The Book of Mormon is poorly written, lacks grammatical cohesiveness, and is very boring. If you are interested in what Mormons believe qualifies as a \\"marvelous work and wonder,\\" than don't spend your money here, ask the LDS missionaries for a free copy."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"When I was a full-time missionary for the Mormon Church and read the Book of Mormon (BoM) seriously, I realized that it was at least partly autobiographical for Joseph Smith/Nephi. Then in 1 Nephi Chapter 4, I read about how Nephi murdered an unconscious Laban at God's command to obtain written records Lehi, as a wealthy Jew living in Jerusalem should already have owned. Anytime you have anyone claiming God commanded him to murder someone else, you've got the potentials for another Waco or Jonestown tragedy. Or, for that matter, the 1857 Mountain Meadows Massacre perpetrated by Mormons near Cedar City, Utah.And don't think reading the BoM will teach you much about the contemporary LDS Church. The BoM clearly lacks important core LDS beliefs developed by Smith after he wrote the BoM, such as the Temple ceremony, polygamy, the Word of Wisdom, the Aaronic and Melchezedik priesthoods, and the three degrees of heaven, all doctrines necessary for exaltation into the highest degree of the Celestial Kingdom in LDS theology. They're just not in the BoM.In addition, don't think reading the BoM will teach you much about the Mayan or Olmec civilizations (i.e., the real-life people who lived in Mesoamerica during the time period supposedly covered). The BoM claims the Nephites had horses and steel swords, something all non-LDS archaeologists and anthropologists will tell you simply weren't there at that time period.Frankly, I can't think of a single reason why anyone would want to read the BoM except to see a classic example of what is called \\"pious fiction.\\"James Clifford Millermillerjamesc@cox.net"},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"Joseph Smith, Jnr., has never been given his proper due either by his friends or his enemies. He wrote the greatest fantasy novel of all time, but he called it scripture and forced his friends to deny that he was a novelist. He made so many mistakes and displayed such ignorance that he was mistaken either for a prophet or a fool, when in fact he was a genius who memorised the entire King James Version and could recite it from memory for hours at a time. He had a vivid imagination, the gift of being a great storyteller, and no sense of humor at all (see below). I have a theory that from time to time the Earth is visited by what I call Novas, extremely great men who pass like meteors in the heavens, throwing the human race for a loop. They tend to be sociopathic. Such an one was Joseph Smith. He was great regardless of whether the BoM was true or not. Yes, I have read the entire book. I know too much about it to believe any of it. Take, for example, the ninth chapter of Ether. This is the one flash of dry humor in the book, so of course the faithful don't notice the humor. Surely Smith was pulling the reader's leg when he spoke of \\"elephants and cureloms and cumoms.\\" Too much has been written to disprove the BoM for me to waste space on this, other than to say that \\"the harlot Isabel, who leads astray the hearts of men\\" has a curiously Hispanic-sounding name for a supposedly Jewish woman who lived 16 centuries before the Spaniards arrived. If you want to believe in cureloms and cumoms, go ahead. Believe in the elephants. Believe in Hispanics in 79 BC. See if I care.

If you just remove the four brackets then you have first Corinthians, Chapter 13, verses 4-7 from the King James (1611) translation of the Bible.Which is rather strange, really, because according to information from the &quot;Ask Gramps&quot; column written by Mormon member H. Clay Gorton:&quot;All the witnesses [to the translation of the BOM], directly or indirectly, provide strong evidence that Joseph Smith did not use a King James Bible.&quot;The whole subject of the alleged translation of the Book of Mormon is riddled with this kind of inconsistency, starting with the gold plates that were supposedly buried in the hill called Cumorah, near Manchester, New York, in 420 A.D., just over fourteen hundred years before Smith allegedly found them in 1823.According to David Whitmer, one of the three witnesses to the authenticity of the BOM, Smith:&quot;... did not use the plates in the translation, but would hold the interpreters to his eyes and cover his face with a hat, excluding all light, and before his eyes would appear what seemed to be parchment, on which would appear the characters of the plates in the line at the top, and immediately below would appear the translation, in English, which Smith would read to his scribe, who wrote it down exactly as it fell from his lips. The scribe would then read the sentence written, and if any mistake had been made, the characters would remain visible to Smith until corrected, when they faded from sight to be replaced by another line.&quot;So if Smith didn't need the plates in order to translate them, what was the point of showing them to him in the first place?Why, having been shown the plates, did Smith see &quot;what seemed to be parchment&quot; during the translation?Why was the text on the plates in &quot;reformed *Egyptian* hieroglyphics&quot; if it was written by one-time *Israelites* living in America?Why, if it is genuine, has no-one else ever found a single example of this form of writing, not even in America, Egypt or Israel?Why, if Smith was able to read Egyptian hieroglyphics at all, did he make such a hash of &quot;translating&quot; the manuscript he named the &quot;Book of Moses&quot;? (See &quot;By His Own Hand Upon Papyrus: A New Look at the Joseph Smith Papyri&quot; by Charles M. Larson)And why was Smith given a translation in 17th century English, which surely bore no relation to either the language of America in the 1820's or to the language of the original authors?It is also hard to understand why, even with that seemingly &quot;absolute&quot; quality control, well over 3,000 changes have been made to the text since it was first published.And it *still* contains errors such as this &quot;prophecy&quot; concerning the birth of Christ:&quot;... he shall be born of Mary, at Jerusalem which is the land of our forefathers ...&quot;(Alma 7:10)(It need hardly be said that Jesus was born in Bethlehem rather than Jerusalem, and that Jerusalem itself is a city, not a &quot;land&quot;.)The truth of the matter is that this is not a &quot;divinely inspired&quot; work at all, but a (...) version of an earlier novel called &quot;The Manuscript Found&quot;, by one Solomon Spaulding, (not to be confused with another of Spaulding's works - &quot;The Manuscript Story&quot; - which has nothing to do with the BOM).So, if you enjoy badly written adventures in a poor imitation of the language of the King James Bible, you may well enjoy the Book of Mormon.If you don't, you won't.Just one last point - it has been asked &quot;If the book has been the backbone of a religion for over 100 years and yet it was a scam, would it have gone uncovered for so long and would so many people have believed it to be true?&quot;On the face of it, these are perfectly good questions, which have been asked numerous times by people on both sides of the discussion. The answers are:Firstly, the question of the authenticity of the BOM is nothing new, on the contrary, it has been in doubt ever since the book was first published.Secondly, there are far more people around the world who believe in flying saucers than have even heard of the BOM - but that doesn't., of itself, mean that flying saucers actually exist, does it."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"\\"All false doctrines are fables.

As many of the &quot;believers&quot; have pointed out already, you can get it for free. So why, oh why is it for sale here for a mere $0.95? That is a puzzle for even the most faithful mormon (as you can see by some of their comments here). Well, it's really not to do with the value of the book (as I said, $0.95 is a little much for the book but hey, you do wind up with some paper (I dunno, table coasters, handiwipes,,,use your imagination).Back to the &quot;why just $.095?&quot; question. Two answers...Reason one: Promotion. First rule of business (yes, the mormon church is a business....a HUGE business empire), advertise your wares anywhere and everywhere. Displaying the book on one of the most popular websites selling products is no accident. The web is where people come to look at things. The mormon CEO's don't really want or need to sell a book to anyone. Just look for the TV commercials...they're clamoring to give the book away for free. They just want you to read the book. They'd give it away free on the dot com sales sites but ya can't just give away things for free on sites that are designed to produce income. Ya gotta sell it. They really don't care about the $.095. It probably costs more to make a book than that anyway and trust me, they're not trying to recoup their losses with a mere 95 cent charge for the book. And they're not doing a fire sale because of overstocks. All they want to do is get as many people as possible to read the book. Eventually they strike gold and some poor person reads and believes and ends up giving them 10% of his income for the rest of his/her life. That produces the revenue that buys the &quot;church&quot; a lot more books and then some. Be it one person out of a thousand readers or one out of every ten thousand. I don't know what the profit margain is but I guarantee the mormon leaders and accountants do.Reason number two for the price tag: I actually learned this devious tactic as a 19 year old while I was a mormon missionary. We were required to peddle as many books as possible during our 16 waking hours of non-paid missionary work each day. Even way back then, they were doing the $.095 fire sale thing. But it had nothing to do with book revenue. We were actually told that the point of distributing the book to others for $0.95 had nothing to do with recouping printing costs. They were happy to just give the book away for free except for one thing. We were instructed that if you give something to someone for free, they won't value it. It will wind up in the trash can more often than not. So you tack on an optimum price that isn't so high that people won't buy it, but just high enough that they won't throw it away.So there you have it...two explanations to the puzzling riddle of why there's a $0.95 fire sale for a free book of mormon.So, back to the review. I wish I could say the book is original but it's not. Historians have uncovered evidence that the author got his subject material about the roots of the american indian from other sources (scientists have proven through DNA studies that modern day american-indians are not of jewish descent). And I wish I could say it was well written but unfortunately, it isn't despite all the revisions it has gone through. The really interesting thing is not the book, it's the people who believe it's real. The book is boring but harmless if you read it with a sane mind. And it provides interesting insights into the minds of the mormon faithful.The mormon faithful love to quote a passage in the book telling people to read the book and then ask God if it's true or not. You'll see a lot of that in their reviews (or &quot;testimonies&quot;) here. Most of their converts do just that. They read the book and somewhere through the book they get a good feeling which over the passage of time, gets pumped up from a good feeling to a personal vision or direct revelation from God. The story gets bigger every time they tell it. This is the foundation of their conversion process. Why does it work so well? Think about it. Aren't most of us looking for some kind of indication that we are special? Wouldn't it be really cool if God talked to you personally? So here's how you can start your own religion:Write a &quot;feel good&quot; book. Make it sound like the bible as much as possible. Aw, what the heck, let's just pluck whole passages directly from the bible, nobody owns the rights to the bible anyway. Find someone who needs to feel special, give them the book (or sell it for $.095 on the internet), then tell them that if they read it and get a good feeling while reading it, that it is God talking to you and letting you know it's true. The reader thumbs through the &quot;feel good&quot; Biblish type book, they get an occasional warm fuzzy, and Voila! You just got your first convert. Now you get his/her 10%, print a few more books and throw the rest in the bank. Then you get your new convert to spend as much time as possible peddling the book to others. Now bake this process for 175 years and you've got a few million people under your belt and a lot of money and power. Re-write your history and your rules as times change and you can perpetuate your religion as long as you want.Conclusion: Don't buy the book for the read (unless you're really curious and want to understand the basis of a modern day cult). Just buy the book to support amazon.com. Amazon is a great company and you can get just about anything you want here.

Second, the book (along with the other books of the Latter-Day Saints) guides the \\"Christian\\" farther FROM the Scriptures especially in areas where God Himself is made to have had a very \\"human past,\\" that God Himself and not the Holy Spirit empregnated Mary, that the dead can be redeemed because of the work established by Jesus when he descended into the place of the dead and made orderly the work of redeeming the dead, and the sealing of marriage for eternity which contradicts Scipture that states that there are no marriages in heaven. In all honestly, one must believe the Bible or the Book of Mormon, or spend their lives \\"interpeting\\" the Scripture as being corrupt (the use of the King James Version of the Bible as the authentic text of the Bible instead of the Hebrew/Aramaic and Greek texts is puzzling). Finally, the tremendous power of the Mormon priests to sell one's salvation, marriage, etc. focused on the President of the Church is tyrannical and finds no merit in Scripture. In his power, he has replaced Christ and is more powerful in Mormon theology than the Roman Catholic Primate, the Pope. Finally, the experience-oriented nature of the Mormon Church shows the hunger for genuine Christianity that has a strong experiential base as well as an intellectual one. May we all seek to know the One who sets us Free, this Jesus of Nazareth."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"The current Prophet of the Mormon church, Gordon B. Hinkley, is fond of repeating the Mantra, \\"Either it (the Book of Mormon)is all true, or it is the biggest [...] the world has ever known.\\"If it were at all true, there would be ample physical evidence to back it up, but to the contrary, the physical evidence or lack thereof, proves it is the latter.#1.

(unlike the original \\"Book of Abraham\\" facsimilies, which are not missing, and have nothing to do with what was supposedly \\"translated\\")#2. Where are the bones or artifacts of the 2 million plus Nephite warriors who were supposedly slain at the Hill Cumorah at the end of the Book of Mormon, which Joseph identified as the same Hill Cumorah (Now owned by the Mormon church)in upper state New York, where he found the so-called \\"golden\\" plates.#3. Where is the DNA evidence to support the Mormon claim that the Book of Mormon is a record of the \\"principle ancestors of the American Indian?\\" Non-existent, despite thorough testing, which establishes that the primary ancestors of the American Indian is in fact 99.9% Mongolian, with zero trace of Semetic ancestry.#4. Where is the archeological evidence of the things mentioned in the Book of Mormon? Steel swords? None have ever been discovered in pre-columbian America.Horses? Sorry, not after the ice age.#5. There are vast records of huge civilizations having existed all over North, Central and South America, since long before the start of the Book of Mormon even begins. Interesting how those vast civilizations who would have existed at the same time as the Nephites and Lamanites, are never mentioned in the Book of Mormon.#6. Why would the Book of Mormon be written in the language of 15th Century Elizbethan English, when it was supposedly originally written in \\"reformed Egyptian\\" and \\"translated\\" in the 19th Century?#7. Why would the Book of Mormon copy word for word the King James version of the bible Joseph Smith had on his bookshelf, errors and all?Why?

I have since had my name removed from the Church membership.The book of Mormon is the foundation of what differentiates Mormons from other Christian denominations. The book claims to be a translation from gold plates of a record about an ancient civilization that was visited by Jesus Christ. In reality, the book and the story of how it came to be are obviously fabrications by Joseph Smith. Reasons the book has lasted this long without being debunked include the church's revision of it's own history, the cult-like mentality of Mormon culture, and that Mormons are taught to censor themselves and avoid \\"anti-Mormon\\" literature that would reveal uncomplimentary facts surrounding the history of the Book of Mormon, the church, and it's founder, Joseph Smith.Mormons will ask you to ignore that facts and \\"look into your heart\\" to see determine if the book is true. This is because Mormonism, like many cults, teaches it's members that one can determine if something is a historical fact by referring to one's feelings about it. This technique, which is commonly used by cults leaders and sales people alike, is referred to as the \\"Book of Mormon Promise.\\"The book of Mormon, curiously written in a style similar to \\"King James English,\\" recycles many scriptures from the Bible, uses the phraseology \\"And it came to pass\\" about a thousand times, and overall is very boring. In addition, you will find very little about what Mormon's believe in the book of Mormon.

They quote each other and when they quote Mormon authors it is out of context, irrelevant or distorted- only used for making their points. If someone wants to buy and read a Book of Mormon, let them do that. If some one wants to buy a copy of the Bible, let them do that. If someone wants to buy a copy of the Koran, let them do that.

Second of all, it has opened up a whole new realm of archaeology (if you wish to know more, get a subscription to Ancient American magazine). And finally, it is a transcendental work, to nurture the spirit (whatever it may be), and give you a more cosmic consciousness of things. Now, you can that it was written by a dozen ancient prophets. You can believe it was written by one dreamer from early America. You can even believe that Joe Smith plagiarized it from some \\"novel rough draft\\", although I can't imagine wantign to read this if it were a novel. The point is, if you have values, no matter what they are, this is a good \\"values\\" book. And if you want to hear a book written in \\"King James\\" language that's actually entertaining, at least compared to the Bible, read this. Last of all, read this to understand the cosmos better.

Peace!"},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"Anyone interested in American Religous history must read this book. The Book of Mormon recently voted one of the nations top 20 most influential books, Joseph Smith is Americas greatest religious reformers. Anyone who is a believer in the divinity of Jesus Christ should find this a very inspiring book. The book is very Christ centered which certainly shows Joseph Smiths very deep belief in Christian ideas. The book is highly complex and shows forth astounding consistency (with some acceptions). Although some of the stories are shallow and not really entertaining and the characters fit into simple categories of being good guys or bad guys, the story as a whole is complex and captivating. I have seen that many people bring up the fact that Mark Twain was not impressed with the book. I believe that Mark Twain was likely jealous that he could not produce something this complex. Tom Sawyer and Hucklberry Finn are great but nothing in comparison with the Book of Mormon. Nor can those who bring this up write anything close to it. And I know some superstitious people think the Book of Mormon is inspired of Satan, that is as superstitious as an astrologer. I would recommend the mountain of recent studies done on the Book of Mormon. From a very pro-Mormon point of view I would recommend the works done by the Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies (FARMS). They are many times apolegetic and fall into the same ridiculous category as Christian apologists that actually think religious claims can be verified with physical evidence, but they have produced a mountain of interesting literary studies into the Book of Mormon. From a more secular view of the Book of Mormon I would recommend works that have been published by Signature Books. I also want to bring up one more point about this book. I have seen a lot of people bring up the recent DNA studies showing that the American Indians come from Asia and not the Middle East as the book claims. Although this is true I find it odd most of these people are strict Bible believers and don't realize that the same type of DNA studies show that humans are much older than Adam and Eve and DNA also helps in verifying organic evolution. Just read the article by Thomas Murphy in the book \\"American Apocrypha\\" published by Signature Books and you will realize DNA presents problems for both the Book of Mormon and the Bible."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"This book is incredible.

It testifies of the truth of the Bible and its writers bear witness on nearly every page of the reality of God, of his love for us and of the great atoning sacrifice of his son, Jesus Christ.

I speak specifically of all of the pages of scripture that are in word-for-word harmony with biblical passages in Isaiah. Those biblical translations weren't even written when the ancient Book of Mormon Prophets inscribed them onto the Golden Plates. Joseph Smith was not only able to translate 'reformed Egyptian' into English, he was able to put it into the exact same words that the (as of yet) unborn biblical Prophets were to some day use and then translate those words into Elizabethan English, just as King James had his translators do.Now just for a moment, think about how difficult all of this was.

Would you at least give such a book, claiming to contain these truths, a sincere one-time read-through, just to see for yourself what you think? I can only ask...

They either love it or want to destroy it along with any hope that it ever existed. Has there been such a book to accomplish this in society? If you think this book is common, then you are sticking your head in the sand.One thing to notice: The naysayers of this book seem to have a common thread of disenchantment. I won't go through all the negative remarks that are similar, but when a group of people say the same thing while overly attacking, one has to way that fact in deciding whether they are credible. Have you ever given credibility to anyone on TV or in real life that has nothing good to say? There has got to be something in the book that they like; yet they never admit to such or else they haven't read it.So why the depth of distain for this book? The main principle of the Book of Mormon is Faith, Repentance, Baptism and Laying On Of Hands For The Gift Of The Holy Ghost. Did the naysayers miss that? Also, it was hidden away by God to come forth for our society today, so that we might remember the covenants that our fathers had made with God. A person looking at the Book of Mormon with a pessimistic eye will certainly miss this and many other great things contained in the book.The Book of Mormon is a feat in and of itself. It will not be proved true or untrue through evidence, but only through spiritually pondering, studying, praying and listening. I think the naysayers are so focused on their rhetoric they have yet to listen.And that brings up another point. Listening! Isn't that an incredible concept? The prophets and their people in the Book of Mormon actually listened for the spirit, which means that we have the ability here and now to listen also. Isn't this really what all the naysayers are objecting to? Is it that they really don't believe that the Lord God is able to speak to us at this time, therefore it can't be true?There are many evidences for the Book of Mormon and they are readily available to anyone who wishes to look. I'm sure anyone who looks with pure intent will find a better understanding within themselves as to what they eventually believe and what they don't. Isn't that what a testimony is? Knowing what you believe and why can only bring you closer to your faith.So you can't judge a book by its cover. I doubt that many of the naysayers have actually sat down and read, pondered and prayed about the book. Instead they prefer to read books advocating how and why it is wrong, thus they prefer to have a different kind of prophet for their faith: themselves, or another of like mind. It seems odd that each of the naysayers believes that he or she has the right to tell anyone what to believe. Is this in accordance to Galatians 5 and Philippians 2:3 in the King James Bible?Contrast Galatians 5 and Philippians 2:3 with the yeasayers of these reviews. Which do you feel comes closer to the image of Christ?I hope that you will be able to see all the force and negativity against you ordering this book as an attack on your intelligence. I hope that you will not listen to negativism and listen to those, which have the spirit of the quoted scriptures above, and maybe you might, through the Book of Mormon, find the image of Christ being magnified within you as you pray and ponder the lessons throughout the pages of this great book.There is not a book that offers so much peace, hope and joy.

It is a record of God's dealings with the ancient inhabitants of the Americas and contains, as does the Bible, the fulness of the everlasting gospel.The book was written by many ancient prophets by the spirit of prophecy and revelation. Their words, written on gold plates, were quoted and abridged by a prophet-historian named Mormon. The record gives an account of two great civilizations. One came from Jerusalem in 600 B.C., and afterward separated into two nations, known as the Nephites and the Lamanites. The other came much earlier when the Lord confounded the tongues at the Tower of Babel. This group is known as the Jaredites. After thousands of years, all were destroyed except the Lamanites, and they are the principal ancestors of the American Indians.The crowning event recorded in the Book of Mormon is the personal ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ among the Nephites soon after his resurrection. It puts forth the doctrines of the gospel, outlines the plan of salvation, and tells men what they must do to gain peace in this life and eternal salvation in the life to come.After Mormon completed his writings, he delivered the account to his son Moroni, who added a few words of his own and hid up the plates in the hill Cumorah. On September 21, 1823, the same Moroni, then a glorified, resurrected being, appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith and instructed him relative to the ancient record and its destined translation into the English language.In due course the plates were delivered to Joseph Smith, who translated them by the gift and power of God. The record is now published in many languages as a new and additional witness that Jesus Christ is the Son of the living God and that all who will come unto him and obey the laws and ordinances of his gospel may be saved.Concerning this record the Prophet Joseph Smith said: \\"I told the brethren that the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book.\\"In addition to Joseph Smith, the Lord provided for eleven others to see the gold plates for themselves and to be special witnesses of the truth and divinity of the Book of Mormon. Their written testimonies are included herewith [in the book] as \\"The Testimony of Three Witnesses\\" and \\"The Testimony of Eight Witnesses\\".We [the leaders and members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints] invite all men everywhere to read the Book of Mormon, to ponder in their hearts the message it contains, and then to ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ if the book is true. Those who pursue this course and ask in faith will gain a testimony of its truth and divinity by the power of the Holy Ghost. (See Moroni 10:3-5)Those who gain this divine witness from the Holy Spirit will also come to know by the same power that Jesus Christ is the Savior of the world, that Joseph Smith is his revelator and prophet in these last days, and that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the Lord's kingdom once again established on the earth, preparatory to the second coming of the Messiah.I personally testify that I have come to know that the Book of Mormon is divinely inspired scripture, just as much as I know that Jesus is the Christ, and I wholeheartedly recommend that everyone read this book for themselves.

It was written by a man in New York City who asked that it be published by a local publishing company. When the editor/publisher took a look at it he said, \\"This is garbage and I will not publish it!\\" It was left in the corner of the publishing building. One year later the company closed down. Joseph Smith purchased the company and found the book sitting in the corner under a pile of dust. He then read it and thought it was a great read. Thus, the book of Mormon was born. Joseph Smith was a corrupt man and therefore right away anything he ever said or supposively wrote should be taken into serious consideration as a lie. Anything written by a man today who claims to have visions or visitations from angels has obviously consulted with demons and portrays to us that he is holier than we are. Friends, this is how cults get started. The only recommendation I can give for The Book Of Mormon is to read it and study it so you can teach Mormons how wrong they are and to rid the world of such heresy! Sure, lots of what is in the book or has been added by Joseph Smith has been taken from the Holy Bible. But so what? It's only a gimmick to attract those wandering people who are in search for something \\"godly.\\" Don't be fooled! Amen! P.S. I tried to change the rating to one star but somehow they put in two.......not my fault!"},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"For anyone who has ever read the Book of Mormon, they know it is true. I know it is true because I asked God myself. All you have to do is the same. If you have a sincere heart and a contrite spirit, and get down on your knees and pray to ask God if what you have read is true, HE will make it known to you! Ask anyone of these reviewers that gave this book 1 star, why they did, and they will give you some excuse...but it really comes down to the fact that they are angry at God. One example is the guy who said we condone divorce. I assure you we don't. We encourage people to work out their problems and then to get out of the relationship if nothing else will work. Don't you do the same for your friends? It is no doubt in my mind the guy in this example went one way and his wife went another. She had a support system of the Church, and he didn't, and thus he blames the Church instead of looking at himself. I feel sorry for all of you angry people out there. Open your hearts up to God and HE will make everything ok again. All you have to do is ASK! Buy it!"},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"if I didn't post before you today, and humbly bear my testimonkey of the Book of Marmon. I know with all the fiber in my bean, that the Book of Marmon is bad fiction written by as B.H. Roberts asserted, \\"an immature mind.\\" Yes, I post boldly and with the spirit of reason to you today, that this book has changed the lives of many people. For this book has inspired people to believe that because they are \\"white and delightsome\\", that they are a chosen and peculiar people. This book solemnly affirms that God regularly punishes the wicked and the unbeliever with dark skin.This book also inspired acts of violence in the name of the lord. Just as Nephi understood, that \\"better one man should perish, than an entire nation dwindle in unbelief\\", many other Mormons have taken the matter into their own hands. From the second biggest religious terrorist attack in our nation's history at Mountain Meadows, to the killing of perceived apostates by Porter Rockwell, Bill Hickman, Hosea Stout, and Dan Lafferty, this book has stood as the inspirational anthem of blood atonement.Yes, I testify that this book has inspired many people to better themselves. A common theme in this book is that God blesses the righteous with economic prosperity, but then punishes them with economic hardship when they turn away from the Lord. It makes me feel so superior to know that the less fortunate should have been more valiant in the pre-existence. .I will bear witness to you that the Book of Marmon has been found to help many people who suffer with the heartbreak and fatigue of insomnia. Even the great author Mark Twain realized the medical value of this book when he called it \\"chloroform in print.\\" 2 Nephi by itself has given hope to those suffering from this crippling sleeping disorder. This is the reason for the two star rating.I also testify, that this book testifies of Jesus Christ. In this book, those who rejected his glad message were destroyed in earthquakes, floods and other disasters. You think Jesus was pissed at the moneychangers in the temple? Check out his wrath in 3 Nephi. Reminds me of an old primary song \\"Jesus wants me for a Sunbeam\\" but my version would go \\"Jesus killed me in an earthQUAKE, because I wasn't good....\\" Yes this Jesus fellow sure made an entrance. The message is, \\"believe in me, or I'll show you who's boss.Let me say in closing, that I know without a shadow of a doubt, that Joseph Smith wrote this book. My testimonkey grows stronger every day that Joseph Smith was a philandering con-man who had a thing for underage women.

Not only that, but Joseph Smith, the translator of The Book of Mormon, never had more formal than a third grade education. Could someone do that without God's help? Of course not. Then, on a spiritual view, read the book and ask God if He inspired it, and if it is true. He, the source of all truth, will tell you that it is, as He did to me. This book changed my life.

However-if you read with an open mind and are searching for truth you will find your life may be changed by the teachings in this book. However, there must be opposition in all things. When something is so good and offers so much for people today, Satan will do all he can to keep people from hearing it or believing it.

You can take some reassurance in this because powerful and sacred truths by their very nature draw both strong support and opposition.Christ's life is a wonderful example of this. He either is the Son of God or He is a raving lunatic. He really performed miracles or He was involved in some of the most remarkable deceit ever performed. This explains why so many revered (and still revere) Him as the Son of God (which He is) while numerous others wanted to murder Him. Those that knew he was indeed the Son of God (and even those who know now) have not had it revealed to them by \\"flesh and blood\\" (or in a debate forum) but by the \\"Father which is in heaven.\\" (Matt 16:17)In a similar fashion, The Book of Mormon, a strong witness of His Divinity, has people that love and others that think they despise it. Ultimately the truth regarding this matter, as with a testimony of Christ, is not going to be revealed to you via \\"flesh and blood.\\" Rather, the answer is going to come through the power of the Holy Ghost from our \\"Father which is in heaven\\" as you pray to Him about the matter in Christ's name after having studied and pondered the Book with a willingness to follow Christ (as outlined in \\"Moroni's promise,\\" Moroni 10:3-5). I have tried this promise and have received not just one but multiple very clear and powerful witnesses from the Holy Ghost to my heart and mind for over 20 years that the work is in fact of God and true. For myself, The Book of Mormon has helped answer many of life's questions, has helped clarify many passages of the Bible and has helped me draw closer to my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.

Many ex converts on that website. Why? Because very soon you will see the truth for yourself. AND women in the church are nothing more than a baby factory and a servant to their husbands. Mormon men do not let their women have an opinion. Anger is a suppressed emotion in the mormon church as well. It's ok to get angry every now and then. In fact it's not healthy to bottle up the anger. Watch the anger and hurt when a family member cant attend thier own other family member get married in the Temple because the church said that they were not \\"Temple Worthy\\" In other words dont pay their tithing. Non members cant go into the temple either to watch a friend or family member get married. Ask the older generation of Mormons about the Mountain Meadows Massacre on September 11, 1857 There there was a movie called \\"September Dawn\\" that came out last month about it, but I knew about this many years ago. The founder, Joseph Smith, was a con man and was well known in his youth to tell some tall tales. He was even accused of stealing documents from a professor in which he changed the names, etc and that is what the Book of Mormon are about. FACT: Joseph Smith changed his story about seeing God the Father, Jesus, and the Holy Ghost several times. The first story was he saw an angel, then it was just God, then he changed the age he saw them, and many other variable stories. If I saw God I would remember in detail without changing my story so many times. The church finally had to decide on which version of the story to keep. Historical Fact: The mormons didn't let black men hold the priesthood until 1978. They stated before that year that the blacks were cursed and marked black because of Cain and would not reach the \\"Celestial Kingdom\\" anyways. The all of the sudden the \\"Prophet\\" Kimball suddenly had a vision to let the blacks hold a priesthood. How convienent when you look at the year and what was going on.

Some of the most serious readers have stopped in their attempt because of it's complexity, and some have simply touched the pages one-by-one to know it is a book inspired by G-d.My humble suggestion is to purchase the more expensive Grant Hardy edition that is on sale here at Amazon because it can help you to understand the Book of Mormon better. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"If you want to be happy and have a sense of direction and meaning in your life and of who you really are, then read this book and follow the teachings found in its pages. There are many parallels between problems that exist in the world today, and the problems of the people who lived in the Americas when this book was written. You can learn a lot about human nature from studying their history and perhaps learn to be wiser than they. This is a history about the people who once lived in the ancient Americas and God's dealings with them. God has always been mindful of his children regardless of where they are scattered across the earth."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"There are few words that can accurately describe my feelings about this book. Unless of course you'd like a novel.I can say however, I am disappointed in some of the reviews I have read. As with anything, particularly books of faith, one truly needs to DESIRE the knowledge to understand it.You need to WANT to read the book. Not simply read it hoping to be given this wealth of knowledge that will not make you all powerful and all knowing, when it comes to the LDS faith.If you go into your journey of reading this book, with a blackened heart, with serious doubt and not an inkling of faith or hope that the words you are about to read will in some way help you, it's very likely you'll remain that way even after completing the book. Or worse yet, you'll feel even more horrible.Those who are adamently against The LDS Church, will likely find anything possible to complain about this book, no matter it's significance. If you truly wish to be given knowledge of the LDS faith, are truly interested in the teachings and have faith that this book will shed some light on questions you may or may not know you ever had, READ THIS BOOK!!If need be, find yourself a free copy somewhere, if money issues keep you from purchasing this. I highly reccommend the book.It has saved my faith in many ways, on many occasions. I am sure it will again someday."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I whole-heartedly recommend this book to the honest and sincere seeker of truth. I have read the Book of Mormon almost every day for this entire year and I must say that it is without a doubt the greatest book I have ever read! It has changed my life. As I have read and tried to apply its teachings into my life, I have been amazed as I have become more patient, more compassionate, more filled with peace (even though we live in a turbulent world). My love for my family has increased and my desire to serve my fellow men has grown. It is all because I have gained a greater understanding and appreciation for the gospel of Jesus Christ through reading this book. I can promise any who reads the Book of Mormon with a sincere heart that they too can receive joy and happiness in their life, more peace, a greater appreciation for their family, and a greater understanding of the gospel of Jesus Christ."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I would guess that 90 percent of the negative reviews are from people who have not read this book from cover to cover. After reading it in its entirety, I can see that it is a real history of a real people. And I, a Christian, felt that I was closer to Christ by reading about these \\"Ancient American Christians\\" than I was before I read it. The book seems real, and authentic. And if it is true, I think there is more to the Mormons than most people think."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"The book is appropriate for those who wish to read a poorly written piece of fiction created by a madman."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"i got many things out of it and some people might not agree because they are not mormon like me"},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"This is a beautiful book that has filled my life with peace and joy.

He loves us and wants us to return to Him.We believe Jesus Christ is the Son of God. He is our Savior. He redeems us from death by providing the Resurrection. He saves us from sin as we repent.Through the Atonement of Jesus Christ, we can return to live with God if we keep His commandments.We believe the Holy Ghost helps us to recognize truth. Through reading the Book of Mormon you can call upon the Spirit of God to ask Him if what you are reading is true scripture and came from Him.We believe the first principles and ordinances of the gospel are faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, and receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost.You too can know that the Church of Jesus Christ has been restored to the earth in it's fullness just as it was in the times of Jesus Christ. By prayerfully reading this scripture you can get the answers you are looking for in life.The priesthood authority of God exists in His Church today, just as it did in the original Church of Jesus Christ during the New Testament times..Through reading the Book of Mormon you will find the Bible and the Book of Mormon are the word of God.God has not stopped talking to us as a people.Have you ever wondered why God talked to his Prophets in the Bible but why is did he stop revealing his word to us? Because He never did stop talking to us. God still reveals His will to prophets today, just as He did anciently.Your life has a sacred purpose here on earth and has meaning.Your family can be together forever.There seems to be so many people who have jumped to review this book- The Book of Mormon which was translated by Joseph Smith........ not written by him as a fictional book. How many other books have you read reviews on this website that have gotten so many hostile reviews? Why do so many DO NOT want you to really read this book? I'll tell you why because they are afraid. Just like the jews were afraid of Jesus in His time. Jesus in His day was a controversial leader when you think about it, and many people did not want to accept Him. His church and teachings was a different way of life, then living the Law of Moses, as the Jews had been living up till that point. Jesus Christ fulfilled the Law of Moses and established His church on the earth.This book is another Testament of Jesus Christ.This sacred book was written for our day. God has not stopped talking to his people and saved this scripture to be read in the Last Days.....our times in the world right now are so turbulent. Look in the news and it is everywhere the morally corrupt, the wars, the greed and the blood thirst show in almost every aspect. This book of scripture was written for our time to be able to Stand with God as a witness at this last day of His Son Jesus Christ. I would exhort you to read this book and let it touch your heart and fill your soul with His love. I am member of the LDS Church and have read this book of scripture many times. It is truly inspiring and you will feel the Spirit of God when you read it.If you will read it and ask God for an answer whether this book is true and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints is true you will get an answer .The words in this book came from God and his Prophets. If you have any questions about this book I would go to someone whether it is a friend or an acquaintance of the LDS church. It always puzzles me how people will turn to people for answers who aren't a member of the church and they don't have the correct information about the Book of Mormon or our beliefs .If you were going to find out the beliefs of the Catholic church would you go to a Baptist to find out about it? No, I think you wouldn't, but to someone who believes in that Church. Do the same here and find the answers from those who really know and believe in this Church and the Book of Mormon.You can also find answers to questions you may have on the church's website at www.lds.orgGood luck to you in your quest in finding the truth as it will be the most important thing you will do in your life."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"The great author, Mark Twain, reviewed it best by saying, \\"it is chloroform in print.\\"I share his review and add a few words of my own.First, it is misleading. I read the book expecting a good piece of well written fiction but instead I found plagarized portions of the bible. The storyline was incredibly violent and poorly written. If you are reading it for literary enjoyment I'd suggest you don't waste your time. If you're reading it as a book with which to gain great insights and wisdom I would also suggest you don't waste your time. I found nothing of great value in it. I've found more profound wisdom reading graffiti on the bathroom wall. There was nothing remarkable that held my attention. It's a sleeper. One's time and money is valuable and there are far better books with which to spend both on.Perhaps more fascinating than the book is the fact that the Mormon people honestly believe this book is actual scripture, that it is not fiction, but an actual documentary account of people who lived on the American continent. The problem is that no 3rd party historians or archeologists can find any trace of authenticity to support such claims. The only truly fascinating thing is when one realizes that large numbers of people do not view it as fiction but instead view it as the most perfect book ever written.The worst part is the end wherein a character named Moroni promises the reader that if they will pray about it God will tell them it is a true book. Mormon Church members believe this verse and use it as a missionary tool with which to convert people to believe the book is not fiction but actual fact. I took the \\"moroni's challenge\\" as they call it and prayed with all the sincerety I could possibly muster. I did not get any kind of inspiration or insight that this book was true. In fact I got a strong impression that it wasn't true. If you don't agree that the book is true, the Mormon members claim you aren't righteous and that there is something wrong with you as is evident by one of the reviews written here by the name of \\"notlostanymore t-rev from Marysville California\\". His review completely verifies my above statement. It has very psychologically unhealthy/cultish underpinnings. They believe there is something wrong with people who do not accept the book is a true, factual documentary.If you are curious about the book I suggest you read it but do not allow the mormons to answer questions person to person. If you become curious I would suggest you use the anonymity of internet forums with which to ask questions so no personal contact will be made. They will try to convince you that it is not just a book but is holy scripture that must be adhered to and if you end up believing that pitch you will be living your own very real, non-fictional horror story. You will be bombarded by the strong manipulation tactics displayed by the reviewer \\"notlostanymore t-rev\\" and every other mormon member who is just like him and this can be very damaging to one's psyche and lifestyle.You see, it's not just a book - it's advertised as a religion and I recommend you treat it as such.-------------------------------------------Reviewer: notlostanymore \\"t-rev\\" (marysville, ca)For anyone who has ever read the Book of Mormon, they know it is true. I know it is true because I asked God myself. All you have to do is the same. If you have a sincere heart and a contrite spirit, and get down on your knees and pray to ask God if what you have read is true, HE will make it known to you! Ask anyone of these reviewers that gave this book 1 star, why they did, and they will give you some excuse...but it really comes down to the fact that they are angry at God. One example is the guy who said we condone divorce. I assure you we don't. We encourage people to work out their problems and then to get out of the relationship if nothing else will work. Don't you do the same for your friends? It is no doubt in my mind the guy in this example went one way and his wife went another. She had a support system of the Church, and he didn't, and thus he blames the Church instead of looking at himself. I feel sorry for all of you angry people out there. Open your hearts up to God and HE will make everything ok again. All you have to do is ASK! Buy it!"},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I was recently at my grandmother's house and saw a copy of the Book of Mormon respectfully sitting on a bookshelf. On the inside front cover was a personal, handwritten message stating with absolute knowledge and certainty that the Book of Mormon was in fact an accurate history of ancient American civilizations, and that reading this divine book would surly change the life of the reader. The person who wrote the message was me. I wrote it 20 years ago as a pious 15-year old boy who was attempting to convert my non-Mormon grandmother to the Mormon religion. The curious thing about it is that when I wrote that message, I hadn't even read the book.6 months after I wrote those certain words, I finally read the book for the first time. I was being taught that the Book of Mormon was food for my soul, and I obediently got into the habit of reading a chapter of it every single day before going to sleep. Many chapters were boring and reading them was an exercise in self-discipline. Other chapters were mediocre, but I would search for meaning and inspiration and using my creativity, would often find it. A few chapters are in fact quite interesting and even inspiring.Ironically enough, my habit of reading at least a chapter of the Book of Mormon every day ended when I was a Mormon missionary. By the middle of my mission I had read the book about 10 times and despite my best efforts, reading it became an unendurable chore. I tried several times to resume the ritual of \\"feeding my soul,\\" but I just couldn't do it. The book became boring to be sure. But it wasn't plain boredom that paralyzed me: it was the cognitive dissonance that I suffered: when I actually engaged myself in the book, I was looking squarely at the fact that what I \\"knew\\" was accurate history and God's uncorrupted teachings was plainly and patently implausible and uninspiring.It is hard to talk about the merits of the Book of Mormon without digressing to the merits of the Mormon religion. But that is what I'll try to do. What makes a book a good book? I would say a book is a good book if it is entertaining, interesting, thought provoking, educational, or stimulating. It is an outstanding book if it somehow expands your mind or soul.If I had approached the Book of Mormon with an open mind rather than with an a priori certainty that it was accurate history my review would be different. Perhaps I could say that it was interesting and thought provoking. At least some parts of it. But reading it over and over again with fanatical dedication stunted the growth of my mind and soul and was anything but a pleasant activity. Because of that, I can't give it more than a single star.But of course that is just one man's opinion. Go ahead and read it if you feel inclined to do so. But be forewarned: if you read it, don't like it, and have the audacity to write a review about it, you will most likely be accused of being a bitter, angry, mean-spirited person who has a bone to pick with the Mormon Church."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"This book is all made up by Joseph Smith, if you read it you will see that it can't be a true story about Jesus coming to America. It is full of things that were not here during the time the book was supposed to have taken place, Like wheeled carts, horses, cattle, elephants. There is no evidence in North or South America of the people who are in the Book of Mormon.it is a very boring book and will put you to sleep. You can get them free from the LDS church and if you don't want to get one from them then go to a used book store and get one for 50 cents. Don't waste your money, it's not worth it !"},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"As I've read through many other reviews, I find them unfair. I have read the Book of Mormon many times and prayed about it. I know it is the Word of God without a doubt. How can I know you ask? It's really quite simple.The Book of Mormon is a companion volume to the Bible. The Bible gives us the religious history in the \\"old world\\". The Book of Mormon gives us the religious history of the America's. The Bible refers to \\"the Spirit of truth\\" which shall \\"testify of me\\", me being of course Jesus Christ (see John 15:26).The Book of Mormon expands on this and tells us how to have \\"the Spirit of truth\\" testify to us conerning truth. It says if you Read it (whether it be the Book of Mormon or the Bible, or anything for that matter), Ponder it (give thought to it, think about it), then Pray about it asking the Father in the name of Christ if it is true, with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Jesus Christ; he WILL manifest the truth of it unto you by \\"the Spirit of truth\\". You can see this promise in Moroni 10:3-5 which is the last book in the Book of Mormon.This is how I know the Book of Mormon is the word of God.Is it easy reading? Not necessarily, but then again, the Bible isn't either. I think the Lord intends it this way so we'll have to study and work hard for understanding. For doing so will only help us.I strive each day to live it's teachings as well as the Bible's. I am a better person because of it. It helps me to strive to become an even better person each day. I thank God for this Book."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"This book has brought me and my family hope and happiness. Don't read a review on Amazon.com to determine what's true. Read the Book of Mormon, pray sincerly, and ask God if it's true(James 1:5).

Now, let me get some things straight here.No, we're not a cult, no we don't have horns, no we don't hate you, no, we don't have ten thousand wives, no, we don't sacrifice babies, no, we don't worship statues.However, he's what we do.Yes, we love family, yes, we believe families are eternal, yes, we believe in life after death, yes, we believe in peace, yes, we believe in happiness, yes, we have high moral standards (which might be peculiar to you, but that's okay, that's your opinion, I don't hate you for it.)

So, instead, I fasted for 2 days and prayed about the virtues of pizza. Behold, I found pizza to be true, since it passed the very same test they were asking me to take on the book... it felt good, sounded good, there was much salivating and warmth of spirit. OK, with that part of the \\"promise\\" of the book debunked, the rest is either copied from the bible(not from pre 500 BC bible text as Mormons believe, but of post 18th century King James versions... same textual mistakes an misinterpretations etc.) or myths and understandings of the time and area of the author Mr. Smith."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"This is such a beautiful book that answers all the questions of the soul.

And no one need say they shall not come, for they surely shall, for the Lord hath spoken it; for out of the earth shall they come, by the hand of the Lord, and none can stay it; and it shall come in a day when it shall be said that bmiracles are done away; and it shall come even as if one should speak from the dead... Yea, it shall come in a day when the power of God shall be denied, and churches become defiled and be lifted up in the pride of their hearts; yea, even in a day when leaders of churches and teachers shall rise in the pride of their hearts, even to the envying of them who belong to their churches... Yea, it shall come in a day when there shall be great pollutions upon the face of the earth; there shall be murders, and robbing, and lying, and deceivings, and whoredoms, and all manner of abominations; when there shall be many who will say, Do this, or do that, and it mattereth not, for the Lord will uphold such at the last day. But wo unto such, for they are in the gall of bitterness and in the bonds of iniquity. Yea, it shall come in a day when there shall be churches built up that shall say: Come unto me, and for your money you shall be forgiven of your sins. O ye wicked and perverse and stiffnecked people, why have ye built up churches unto yourselves to get gain? Why have ye transfigured the holy word of God, that ye might bring damnation upon your souls? Behold, look ye unto the revelations of God; for behold, the time cometh at that day when all these things must be fulfilled. Behold, the Lord hath shown unto me great and marvelous things concerning that which must shortly come, at that day when these things shall come forth among you. Behold, I speak unto you as if ye were present, and yet ye are not. But behold, Jesus Christ hath shown you unto me, and I know your doing. And I know that ye do awalk in the pride of your hearts; and there are none save a few only who do not lift themselves up in the pride of their hearts, unto the wearing of very fine apparel, unto envying, and strifes, and malice, and persecutions, and all manner of iniquities; and your churches, yea, even every one, have become polluted because of the pride of your hearts. For behold, ye do love money, and your substance, and your fine apparel, and the adorning of your churches, more than ye love the poor and the needy, the sick and the afflicted. O ye pollutions, ye hypocrites, ye teachers, who sell yourselves for that which will canker, why have ye polluted the holy church of God? Why are ye ashamed to take upon you the name of Christ? Why do ye not think that greater is the value of an endless happiness than that misery which never dies-because of the praise of the world?

I love the book as both literature and a source of inspiration, not incomparable to the Bible, which I have also read cover to cover and continue to enjoy.I also believe The Book of Mormon to be historical truth to the extent that any history written by a human being may be unbiased. Are there translation or transcription errors? Maybe. Are there faults? If so, they are the faults of men as the book was written by men--men who on the pre-Columbian American continent and in Jerusalem felt or witnessed the hand of God in their own lives or that of the people they loved.Whether you believe this book is true or not, an unbiased reader cannot help but be inspired by it. A biased person will take it like the Grinch in Dr. Seuss's \\"Grinch Who Stole Christmas\\" did Christmas.As a young man, I was told by my parents that I should choose my friends wisely, as they would have a great impact on my morals and the choices I would make in life. While most of my friends are not books, I count this book and the men who wrote it my friends, heroes, and spiritual Hercules. Spiritual, yet down to Earth.If you never read another book in your life [...], I propose that you read this book. Make up your own mind, or don't, it's up to you.MY ONLY COMPLAINT is that the book can so easily be obtained for free. While butter and honey should be free by Isaiah and John the Baptists' utopian expectation, I think the low price may lead people to take this book for granted. \\"HO, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.\\" (Isaiah 55:1)Finally, for all who in this fast food and instant entertainment world are too lazy or reserved to ask for, read, analyze, and pray about a 531 page book, the main message of the book as spoken by Jesus Christ is as follows:Third Nephi 9: 14 - \\"Yea, verily I say unto you, if ye will come unto me ye shall have eternal life. Behold, mine arm of mercy is extended towards you, and whosoever will come, him will I receive; and blessed are those who come unto me.\\"Take a chance on this book. You cannot lose (I haven't after 49 1/2 attempts!), and you may actually find yourself smarter and happier and closer to God for having read it."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"This book can change your life for the better. It has mine.I have read the Book of Mormon many times. When I first read it, without pondering it carefully, and without praying, it didn't do much for me.But once I started reading the book for understanding, and really wanting to find out if it was true, and praying to our Heavenly Father in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, to know if this book was indeed divinely inspired, I got my answer from God.I know that this is a true book. It is filled with many wonderful truths that shed light on the most important questions that people need to know in this life. It uplifts me in spirit. It helps me in my day-to-day life.I know that Joseph Smith, the man who translated this book by the gift and power of God, was a prophet called by God. Many people say differently. Go to the Source. Go to Him who is your Father in Heaven, and ask him sincerely if this book (once you've read it) is true and if Joseph was a prophet.

Doubleday has laid out this edition in an easy-to-read format with fairly large text.I first read the Book of Mormon as a teenager. Thirty years later, I find the book just as compelling and inspirational as when I first read it. There will be naysayers and those who denigrate the book without really even reading it just to get in a dig at a religion they might not understand or might not like, and I admit to having once been in those ranks -- until I actually picked up the book and read it myself.They always say not to judge a book by its cover and in turn, I say not to judge this book by anyone else's biased opinion -- including mine. :) I would say to ignore all these reviews, both pro & con, and pick up the book and read it yourself -- that's the only way to know for sure if the contents are to your liking. If you can't afford this new Doubleday edition, many libraries will have a copy of the book you can borrow for free.

This book inspires to be a better people and believe in the God who lives. It also testifies of the divinty of our Savior Jesus Christ.

It's very well written, and it is also and interesting read.What I did enjoy about the book is that there is a real enthusiasm in it, the book just seems excited. It is also very well structured and consistent.Now, one review for this book on this site was by a \\"black\\" woman(no offense intended as to referring to her as black, as she did to herself) who encouraged every non-mormon to do their research on the net. If that isn't a sign to pick up the book then what is? I doubt she ever finished the book, in all fairness, what harm could come to you for actually RESEARCHING the RELIGEON based on IT'S text, not the texts of someone who feels the need to BASH the religeon for whatever reason they have. Have you ever noticed how you can acquire this book for free...go buy an anti-mormon book, they all cost MONEY. People call Joseph Smith a gold digger(he, at one time, worked for someone who wanted to mine for gold until Joseph Smith convinced him it wasn't worthwhile. You can read this in Joseph Smith, History). The problem with people calling him a gold digger is that they then close their eyes to the location of the real gold diggers, the people who write and sell anti-mormon literature. The mormon website has the Book of Mormon up there for you to read for FREE, most in depth anti mormon literature will only provide you w/a few pages of lies to get you to buy the book..where you are bombared w/mainly more lies.DO YOUR RESEARCH IN THE ONLY PLACE WHERE YOU CAN CONDUCT VALID RESEARCH. Don't go out and read a bunch of stuff on the net which could've very well been written by an 11 year old. If you want to study the Mormon reliegeon, acquire this book and other Mormon texts. Just as if you wanted to study the Muslim religeon, you wouldn't go find anti-muslim sites, you'd go check out some Muslim literature.If you want to enjoy this book you need to know something before you even start, and that is to BE FAIR when reading this book and desregard, if only for a moment, all the anti-mormonism you've read and just read the book, an actual publication of the church itself.It's has earned every one of the 5 stars I give it."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"This is a wonderful book and truly inspirational.

Joseph Smith Jr. translated this book through divine means for US to have TODAY. He did NOT write it himself. He translated it. To some it may seem like a history book, but it is more than that. It will bring spiritual enlightenment to those who read it searching for truth. Those who read it with Anti-Mormon feelings already in their hearts will most likely not be changed by it, but those with open hearts will FEEL its truthfulness as they read. The book is real and it is true."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"This is the most influential book I've ever read. I read it in its entirety when I was 21 and it has changed my life forever. I have since read it 6 or 7 times and each time I read it I learn something new. Think of it as a companion to the Bible, which is a history of the prophets and people in Jerusalem, and the Book of Mormon is a history of the prophets and people in the Americas (south, central and migrating northern). This is definately recommended reading. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"Reading the Book of Mormon has deepened my testimony of Jesus Christ. It so beautifully corroborates the Holy Bible, in many cases filling in missing links. To a first time reader, it is like reading a compelling family saga. The gospel of Jesus Christ is taught throughout the Book of Mormon. After reading this book, one can have a sure knowledge, not only about the divinity of Christ, but of the history of those who lived in this hemisphere from 600 BC to 400 AD. It is a must read for anyone interested not only in the gospel of Jesus Christ, but in history."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"Throughout my life I have struggled too read an entire book from cover to cover. I usually get to bored, put it down and never return. My experience with The Book of Mormon has been completely different. I have read the entire book several times and am constantly amazed at the new insights I gain into the life of Jesus Christ. The Book of Mormon is a great testament of the life and mission of Christ as recorded by the inhabitants of the North and South American continents from 600 BC to 400 AD. It stands as a second witness to support the writings of the Bible, not to replace the Bible. The Book of Mormon is an easy read and for the most part flows chronologically.Our family just finished reading The Book of Mormon this past year and we feel a greater closeness to Heavenly Father and to His son, Jesus Christ. So many of life's questions can be answered within the pages of The Book of Mormon. I encourage everyone to read and ponder the words contained therein. By doing so you will be able to develop a stronger relationship with your Eldest Brother, Jesus Christ."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"Like all religious matters, the Book of Mormon should be read with an open mind and heart, not to mention tolerance for the beliefs of others.

Each time I read it I have a stronger testimony that it is true. It is another Testament of Jesus Christ just like it says. Anyone truely reading and studying this book can know for themselves if it is true or not by praying and asking our Heavenly Father in Jesus name if it is true. I know that it is a record of our ancestors that lived here on this the American Continent. It is a companion to the Holy Bible (they go hand in hand) to help us understand the fullness of the Gospel. I LOVE IT, THERE IS NO OTHER BOOK IN MY LIFETIME THAT HAS TOUCHED MY LIFE LIKE THE BOOK OF MORMON HAS.

We simply ask you to find out for yourself.What other book invites you to find out for yourself whether it is true.\\"Behold, I would exhort you that when ye shall read these things, if it be wisdom in God that ye should read them, that ye would remember how merciful the Lord hath been unto the children of men, from the creation of Adam even down until the time that ye shall receive these things, and ponder it in your hearts.4 And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.5 And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things.\\"All we ask is that you read \\"The Book of Mormon\\" and find out for yourself.

In fact, I claim to know very little. What I do know is that the Book of Mormon is scripture, written for our troubled day. If you're unsure about reading this book, all that can be fairly asked is that you give it a chance. You may not convert, you may not even ever pick it up again. But you will feel better after having read it.It has changed my life, and for the better."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"When I was growing up, I prided myself in my own self-concious way at the thought of my being an intellectual. People who refer to themselves as intellectuals usually consider themselves better than other \\"ordinary\\" people and scoff at the thought of tradition and religion. I bought into the whole, \\"dissent will show you the light\\" liberal political stuff. However, I always made it to Church, though I'm not really sure why; it conflicted so much with what I thought I wanted in my life, but in the end the feeling in my heart was so good while I was there. As I grew older, God allowed my heart to be humbled through various (and sometimes painful) experiences; health issues, self-doubt, etc. When I reached the proper age I served a mission for my Church and still maintain to this day, that if you want to know what charity is like, step into the lean-to of a poor Philippino family, teach of Christ, hand them a Book of Mormon, and watch their life change. Amazing things happen, friends...When I grew a little older and started my own family, I became overwhelmed with the responsability and thought of raising children in this world. In the end, isn't that what we all want? To be humble enough to learn how to treat our spouse, raise our children, and help them to be good people? Well, on top of suffering for our sins and providing a way back to live with God, Christ has provided us with help in our everday problems and desires. This book is one of those opportunities.Other than the Book of Mormon, I have never read a book over 10 times. What is interesting is despite the invaluable information contained in the Book, the best part about it is the Spirit entering into the life of the reader. Just simply from reading it. You begin to realize God's hand in your life; how He's been there for you from the very beginning. You begin to understand the nature of the family, and how you can be with your loved ones forever. You can see what God expects of you as a person living in the current world, and experience the blessings. You will learn to be a positive person. You will learn self-reliance. You will learn what true happiness is (not mere joy or fun). You will learn of Christ, and His dealings with the people on the American continent. This book has meant the world to me.Of course you will read here and other places of people who dissaprove of the Book of Mormon and the Mormon religion, but so what? This is simply \\"opposition in all things.\\" These people claim that they have the truth but ask yourself, \\"are they happy?\\" If they are, why do they teach hate? What these people have to say will fade away, but the Book will remain.

I know that the history of the latter day saint people has been laden with persecution and skeptisism. We are in times now that submerge us in danger and uncertainty. Much like the people described in The Book of Mormon. They met the challenges of their day with faith in the Almighty God. Even in the darkest and most uncertain times, a small group of people found peace and hope by looking forward to the coming of Jesus Christ.The majority of people in the world face challenges in life that make us all wonder what will happen with our lives. I can personally speak with confidence that after having read The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ, I know that, though things may seem uncertain in our world, hope can still be found by following Jesus Christ.If you are an open minded reader that is able to put aside the bad and the good that has been said about The Book of Mormon and have a mind of your own to read it for yourself, you will finish reading The Book of Mormon, knowing, as I have discovered that it is the work of Jesus Christ."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I found this to be a very enlightening book.

There is no way Joseph Smith Jr. wrote this book. As you read it, it will sound like the King James Bible. The Book of Mormon is a translation of an ancient record of multiple civilizations' experiences with God. Chronologically, the book entitled 'Ether' in the book takes place first, starting at the tower of babel. It is an abridgment of a man's record called the Brother of Jared. This is an incredible account of a man seeing the Spirit Body of Jesus Christ years before he would be born in the flesh. We learn from this passage (Ether Ch. 3) that all people, Jesus included, exist as a spirit body before being born. This is just one of many unique and exciting doctrines clarified in the Book of Mormon. Read this book if you want to find out what millions of people around the world believe in. This book goes hand in hand with the Bible to show that God not only communicated His word to the peoples of the middle east area, but also in the ancient Americas as well. This book is used by millions as a guide post in their lives to moral living. It teaches of people who can be happy in times of terrible wars and economic struggles. It teaches that even if you've lived a horrible life, you can change your life and accomplish much good in the lives of others.

I have read it many times, and have seen it change the lives of many people for the better. It is a record kept by ancient prophets in the America's from 600BC to 400AD. These prophets were inspired by God just as the prophets in the Holy Land were. God loves and teaches all his children regardless of where they live on the earth. These ancient American prophets kept records of their teachings concerning repentance, baptism, temple work, and the Savior Jesus Christ and his atonement. As a result this record compliments the Holy Bible as a second witness of Jesus Christ and His divine mission. I encourage all sincere seekers of the truth regarding our relationship with our Heavenly Father to read this record. It will lead to answering the three most important questions we have; Where did I come from before this life ? Why am I here ? Where am I going after this life ?(...)"},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I was a true believer for 30 years and nothing anybody could have said or done would have lessoned my \\"testimony\\" to the \\"truthfulness\\" of this book or the religon that goes along with it. Unfortunately, after 30 years I suddenly woke up one day and realized that I had been completely brain washed and marching in step in one of the wackiest cults in America.Okay, but about the book... Any of my \\"brothers\\" from church will tell you how great this book is, how it changed their life, etc. - people from other religons will tell you it is of the devil.In reality, if you are not already a true believing mormon, you are not going to make it past the first chapter. It is incredibly difficult to read, as Joseph Smith chose to dictate it in the style of Elizabethan English, to make it sound more Biblical. Even the most hard core members only read this book because they have to. It is just boring and nonsensical.The general message is that all of the Native Americans were originally white Jews who lost faith in God, and God cursed them with dark skin to make them \\"repulsive\\" to their \\"white brothers\\", so they wouldn't want to \\"mix their seed\\" with them. Later the \\"dark and loathsome\\" (using the Book of Mormon's own words, NOT mine!) native Americans kill all of the \\"white and delightsome\\" ones, and today we are left with dark skinned Hebrews who non-mormons call \\"indians\\".Sound offensive? YES IT IS!!! After years of trying to justify this religon, I have finally come to the realization that it is NOT the word of God, but a product of 19'th century folk lore, magic seer stones, and racist \\"doctrines\\" that the church should have dropped centuries ago.I apologize for all the \\"free copies\\" of this offensive book that I gave out to people when I was a Mormon Missionary many years ago. (that's right, you don't have to buy this book, the church will give you one for free as part of their conquest for new members), and I wish I could some how make up for all of the twisted teachings of this church that I helped to indoctrinate into people. As members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, we really do believe that we are doing the right thing, and sadly, once you get into this religon it is VERY difficult to get out.I know everyone from church regularly comes here to write 5 star reviews of the Book of Mormon, and to sing it's praises about how it has changed their lives, brought them peace, and brought them closer to Christ. I used to do that myself. But the truth of the matter is, this is the farthest thing from a good book that you could possibly find at Amazon.If you want to know about the history of the Book of Mormon and where it really came from, I would suggest \\"Losing a Lost Tribe\\" by Simon G.

But anyways this book claims to be \\"another testament of Jesus Christ\\" Galatians 1:8-9 in the New Testament of the Holy Bible says...\\"But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. As we said before, so say I now again, if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.\\" The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints says the angel Moroni brought Joseph Smith gold plates with this \\"testament\\" on it. Just like Mohammed said the angel Gabriel brought him the Koran (Quran). See I don't believe Joseph saw an angel, I think he made it up from stealing from the KJV bible, Solomon Spalding book etc. and his \\"book of Abraham?\\" what a joke and fiasco that has been. It's been PROVEN it's false!! Grow up Mormons and worship the God of the Bible not some phony god with his harem of wives! I loved the post from the hypocritical Mormon saying Christians worship the bible (sorry if they do they aren't Christians) but in the same token Mormons will get up the first Sunday of every month and say \\"IknowthechurchistrueIknowJosephSmithwasaprophet etc. etc.\\" Where's Jesus in the testimony meetings Mormons?!

(BTW, Jesus hated hypocrites just look at the pharisees)signed, a former Mormon who quit from the false doctrines not secret sins (which I know you all just automatically believe because \\"how can someone think the church isn't true?\\" Duh, try reading and doing your homework.)

I've learned much of the book and Mormonism's history since. The bad plot was likely borrowed from a dime store novel,it's written in a really pathetic attempt at King James English, though it was supposedly written 1400 years before King James and the spelling and grammer (written by an Angel,no less.) have had to be re-proofed many, many times. The most damning truth is that doctrines people base their lives on have appeared and disappeared with regularity in different editions, though the leadership CLAIMS this has not happened, (Much like they deny Mormonism's denial of EXTENSIVE, heavily documented proof of Polygamy,not to mention pedophilia, and so-called \\"blood atonement\\" murders committed or sanctioned by virtually every leader of the LDS until the 1900's.)

Explain why there be so many divisions among the Christian beliefs with the Bible alone?The attacks against this book will amount to nothing as those who truly seek Christ will find Him in the pages and the spirit of the words. I appreciate Mark Twain's storytelling ability, but I know nothing of his spirituality and I see no need to give any weight to his book review. Strange how so many are quick to prop him up on this matter. Interesting how some of the attacks against the Book of Mormon could be the same attacks used against the Bible. Be careful who you take to be your guide. Why does this book, which so many vehemently claim to be false, arouse such bitterness? If it is no value it will fall by the wayside as all garbage does.

However, this can only be procured if the individual has an open mind and does not think that the Lord has stopped speaking to man.I grew up believing that the Book of Mormon is a book of falsehoods, due to my upbringing in the southern United States. My family and my former pastors only condemned those who were of the Latter-Day Saint faith with nonsensical charges. However, when I left home for the military, I began to search for peace and only obtained it after reading this great book. Only after putting away my preconceived notions of the Latter-Day Saints did I find that this book holds great truths.Prophets that ministered among the Nephite civilization wrote many of the truths in this book, which were written for our day. This is a cacophony of voices warning the Gentiles of America not to make the same mistakes they had made. It truly is a warning from the dust (Isaiah 29). When Christ appeared to this civilization, after his resurrection, he spent several chapters focusing on the condemnation that awaits the Gentiles, if they do not repent. If you will but look around, many can see that all is not well in so-called powerful America. Our societal ills are numerous.This book, coupled with the King James Bible, has given me eyes to see and ears to hear.

I love the book as both literature and a source of inspiration, not incomparable to the Bible, which I have also read cover to cover and continue to enjoy.I also believe The Book of Mormon to be historical truth to the extent that any history written by a human being may be unbiased. Are there translation or transcription errors? Maybe. Are there faults? If so, they are the faults of men as the book was written by men--men who on the pre-Columbian American continent and in Jerusalem felt or witnessed the hand of God in their own lives or that of the people they loved.Whether you believe this book is true or not, an unbiased reader cannot help but be inspired by it. A biased person will take it like the Grinch in Dr. Seuss's \\"Grinch Who Stole Christmas\\" did Christmas.As a young man, I was told by my parents that I should choose my friends wisely, as they would have a great impact on my morals and the choices I would make in life. While most of my friends are not books, I count this book and the men who wrote it my friends, heroes, and spiritual Hercules. Spiritual, yet down to Earth.If you never read another book in your life [...], I propose that you read this book. Make up your own mind, or don't, it's up to you.MY ONLY COMPLAINT is that the book can so easily be obtained for free. While butter and honey should be free by Isaiah and John the Baptists' utopian expectation, I think the low price may lead people to take this book for granted. \\"HO, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.\\" (Isaiah 55:1)Finally, for all who in this fast food and instant entertainment world are too lazy or reserved to ask for, read, analyze, and pray about a 531 page book, the main message of the book as spoken by Jesus Christ is as follows:Third Nephi 9: 14 - \\"Yea, verily I say unto you, if ye will come unto me ye shall have eternal life. Behold, mine arm of mercy is extended towards you, and whosoever will come, him will I receive; and blessed are those who come unto me.\\"Take a chance on this book.

The adventure and characters that are included in the history portion of the record are inspiring and interesting to read about. I particularly like Captain Moroni and the Stripling Warriors. The account of the Savior's visit to the American continent written by Nephi is very moving. It is so good to know that Jesus Christ cares about all people and wanted all to know of his gospel. The account tells of many people witnessing his visit after His resurrection. They felt the nail prints in His hands. He told them who He was, and taught them the same things he taught the people in the old world. He called 12 apostles to help teach the people His gospel after he was gone, just as in the New Testament. I can't believe that this record is not accepted by everyone as a true record. It should be in every home, just as the Bible is. There is one scripture in Moroni Chapter 10 verse three that if put to the test, you will know this is a true record. It's good to know that God the Father and His Son Jesus Christ know us by name and still want to be a part of our lives."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"Since I have read this book from cover to cover more than twenty times, and can still quote large chunks of it from memory, I thought it might be helpful if I posted a few of my thoughts here. I was a faithful Mormon until my mid-forties, and served as a Bishop in the Mormon Church for a full five year term until I eventually began to read and question (violating the strong counsel of Mormon leaders that I not do so), and subsequently moved on to other, more expansive and inclusive, spiritual view points.The Book of Mormon is alleged by its believers to be real history recorded by prophets who had direct communication with God. Hence, most Mormons believe that the lessons it teaches by recounting the relationship between God, His prophets and a people who lived in the Americas, can be relied upon to guide our lives. And most importantly, they believe that since Joseph Smith created the Book of Mormon, its literal truthfulness is proof that all of the other things foundational to Mormonism that Smith said are also true, including that God gave him the exclusive authority to lead God's only \\"true\\" church on Earth.As time passes and science produces more evidence relevant to world the Book of Mormon says existed between 600 B.C.E. and 400 C.E. in the Americas (like recent DNA research related to the ancestry of native Americans - See Simon Sotherton \\"Losing a Lost Tribe\\"), it appears more and more probable that the Book of Mormon is not real history. This makes it, as things now stand, highly probable to be mythology in the classic sense - one of the sacred stories that are used by a people to explain the world in which they live. Virtually all of the people who do not accept this view and insist the Book of Mormon is real history, and the word of God, are those whose vested interest in Mormonism makes it somewhere between difficult and impossible to accurately assess the relevant evidence. Medical doctors do not treat their own children for the same reason that faithful Mormons should not be relied upon for a realistic view of what the Book of Mormon means or is - strong emotions are proven to interfere with the ability of human beings to process the information in front of them.For quite a while times have been rough for mythologies in general. Religious historian Karen Armstrong explains that this is due to the fact that modern man has become science or logic oriented but still needs and uses mythologies. Since mythologies are now written down, they can be analyzed in terms of their \\"truth\\" as defined by the accuracy of the description of the physical world they provide. When mythologies were not written down they could be modified from time to time as circumstances required by those within the society who were charged with the sacred responsibility of remembering and recounting these mythic histories, and so helping to stabilize society. Plato referred to these elites as philosopher kings - those few wise charged with the task of deceiving the masses as required to keep order and lead to them along the way they needed to go. The changes made to mythologies were essential t this, because mythologies need to make sense in light of the rest of what society believes in order to be relied upon to answer the \\"big\\" questions: Why are we here? Where did we come from? Why do we suffer? What happens after death? It is interesting to note that these are precisely the questions Mormons will tell you the Book of Mormon addresses, and definitively answers in most cases.So, what does geology tell us about whether there was, or not, a worldwide flood? What does the study of genetics and linguistics tell us about the origins of mankind, and of language? Etc. Mythologies were not subjected to these tests until relatively recently, and most religious people to one degree or another accept books like those contained in the Bible as being mythic. Was the earth created in seven 24 hour days, or was the story in Genesis some kind of metaphor, or myth? How about the Tower of Babel? Noah and the Ark? Jonah and the whale? The Virgin birth? The Resurrection?You can learn a lot about a Christian sect by simply determining where its members tend to draw the mythology line (usually without calling it that). Christianity has been dealing with this issue for at least a couple of centuries. Mormonism is just starting to deal with it in terms of the Book of Mormon. I predict that the Mormon Church will eventually follow the lead of the organization formerly called the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons who after Joseph Smith's death followed his family instead of Brigham Young) and recognize the Book of Mormon to be mythology.While most of us don't think of mythology in these terms, science has become the mythology - or is central to the mythology - of many people. This is even the case for many religiously inclined people. They use science to answer the big questions to the extent they can, and use religion (or new age philosophy, or common sense, etc.) to deal with what science cannot. This approach has been advocated at least since Galileo and Bacon, and so has had plenty of time to become part of the unconscious background of our society - our wallpaper. And then we have a host of quasi or psuedo-sciences that are really little more than religion dressed in mysticism derived from the fringes of science. The recent film \\"What the Bleep Do We Know\\" provides an interesting (if irritating) glimpse of a classic in this genre.As mythology, the Book of Mormon does not fare well. First, those who created it set expectations high by trying to sell it as real history. As the evidence noted above mounts, many former believers come painfully to the conclusion that they have been sold a grotesquely expensive bill of goods. And second, the book is unpersuasive as mythology except for those who continue to believe that it is a real account. This is because it does not pass the test of making sense in light of the rest of what we think is likely real in the world around us. And as time passes, the distinction between reality as most non-Mormons (and some Mormons) perceive it and the picture painted by the Book of Mormon becomes more stark and so harder to ignore. This, along with the wealth of easily accessible information available over the Internet, is what eventually drew my attention. Even leaders of the Mormon Church close to a hundred years ago, unbeknownst to most Mormons, are on record to the effect that the book is poorly written; shows clear signs of not only unoriginality, but immature authorship; etc. (See B. H. Roberts, \\"Studies of the Book of Mormon\\").In sum, there are countless books in the western canon, and many movies, that are in my view far more important in terms of their mythic contribution to our society than is the Book of Mormon.I continue to believe that it is important that we find our \\"whys\\". Hence, I place a high value on good mythology. However, my experience with Mormonism taught some hard lessons about how a few people tend to use whatever means they can lay their hands on to control the large group around them. I now take special care to avoid those who attempt to use any mythology to control me, and seek out those who will try to help me understand myself and exercise more control over my life as I explore this wonderful experience that we in the democratic west have the privilege to have.So why, might one ask, did I give the Book of Mormon two stars? First, it forms the basis for a large religion that continues to grow, though more slowly than in the past due to issues such as those I mention above coupled with the Internet. That religion also boasts many well-educated members who continue to believe, against the odds, that this book is real history. This, in and of itself, makes the Book of Mormon a matter of significant curiosity.Regrettably, a person who wishes to understand the Book of Mormon's power will not likely be helped by reading it. Its power rests not in its texts, but is a function of the emotional responses that result from being a member of the close-knit Mormon community. That is, when a Mormon or someone looking into Mormonism feels good things as a result community participation, being paid significant attention of one kind or another, etc. they are told that these feelings emanate from their study Book of Mormon - that God is telling them by the good things they feel that the Book of Mormon is indeed His word, and that by extension the Mormon Church is the one and only true church on Earth. The book could work just as well in this regard were it a South Park episode written in socially acceptable, clumsy language and without wit. In fact, as I wrote that I realized that South Park likely has much more mythic value than does the Book of Mormon. At least some episodes do.The second star is for a few ideas that the book contains that Joseph Smith, the book's author, should be at least credited with collecting. These include ideas related to the joy mankind should experience and the central role we may choose to give joy in life. Various philosophers had been saying that for a long time before Smith, but it was not part of the Christian canon and so IF the Book of Mormon had been the word of the Christian God (as Mormons claim it to be), this would have been an innovation. It also contains some nice passages regarding how faith works, the importance of humility and personal agency, and the role of suffering in life. But again, none of this was new when one considers the work of the countless thinkers who preceded Joseph Smith. It appears likely that he either copied these ideas from things he read or had heard, or that he came to the same kind of conclusions about the human predicament that many before him had already reached.In short, I don't think that this book would be useful to the vast majority of people who purchase books on Amazon. But for the curious few who are interested in modern mythologies and how they work, don't mind turgid prose, and have plenty of time on their hands, the Book of Mormon might be just the thing. Overall, my advice even to those few is that they wait for the Coles Notes version. That will be as enlightening, and much less painful to read.My further thoughts regarding the Book of Mormon and Mormonism can be found at http://mccue.cc/bob/spirituality.htm"},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"Regardless of you religous preference The Book of Mormon provides an awsome look into the lives of characters, who much like people today, face struggles to find peace, and happiness.

As I have done some extensive research on the origins of the LDS church and the Book of Mormon in particular, I have come to the realization that it is a fabrication with some shreds of truth mixed in.I totally support any and all who want to align themselves with the LDS religion. Some of the values and virtues taught are certainly worthwhile. Most of my extended family are active LDS. However, I have come to the realization (as hard as it was) that Joseph Smith was not at all what the LDS church is claiming. If you actually look at history, you would be somewhat surprised to learn just how \\"shaky\\" the whole \\"first vision\\" tale is. I no longer believe it even happened. Polygamy was always a sore spot with me, but if you actually read historical accounts of what actually happened, you would be shocked and disgusted and come to the realization that it was a practice invented by Smith alone and was the main factor in his eventual death. In fact, most of the teachings and historical depictions taught by the LDS church - including the recent DVD on the \\"restoration\\" - are, in fact, mostly fiction.From an historical point of view, the Book of Mormon has hundreds of contradictions and problems. Many of the views and doctrines addressed in the book were prominent religious issues of the 1800's period and it was obviously of product of that time.I was first troubled by another book of LDS scripture called the Book of Abraham in the Pearl of Great Price. From my research on that book, it is very obvious that it was a fabrication of Joseph Smith. The actual papyrus from which that book was supposedly \\"translated\\" was recently found. The analysis of the papyrus - even by church authorities - has resulted in the declaration that the validity of the Book of Abraham is in question. I have no doubt that it's a fabrication.When the shocking declarations against the Book of Abraham became known, I began to look at the Book of Mormon with critical eyes as well. The result was a discovery of many problems starting with the way the gold plates were discovered and continuing with problems with how they were translated and ending with major doctrinal problems.There are many in the LDS church who will claim they \\"know\\" the Book of Mormon is \\"true\\" because they have a \\"testimony\\" of it through the power of the Holy Ghost. I certainly claimed as much. However, I have also come to realize that the \\"emotional response\\" of such things is very unreliable. The tingly, warm peaceful feelings one gets from various events and interactions are really nothing more than an \\"emotional response\\" based upon beliefs and experiences. They happen to everybody in many different capacities and religions. They are not manifestations of \\"truth.\\"I respect those who believe in the LDS teachings - including the Book of Mormon. However, I have come to the realization that the Mormon church is a fabricated religion. There are many \\"active\\" members of the church who believe the same thing but are still involved because they enjoy the community and culture. Many in other religions do exactly the same thing.With regards."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"This book is amazing. Although very similar to the Bible, from a reading standpoint, the Book of Mormon is an entirely separate work. A lot of the people reviewing this book are so incredibly close minded. Why is it so hard to believe that there are two &quot;witness of Christ&quot; like the book explains??? I don't understand what is so mind wrenching about that concept. It is a known fact that the Bible has been translated multiple times and the errors that occur within the text are numberous. It would only make sense that an ALL KNOWING GOD would be able to forsee such an occurance and have other means by which to get the truth out in the open! It is impossible to read this book and not feel something, even if it is a slight desire to improve ones self, right!? So for all of you supposed Biblical fanatics out there who profess to the death that the Bible is the one and only word of God...wake up! If you really understand the Bible then you have to realize that being close minded is NOT an element talked about. I love this book and would recommend that everyone who ever gets a copy of it should read it! Go out of your way to get one if that's what it takes. You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"...As for my review:The faux-King James language is somewhat off-putting because the Book of Mormon has none of the rhythm and feel of the language that KJV has on just a single page. (Compare Coverdale's Bible to a modern translation and you will see what I mean. Joseph Smith had less style in is whole body that Coverdale had in his pinky.)I was astounded at the methodology of the \\"faith experiment\\" of Alma 32. It is poor science at it's very worse - more kith and kin to the \\"science\\" of creationism than any sort of real science.I am also dubious of the thesis that the Native Americans are of Jewish extractions being Lamanities and such and the Polynesians are also Jewish through the Nephite Hagoth. Are the Navajo and Sioux languages (for example) of Hebrew derivation like French and Spanish are to Latin? Was the \\"Tower of Babel\\" a real event as described in Ether? The science is just not there to make and substantiate any such claims. I hear that the BofM is not a book of geography and that you should not try to find where certain places (like Bountiful or Zarahemla) were, but that begs the question: If the BofM is not a book of geography is it a book of history?I have to agree with an earlier review stating that the BofM that the book has almost no distinctive Mormon beliefs - those all reside in the \\"Doctrine and Covenants\\" and the \\"Pearl of Great Price\\". The whole point of the BofM as presented by the missionaries is to establish a belief in Joseph Smith and less of a point to convert someone to a belief in Jesus Christ - since most \\"investigators\\" already have that belief. The logic goes like this:a) BofM is true, therefore:b) Joseph Smith is a prophet, therefore:c) Church he set up is true ( and the one you belong to is not), therefore:d) Everything the Church has done, is doing, and will do is \\"true\\" QED.But the flaw in the reasoning is that is just because the book is \\"true\\" that does not mean that the practice of polygamy (for instance) is \\"true.\\" It only means that Joseph Smith was called to translate this book - Nothing else. The Mary Baker Eddy approach of religion building seems to be a more honest approach. That is just simply writing a text which correlates and \\"corrects\\" the bible to your own personal opinion and use that as a scripture.But in the final analysis, who am I to judge the beliefs of my brother (or sister)? If people say they feel like they are better people for reading the BofM then more power to them. If a belief in the BofM keeps the book's believers from breaking into my house, then by all means let me not tear down your faith in such a book - read it to your heart's content.Two similarities to the Celestine Prophecy make me smile:CP\\"An ancient manuscript discovered in Peru...\\"BofM\\"Ancient golden plates discovered in New York State...\\"CP\\"Government wants to suppress the manuscript...\\"ParleyP.Prat\\"hiring ministers fight the truth\\""},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"Mark Twain made a somewhat in-depth review of the Book of Mormon after reading it, but he summed it all up when he said that the book was &quot;chloroform in print&quot;.

The hero, Nephi, is a murderer and a thief. He decapitates a drunken man in order to steal some of his belongings. He does this because God commands him to. The book is filled with religious battles, where millions of people are slain. Arms are hacked off by the dozens.The story revolves around a group of middle eastern people who migrate to the Americas, where they split into good and evil civilizations. The bad guys, the Lamanites, are cursed with a dark skin, and are lazy and evil. Mormons used to teach that these are the ancestors of Native Americans (DNA evidence has proven this false). The good guys, the Nephites, are forced into hiding and eventual extermination by the Lamanites.Mormons recently taught that Lamanites could overcome their dark skin curse by accepting the gospel; they could be made \\"white and delightsome\\" (quote from book of mormon; note: the wording was recently changed to \\"pure and delightsome\\".

Beyond the glaring historical innacuracies, linguistics say it best: Yucatec and Quiche Mayan do not even use the same consonants as Semitic languages, use preceeding adjectives, and share a few suspiciously coincidental words with Asiatic languages. That said, it's quite an impressive work of fantasy, and I mean that in a most respectful manner.If we are to be truly objective about the Book of Mormon, it must be said that it took quite an intellect to create. I know this may sound mocking, but allow me to put the writing of this book into perspective, how many first-time authors in their late teens/early twenties have dictated a great epic featuring dozens of characters that takes place over a thousand years while sticking their heads into hats? Perhaps the earlier editions were rougher, my copy is post-1970, but it must rank up there with other works from young authors such as Chris Paolini.It took a vivid imagination to write such a book. Case in point: where else do you read about Angry Jesus coming down and wreaking havoc? The individual stories and characters are fairly original and the genealogies are complex and consistent as far as I could tell (I have neither the time nor desire to examine it thoroughly). While Smith's style is a bit pompous and ponderous, compared to other works of the 1800's/early 1900's such as Crowley's \\"Book of the Law\\" and Blavatsky's wordy \\"Isis Unveiled\\" and \\"Secret Doctrine\\", it fits right in.To sum it up, if you can take the Book of Mormon objectively without a knee-jerk reaction to its religious nature (positive or negative), it's a rather decent work of fiction. The story is dull at times with annoying Biblesque tangents and anachronistic monikers for Jesus, but it's not a bad bit of writing for a first-time, basically self-published young author.

Christ would answered the woman's question, \\"How is that thou, being a Jew, asketh drink of men, which am a woman of Samaria\\" with the reply, \\"If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee eternal life.\\"Image yourself in a state of dehyration caused from countless hours of walking in a hostile terrain. The texture of your tongue tasting like cotton paste and the lips split open and bleeding from exposure to the dry wind. The heat of the day and the sound of the wind blowing offer no companionship as the sweat has stopped and the pains of kidney drive one for survival. At times, the mirage of a water provide relief too strained eyes with hopes of eager anticipation of water, but only to step aimlessly toward dry deseret. Suddenly, the sound of water is detect; scrapping feet along the unlevel surface, one stumbles towards the beautiful sound of water. Reaching the waters edge, scoups of waters can not quench the fast enough; so the urge for more water causes a change of posture to a prone position next to the earth allowing increased water intake. The quest for water was never so important. Reflection of those moments of deprivation caused a strong longing not be every return to such hostile terrain and risk water deprivation. Christ is the spiritual water to a thirst world. He understood perfected the need for man to receive the water of eternal life. Without his water we would die spiritually. The Savior distinquished between the water at Jacobs well and his spiritual water by telling the women, \\"But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.\\"Only the faithful can tap into the living spring. \\"But unto him that keepeth my commandments I will give the mysterious of my kingdom, and the same shall be in him a well of living water, springing up unto everlasting life.\\" Why are so many spiritually thirsty? They don't get to the Iron Rod which will lead them to the fountain of living water; they are blinded by the subtle craftiness of men, whereby they lie in wait to deceive, and who are only kept from the truth because they know not where to find it. The Book of Mormon is the word of God. The Book of Mormon is a second witness of Jesus Christ supporting the testimony of the Bible. The Book of Mormon teaches about the Tree of Life and the Fountain of Living water.Image arriving to the tree of life through obedience and faith and seeing the face of Jesus Christ and upon remembering the scripture of the Samaritian ask for eternal life. Would Christ at that moment of reward deprive one of the needed water? If we are worthy to see Christ we can ask for his water of eternal life? Think of the wonder relief knowing that one election is made sure, as the Lord says, \\"I will give you eternal life\\"."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"The Book of Mormon contains the writings of ancient prophets. The first of these, Lehi, lived in Jerusalem about 600 BC (around the same time of Zedekiah, King of Judah). The Lord commanded Lehi to leave Jerusalem (as it was soon afterwards destroyed by the Babylonians), and lead a small group of people to the American continent. There, they established a great civilization. God continued to call prophets among these people.The Book of Mormon is a collection of their writings - it is named after one of these prophets. If his name had been \\"Frank\\" it would be called the \\"Book of Frank.\\" Then, when missionaries came knocking on people's doors - parents would yell to their children \\"Quick, Hide, the Franks are coming!!!\\" and there would be a group of bitter \\"Anti-Franks.\\" But his name was Mormon, and it is named after him.The prophets who wrote in the Book of Mormon wrote all about Jesus Christ. They prophesied that he would come, and after his death and resurrection in Jerusalem, he appeared to his \\"other sheep\\" (john 10:16) in the American continent. There, He taught them his Gospel and formed His church among them. This book contains a record of that visit.For centuries, the truth about God's plan for us has been available primarily in the Bible. God has now given us the Book of Mormon. It stands as another witness of Jesus Christ. In the Bible, the Apostle Paul states that \\"...in the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established\\" (2 Cor 13:1)The Book of Mormon contains a promise to all who read it. The Lord has given each of a promise through the last prophet in the book that if we will read from it, ponder it, and pray about it - then God will let us know that it is true.I have had the chance to read this book several times - it helps me feel closer to God. I know that it is true because I have prayed about it. God let me know it was true :)"},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"It's sad that most of the negative reviewers will not even have read this book.

I read this book because I promised my Mormon friend I would. I love my Mormon friend to pieces, but lordy lordy, how can anyone with any intelligence see this book as a true revelation from God.I also read the Doctrine and the Covenants and The Pearl of Great Price (two more scriptures that Mormons believe in just as much as the B of M) and it is so clear that Joseph Smith was a conman, a trickster, a very dishonest man who created a religion to satisfy his narcisstic desires. The fact that he created polygamy for himself, even marrying women who already had husbands, and designed the Mormon temple ordiances with all it's secret handshakes, code words, and blood oaths, after Freemasonry. Joseph Smith was a devoted Free Mason amongst many other things,.. why the heck are these facts not in the Mormon missionary's lessons? Because they're not faith-promoting that's why.And my Mormon friend who gave me the B of M and the D and C and the P of G P, herself hardly knows the history of the Mormon church. She completely believes the Book of Mormon despite how obvious it is that Joseph Smith made it all up. And she swears on the B of M that Joseph Smith never practiced polygamy. I love my naive Mormon friend, but it's clear that all Mormons have to be this naive and blind in order to believe in such a religion. My poor friend is so sad that she hasn't been able to convert me.

In Stake High Concil Meeting last week the Stake President made a point to discuss the Church's distribution of the Book of Mormon in retail stores as a fulfillment of the promise that the Book of Mormon will flood the earth in the latter-days. He said that there are individuals who don't want the Lord's work to go on and are doing everything they can to thwart the Gospel of Jesus Christ. He said that one particular item that is causing the Bretheren concern is public message boards and book review forums such as the one at Amazon.com. He asked that we pass along the request to visit the review boards and message areas and post thoughtful and uplifting messages and reviews for those who are seeking the truth. If enough people will post uplifting messages then the anti-Mormons will get the message and stop spreading their hate. So, as a friend I am asking that each and every one of you take the time to do something positive in regards to the attacks on the Book of Mormon.

I have found the reviews below to be a great cross section of opinions and stories, not so much about this book, but about the reviewers themselves. Many seek to polarize Christians from mormons, many seek to convert others to the truthfulness of this book. As a former lapsed-mormon, I readily recognize the thesis-beating, anti-mormon angles on everything from polygamy to the drab nature of modern day sacrament meetings, to Joseph's polyandry, to the \\"evil\\" corporate structure. I smile. I love to learn about people's biases. I also reconize the stories about how this book has changed lives. It has changed mine for better and worse. Yet they are simply stories about people, not about the Book of Mormon. I look at the book of mormon support/critizism much as I look at the war in Iraq. Something has taken place in Iraq. But if you listen to CNN, you will come away with a much different story than, say, Al-Jezzira Television. And Fox will give you a much different story than Peter Jennings or Dan Rather. The NY Times a much different story than the Washington Post. All stories about the same event ,yielding vastly different interpretations,It is my contention that the stories say much more about the tellers than they do about the event. Same with the book of mormon. It is an event. It was published. It exists. It is examinable, inspectable.The Book of Mormon is what it is.People's reactions must necessarily vary in intensity and response. And many of the responses can be true at the same time, given the heart-felt state of the believer/non-believer. One approach to this book is to read everything Pro and Con about it. Get data, then decide. You'll find this approach initially invigorating and enlightening.If you are coming from an anti-approach, you'll find wonderful ammo with which to surprise the lay member of the church who is not up on history. You can build a case or story begging the question, \\"How can any half-witted dolt buy into this fabrication?\\"If you are reading for pro-mormon reasons, you'll find incredibly poor logic behind much of the attacks and will be pleasantly surprised that some of the smartest thought leaders in secular society also happen to be believing, practicing mormons, i.e. Covey, Bushman, Eyring, Orson Scott Card, and a ton of Senators, business leaders, university presidents, yale philosphy doctorates, oxford press publications, blah blah blah, etc. etc. You'll also find church owned BYU in the forefront of genetic research using scientists who believe in this stuff. In fact the first woman to graduate at the top of Harvard Law School just a few years ago was a mormon girl from Sandy, Utah. But this approach will teach you that opinion repeats itself in many different costumes, forms and levels of articulation. Data does not convice, it just makes you aware of the spectrum of opinion.Again, the Book Of Mormon is what it is. You have to develop your own response by reading it.So what does all this mean? At the very least, one must admit there is something in this book that arises passion and confusion at the same time. Something that brings it to the all time best seller list and to many \\"biggest frauds\\" lists as well.Really the only question is this: What story do you tell about this book, having really read it, and what does that story say about you? It will certainly amplify the skeptic's horse laugh. It will give the believer a real challenge to their sprituality. It will give the debunker a chance to selectively pick through the pages and build a case that reflects the internal bias of the debunker. If you come at it expecting the \\"Koran\\" of the mormons, you may find it to be so. If you happen on it without any precondtioning, without any western provincial attitudes, such as the western african nations have, then it may blow your mind and cause you to start a movement that will convert thousands, as it has. If you grew up in Salt Lake City as a non-mormon, you will certainly be very aware of how you should think of it and if you are a life long mormon it will be so ingrained in your soul you don't even notice when you are telling your own story through it's tales. Bottom line, as Joseph Campbell said, \\"Get a myth and hold on for the ride\\". Many have latched onto the mythical proposition the Book Of Mormon offers. We are all on spritual journeys, and here is a book full of stories you can adopt as your guide.All humans are built to tell stories which reflect our inner self. I feel as though I know each and every one of these reviewers, as I have walked in many of their shoes. but I do not know much more about the book of mormon by scanning the reviews. And neither do you. Read it and find your own bent, prayers or no prayers. Either way it is worth a look see.

The Story of Alma the younger is one many of us can relate to. It is the story of a wayward child and how the faith and prayers of his righteous parents have a powerful effect in his life. The Savior's visit to the ancient Americas and the establishment of His Church let each of us know of His Divine Messiahship and love for all people. Could it be that these where \\"the other sheep I have which are not of this fold\\" that he spoke of in the New Testament? The book of Mormon is truely another testament of Jesus Christ.

The author ought to refund my money."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"\\"For faith, as well intentioned as it may be, must be built on facts, not fiction - faith in fiction is a damnable false hope.\\" - Thomas EdisonMormons have faith that the Book of Mormon is true, i.e., they believe the claim of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (the LDS or Mormon church) that the Book of Mormon is an actual history of the ancient peoples of the Americas. This belief generates a feeling that the Book of Mormon is scripture, i.e., the written word of God. Mormons are indoctrinated by the LDS church to believe and feel these things.The LDS church has declared for generations that the Book of Mormon is the keystone of the Mormon faith (take away a keystone and the arch collapses). It also claims that it is the only true church of God on Earth, the only church authorized by Jesus Christ to teach his doctrines and perform the rites necessary for \\"eternal salvation\\". As well, since Joseph Smith's day, the LDS church has grown to be a multi-billion dollar religious/corporate empire. So, there's a great deal riding on the Book of Mormon being what the LDS church claims it to be.In fact, the Book of Mormon is a work of fiction, and a rather boring one (I have read it several times). For example, the phrase, \\"and it came to pass\\" is repeated 3,855 times. The LDS church's senior historian in the early 20th century, B. H. Roberts, carefully reviewed the Book of Mormon and discovered that it contained more than 100 pages worth of Biblical words and phrases. Quoting Roberts from his book, Studies of the Book of Mormon: \\"In the first place there is a certain lack of perspective in the things the book [the Book of Mormon] relates as history that points quite clearly to an undeveloped mind as their origin. The narrative proceeds in characteristic disregard of conditions necessary to its reasonableness, as if it were a tale told by a child, with utter disregard for consistency. (p. 250). That \\"child\\" was Joseph Smith, the author of the Book of Mormon.The Book of Mormon is not a true or even an allegorical history of peoples in the ancient Americas. The mountain of facts proving this statement grows larger with each new archeological, genetic, and other types of scientific discoveries. The lastest has been DNA evidence confirming that the indigenous peoples of the Americas descended from people who came from regions in Asia. The lack of bellows, steel, brass, breast plates, gold and silver currency, elephants, asses, oxen, cows and bulls, domestic goats, swine, horses, and barley (all mentioned in the Book of Mormon) in the Western Hemisphere prior to the arrival of Columbus and the subsequent European migration is strong proof that the Book of Mormon is not what the LDS church claims it to be. As well, people in the ancient Americas did not use the French word, \\"Adieu\\" (ref. Jacob 7:27), nor did they ride around in chariots (ref. 2 Nephi 12:27; Alma 18: 9,10,12 and 20:6; 3 Nephi 3:22 and 21:14).If you are going to read the Book of Mormon, bear in mind that it is used to support a fraud: Mormonism. The LDS church, aware of the scientific and other evidence that disproves its claim about the Book of Mormon, continues to use the book in an attempt to persuade people to join (and stay in) the church (and pay at least 10% of their income to the church).[...]"},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"When you faithfully give your heart, mind, and soul to an organization that you faithfully believe was a restored gospel of Jesus Christ, and then uncover all of the contradictions and lies....you can't help but \\"leave, but not leave it alone.\\" I view those still in the church kind of like I do those in an abusive relationship but don't know that they are in one. They are victims of their own ignorance. The book of Mormon is a fictional book and a boring one at that. Joseph Smith (the author) was a sick con man that has fooled millions. You'll find many mormons say that they \\"know\\" that it is true. I used to say that too before I found out the truth. Now I \\"know\\" that it's not. Don't waste your money on this book....besides, the church will give you a FREE one if you want, you'll just have to listen to some missionaries give you a sales pitch a few weeks later on how you need to give 10% of your money to the \\"Only true and living church on the face of the earth\\". If you don't you'll burn in the second coming (it's your fire insurance). Doesn't that make you feel so good inside? I can feel the burning in the boosom as we speak!

The book is exceedingly dull and insipid to read. It takes a \\"cheer squad\\" of Mormons (R.L.D.S. or L.D.S.) to work up any respect for this piece of tiresome fakery and snooze-inducing, sub-sub-standard prose, which Mark Twain so aptly called \\"chloroform in print\\".Doubleday missed an opportunity to make a trade edition available of this kinky, funky religious classic. The text which Doubleday elected to print for fully commercial distribution is the presently accepted one, copyrighted 1981, of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (L.D.S.), a text which is encrusted with editorial accretions, emendations, and changes inflicted on the torpid fustian of Joseph Smith's tortured prose, perpetuated by now across years within three consecutive centuries. There have been notable attempts to return to a more authentic text of the BoM, and Doubleday should have insisted on printing a more exact text than what is available free from the L.D.S. Mormon cult in its missionary endeavours.Atop that, Doubleday's text is visually bland, downright (and needlessly) glumly stolid. Printing the text in double columns is not at all inviting to the reader's eyes. The currently standard edition as published by the L.D.S. cult itself, in various bindings and of varying physical quality, is much more alluring to a reader's vision. It is difficult enough to trudge through Jospeh Smith's tiresome prose, turgid and pseudo-archaic in the worst way, without having to read it in a form so uninviting as on the pages of this edition.Doubleday also has published Grant Hardy's study edition of the BoM, titled \\"The Book of Mormon: a Reader's Edition\\" (ISBN 0-25207341-X) from the then official L.D.S. 1920 text, thankfully, published full page rather than in double columns. Hardy's study helps are welcome and helpful, at least from an indoctrinated L.D.S. point of view. However, the fulsome stodginess of Joseph Smith Junior's own dreadful English remains, along with the 1920 and prior L.D.S. texts' own array of alterations and emendations which had accumulated by 1920 and now by 19821 to remove the text of Smith's words from the readings of the earliest manuscripts and editions.If the reader really wants, out of a sense of cultural duty or from sheer curiosity, to read the BoM, let him at least acquire the moderately updated rendering done from a better original text, in the \\"Revised Authorized Version\\" (or \\"R.A.V.\\") of the BoM that is available as published by Herald House, thus from the official publisher of the Community of Christ (a.k.a. Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, or \\"R.L.D.S.\\"). The R.L.D.S. \\"Authorized Version\\" (or \\"A.V.\\") BoM's text (ISBN 0-83090275-0) as accepted by the Community of Christ is closer to Joseph Smith Junior's original wording, in all of its authentic turgidity, while the R.L.D.S. \\"Revised Authorized Verson\\" (the ISBN of an economical edition being 0-83090273-2) of the Community of Christ is a modest update in current modern English of the text, the latter hence being a wee bit less tedious to read than the former.If the reader simply wants to have an acquaintance with what the BoM is about, without reading its hundreds of pages of torpid prose, he can procure a breezily appealing and very thorough recast of it into the idiomatic modern English as Lynn Matthews Anderson simplifies it (working from the L.D.S. rather than from a R.L.D.S. text), somewhat abridging the bloated and overly-extended accounts of the putative narratives, visions, and discourses that fill the BoM's pages. Anderson's appealing adaptation is titled \\"Easy-to-Read Book of Mormon\\" (Estes Book Co., 1995) and is available (from Amazon or elsewhere) in a paperback edition (ISBN 0-96449570-8) as well as in an hardcover edition. For readers who wish to have a L.D.S. edition which modernises the English less drastically than Anderson recasts it, while retaining the text of the BoM more fully, a choice (as a L.D.S. alternative to Herald House R.L.D.S.' R.A.V. of the BoM in modern idiom) is \\"A Plain English Reference to the Book of Mormon\\", as Timothy B. Wilson updates Smith's English prose (Bonneville Books, 1998, ISBN 1-55517401-9).The message for the publisher of this trade edition is this: \\"Doubleday, guys, when you are ready to reprint the BoM, why not seek out a superior text in more agreeable presentation? Go to it (next time), dudes!\\"NOTA BENE: As per s.o.p., a L.D.S. Mormon (B. Robert by name) has objected that this review outmodedly reeks merely of anti-Mormon bigotry. Since L.D.S. Mormons are prone to have such knee-jerk reactions to any opinion that varies from their own cultish one, here is added to the text of this review itself part of the reply, adapted, to that reader, as follows:A secular (trade) publisher is not held to printing the current standard text of the BoM; in fact, he is not bound to print any of these three \\"standard\\" sanctioned texts of either of major Mormon groups, the two standard texts of the Community of Chirst (R.L.D.S.) or the copyrighted 1981 standard text of the L.D.S. cult; it remains true that an edition based on a more critical text would have been a better (and far more interesting) choice on the part of Doubleday. The L.D.S. cult itself is preparing critical text and variorum editions of the BoM, for that matter! Why should Doubleday at least not print, for example, a BoM according to the wording of the 1830 (1829) edition, something that would be of interest to many Mormons as well as to others?Any religious group that passes itself off as Christian but is anti-Trinitarian is a cult (so that's how as this review quite legitimately uses the term), thus the L.D.S. group is a cult, while the Trinitarian R.L.D.S. (Community of Christ) group has been a Christian denomination (or an only mildly devient Chistian sect) right from its inception, albeit one that is becoming increasing \\"liberal\\" in its drift (but is not, at least yet, a cult). Trinitarianism (the doctrine of both Christ's simultaneous divinity and humanity, within the Trinity, is among such other crucial doctrines) is not the only possible divide between Church (or denomination, sect) and cult, but it is \\"The Great Divide\\" that is what one usually confronts which makes a group cultic in essence. In addition to rejecting Trinitarianism, the L.D.S. cult embraced polytheism, so that it is not even monotheistic (and L.D.S. arguments that its Mormonism now worships only the Father, among the many gods that it teaches to exist, do not clear it of the charge of polytheism). Mormonism om its L.D.S. really has become a different world religion rather than simply an heretical varian of Christianity. That Mormonism could in its early days branch into Christian (R.L.D.S.) and pagan (L.D.S.) forms is one of the most fascinating aspects of the religion that Joseph Smith bequeathed to a suffering, conflict-besotted planet.No, there is no need to back up to the 1970s to situate this Amazon contributor's reaction. Mainstream, highly doctrinally compromised Protestant denominations may choose, from politeness or from doctrinal indifference, to refer to the L.D.S. cult as a church, but there are plenty of more doctrinally strict Christians who recognise the cult, non-Christian, indeed heathen nature of L.D.S. Mormonism. There is room to disagree about such matters, today as there was yesterday.Incidentally, personal opinion, as here, can sustain an high regard for the religiously intellectual status of both forms of Mormonism, including regularly reading scholarly L.D.S. Mormon publications, to which this writer subscribes, (e.g., \\"B.Y.U. Studies\\", all of the FARMS' serial publications, etc.), with great interest; these periodicals (and many L.D.S. books, too) very often are more rigourously learned and probing than far too many Christian publications, Protestant or Catholic are (though, of course, not thus superior to all such). When one is from an Utah family, it is not surprising that one can find L.D.S. Mormonism so inherently interesting. This contributor has taken care to warn, in several Amazon reviews, that a Christian zealot under-estimates the sophistication of Mormonism to his own peril, especially in apologetic interchanges. It is no compromise of Christian principle to insist on NOT misrepresenting what Mormons believe. The truth about L.D.S. Mormonism is of sufficient concern to a believing Christian that he has no need to distort what Mormonism really does teach and practise. To misrepresent Mormonism is usually either a sign of intellectual dishonesty (and hence, of uncharitable contempt) or of ignorance of Mormonism's own sources and of other more honest Protestant and Catholic evaluations of Mormonism. Neither is it contradictory for a believing Christan to hold a VERY high regard for Mormon accomplishments, artistically, academically, and in other ways. Modern-day L.D.S. Mormonism indeed, fuguratively speaking, has made a silk purse out of the sow's ear of the religion that Joseph Smith Junior founded, as he, Brigham Young, and other L.D.S. Mormon founders formulated it."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"This book has changed my life, helped me find Christ, helped me become a better, father, husband, friend and employee.

Now that I have read the book and compared it to Smith's book, \\"The Doctrine and Covenants\\", I sadly must conclude the Book of Mormon is nineteenth century literature.If you are looking for some spiritual insight, here are some nice passages. 2 Nephi Chapter 2 has an interesting messianic discussion about opposition in all things. Mosiah Chapters 2-3 have a nice discussion about serving others. Alma Chapter 5 has nice language of having \\"God's image\\" engraven in one's countenance. The visit of Jesus of Nazareth, in 3 Nephi Chapters 9-27, however, was too clever by half and too much like Matthew 5-6, including translation errors that crept into the New Testament texts after the autographs were written in the late first and early second centuries CE.What I found odd but subtle was Smith's doctrinal evolution in the text even as he dictated it. Smith wrote, \\"... God doth not walk in crooked paths ... nor doth he vary from that which he hath said ....\\" (D&C; 3:2). But both the Book of Mormon and the Book of Doctrine and covenants show Smith's changing doctrine.Just take Smith's early ritual of becoming a Mormon convert.Regarding the early evolution of Smith's conversion ritual, his written record probably began in the summer of 1828. Smith wrote a definition of Jesus' doctrine that had two elements:Behold, this is my doctrine-whosoever (1) repenteth and (2) cometh unto me, the same is my church. Whosoever declareth more or less than this, the same is not of me, but is against me; therefore he is not of my church.(D&C; 10: 67-68. Notations added). In this passage, there are two elements that were exclusive to the ritual. The inclusive/exclusive declaration, \\"more or less than this, the same is not of me\\" etc. implicitly excluded everything else. Baptism was not one of the two elements.The King Benjamin \\"camp meeting\\" in the Book of Mormon was probably Smith's next expression of a conversion ritual:O (1) have mercy, and apply the atoning blood of Christ that we may receive forgiveness of our sins, and our hearts may be purified; (2) for we believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who created heaven and earth, and all things; who shall come down among the children of men.(Mosiah 4:2. Notations added). The people's invocation was effective as their two-element ritual, sans baptism, achieved a remission of their sins:\\"And it came to pass that after they had spoken these words the Spirit of the Lord came upon them, and they were filled with joy, having received a remission of their sins, and having peace of conscience, because of the exceeding faith which they had in Jesus Christ who should come, according to the words which King Benjamin had spoken unto them.\\"(Mosiah 4:3). Baptism does not appear anywhere in the corpus of King Benjamin's discourses. Baptism's absence in King Benjamin's doctrine was justified by the people's on-the-spot remission of their sins, and the absence of baptism was implicitly defended by King Benjamin's inclusive/exclusive statement:[N]either are there any conditions whereby man can be saved except the conditions which I have told you.(Mosiah 4:8). This, statement, spoken immediately after the people had received a remission of their sins, qualifies as the inclusive/exclusive declaration element of the conversion ritual that I noted in D&C;, section 10. Perhaps not coincidentally, the statement appears to exclude baptism a requirement for salvation.But back to the subject of conversion, a small step had been taken toward forming an institutional religion, because King Benjamin \\"thought it was expedient . . . that he should take the names of all those who had entered into a covenant with God . . .\\" (Mosiah 6:1). However, there was no formal organization that was joined as a direct result of his people's epiphany.Smith next articulated a conversion ritual with Alma the Elder's charismatic-authority behavior at the Waters of Mormon. An informal statement of requirements for this conversion ritual is found in Mosiah 18: The people must (1) be desirous to come to the fold of God (v. 8), (2) be called his people (v. 8), (3) be willing to bear one another's burdens . . . and mourn etc. (v. 8-9), and (4) stand as witnesses etc. (v. 9).Of special note is baptism. Baptism was added, not as an integral part of Alma's conversion ritual, but as an invitation to the newly converted to show God a sign of their covenant. Thus, an evolutionary step toward including baptism occurred in the conversion ritual:\\"Now I say unto you, if this be the desire of your hearts, what have you against being baptized in the name of the Lord, as a witness before him that ye have entered into a covenant with him, that ye will serve him and keep his commandments, that he may pour out his Spirit more abundantly upon you?\\"(Mosiah 18:10). A new, but optional element in the conversion ritual was baptism in the name of the Lord. It is interesting that Alma the Elder baptized himself once (Mosiah 18:14) by his charismatic authority. It is also interesting that a certain quantity of \\"his Spirit\\" (Mosiah 18:10) appears to be an enabling event for authority. (\\"O Lord, pour out thy Spirit upon thy servant, that he may do this work with holiness of heart.\\" Mosiah 18:12).The book of 3 Nephi, chapter 11 is Smith's next expression of a conversion ritual. This one included baptism. Further, there is a three-element inclusive/exclusive declaration that cannot be reconciled with the two-element inclusive/exclusive declarations in D&C; 10 and Mosiah 4.3 Nephi 11:31. \\"Behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, I will declare unto you my doctrine. 32 And this is my doctrine, and it is the doctrine which the Father hath given unto me; and I bear record of the Father, and the Father beareth record of me, and the Holy Ghost beareth record of the Father and me; and I bear record that the Father commandeth all men, everywhere, to(1) repent and(2a) believe in me. 33. And whoso believeth in me, and is(3) baptized, the same shall be saved; and they are they who shall inherit the kingdom of God. 34. And whoso believeth not in me, and is not baptized, shall be damned . . . .37. And again I say unto you, ye must(1) repent, and(2b) become as a little child, and(3) be baptized in my name, or ye can in nowise receive these things. . . .(inclusive/exclusive declaration) 40. And whoso shall declare more or less than this, and establish it for my doctrine, the same cometh of evil, and is not built upon my rock; but he buildeth upon a sandy foundation, and the gates of hell stand open to receive such when the floods come and the winds beat upon them.\\"(3 Nephi 11:31-40, notations and emphases added). This passage was probably written after the summer of 1828 CE, when D&C; 10 was written. But it was obviously written before the Book of Mormon manuscript went to the printer.A possible insight as to why Smith added baptism to a previously required two-element conversion ritual is that there may have been some uncertainty in his own mind, or disagreement with others or even perhaps in the community generally, over which elements were necessary for conversion. Hence, Jesus is quoted in 3 Nephi as saying:\\"And according as I have commanded you thus shall ye baptize. And there shall be no disputations among you, as there have hitherto been; neither shall there be disputations among you concerning the points of my doctrine, as there have hitherto been.\\"(3 Nephi 11:28, emphasis added). Since we are to presume that in the year 34 BCE that Jesus uttered the three-element conversion ritual, in 3 Nephi 11, Smith was misquoting Jesus in 1828 C.E. when Smith pronounced the two-element conversion ritual in D&C; 10. Otherwise, it was not \\"from God's mouth to Smith's ear\\" in the summer of 1828 C.E.One might put the case that the two-element conversion rituals of King Benjamin and Alma the Elder were defective, i.e. Mormon simply compiled them as he read them, and Jesus cleared up the confusion when he appeared in 34 C.E. However, this theory breaks down because the two-element conversion ritual in D&C; 10 appeared in 1828; D&C; 10 is a contemporaneous writing with the dictation of the identical two-element conversion ritual of King Benjamin in Mosiah 4. No significant revision of D&C; 10 has occurred to amend its two-element conversion ritual, or the King Benjamin conversion ritual for that matter.I have learned, from faithful Mormon scholars that the books of 1st and 2nd Nephi were written by Smith after the book of 3rd Nephi was dictated. Therefore, the conversion ritual in 2 Nephi 31:10-12 was written after the conversion ritual in 3 Nephi 11. Hence, the next conversion ritual written by Smith was:\\"And he said unto the children of men: (1)Follow thou me [believe]. . . . And the Father said: (2) Repent ye and (3) be baptized in the name of my Beloved Son. . . . Wherefore . . . I know that if ye shall follow the Son, with full purpose of heart . . . witnessing unto the Father that ye are willing to take upon you the name of Christ by baptism . . . .\\"(2 Nephi 31:10-12, notations added). Where is the inclusive/exclusive declaration? It appears as a statement that baptism is not optional:\\"And now, if the Lamb of God, he being holy, should have need to be baptized by water, to fulfill all righteousness, O then, how much more need have we, being unholy, to be baptized, yea, even by water!\\"(2 Nephi 31:5). Here, there are the three elements as in the previous pronouncement of 3 Nephi 11, and the older and weaker pronouncement of Alma the Elder in Mosiah 18, in which baptism was an appendage to the ritual. But now, baptism had become indispensable. The commentary, \\"witnessing unto the Father that ye are willing to take upon you the name of Christ by baptism\\" was a foreshadowing of what followed.Later, Smith wrote D&C; 20:37, which explained the manner of conversion. Did this passage have an inclusive/exclusive declaration? Yes. It appears as an echo of his earlier thought processes. His new conversion ritual was \\"given by way of commandment\\" (ibid.). The phrase \\"given by way of commandment\\" reflected the earlier inclusive/exclusive declarations such as \\"more or less than this cometh of evil\\". The elements in Smith's latest conversion ritual were that persons:\\"(1) humble themselves before God,(2) desire to be baptized,(3) come forth with broken hearts and contrite spirits,(4) witness before the Church that they have truly repented of all their sins,(5) are willing to take upon them the name of Jesus Christ,(6) having a determination to serve him to the end,(7) truly manifest by their works that they have received of the Spirit of Christ unto the remission of their sins, and accordingly they(8) shall be received by baptism into his church.\\"Smith's two-element conversion rituals (Mosiah 4 and D&C; 10) condemned his three-element conversion rituals (Mosiah 18, 3 Nephi 11 and 2 Nephi 31) and vice versa. Additionally, the two-element conversion rituals of Mosiah 4 and D&C; 10, condemned Alma the Elder's multiple-element conversion ritual (Mosiah 18) that added baptism, even though it was an act after conversion ritual had been completed. And all of these conversion rituals, condemn what is probably the current Mormon scriptural conversion ritual; D&C; 20:37.This review leaves me wondering what could possibly be meant by \\"... neither doth [God] vary from that which he hath said ....\\" (D&C; 3:2).Thus, there is an end to the early evolution of the Mormon conversion ritual.Salvation RequirementsBut the requirements for a Mormon to achieve salvation were another matter that was closely related to the conversion ritual. King Benjamin had not mentioned baptism as an element of salvation, but he had mentioned\\"salvation might come to him that should put his trust in the Lord, and should be diligent in keeping his commandments, and continue in faith even unto the end of his life . . . \\"(Mosiah 4:6). Thus, although baptism of course is not mentioned by King Benjamin, the two elements that were mentioned were to (1) \\"trust in the Lord\\" and (2) \\"continue in faith even unto the end of his life\\".Chronological parallels to King Benjamin's declarations of salvation requirements, were set forth in the 1833 Book of Commandments (\\"BC\\") First, a revelation given in April 1829 was published as section V:\\"... Say nothing but repentance unto this generation ....\\" (Book of Commandments 'BC', V:4, D&C; 6:9),and\\" ... If thou wilt do good, yea and hold out faithful to the end, thou shalt be saved in the kingdom of God, which is the greatest of all the gifts of God; for there is no gift greater than the gift of salvation.\\" (BC V:5, D&C; 6:13).This salvation-without-baptism concept is repeated in BC XII (June, 1829), where it states:\\"... and if ye keep my commandments, and endure to the end, you shall have eternal life; which gift is the greatest of all the gifts of God.\\" (BC XII:3, D&C; 14:7).A distinct change occurs, however, in the Book of Mormon between Smith's dictation of King Benjamin's address and that in Second Nephi. Baptism has been added as a requirement for salvation in 2 Nephi 31:\\"for my soul delighteth in plainness (v. 3) ... If ye shall follow the Son ... by baptism ... then shall ye receive the Holy Ghost .... (v. 13).\\"And to emphasize that the entire salvation package is contained in this ritual that includes baptism, it states further in verses 21-22:\\"And now ... this is the way; and there is none other way nor name given under heaven whereby man can be saved in the kingdom of God. And now, behold, this is the doctrine of Christ, and the only and true doctrine of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, which is one God, without end. Amen.\\"The \\"only and true doctrine of the Father\\" statement is probably an echo of Smith's inclusive/exclusive declarations regarding the conversion ritual, but now it is applied to salvation requirements.It is notable that Smith used the terms salvation and eternal life synonymously.Once Smith's church became more established, Smith contradicted all previous pronouncements in his \\"Lectures on Faith.\\" In Lecture Sixth. Of Faith, salvation required the sacrifice of all things:Let us here observe, that a religion that does not require the sacrifice of all things, never has the power sufficient to produce the faith necessary unto life and salvation . . .(Book of Doctrine and Covenants (1835) page 50). This was very different from any of Smith's previous declarations of salvation rituals. The \\"atoning blood\\" (Mosiah 4) of Christ was marginalized with respect to an individual's salvation. Smith's adherents had to manage open-ended requirements to \\"sacrifice all things\\" to Smith's religion for life and salvation. And Smith's religion at that time was called \\"Church of the Latter-day Saints\\" (Book of Doctrine and Covenants, title page. 1835).I have tried to be thorough. My favorite \\"fun\\" passage in this book is \\"and as for myself, to me he doth not stink.\\" (Alma 19:5)"},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"This is one of the most powerful books you will ever read.

The Lamanites, who are present day Native Americans, carried with them some of the stories contain in this book, but they have some changes made over time because they weren't hid and were open to changes in oral tradition and Aztec government. Any way, one story (which was written by Ixtlilxochitl in the late 16th century from ancient hieroglyphic writtings pased down from his ancestors), about Quetzalcoatl, is about a white skinned, bearded man who wore a robe who taught them doctrine to live happily and gave good laws of virture and deed. It is also stated in this Aztec account that he'd come again to visit them, and when Cortez arrived, they mistook him for Christ). Interestingly, Christ, in the Book of Mormon, shows himself to the people in the Americas after he is resurrected and taught them. Coincidence?

I felt inspired to place a copy of the Book of Mormon on my dash and when I did so, the air conditioning started working again.Once I got out of school and found a real job, I had the opportunity to work with several Native Americans. It was my great blessing to be able to share with them the joy of knowing that due to the promises of this book they can someday become a pure and delightsome people if they will only forsake the pagan traditions of their ancestors and embrace this book. God truly loves them! I can remember when President Kimball showed a picture of some of the Lamanites who had become whiter due to their participation in the church's placement program. It was such a strong testimony to me of God's love. I am assuming that the same promise applies to African Americans as well but I don't know for sure. I hope so because God obviously loves all of his children, even those that he turned black because of the indiscretions of their ancestors.I have been trying to heed the prophet's counsel to share the Book of Mormon with everyone. We live in a very industrious neighborhood that has lots of families from India as well as several Jewish families. It was really great to be able to take them a Book of Mormon when we went caroling the other night. It's just so sad that they don't celebrate Christmas, but I'm sure Jesus loves them even though they may not respect him. I think the days of the scourging of the Jews as mentioned in the Book of Mormon is finally over.One thing that was neat about sharing the Book of Mormon with the families from India... They are not United States citizens (here on work visa--don't worry they're not illegal aliens!!) so they don't fully appreciate the Book of Mormon promises that God has made to citizens of this country. I told them how lucky they were to be able to live here (especially in this last dispensation!) and that their ending up in our country was likely a sign of their being more worthy of those blessings than others due to their actions in the pre-existence.The last thing I want to share is that I've been sending lots of copies of the Book of Mormon to our troops overseas. Most of them are unaware of the protection offered to those who believe in the teachings of the book. I know some of our troops are concerned that they do not have adequate protection/armaments in their defense of freedom. I know that (like Helaman's Stripling Warriors) their belief in the Book of Mormon would be a much greater protection against death or physical harm than any supplies our government might provide.I only rate this book as 4 stars because the Isaiah chapters are hard to understand but that is a failing on my part more than anything else.

It is a complimentary book to the Bible. It contains real accounts of prophets and their prophecies of Christ. These prophets declared to the people of the Americas that the Son of God would visit them as well as He did those in Jerusalem after His ressurection, and then gives an account of this visit. It is a true book. I invite you to read it and ponder it and even pray about it."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"This book will be one of the most important books you will ever read!!

It reads much like the Bible, of course, but follows more of a constant storyline. There is much to be learned from these pages, about life, love, pride and war. If you want to read this book as a work of fiction, then do that. You will enjoy it. If you want to read it as the word of God, then do that, and you will enjoy it. It's a great story, and one that will make you think, and think again, and you will never forget that you've read it."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"Preeminent among the precious truths presented within the Book of Mormon is its sure testimony that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God. He was crucified and then resurrected as an immortal being. He lives today!Over and over, the prophets in the Book of Mormon teach us of the divinity of Christ and His character. For example, one prophet says, \\"And we talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, and we write according to our prophecies, that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins.\\" (2 Nephi 25:26)As someone who has read this book many times, I can testify that it contains many great truths revealed by the Lord to his prophets.The Book of Mormon is for people from every nation. This book is scripture, translated by Joseph Smith, Jr. by the gift and power of God. I have personally obtained this witness, as you and others can, as is promised in the latter part of this book: \\"And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you by the power of the Holy Ghost.\\" (Moroni 10:4)"},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I've read this book many times since I was a child and have found it to be exciting, interesting, and a source of truth. It compliments and enriches the Bible. For instance, why was Christ baptized? See 2 Nephi chapter 31. The fall of Adam and the redemption from the fall by Jesus--see 2 Nephi chapter 2. An eyewitness testimony of divinity of Jesus Christ--see 3 Nephi chapters 11-26. Almost every aspect of the gospel is addressed.This is an amazing book and I believe that it is a gift from God."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"It should be painfully obvious by now that an organized effort is taking place here by disaffected ex-Mormons to write as many negative reviews as possible, and give positive marks to those reviews. In fact, on one well-trafficked web board, those who claim to be \\"recovering\\" from Mormonism have openly encouraged this.It's shameful because what should be a forum for honest review has been hijacked and turned into a petty stunt to make the Book of Mormon and the LDS Church look bad. Typically \\"recovery\\" includes coming to terms with pain and anger; instead we see a childish attempt to hurt others because they have been hurt. Amazon should examine its review process to account for such activities.Strangely enough, the critics who claim Mormons are ignorant sheep are now asking you, the reader, to take their word for it -- to be one of their \\"sheep\\" -- and not even bother to read the Book of Mormon. An honest critic would invite people to experience for themselves and find out if a work is good or bad.So, in the spirit of free inquiry, I recommend the Book of Mormon to all readers. I have found it inspired and inspiring."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I received my first copy of the Book of Mormon at age eight in 1949 from my devoutedly Catholic grandfather. He knew of my interest in religion and in religious texts, especially the Bible, which I had already read. My appreciation for the Book of Mormon has grown over the years, particularly as I discover that many of its aspects were known in antiquity but had disappeared from the Christian world of 1830, when Joseph Smith translated the book into English. Despite its naysayers (many of whom will undoubtedly have their say on this web site), the Book of Mormon is, after the Bible, the most widely-distributed book in the world, with some 8 million new copies coming off the press each year. Millions of people have found Christ through the Book of Mormon, thus fulfilling its purpose to testify \\"that JESUS is the CHRIST, the ETERNAL GOD, manifesting himself unto all nations.\\"John A. TvedtnesInstitute for the Study and Preservation of Ancient Religious Texts, Brigham Young University"},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"Do not deny the writings of the Book of Mormon.2 Nephi 33:11,1411. And if they are not the words of Christ, judge ye-for Christ will show unto you, with power and great glory, that they are his words, at the last day; and you and I shall stand face to face before his bar; and ye shall know that I have been commanded of him to write these things, notwithstanding my witness.14.And you that will not part of the goodness of God, and respect the words of the Jews, and also my words, and the words which shall proceed forth out of the mouth of the Lamb of God, behold, I bid you an everlasting farewell, for these words shall condemn you at the last day.Jesus Christ will prove the Book of Mormon words are true with great power and glory at the last days. Jesus Christ will be our judge and He will judge all mankind. Jesus Christ admonishes the righteous saint to continue in righteousness, be faithful, and endure to the end. Jesus Christ convincingly warns the wicked to repent, stop hating Him, cease from rebellion, and seek admission into the Kingdom of God. The contest is between the unbelievers and the Lord; the Lord says He will prove the words of the Book of Mormon are true with great power and glory; the unbeliever will be without defense, as the power and glory of the Lord is manifest: the innocent will be vindicated, the saints will be quickened, and the wicked destroyed with fire.Moroni 10:2727. And I exhort you to remember these things; for the time speedily cometh that ye shall know that I lie not, for ye shall see me at the bar of God; and the Lord God will say unto you: Did I not declare my words unto you, which were written by this man, like as one crying from the dead, yea, even as one speaking out of the dust.Moroni also testifies that he will be a witness at Judgment that the Word of Christ written in the Book of Mormon is true. The punishment of the law demands that Justice is not robbed. Moroni teaches that those who die in their sins will not escape justice through the mercy of Jesus Christ. Instead, the word and law of Christ as described in the Book of Mormon will bear testimony against their sins and justice will claim the creature. Thus these words are a sharp rebuke for the wicked to repent and avoid the awful monster of justice. Ignorance is not a defense against the claims of breaking the law. Today is a day of probation, a time to prepare to meet God, a time to repent. Failure to read and study the Book of Mormon is no justification to escape the laws binding to the inhabitants of this earth. Therefore, both member and nonmember are under condemnation and if they do not study and apply the teachings of the Book of Mormon.2 Nephi 28:2929.Wo be unto him that shall say: We have received the word of God, and we need no more of the word of God, fore we have enough.Whenever, the Lord uses the word, \\"wo\\", he indicates a sharp warning; a warning so severe that if this is ignored the wrath of God and calamities of the wicked are sure to follow.2 Nephi 29:3-11 \\"A Bible, we have got a Bible, and we need no more Bible\\".The Lord teaches that in the mouth of two or more witnesses the truth is established God does not favor one nation over another; he is no respecter of person. The canon of scriptural writings will prove that God is the same yesterday, today, and tommorow, unalterable and unchangeable.Ether 12:23-27 \\"Lord, the Gentiles will mock at these things, because of our weakness in writing, for Lord thou has made us mighty in word by faith\\", \\"I fear the gentiles will mock us at our words\\" 26. And when I had said this, the Lord spake unto me saying, Fools mock, but they shall mourn; and my grace is sufficient for the meek, that shall take no advantage of your weakness;The wisdom of the wise shall perish; the learned, who hearken not to the Lord will fall; and the meek shall inherit the earth. I believe in the prophecy that the meek inheriting the earth also suggests they will receive their celestial inheritance. Interestingly, the meek will be blessed with the grace of God, to understand the words of the Book of Mormon.Mormon 8:16-1716. \\"And blessed be he that shall bring this thing to light; for it shall be brought out of darkness unto light, according to the word of God; yea, it shall be brought out of the earth, and it shall shine forth out of darkness, and come unto the knowledge of the people; and it shall be done by the power of God.\\"17. \\"He that condemneth, let him be aware lest he shall be in danger of hell fire.\\"The Book of Mormon is not to be condemned. Those who choose to condemn the Book of Mormon rashly tempt God, or smiteth the righteous bring Judgment against themselves.Oppose and resist secret combinations.Ether 8:18-26. \\"Murder for gain is abominable to the Lord\\". Mormon 8:26-41.The cries of the slain saints will cry up for Justice and the Lord will be unable to turn a deaf earth to their cries. The wrath of God will sweep the wicked from the earth. We are to hope that there is sufficient time for the wicked to repent before the great and dreadful day of the Lord. Time is mercy because it give the wicked an opportunity to see the error of their ways, the lack of fruit in the lies they believe, and the craftiness and deceptions of man. The wild branches needs time to be grafted into the tame fruit of the tree and start producing good fruit.The Book of Mormon is a type of our Day. Murder for gain or theft is the driving force behind war. Scarcity is the product of war and not the forces of free market systems. Righteous moral belief systems abhor war and consider its methods and affects, evil. I do not believe Jesus delights in the conflicts and wars of men. I do not believe that in the last century man has been justified in the cause of war. I say where is the reveal justification that the Lord is command man to fight and kill? Men fight because they have forgotten the teachings of Jesus. Listen to the anquish of Momon:Mormon 6: 17-2217. O ye fair ones, how could ye have departed from the ways of the Lord! O ye fair ones, how could ye have rejected that Jesus, who stood with open arms to receive you!18. Behold, if ye have done this, ye would have not fallen. But hehold, ye are fallen, and I mourn your loss.19. O ye fair sons and daughters, ye fathers and mothers, ye husbands and wives, ye fair ones, how is it that ye could have fallen!20. But hehold, ye are gone, and my sorrows cannot bring your return21. And the day cometh that your mortal must put on immortality, and these bodies which are now moldering in corruption must soon become incorruptible bodies; and then ye must stand before the judgment-seat of Christ, to be judged according to your works; and if it so be that ye are righteous, then are ye blessed with your fathers who have gone before you.22. O that ye had repented before this great destruction had come upon you. But behold ye are gone and the Father yea the Eternal Father of heaven knoweth your state; and he doeth with you according to his justice and mercy.Pride leads to the fall of civilizations.Moroni 8:27 Pride destroyed the Nephites.2 Nephi 28:15-16 The proud are puffed up, they teach false doctrines, commit whoredoms, and pervert the right way of the Lord. The proud are full of iniquity and ripe for destruction. The rotten fruit analogy versuses the beautiful fruit analogy should be a point of focus. The righteous have radiant countenances, bright and illuminated like the crystal lights of a beautiful light. The righteous radiate with happiness, contentment, and intelligence and they are a delight to behold. The fruit of the tree can be directly witnesses by the countenances of the righteous saint. There inner light is so transparent that all can see and glorify our father, in heaven. In contrast the rotten fruit demonstrates a countenance of anger, pride, arrogance, and decept. A rotten fruit can not bring forth good fruit.Alma 32:14 Blessed are those that are not compelled to be humble.Pride leads to the fall because a untrue hypothesis is undefeatable and irrational. The mind can not grasp and sustain a lie indefinitely. The pain associated with embracing a lie will eventually cause the individual too abandon the lie. Interestingly, as the group discovers and abandons the lie often in force. As true is revealed, a stronger and more compelling force substitutes and dissolves the lie. The power of the true is so tremendous that complete systems based on pride will dissolve instantaneously. The either means the system repented and turned from their error or they were destroyed. Now, Jesus Christ understands our case and has pleads for us. If we will discover the truth, we will find that Jesus has been careful orchestrating events designed to assist in our success, all along. Destruction only occurs when the fruit is rotten and the devil has seal these servants as his own. At that point, there is not use in trying to redeem the bad fruit. The fruit is only salvageable in the early stages of sin.The Lord warns against the curse of unbelief.Mormon 9:7-10 The Lord speaks against those who deny the revelations of God telling them if they willfully deny revelations, prophecies, gifts, healing, speaking in tongues, and interpretation of tongues, then they must think God is a changeable God. Furthermore, these individuals must think God is not a God of miracles. Therefore, they deny that the power of God exists.Mormon 9: 15-21 \\"Miracles cease because of unbelief\\"Moroni 7:37-38 \\"It is by faith that miracles are wrought\\". Men have faith in Jesus Christ because of their meekness; if we do not have faith in Jesus Christ then we are not fit for membership in his church. Moroni 10:24-34 \\"If the day comes that the power and gifts of God are done away with\\" it will because of unbelief and those that do good possess the gift and power of God to act.30. And again I would exhort you that ye would come unto Christ, and lay hold upon every good gift, and touch not the evil gift, nor the unclean thing.31. And awake, and arrive from the dust, O Jerusalem; yea, and put on thy beautiful garments, O daughter of Zion; and strengthen thy stakes and enlarge thy borders forever.The priesthood is the power and glory of God manifest through the actions of worthy priesthood holders. The glory of God is intelligence. Priesthood holders are too act and not be acted upon. A good measure of faith is required too act. A priesthood holder should \\"Invoke\\" the powers of heaven rather than passively request assistance. The priests of Levi exercised great faith by stepping into the waters of the Jordon before the river parted and they crossed over dry ground. Faith must proceed the miracle.Mormon 9:2,5 (To the unbeliever) 2. Behold, will ye believe in the day of your visitation-behold, when the Lord shall come, yea, even that great day when the earth shall be rolled together as a scroll, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, yea, in the great day when ye shall be brought to stand before the Lamb of God-then will ye say there is not God?5. For behold, when ye shall be brought to see your nakeness before God, and also the glory of God, and the holiness of Jesus Christ, it will kindle a flame of unquenchable fire upon you.6. O then ye unbelieving, turn ye unto the Lord; cry mightily unto the Father in the name of Jesus, that perhaps ye may be found spotless, pure, fair, and white, having been cleansed by the blood of the Lamb, at the great last day.Mormon 5:22-2422. And they, O ye Gentiles, how can ye stand before the power of God, except ye shall repent and turn from your evil ways?23. Know ye not that ye are in the hands of God? Know ye not that he hath all power, and at his great command the earth shall be rolled together as a scroll?24. Therefore, repent ye, and humble yourselves before him, lest he shall come out in justice against you-lest a remnant of the seed of Jacob shall go forth among you as a lion, and tear you in pieces, and there is none to deliver.In SummaryThe message of the Book of Mormon: 1. Deny not the power of God 2. Jesus is the Christ 3. Beware of Pride 4. Flee from the wickedness of secret combinations 5. Repent and be baptized. 6.

The book gives a historical account of the earliest inhabitants of the Americas, who are of middle-Eastern descent. It chronicles the social, political and religious practices of this people, their wars and contentions, and ultimately the rise and fall of an entire civilization.The historical portions of the Book of Mormon, however, serve only to provide a background of events to its primary purpose, which is the interaction between God and the early inhabitants of these continents. The chapters detail miraculous experiences and great prosperity when the people live in righteousness, and the great chaos and destruction that occurs when they choose to disobey the prophets called to warn them of their pending destruction.The penultimate experience is the account given of the appearance of Jesus Christ to this people shortly after his ascension to Heaven after His crucifixion. According to the prophet Nephi, the Savior dwelled with this people for a period of time, called apostles and organized His church among the people.The teachings and stories in the Book of Mormon are fascinating from many points of view, whether religious, political, historical or for education. Regardless of why you choose to read the Book of Mormon, one thing is certain: you will have a much better understanding of the purpose of life, of life after death, and the true account of the original inhabitants of the American continents."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I am so thankful for the Book of Mormon.

They are scared to death that a person may actually read the Book of Mormon and find out for themselves that it is a true account of an ancient spiritual people who left Jerusalem around the year 600 B.C. and arrived by boat somewhere in Central America. The most significant part is when the risen Jesus Christ visits and teaches this people after his death.Is it so hard to believe that there are additional records of scripture not found in the New and Old Testament? We know for a fact that there are many books which were not included into the Bible (the bible wasn't put together until the 4th century A.D. by Bishop Eusebius. The Apostles who wrote the books were not around to say what should go into its compilation. So anyone claiming that when the Book of Revelations states \\"not to add to this book,\\" saying it means there should never be additional scripture, is very uneducated and misinformed since Revelations was written before the New Testament was even around and chronologically would not even be the last book.)The Book of Mormon is an amazing additional testament to the Old and New Testaments that has helped millions to learn and know more about Jesus and his teachings and solidify that he is the Christ."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I can promise you that if you will read this book and then pray to God - the Father of all, the God of Abraham and Issac- about what you have read and the truths contained therein,He will send a feeling of warmth and peace, a feeling that only He can send.

Mormom is simply the man who collaborated multiple books into one. Every single event mentioned in the Book of Mormon really did happen. The verses are very clear about who is to be worshipped- Jesus Christ.The message is simply this: Serve others as Christ has served you. We are all children of God, and we all chose to come down to earth to prove ourselves worthy to live in the Celestial Kingdom and hopefully make planets of our own one day. Life doesn't end when our body dies. Our spirit lives on. We continue to grow and learn. But what we do now determines where we end up after death. For eternity. So there's no turning back and saying &quot;We'll I didn't really mean to do that. Do you think you could just ignore that one mistake?&quot; But by then it's too late. That's why Christ came.

Who knows, maybe LDS is the new Catholic...I agree with other comments that the merits of the Book of Mormon should be considered independently from whichever side of the fence you side on doctrinally. As literature the book is rather stunning really. I would submit that if this book is not the word of God, Joseph Smith deserves the apologies of English Literature programs across the nation. If this is merely good fiction then the book has been grossly underrated. You only need to read several pages to get a sense of how difficult writing such a text would be, especially for a third grade educated farm boy in 1820. In that sense, I don't understand how anyone can give it a one star rating. It's either God's word (5 stars) or one of the most massive literary products in US history (5 stars).Either way, a one star rating on here seems like sour grapes.

I would encourage all to read it, and ponder its message."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I am over 40 years of age and for years I searched many churches looking for the right church. After reading The Book of Mormon I knew I found home. I did as Moroni asked (Moroni 10:4-5) and I said a prayer with a sincere heart and received my answer. The Book of Mormon is another testimony of Jesus Christ. After you read the Bible then the Book of Mormon you will see how the two go together. The history is so fasinating of our ancestors. If one researches the Book of Mormon you will understand all about the prophets. Please keep an open mind when reading this book. If one really loves the Lord then why not see what HE has to say to other prophets of old? Thank you for reading this and I pray that you get your answers."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"When a single book has the power to influence the behavior of millions of rational, well educated people, it's worth reading -- if for no other purpose than to see what the fuss is all about.I am a fairly well educated person (two graduate degrees) who tends to be clear-headed about life. Reading the Book of Mormon gave me a whole new understanding about the relationship of man and God. The experience was transcendent. As a result of that reading, I have chosen to be a devout Latter-day Saint, with all that entails.This book is not for the timid or the weak-minded. It will challenge the very core of your being.What you do as a result of the experience of reading the book is between you and God. But for better or worse, read it."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"Just like all religious texts, this one is a tool. Not a tool to bash into people's heads...nor a tool to look over to sharply. It may help you...it may not. It may be your &quot;Bible&quot;...it may be your &quot;Archie Comic,&quot; either way it means something to someone. So don't bring up any religious dogma to a book review.The idea presented in this book is simple...one idea that trancends all things: love eachother. That's all you need to know. Everything else just highlights the point...sorry if I gave away the ending.:)The Book of Mormon = A toolDoes it need to be anything else?"},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"For those who don't know, The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ, is comparable to the Bible and is written by many prophets. In the Editorial Review section, a thorough explaination is included as well as the testimony of those who saw the book (12 all together, if Joseph Smith is counted). The Book contains many doctrinal treasures, eloquent prose as well as poetry and is well organized. The prophets utilized many complex writing forms, and each prophet has something to contribute. I highly recommend reading the record of Jesus' visit to the American Continent as well as King Benjamin's speech. For those who would like evidence for authenticity, there is plenty. LDS scholars answer critics regularly. I have a college education and understand logical fallacies, and I say that the LDS responses and proofs are more than adequate to satisfy one's need for reasons to believe. The botom line is that this is the most important book to emerge, since the Bible. This is a great way to build a relationship with Father in Heaven. I believe this book can benefit anyone who reads it sincerely wanting to understand."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"And yet, it purports to be the revealed word of God. Aside from the really bad literary style (Mark Twain was being kind when he called it Chloroform in print) the Book of Mormon is so obviously fiction that nobody with any knowledge could believe in it. Consider:-Read Ether 9 verses 17-19. There are 13 specific items listed here as having been owned by the &quot;Jaredites&quot;, pre-Columbian Jewish residents of the new world. Of those 13 items, only 2 (Gold and Silver) existed in Pre-Columbian America. To assert that Elephants, Horses, Silk etc. were here at that time flies in the face of all that has been learned about the Americas in the past 5 centuries. It is patently false.-The final battles scene where everyone is wiped out. I've read a bit about military history. With any slight knowledge of the ebb and flow of battle, one realizes that any battle or war will end with one side or the other losing completely, unless they can come to some kind of terms or escape. There is a cascading effect. As one side loses it has fewer resources, so it loses more. So the battle will end in complete victory for one side, utter defeat for the other. Yet in the Book of Mormon you have millions of people, even women and kids, duking it out until only the two kings are left. I submit that this is a military impossibility, thereby rendering the Book of Mormon a literary impossibility.-The Book purports to be a history of Jewish people. Jewish people have always taken their core rituals with them wherever they go. They all celebrate Passover and the other Jewish days. Yet in the Book of Mormon these devout Jews are never referred to as performing any of these things. Very unlikely.So you are left with a book that is dumb to read and obviously untrue. Why waste your time with it?"},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"If you want a straight review of the Book of Mormon as a book for you to buy and read, I'd say \\"buy it.\\" It holds your interest from the very beginning. There are some parts that run a little slow or confusing (text from ancient prophets \\"like\\" Isaiah), but the remaining parts run very quickly and keep your interest. In fact, sometimes you will find yourself unable to put it down. Read the stories about Alma and his son. They are especially interesting. Also, anything in Mosiah.If you're looking for a more personal commentary on the Book of Mormon, I'd have to say that the doctrine and principles contained within its pages have changed my life--for the better. The people who lived in ancient times were not much different than I am. They had the same doubts, fears, questions and trials that I have had. I use it as a guide to help get me through each day, just as I do the Bible or any other book of scripture. The stories are about real people for real people.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"The Book of Mormon helps me live a better life.

The scriptural style of the Book of Mormon is interesting, but a little overdone. Although it starts out exciting, there were a lot of loose ends that constantly had my 'feasibility' alert going.As the hero, Nephi, and his family are leaving Jeruselem to go to the American continent, Nephi goes back to kill and rob a man. Nephi thinks he is justified in killing this guy, Laban, because he thinks he is more righteous than the victim and he wants the victim's records. He said God told him to do it. This was a bit over the top for me. It sounds too similar to the true stories concerning LDS fundementalists that Jon Krakauer wrote about in his book, \\"Under the Banner of Heaven\\". The Lafferty's were locked up for their crimes in 1984. But, in the story, Nephi is praised by his family and by God. I just wasn't convinced. I like the hero to be somewhat believeable.Nephi kills Laban to get some brass plates that supposedly held the Old Testament of the Bible. When the author, Joseph Smith, plagerized chapters from the King James Version of the Bible and included them in this Book of Mormon, he didn't know that years later, translation errors would be discovered in the King James Version of the Old Testament. So, he included them in the parts that quoted these brass plates. These translation errors, then, ended up in the Book of Mormon.The story goes on about cities of millions of people, and wars of 100's of thousands of people who had armor and swords. It says the people had chariots and horses. This stuff is a little too far fetched, even for fiction. No archealogical evidence of these cities, wars, armor, swords, chariots or horses exists on this continent for this time period. Even the Viking colonies, which were established on this continent in roughly the same time period, are made believable by obvious evidence today. This stuff is just too far out there.The book is actually about a group of people it calls 'Lamanites'. They are called that because they are all decendents from the hero's brother, Laman. The book says that this group eventually became the modern Native American Indian. Since, Laman was semetic (from Israel), his progeny would be semetic as well, of course. In 1824, when he wrote the book, the author had no way of knowing that the DNA studies would be done. So, you have to give him a break for that. However, recent DNA studies have shown that the Native American Indian has his origins in Siberia. Now that this is widely known, it strongly dates the book and limits it as an enjoyable read.In the past, the LDS church has made quite a few changes to the Book of Mormon. They've especially tried to take out some of the more obvious racist wording, although much is still there. They have actually changed many of their historical works and claims over the years. Maybe they will consider updating a few more places in the Book of Mormon to make the book a little more believeable."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I was going to read the Book of Mormon but thought, \\"Hey! Why not wait until the movie comes out?\\" After long last, the movie came out about a year ago but it was not a very good movie. Most of the actors wore table cloths for costumes and had SuperCuts hair-do's.In all fairness, the movie only depicted a first segment of the Book of Mormon. Maybe as the further chapters are filmed, it might get better. Kinda like a REVERSE of the Star Wars syndrome where the more movies they made, the progressively worse they got and maybe the Book of Mormon gets really interesting later on.I am giving the Book of Mormon 2 stars, not because of the book, but because the star of the BoM movie, Noah Danby, is pretty hot and has done gay nude scenes on Showtime's \\"Queer as Folks.\\""},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"You can discover by looking at the people endorsing it. Do you see a single positive endorsement by anyone who is not at the same time zealously proclaiming the message of the Mormon Church? The great religious texts of the world such as the Koran, the Bible, the Torah, and the Tao Te Ching have messages that resonate strongly across denominational lines. They are enjoyed by theists and non-theists alike; their beauty and insightfulness recognized even by those not professing allegience to their tenets. Not so with the Book of Mormon.If you are an adherent of or are interested in investigating the Mormon faith, this book may be of interest to you. If you are, however, searching for great literature, keep looking. Even as an adherent of the Mormon faith, I found this book to be tedium defined. The author's hackneyed attempts at effecting a King James Bible-type prose comes across flat. The plot is thin and full of holes, defying common sense as well as historical records, and is populated with one-dimensional characters.The one area where this book does generate interest is as a chronicle of 19th century America. It illustrates nicely the racial prejudices of the era (although the most blatantly bigoted material has now, gratefully, been removed by church censors). It also provides insight into the religious and political mindset of 1820's America. It takes a stance on the relevant religious issues of that era such as infant baptism, trinitarianism, polygamy, and grace vs. works in salvation. Interestingly, its stance on many of these issues directly contradicts current Mormon teachings on the subjects. It also looks at many of the political philsophies from that era, advocating such causes as manifest destiny and anti-freemasonry. Thus while utterly implausible as a record of ancient America, the Book of Mormon provides considerable insight into the mindset of early the United States.Ultimately, this book falls far short of the mark as a religious classic, with very little literary or spiritual merit. As a historical document, on the other hand, it does reward those willing to plod through its repetitive prose and ridiculous stories with a certain amount insight into the religious and political climate of 1820's United States."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I am a new convert to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, and OVERJOYED! About 6 months ago I was absolutly appauled by the church. My family is Mormon, and I have had, and do have Mormon friends. I could not understand how these people could be so \\"mislead\\" by something that I truly believed was false. I was out to prove it wrong, to \\"save\\" the people I loved from it. I was angry about it, hateful towards (not the people) but the church and the religion.One day I took a good look at myself. I had been a non-denominational christian all my life, and most of my friends were christian. They had the same ideas about the church as I did (in fact thats where I got many of my misconceptions from). I realized it wasn't right to be so angry, and I no longer wished to assaciate myself with hateful people. I had prayed about weather or not the Book of Mormon was the word of God several times, and instead of getting that warm fuzzy feeling the missionaries had talked about, I got sick to my stomach, so of course I thought God was steering me away from it. Ultiamtely, I realized I could not get the truth (or a positive feeling) about the church the way I was constantly reading material opposing it. I couldn't get the truth from people who are angry at, or fearful of, the church. I had to look inside, and I did. The people who I thought I needed to save saved me! The Book of Mormon saved me.

I obtained a testimony (i.e. a personal spiritual conviction) of this book when I investigated the LDS Church in 1978 in the Netherlands where I was born and raised.This book and the messages it contains truly \\"hit me where it was supposed to hit me\\". I loved and continue to treasure the Bible, but the Book of Mormon as an inspired record brought me closer to the Lord Jesus Christ than anything else I had ever read before.I was raised in the Dutch Protestant Church. I was familiar with your \\"basic\\" Christian beliefs and dogmas. I had a nagging feeling from an early age though, that something was lacking in the traditional Protestant doctrine. Without sounding trite, I did wonder that if God is the same yesterday, today and tomorrow, and is not a respector of persons, why then supposedly were \\"the heavens sealed and revelation were no more\\"? If prophets, revelations, etc. were important ages ago, surely we have more need of them now than ever before... To make a long story short, I experienced such a wonderful spiritual enlightenment when I read and followed the counsel contained in the book of Mormon, that the Book has made me a \\"true believer\\" ever since.Read and ponder this Book -prayerfully- and with a sincere desire to find out for yourself if it is true or not.

Two Jewish families are involved and their journeying and travellings are told including the hardships and challenges they faced. They eventually reached a coast, built a ship and launched it upon the seas and were carried by currents/winds to another continent. There they settled,inter-married and expanded their numbers. Their history over many generations and centuries is told, including their disputations, factions, and wars with one another. One group remained faithful to their teaching about a Saviour to come, and lived moral and righteous lives, while the much larger group became decadent and unrighteous. The resurrected Lord Jesus Christ came to visit the righteous group, called Nephites, and delivered the same teachings as He had done during His mortal ministry in Judea in the eastern hemisphere. Now in the western hemisphere, Jesus Christ again calls twelve apostles and others to deliver the Gospel message. However, the Nephites are up against a disbelieving and aggressive host of people who have great superiority of numbers. Eventually the remnants of the righteous group are all killed, but not before the last one remaining, a prophet called Moroni buries a record of the history of this people, which had been engraven on metal plates, on a hillside for a future generation to find. This sacred record is the Book of Mormon.A compelling read to those who have an open mind about God-given revelation in modern times. A history book with a message for everyone."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"This is a wonderful inspiritng book which testifies that our Savior, Jesus Christ, did visit the Americas shortly after His resurrection in the Holy Land. Here, in the New World, He taught His same Gospel of Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, Repentence, Baptism and receiving the Holy Ghost. The Savior also organized His Church with those in leadership positions receiving the authority to administer the ordinances and teach -just as He did in Jerusalem.The writings of other prophets are also recorded in the Book of Mormon, and they testify of Christ and prophesy of His crucifixion, resurrection and visit to the Americas.It is probably the most inspiring book I have ever read, and I recommend it to anyone who is interested in finding the truth. The promise in Moroni 10:4 is a challenge that can be taken literally. Many people have and have come to know that the book is true and accept it as the word of God."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I would like to testify of the truthfulness of this book.

I encourage you to read it, it is a great book!"},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I have read some of the negative reviews posted here. Mostly, they make me sad for those people who have entirely missed the purpose of this book. Some have focused on what they perceive to be historical inaccuracies, bringing a self-imposed preclusion to the great spiritual teachings that would otherwise be available to them. Others seem simply close-minded and unwilling to be taught- \\"stiffnecked,\\" to use a Book of Mormon word- seeking solely to find fault and looking for any bit of content that they deem questionable, in an effort to tear down the Church. Still others have viewed the book in terms of entertainment, discarding its value because it didn't provide the instant gratification that the average reader has come to expect in this day.Firstly, scriptural books, of any religion, were not written to entertain. If you are looking for a quick, flashy, read, then you should pick up a John Grisham novel. If, instead, you seek a book rich in spiritual doctrine, to be studied and pored over for many years for its timeless lessons, then read the Book of Mormon. Better yet, if you want God's word, and an additional witness that Jesus is the Christ, than read the Book of Mormon. I have. I continue to do so. I have taught many Sunday School classes by its precepts. My wife and I read it together every night. It has given depth and meaning to my life, and continually reminds me of that which is good, beautiful, and uplifting.The Book of Mormon is not entertainment. Although it contains many historical records of the peoples of the ancient Americas, it is not a history book. It was never intended to be read as a comparative work, as the basis for scholarly theology. And lastly, it was not \\"written\\" by one man. It is a collection of writings of many different ancient prophets, translated by Joseph Smith. You will not find in it the refinement and polish of great authors, reknowned for their profound prose. These were ordinary men, called of God, quite aware of their imperfections, and readily admitting of them. However, the spirit of what they say is unmistakable. It edifies and instructs in a most sublime way.Simply put, this is a religious book of scripture. Its purpose is to invite all to come unto Christ. In terms of importance, it is like the Koran for Muslims, or the Torah for Jews. It is the keystone of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It is held sacred by its members. As Moroni, the last prophet in the Book of Mormon states, read, ponder, and ask God \\"with real intent\\" if it is His word, and He will make it known unto you. I have put that challenge to the test, and I have come to know, by my own experience, that it is a true book. I love this book. If you read it with an open mind and heart, I know that you, too, will come to love it."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I have studied The Book of Mormon for many years, both pro and con.

Rather, I have tried to examine why the Book of Mormon has been taken seriously-for very different reasons-by generations of devoted believers and and confirmed skeptics. ...\\". The second is to read the Book of Mormon and pray to Heavenly Father asking if it is true. I have read and have received an answer of its truthfulness."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"This book was overall pretty boring but it was peppered with some fun violent parts, and some very bloody wars.*****WARNING SPOILERS**************It starts out around 600BC with a guy named Nephi. Nephi wanted another guy's book but the guy wouldn't give it to him so Nephi waited until the guy was drunk and passed out and then Nephi chopped off his head and stole his book. He ran home and after looking through his new book he found out it was the first few books of the Bible that had been written up to 600BC. Now you may think that to go through all the trouble of murdering someone, and them robbing them and finding out all you got was a stupid Bible would be a disappointment, but Nephi was a bit of a religious nut, so he was pretty excited about what he scored.Then Nephi and his family sailed to America with his new book and started a Christian church (using the stolen scriptures as a guide) in America. Nobody is living in America at the time because God preserved it for Nephi and his people. Over time Nephi populated all of America with his family and friends on the boat (kinda like the Noah story) which is a bit of a stretch, but we'll give Joseph Smith some dramitic license here because he needs large populations for the rest of his story.Nephi has a mean brother named Laman, and Laman and his buddies split off from Nephi and his buddies and they form their own tribe called Lamanites. Nephi and his buddies are called Nephites. God hates the Lamanites for some reason and curses them with dark skin and makes them look and dress like Indians. Now, the Nephites keep trying to get the Lamanites to join their church, but the Lamanites don't want to. They prefer to throw spears, live in tee-pees, have sex, get drunk, nap all day and do all the things Indians like to do. The Nephites are white skinned, God fearing Christians, who like to go to church, pray, build temples, etc. This sets up a clash of cultures between the lazy, savage dark-skinned Lamanites, and the god fearing, hard working, white skinned Nephites.The Nephite and Lamanite populations grow over time into populations of millions on each side. They cover all of the Americas from Alaska to the Southern tip of South America. They go to war constantly over religion. Sometimes the Nephites win and they are able to set up their Christian run government, sometimes the Lamanites win and they set up their Indian style, non-religious government except without casinos. The Nephites send missionaries among the Lamanites (much like the mormon missionaries today) and if a Lamanite Indian joins the Nephite church God turns them 'White and Delightsome'.This all leads up to a final battle in which the Nephites lose. The Lamanites butcher all of the Nephites except for one, his name was Moroni. Moroni gathered up all of the journals that the Nephites had kept on Golden Plates and buried them in a hill in rural New York so that whoever found them would know about the extinct Nephite people. Joseph Smith dug them up in the 1820s and translated them into the book you are reading. The Lamanites continue to live without Nephites or any other white man around them for another 1000 years before Columbus comes. These Lamanites are the Native Americans we see today!! Pretty cool huh.The plot sounds exciting, but it is actually pretty boring. The cool bloody battles are seperated by long boring stretches. There are a couple cool parts, like the guy getting his head chopped off by Nephi and another part where a Nephite missionary named Ammon goes postal on a bunch of guys and chops off their arms and then puts all the bloody severed arms in a basket and gives the basket to his friend as a present. I think Ammon needed some professional help, but he is treated as kind of a loveable psycho. The handful of entertaining violent parts doesn't make up for the tediousness of the bulk of the book. Joseph Smith could've benefited from an editor. His writing style shows him to be the uneducated farmer that he was.There are also some anachronisms and unrealistic parts in the book that show Joseph did not do his research. At one point, Jesus gives 3 Nephites immortality. These three Nephites supposedly walked the earth forever and still walk it to this day, yet they are not mentioned again in the book. Where did they go? The book is filled with weird supernatural, magic stuff that doesn't fit the main theme of bloody ethnic wars and religious intolerance. Also, their are some anachronistic goofs, such as several King James Bible quotes that were first written in 1611AD yet the Book of Mormon has them being used in America between 600BC and 400AD. Also, he mentions horses and other animals that did not exist in America before Columbus. Oops, a little research on Joseph's part could have avoided these goofs.Finally, my biggest nitpick is the idea of Native Americans being the cursed descendants of the godless Lamanites and their dark skin was punishment from God is just a bit offensive in this day and age. I realize Joseph lived in a time when such racist assumptions were common, but that just proves the book hasn't aged well. I'm not the overly PC type, but the racial theories in The Book of Mormon are a little too close to 'The Birth of a Nation' for my tastes.These problems unfortunately overshadow the cool, bloody battles, and violent religious extremism that is at the heart of the book. Joseph Smith could have cut out the boring tedious parts and the magic supernatural stuff, eliminated the goofs, and only included the fun stuff and the book would be 1/4 of it's size and it would have been much more fun.Overall, a disappointment."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"quotes extracted from sections of Moroni- Be peaceable followers of Christ obtain hope by which you enter the rest of the Lord.

I have a strong testimony that it is true. I have read it several times from cover to cover; I have also read the Bible. I have not read anything in The Book of Mormon that is negative to the Bible but only proves it to be true. It speaks of Jesus Christ - the same - one and only - Jesus Christ that is spoken of in the Bible. It is the recorded history of the people that lived on THIS content long ago and their belief in God and his son Jesus Christ. Anyone who thinks otherwise about this book has plain and simply not read it.I highly recommend it!*****"},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"This book needs to be looked at by first detaching one self from preconceived ideas of the Mormon faith. Most reviews of the book instead base their review to the church claim of how the book can affect ones life and not solely on what the book contains. Listing how one has lived, or believs does nothing to inform a reader of how they will enjoy reading the book.Listing alternative texts that delve into the Mormon faith does nothing to inform a reader of what the book is like, both to read and comprehend.This book is a complex read, it has multiple writers who write in a similar but differing style, it also has numerous language oddities that make it stand out from regular texts of the American origin.Whether or not you read this book for a religous purpose, embracing tachings of the LDS church or to discount the Mormon beliefs then like any research efforts if you are clouded by the outcome you wish to arrive at, you will find what you want to find.After all this and having read this book I have to say it is an enjoyable change to the common religous literature of today which revolves around different interpretations of the books of the Bible and the stories contained therein.This book alone is a good read, many stories and principles of life are easy to relate to.I recommend this book and do so by encouraging you to read it with and open mind and with no preconceived expectations.Read it and see what you think...."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"My life has been forever changed (for the better) by reading this book.

I promise it can bring you the same blessings it has for me."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"With our world so full of confusion and violence, I cannot imagine a better book to address the ills of our time. The Book of Mormon is tailored to answer so many questions about life in the modern world; questions about religions, warfare, society, success and the importance of living on the American Continents.The moral and ethical precepts are set forth in terms of \\"I will show unto you\\" and \\"thus we see\\" as Mormon, the editor, invites the reader to learn from the many mistakes of the past civilizations in the Western Hemisphere.This Book has been a blessing in my life. I have read and taught from it for over 40 years, and each time I read it, I find new and fascinating intricacies. I know this is a true record of Ancient America and Christ's dealings with and visit to them. How marvelous to know that Jesus Christ is the Savior for all of mankind and cares about all people everywhere. Explanations of many bible passages, including whole commentaries on Isaiah and poorly-understood verses of the New Testament are set forth in clear, concise and readable language.I would recommend this Book to all to read, re-read and treasure as a guide to improving their spiritual lives."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"This book is an amazing and powerful book. I have read it close to 20 times and continue to read it daily. I have found that when I read it to learn more about God and his dealings with His children on earth, understanding and insights come continually. It has helped me see what God really expects of each of us. It has taught me what it takes to be happy. I love this book!!! I can't imagine living without it. Everyday I feel more peace in my life when I read some of it!!!I recommend this book to anyone who honestly wants to know more about God. It is a true and powerful book! There is a promise in the last chapter that you can try for yourself as to the truthfulness of this book. I have tried it and it IS true! I feel it is a miracle that we have such a book available to us. Like the Bible, it testifies of Jesus Christ and helps me understand just how real He is and how important His mission on earth was for each of us.I strongly recommend this book to all those wanting to get closer to the true God, our Father in heaven."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I read from this book every day. By the fruits of anything, we can know if it is good or evil. The Book of Mormon inspires me to be better every time I read it because it teaches me the basic principles of good, of how to live an honest, upright, virtuous life.If anyone truly wants to know for themselves if the things written in the Book of Mormon are indeed true and are of God, they can ask God, in prayer, with a sincere and honest heart, and they will know, without a doubt that it is of God. If they follow their heart, their life will be impacted for good and they will experience more joy then they ever knew possible. No one has to believe what this book is all about, but let me ask this question. Why is there so much controversy about one simple book? It is either because the book is of God or because it is of the devil. Let me testify to you that numerous times I have felt a burning in my heart that I won't deny and I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that it is of God. Ask, and find out for yourself."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"At first I didn't really study the Book of Mormon, but as I got older I have received a thirst for real answers and the truth. The Book of Mormon brings a spirit into my heart like no other. When it testifys of Christ, I can feel his power and his love for me. I enjoy studying both the Bible and Book of Mormon to learn more about my Savior, his life and mission. I know that the Book of Mormon can help a person get through all the confusion in life and that it teaches great family principles. If you are considering reading it- do what the Bible states in James (1:5). If you pray to the Lord, He will tell you the truth of anything that you are searching for! I know that it's true for I have also prayed and have received a testimony of my own. You have to really want it, though- you can't say a little prayer and then forget about it. If you don't know for yourself what is true and not true then you are stuck just believing anything a person says. I know that it is important to have the teachings of God in your life to guide you and that is why I have searched for the Book of Mormon. I have found His love for me there, and I hope that you do too. This is my testimony, and I say it in the name of Jesus Christ."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"Although I was born and raised in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I still needed to find out for myself if The Book of Mormon is true. When I was in my 20s I read it through from beginning to end for the first time. Then, as I was instructed at the end of the book in Moroni 10:4, I prayed and asked God and received a powerful confirmation through His spirit that this book is indeed His word. It is, as the subtitle says, \\"Another Testament of Jesus Christ\\" as the Lord and Savior of the earth. Since that time I have read and studied this wonderful book over and over again and it has provided priceless direction and inspiration in my life. You can have this same witness for yourself. If you read this book with an open heart and mind and ask God, I promise you that you will receive a witness of its truth."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I recommend this book to any open-minded truth-seeker. I have found it to be a great source of inspiration, peace, comfort, and full of the gospel of Jesus Christ. The truthfulness of this book will not be established by any means that depend on the wisdom of mankind. Rather, each person can know if it's true by sincerely searching its pages and asking God of its authenticity. I have received such an answer."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I first read the Book of Mormon in 1970, when I was 15, and have re-read it probably at least a dozen times since then. It changed my life for the better. It had more impact on me that any other influence in my entire life.The Book of Mormon is an amazing book, and could not possibly be the product of a conspiracy--its just too well-done. The Book of Mormon compliments the Bible like an additional movement of an unfinished symphony. Doctrinally they explain one another, and they are consistent in theme, the dominant of which is that Jesus Christ is indeed the Lord and Savior all ALL the world, and that mankind may live a happier life when they are righteous.If you are already a Christian, this need not threaten your testimony of the Bible. It will augment the Bible and strenghthen your faith.If you are not already a Christian, and perhaps have found the Bible hard to read and understand, this will give you a second chance. It simple style will make things clear that were confusing to you before."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I have learned more about the mission and teachings of Jesus Christ by reading this book than in an entire lifetime of studying the Bible."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"The Book of Mormon is a wonderful book. It goes hand in hand with the Holy Bible and tells of events that happened on the American continents before, during and after the time of Christ's earthly ministery. A must read."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"The Book of Mormon is a second testament of Jesus Christ. The Bible testifies of the Savior and the Book of Mormon sustains that testimony. I know the Book of Mormon is a true book.The Book of Mormon gives accounts of three different peoples who came to the American continent thousands of years ago. Those who kept the records wrote their testimonies of Jesus Christ and the commandments of our Heavenly Father. They often wrote of the consequences people faced when they did not keep these commandments. If we follow these commandments, then we can live peaceful lives, even though we will have trials we must endure and overcome.The highlight of this book is when the Savior visited the Nephites after His death and resurrection. His great love for all of us is illustrated in His great love for these people. He lets each of the 2500 people present come and feel the prints of the nails in His hands and feet. He heals the sick among them and blesses each of their little children.The Book of Mormon has changed my life and it will change yours too if you read it and live by the teachings found therein."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I will admit right off that I am LDS. This book has had more effect on my life than any other book. I know that it is the word of God! (that is not a conditioned response, it is a genuine and personal response given after thorough investigation and experience) As you SINCERELY (meaning: without your mind made up that it isn't true) read this book. You will experience a greater happiness than words can express. As with the Bible the Book of Mormon confirms that Jesus Christ exists and that He is coming again. Extensive time could be wasted arguing archeology, science, doctrine and history to prove or disprove the book. The best way to know for sure that this book is true is if you read it for yourself and make your own educated opinion; instead of taking the opinion of a biased anti-mormon. Just because a fellow reviewer read the book, not wanting it to be true, prayed and didn't get an immediate answer should not make your mind up for you. There is no special voodoo power that captures you as you read and forces you into the church. However, don't be surprised if as you read you feel more joy, peace and love than you have ever felt before in your life. Remember, these things are the fruits of the Spirit of God. (Galatians 5:22) No man could have written this. I know it is true, but I cannot force my opinion on anyone. Read it and you will see that God has once again established His kingdom on the earth to usher in His Glorious second coming. Hosanna, to God and the Lamb!"},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"This is a rare gem. You will never forget its poignant scenes. Ishmael's daughters mourning their father's death on the long journey to ancient America. Alma and Ammon's unexpected reunion after 14 years, as Alma preaches repentance to his people and Ammon seeks their aid to save thousands of former enemies from brutal slaughter. Moroni kneeling in prayer before raising the Title of Liberty to inspire his army in the defense of their country. You'll witness nations rise and fall as they follow and then forget God. Accounts of courage, loyalty, and love will inspire you. You'll be astounded as faithful Christians are rescued from death on the eve of our Savior's birth. Your heart will move as Jesus Christ appears to inhabitants who have endured 3 days of darkness to behold the marvelous light of Christ. Your eyes will be damp as He heals their lame and blind, then takes their children in his arms and blesses them. Then you will feel pangs of grief as you witness the utter destruction of a deprave civilization once described as the happiest of people.As you read the Book of Mormon, you will discover the most powerful witness of the Bible ever published. The doctrines of the Creation, Fall, Atonement, and Resurrection are clearly taught by fathers, mothers, prophets and the Savior Himself. Most importantly, you will feel the Holy Spirit confirm these truths as you read."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"Hi! Lots of varying opinions here, eh? Perhaps it might be helpful to take note of the differences between the \\"pro\\" posts and the \\"anti\\" posts on this book. Most of the pro posts simply invite you to read it and make up your own mind. In fact, at the very end of the book there is very simple guidance as to how to know, for yourself, wether the Book of Mormon is true. If you have any interest in this book at all, don't take other people's word for it (pro or con), it will be worth your while to find out for yourself. :)"},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"The concept behind this book is interesting, whatever else may be said of the religion for which it is sacred literature. Is it colorful fiction? Divine revelation? Was it penned (as my one-time neighbor solemnly cautioned me) by a deceptive fiend straight out of Hell? I have no idea. I found the Book of Mormon remarkably readable and light compared to most liturgical tomes and was impressed a time or two by its quality, if not by its claims. I suppose my ultimate feeling is that if The Book of Mormon makes someone a better person for believing in it, then I see it as no less valid as an item of faith than any other holy work."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I found this book while living in Sao Paulo, Brazil. I could not put the book down and found it a valuable tool to have my children read also. The teachings in them have helped keep my family safe from the turmoils of this world and answer questions that I could not always answer for myself.I only hope that you will take the time to enjoy one of the most sincere and thought provoking books of our day or of any day."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"When I first read this book around 30-40 years ago, I had some trouble getting into it, and indeed, there are sections that can be rather dry, and like Twain said, like chloroform in print. However, the more I look into it, the more I find of value. It has withstood the test of time. Since my first reading, I have continued my education, and received degrees in a variety of fields including literature/humanities, sciences (astronomy, physiology), social sciences (clinical psychology), and have taught in universities. I have read a countless number of books, and written about 20.I have grown to love this book because of the truths contained therein. The words of King Benjamin are especially inspiring along with the words, and experiences of Alma, Enoch, and Moroni, among others.This book consists of the records of the pre-Columbian people of the Americas and their parallel experiences (parallel to the people whose records are contained in the Old and New Testaments of the Bible) with prophets, wars, contentions, pride, and the coming of the Saviour to teach His gospel of peace.There are ugly events, as some have written, certainly, and that is true of life, for as far back as our histories record. But there are also inspirational truths that touch the soul.I have found that my life has been so much better, for having learned from the teachings of Christ, in this book, that I shudder to imagine my life without having read it. Some, who give a negative review, actually, many, while they are entitled to do such, apparently haven't read the book. I find their posts full of errors. For instance, one writes that the best part is when Christ appears in the end. While it was good of the reviewer to share his favorite part, those who have read the book will wonder how it is possible that he thinks that the book ends with the appearance of the Saviour!There are many others that indicate a lack of knowledge of the book, even when the reviewer starts out by stating that he or she has read it many times. I must discount all reviews that include lies and it is obvious when someone writes a detail about the book that is obviously not factual to those who actually HAVE read the book.This is a book about the Saviour and Redeemer of mankind. It is about His teachings, and His example to us. It is full of what we need to know to be happy in this life and the next, to be good, honest people, to love one another. It is about repentence and the atonement. It is about repenting and aligning our lives to be more Christ-like.It is about having no more disposition to do evil. It's about sacrifice, and obedience to God.Whenever I feel like something is missing in my life or that I may be focusing a bit too much on the wrong things, such as career advancement (as opposed to further development of my talents), or material things (status), or even gossip, or spending too much time on trivial of silly things, I turn to the Book of Mormon, and it is like drinking from pure, clean waters that nourish and restore me.My life is good. I have a wonderful career as a writer. I have a wonderful, smart and loving spouse. My children and I have exceptional relationships. I am so blessed. This book, and the Old and New Testaments, together, keep me on track.I love the Bible, I read it regularly. The Book of Mormon is aligned with the words of the Bible, and is yet another testimony of Christ and His gospel.It is herein that I find meaning and significance. And for that I am most grateful."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I hope that people considering reading this book will disregard what seems to be out right mormon haters posting here.How will anyone know unless they read for themselves.If you are curious, why not? It will change your life."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I don't usually read books more than once (I get bored easily), but I have read the Book of Mormon many times. It is a very beautifully written book and is written like an intricately woven tapestry. There are many levels of understanding that can be found within the Book of Mormon. The stories that are related therein are written very much as the parables of Christ that are related in the New Testament--they can be taken on a literal or spiritual level, depending on how you look at them.I have read the Book of Mormon focusing on the spiritual aspects found in the stories. I have read it purely for a geneological view of the history of the people who wrote it. I have read it as a literal story of the history of a people. On all levels it is interesting.If you want it to, the book can change your life. If you don't, then it will be just an interesting read and you can put it on your bookshelf to collect dust.The only reason to buy the book, as opposed to getting a free copy, is because it looks prettier than the free version. So if you don't want to invest the money call or visit lds.org and order your free copy."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"The Book of Mormon speaks of Jesus Christ.

It is, hands down, the most compelling and spiritual book I have ever read. Whether you are a Mormon or not, the history and insight into the evolution of societies is absolutely facinating. Anyone curious about religion or the history of the American continent should give it a read. Quite frankly, I'm a bit surprised at some of the negative reviews. If you don't like the book, fine. But there is nothing self-destructive about reading a book. Read it and judge for yourself."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"When I first read the Book of Mormon, I was touched by its power and feeling. There is something special about this book. The sayings and the message of each chapter seems to speak volumes to me. I found the book to be both understandable and yet, very profound. I would recommend this book highly to anyone. It gives you a a better understanding of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. It teaches each of us to be better people."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"A lot of people put the Mormons down but that's not fair. Just because they believe something different from some of us doesn't make them bad. I have read pretty much all the LDS books and they are pretty harmless. Christians have no reason to 'hate' Mormons. They believe many of the same things we do and their dedication to family and community is admirable.Now sure they believe Jesus came to the Americas and that the lost tribe of Israel settled here and built a giant empire with vast cities. People point out that none of this has been found. So what? If you have faith you don't need proof. And what harm is there if it isn't true? As long as they are doing good works, I don't think God cares about the little details. In fact for centuries many in England believed that Jesus appeared there. And the myths about the lost tribe of Israel coming to the Americas existed long before the LDS (heck, there are so many places that claim the Lost Tribe came there I am beginning to wonder how those fellas made all them trips!).And don't believe all that hogwash about polygamy. The Mormon's abandoned that years ago in order to join the Union. Only a few holdouts that aren't part of the main Mormon Church still do that.So rather than reject the Mormons, Christians should show them the same love they show to Muslims, Jews, Hindus and Pagans. We do not hate those who think differently, we merely gently espouse our gospel and let the Holy Spirit lead them where it may.I encourage you to read this book if you are curious what the Mormon's believe. Just like reading the Koran is a good way to learn about Muslims. By understanding different faiths, we can be better Christians."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"If you have ever seen or heard anything about the The \\"Mormon\\" Church or The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and wanted to know more about what we believe, here is a no pressure way to learn. The Book of Mormon contains the word of God to His children. Specifically, the words of ancient American prophets recorded for us in our day. The Book of Mormon witnesses of Jesus Christ, the Savior and Redeemer of the world. As all good books should, this book will teach you and uplift you each time you read from its pages. I encourage you to read this book and learn for yourself what God has in store for His children."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"Not only is it a boring read, It's lame and overly pretentious.The biggest argument I hear from the followers of Mormo is \\"You can either believe that it's the word of God, or that a 19 year-old farm boy wrote it.\\" Given these two choices I'd have to say the farm boy wrote it. Maybe it's just me, but I think if God wrote a book it would be much more eloquent and much less boring. Besides, why would he have his \\"servant\\" translate in Elizabethan english even though said servant lived in the United States? It don't make no kind of sense. Plus, it's not like the stories in the Book of Mormon are all that original. Take some Bible stories, change the names and some minor details and voila! Another testament of Jesus Christ.On a historical note, if a Jewish family were the first American settlers then why didn't the Indians celebrate Passover? And if they brought their horses with them why is there no evidence of horses on this continent before the conquistadors showed up?Over all, I have to give it an A for effort but and F for originality and readability."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I have read the book many times. I am a practicing Mormon and I attend the Mormon Temples. I challenge all Mormons to step outside the box and study early Mormon documents including this book. Don't take it for truth based on emotional verbal testament. Several leaders of the Mormon church have mentioned that this book must be heavily scrutinized given the claim that it is the most correct book on earth. That is a very daunting claim to make. The book claims to be a literal history of several races of people that inhabited the Americas prior to the arrival of the Europeans. Claims like this force the work into other realms of investigation. Not only is it a religious text but it also is a history of the Americas and it's founding populations; therefore, it must be evaluated just as we would any other historical document in existence.Scholarly investigations, by both Mormon and non-Mormon individuals, into the book from outside sources such as archeology, linguistics, anthropology and human genetics provide no historicity for the book whatsoever. I find it odd that a manuscript of this magnitude would appear 1400 years after it was written and yet no other manuscript or record of any type in the world has been found to support it. It is a singular work. I find it perplexing that the advanced, old world descended populations described in the book left absolutely no trace of their existence. Many Mormons now preach that the populations described in the book were isolated and small. This is not what the book itself teaches. It describes populations that numbered in the millions and covered the face of the entire hemisphere. For these populations to leave no trace of their 1000 year existence is just not possible.I wrestle with this book every day of my life. I deeply appreciate my church but we simply must accept the truth. After all, we claim our church is the only true and living church on the face of the earth. We must then embody TRUTH!! This book was written by Brother Joseph and his associates and I believe for a good reason - to teach of Jesus. If Mormons can begin to view the book as a religious text and NOT an actual history of the Americas perhaps this might help us cope with the fact that the Mormon church is one of many in the world and does not have a particular vestige of truth and divinity."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"Although based entirely on false claims and blatant historical inaccuracy, the Book of Mormon is an interesting work of fiction! The creator of such fiction must have been taking some strong drugs because there is no way that any sane or rational being could possibly come up with some of the stuff within this \\"book\\"."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"Martin Luther once used the term \\"pious fiction\\" to refer to the apocryphal books not included canonical Scripture. Believing that these books were probably written as fiction for the promotion of the Christian faith, he nonetheless in good faith placed them in his translation of the Bible, advising interested Christians to read them while keeping a suspicious eye. I am afraid that \\"The Book of Mormon,\\" while maintaining a facade of piety, is only fiction promoted to the destruction of Christian faith.The casual Christian reader of The Book of Mormon must be warned that while the book claims to be written by inspiration from the Christian Triune God, the god revealed in it one that is foreign to us. He is neither Triune (three persons in one God) nor one personality ~ there are in fact many gods apparently to be seen in the universe and Mormon theology wishes to you how to become one yourself. Any true Christian can see the problems there. The lies and deceptions in this book are hidden behind a veil of pious-sounding phrases and ideas, so as to make the book all the more attractive to real Christians. And there is no doubt that to our sinful flesh the book is attractive - as it was to America of the 1830s. It offers answers to many questions of the era it was written; Where did the Anerican Indians come from? What happened to the lost 10 tribes of Israel? What are people to think about \\"dark-skinned\\" people, slaves? All these questions are answered in The Book of Mormon - albiet completely unsatisfactorally.The version of the book that I am reading is written as Joseph Smith \\"translated\\" it by peering into his magical stone. (Again, an observant Christian sees the stark contrast to the NT.) It seems oddly King-James-ish and difficult and yet more modern at the same time.

Have you ever wondered how come these ancient indians came to know about God? I know that this book is true just like the Bible and you can too if you read it and ask God himself. He has promised that \\"by the power of the Holy Ghost you shall know the truth of all things\\"."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"If you are a Mormon, I want you to know that I respect your open-mindedness in reading this review. I also want you to know that I like Mormons, and even love a few Mormons, whom I consider some of the finest people who ever walked in shoe leather, as my grandmother used to say.Also, check my one-star reviews of books by Mormon \\"scholars,\\" such as Hugh Nibley (World of the Jaredites), John Sorensen (in \\"Echoes and Evidences for the Book of Mormon\\"), and Milton R. Hunter's books.I also reviewed Grant Palmer's book, \\"An Insiders View of Mormon Origins.\\"An Insider's View of Mormon OriginsSo now for the facts:Joseph Smith demonstrated his ability to write Book of Mormon scripture by composing the scripture-sounding \\"Preface\\" (now dropped) as well as the two testimonies (originally at the end of the book). Note the following:PART OF THE PREFACE TO THE BOOK OF MORMON COMPOSED BY JOSEPH SMITHAs many false reports have been circulated respecting the following work, and also many unlawful measures taken by evil designing persons to destroy me, and also the work....notwithstanding my utmost exertions to recover it again....Satan had put I into their hearts to tempt the Lord their God, by altering the words, that they did read contrary from that which I translated and caused to be written; and if I should bring forth the same words again, or, in other words, if I should translate the same over again, they would publish that which they had stolen, and Satan would stir up the hearts of this generation, that they might not receive this work....Wherefore, to be obedient unto the commandments of God, I have, through his grace and mercy, accomplished that which he hath commandedSLIGHT CHANGES TO SHOW THAT JOSEPH SMITH COULD COMPOSE BOOK OF MORMON SCRIPTURE:As many false reports had been circulated in the land, many unlawful measures were taken against Nephi by the evil designing Lamanite king. But notwithstanding Nephi's utmost exertions, Satan had put it into their hearts to tempt the Lord their God, by altering Nephi's words, that they did read contrary from that which he caused to be written as testimony on gold plates. And it came to pass, that Nephi said, If I should bring forth the same words again, or, in other words, if I should write the same over again, they would publish that which they had stolen, and Satan would stir up the hearts of Lamanites, that they might not receive this work. Wherefore, to be obedient unto the commandments of God, I, Nephi have, through his grace and mercy, accomplished that which he hath commanded.The preface also shows the back-tracking style found throughout the Book of Mormon.Note the following examples:l. \\"I have charity for the Jew--I say Jew, because I mean....\\"2. \\"And now if Christ had not come into the world, speaking of things to come as though....\\" (Supposedly written in 148 BC-before Christ)3. \\"...so long as there should be a band of Christians remain to possess the land--For thus all the true believers of Christ....\\" (Supposedly written in 73 BC)4. \\"And behold in the end of this book...Behold I do not mean the end of the book of Helaman, but I mean....\\"5. \\"...it must needs be expedient that Christ-for in the last night an angel spake unto me that this should be his name....\\" (Written in the sixth century BC)6. \\"...and if I should bring forth the same words again, or, in other words, if I should translate the same over....\\"7. \\"...that my name should be had for good and evil among all nations, kindreds, and tongues, or that it should be both good and evil spoken of among all people.\\"NOTE: Number \\"6\\" (above) was written by Joseph Smith in his 1830 preface of the Book of Mormon, a preface now deleted, and number \\"7\\" was also written by Joseph Smith as he later described his visit with an angel.Also, remember that Joseph Smith didn't know when to quit talking. His prayer for the dedication of the Kirkland Temple, according to the guides, was a couple hours long. Thus, again he demonstrated his ability to spin scripture as fast as his scribe could write it down.Published in 1830, the original Book of Mormon bears all the marks of a novel written by a relatively uneducated man. Some 4000 changes have been made in grammar (also deleting the overuse of \\"and it came to pass\\").Also, some significant errors corrected (King Benjamin was dead at one point and it was changed to Mosiah). In addition, it contains errors that are found in the King James Bible at the time.Taking the popular folklore of the lost white race of \\"Mound Builders\\" and that the Indians were descended from the Jews, Joseph Smith had all the makings of a novel set in his lap. He was not a scholar, but he used a few books as references--notably \\"View of the Hebrews,\\" published in Poultney, Vermont, where his chief scribe and third cousin, Oliver Cowdery, came of age.The project took about a year. At the age of twenty-two-and-half, Joseph Smith dictated 116 pages over a two month period. When these pages were lost or stolen, he waited some nine months (with some composition in between) before starting again. Then after three months, he completed his novel at age twenty-three-and-a-half.At the time, Joseph Smith was not a teenager or \\"farm boy\\" as many Mormon writers say, deliberately confusing Joseph's teenage visions with his dictating of the Book of Mormon. He was a married man of 22-23 when he began his novel.Note, also, that Joseph Smith didn't have to \\"write\\" a single word. He had various scribes do that as he \\"translated\\" from behind a curtain by looking at a magic stone placed in a hat.For a fascinating look at the problems of the Book of Mormon, read \\"American Apocrypha,\\" a collection of essays by former Mormons.American Apocrypha: Essays on the Book of Mormons (Essays on Mormonism Series)The following is from an essay by Professor Edwin Firmage, who tells a compelling story of how he came to abandon his belief that the Book of Mormon is an ancient document. The other essays in this book are also fascinating. Highly recommended for anyone interested in the Book of Mormon.Professor Edwin Firmage, Jr. writes:\\"Nearly twenty years ago, as a first year-graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, my ambition was to become another Hugh Nibley, whose writings I loved since I was twelve....\\"\\"Still a neophyte, but armed with German and a little Arabic, Greek, and Hebrew, and intent on acquiring the requisite apologetic tools, I cameo Berkeley to study ancient Near Eastern languages, particularly Egyptian, the language of mysteries par excellence.\\"Not long after my arrival, I was asked to teach the Book of Mormon in the Gospel Doctrine class in my Berkeley ward. I welcomed the opportunity, as it would give me a chance to delve deeper into the book. By any standard, my wife and I were faithful Mormons who attended church, visited the temple, and prayed together. I expected my study of the Book of Mormon to result in an increase of faith as it had done on my mission. But within six months, I no longer believed the Book of Mormon to be an ancient text.\\"To this day, I am not sure how it happened, although I can isolate several issues that played a role in my change of mind....I have often thought that what happened to me in Berkeley was fundamentally a conversion, or, if you like, an anti-conversion. The process had all the inscrutable suddenness that characterized some of the conversions I had witnessed as missionary. Like a conversion to faith, the effect of my change of mind propagated with amazing speed. Almost overnight my whole outlook on life was different.\\"\\"The remaining pages of this essay will present a few of what, for me in 1984, were discoveries of some importance. These do not by any means constitute a comprehensive explanation of the Book of Mormon. Nor are they offered as proof of my thesis that the book is modern, but as examples of how the assumption that is modern resolves otherwise significant difficulties.\\"Further, there is no archaeological evidence for the claims of the Book of Mormon. Read the following:Robert J. Sharer is Professor of Anthropology and Curator of the American Section of the University Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania. His fascinating and heavy book analyzes the Maya from every angle. Although Sharer does not mention the Book of Mormon, he does give a devastating answer to those who would link Meso-American civilization with the ancient Hebrews, placing such theories squarely in the 19th century.Sharer writes: \\"After more than a century of gathering and analyzing archaeological evidence, we have discovered nothing to support the idea of intervention by people from the Old World.\\" \\"This is not to say that accidental contacts between the Old and New World peoples could not have occurred before the age of European exploration\\" (p. 6).\\"On the basis of the available evidence, then, the courses of cultural development in the New and Old Worlds seem clearly independent of each other and devoid of significant contact until 1492\\" (intro., p. 7).The ancient Maya civilization, Sharer continues, \\"are to be \`explained' not as a product of transplanted Old World civilization, but as the result of the processes that underlie the growth of any culture, including those that develop the kind of complexity we call civilization.\\"\\"The idea, which either explicitly or implicitly asserts that the peoples of the New World were incapable of shaping their own destiny or developing sophisticated cultures independently of Old World influence, is still popular in quarters.\\" \\"But this is but one more popular myth devoid of fact, for the evidence points unmistakably toward the evolution of civilization in the New World independently of developments in the Old World.\\"Every Mormon should read Robert Silverberg's book, \\"The Mound Builders: The Archaeology of a Myth.\\" This book provides the context for the novel called the \\"Book of Mormon.\\"Also, read Robert Wauchope's 150-page book, \\"Lost Tribes and Sunken Continents: Myth and Method in the Study of the American Indians.\\"Check out the following links to two very rewarding books:Mound BuildersLost Tribes & Sunken Continents: Myth and Method in the Study of AmeriYour comments--positive or negative--are appreciated.

As such, many of these negative reviews viciously attack Mormonism's precious tome, yet all-the-while these reviewers are espousing the virtues of the Bible; however, most of these them have simply missed the point. It has been my experience that Mormons love negative publicity, for they seem to believe that somehow this proves they're right. That aside, logically and empirically speaking, neither the Book of Mormon nor the Bible can stand the test of reason, so claiming that one preposterous book is superior to another is akin to asserting that \\"Lord of the Rings\\" is superior to \\"Harry Potter.\\" However, the Bible does at least have the obscuring effect of antiquity on its side, whereas the Book of Mormon is just barefaced nineteenth-century flapdoodle. From a rational perspective, how is it possible - given our current state of scientific knowledge - that modern human beings can believe in such absurdities? Although they claim otherwise, Mormonism is a massive brainwashing and propaganda machine that expects and receives uniformity of thought and belief. This point is evidenced by the homogeneous language and responses that Mormons provide either in person or on web-logs.Even though there isn't a stitch of empirical evidence to support that notion that God exists - in spite of all the wordplay from the World's theologians - the intellectual plebeians have abandoned what reason they possess and are lining up by the thousands in order to join this church. Yet, in spite of all the religious nonsense and violence in the world, the Book of Mormon is perhaps worthy of special mention; accordingly, it is perhaps the crowning achievement of generations of religious idiocy. Like all religions, Mormonism preys on the ignorant, the downtrodden, the emotionally unstable, and the hypocrite who all appear to drink heartily from this church's overflowing Kool-Aid fountain. Yet, any critical analysis of this church's basic tenets will reveal that the Book of Mormon is nothing more than one illiterate man's fantasy; which, by the way, does not bear any resemblance to reality around him. Furthermore, it also reinforces nineteenth-century notions of racial bigotry, and it exposes Smith's lack of scientific understanding of the physical world. To this end, let's take a look at just a few of this ridiculous book's innumerable absurdities:Alma 3:6 - And the skins of the Lamanites were dark, according to the mark which was set upon their fathers, which was a curse upon them because of their transgression and their rebellion against their brethren, who consisted of Nephi, Jacob, and Joseph, and Sam, who were just and holy men.Ok, let me get this straight; even though we know that skin pigmentation has everything to do with genetic inheritance, there are those among us who believe that dark-skinned people are cursed. Skin color has much more to do with sexual selection and biological factors than it does with curses. The Book of Mormon is rife with such racial bigotry. For a much better understanding of human history and geographical information, I recommend reading Jared Diamond's \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel.\\" If people understood the basic principles of evolution then these sorts of logical travesties would likely go the way of the Dodo Bird...1 Nephi 25 - And it came to pass that we did find upon the land of promise, as we journeyed in the wilderness, that there were beasts in the forests of every kind, both the cow and the ox, and the ass and the horse, and the goat and the wild goat, and all manner of wild animals, which were for the use of men.Even a kindergartner will recognize that all of the above-mentioned animal species did not exist in the Americas during this time. All of these species were indigenous to the Eurasian continent and did not exist in the Americas until such time as Columbus arrived in the New World. The chicken might be the exception to this, for some scientists believe that Polynesians deposited that bird in the Americas. Oh yes, I have seen many Mormon apologist try to squirm out of this geographical reality, but they have only succeed in making themselves look foolish. Albeit, this is a position in which I suspect they must be comfortable with...Morm. 9: 32 - And now, behold, we have written this record according to our knowledge, in the characters which are called among us reformed Egyptian, being handed down and altered by us, according to our manner of speech.Although many Mormon apologists will claim that the now missing Golden Tablets were written in what they call reformed Egyptian, there, nevertheless, isn't a stitch of evidence to support the notion that such a language ever existed. To make the claim that God provided these Golden Tablets written in a heretofore unknown language and then took them away is akin to not making a claim at all. Plain and simple, the illiterate Joseph Smith was just making stuff up. Given this simplistic mode of thinking, then I can make up anything and ask you to believe it. Say, here's a thought: God just told me that everyone who reads this review owes me ten-thousand dollars. Pray about it and he will tell you; however, keep in mind that the Devil will try to trick you about the truth of my statement. After you've prayed, simply email me and I will provide the address where you can send your check.Although this book is replete with innumerable examples of such blatant nonsense, a rational person can nevertheless understand some of the absurdities written in the Bible; it was written long before the Age of Enlightenment and the rise of science. To this end, the Book of Mormon satisfies the obtuse, and it surely fails to do little more than ingratiate an ignorant person's notion of race, social class, and political and religious ideology. Ergo, this book is a rather profound testament to human gullibility - one which illuminates the simple fact that if something is emotionally appealing then it is far more likely to be believed; this, in spite of the fact that the basic underlying tenets of this book are entirely and demonstrably falsifiable. So, take heed, join this church or any church, for that matter, at your own peril; all that you have to lose is your intellectual autonomy and, of course, your money..."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"Like Islam and the Koran, it is difficult to seperate Mormonism from the Book of Mormon. If you are a devout Mormon, you believe this to be \\"the most perfect book on the face of the Earth\\" as the author or \\"translator\\" said of it. If you read it in any other context, you will find it a poor read. Written in Elizabethean English, though supposedly translated from \\"Reformed Egyptian\\", it reads suspiciously like the King James Bible. In fact, many Mormon critics believe that the book was written by Joseph Smith or one of his colleagues, drawing heavily on \\"A View of the Hebrews\\", written by Ethan Smith a few years before the Book of Mormon was published, and with word for word extracts from the King James Bible.While Mormon missionaries and apologists expect you to accept the book on the merits of prayer and warm feelings, I suggest you read other works, like Mormon historians B.H. Robert's \\"Studies of the Book of Mormon\\" or D. Michael Quinn's numerous Mormon histories to get a more balanced viewpoint. Richard Ostling's \\"Mormon America\\" (1999) also gives a great overview of many aspects of the religion and Mormon subculture.As for a literary work, Mark Twain once said that if you took out \\"And it came to pass...\\", the Book of Mormon would be a pamphlet.In sum, if you want to know about Mormonism, you should read this book, just as I would read the Koran to study Islam.

That in itself should be an indicator of the power found within it's pages. The Book of Mormon has changed my life, and the life of my family, more than any other book we have ever read.

Would you review the Bible or the Koran? At the same time, it's difficult to escape the Book of Mormon, just as you can't seem to get rid of those LDS missonaries roaming up and down the country on their bicycles, with their \\"Elder Johnson\\" nametags and short haircuts. They speak pretty good Swedish too, albeit with a terrible accent. By the way, here in Sweden, the LDS Church wants to look vaguely \\"politically correct\\", so they even use young women as missionaries. \\"Sister Johnson\\", I believe?Many Swedes have seen the Book of Mormon. But how many have actually read it? Very few, I think. I might be the only one. By the way, did I mention that I have \\"Lamanite\\" ancestry? Might impress the sisters.So what can I say about the Book of Mormon? First, it's important to realize that this book isn't the whole of Mormonism. In fact, the more peculiar and exotic doctrines of the Mormons are not to be found in this book. In order to get a real feel for Mormonism, you must also read \\"Doctrine and Covenants\\" and \\"Pearl of Great Price\\". Another good idea might be to read a book about Mormons, written by an outsider. To take just one example, the Book of Mormon condemns polygamy. Later, Joseph Smith got other ideas on the subject...As for the Book of Mormon itself, it's easy to see how it might have inspired settlers in the Wild West during the 19th century. Indeed, it comes across as something of a settler Bible, being a story about migrations from the Old World to America, wars between Whites (\\"Nephites\\") and Indians (\\"Lamanites\\"), and above all, the conviction that America is God's chosen nation. For it's quite obvious that the \\"Nephites\\" and their semi-democratic republic is really a symbol for 19th century frontier America, whatever else it might be besides. And while many non-Mormons find the book tedious and repetitive, I can imagine that it might have looked very different for those who really \\"lived their faith\\" in Jackson County, Nauvoo or Utah.But is it true? I guess that's the $10,000 question. I for one don't believe it. The Book of Mormon is purported to be a translation of a real document found by the Mormon prophet Joseph Smith inside Hill Cumorah. However, modern archeology has completely failed to verify any of its claims. Besides, the original document was supposedly taken to heaven by an angel, making it impossible for historians to examine it! The Book of Mormon is essentially a hyper-diffusionist work, claiming that civilization was brought to the Americas by large-scale migrations of Old World peoples. And while these peoples were presumably Semitic, the Book of Mormon portrays them as lily White. Indeed, the darker skin-color of the American Indians (\\"Lamanites\\") is said to be a divine curse. Of course, these notions of racial superiority over the natives, might also have appealed to the White settlers at the frontier. Even Whites who for pragmatic reasons wanted to reach some kind of accommodation with the Indians - the Mormons surely wanted this - nevertheless felt superior to them. In the Book of Mormon, \\"good\\" Indians are sometimes converted to Christianity and hence become peaceful, and in some cases, even get their White skin-color back.The Book of Mormon is thus best analyzed and understood in its 19th century historical context. It's indeed \\"another testament of Jesus Christ\\", but it's a testament ghost-written by Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"Whether or not you believe that Mormonism is the way to go, this book is an amazing read and will open your eyes to a new way of life."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"\\"Concerning this record the Prophet Joseph Smith said: \\"I told the brethren that the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book.\\"*Paragraph from the introduction pageWe read of our Savior and his good news in the Bible.

The LDS church has been trying to give this book away for decades. And it's not easy. I was raised in a devout Mormon family, and had to commit to giving away dozens of these books over the course of my early adulthood. At the time, I sincerely believed that God wanted me to do this. Even then, it was nearly impossible to get people to take it. I had an English teacher kindly take me aside and explain how poorly written the book is, that it was an obvious and well-known fake to any scholar that wasn't Mormon (and even to some that were). And, Ms. Constance Wray, for the record, you were entirely correct about that.But, that was before I grew up, got an education, and realized that this book is a hoax.The LDS church hopes to legitimize this book by selling it in a mainstream market. Luckily, you have access to the internet, so before you buy this book, do a little research about it. Try www.exmormon.org as a start. Or, read Grant Palmer's book on origins of the LDS church (he's a mormon historian that is about to be excommunicated from the church for trying to tell the well-documented truth about the origins of the church).There is a reason that there is a growing trend of people resigning from this church. It's simply because the foundation of the church, i.e. The Book of Mormon, is NOT the word of God, and no amount of mental gymnastics or fringe scholarship can make a sow's ear into a silk bag."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I can't believe the animosity some reviewers have towards the Book of Mormon!

I honestly can't feel defensive about this. I love Joseph Smith for translating and giving his life for this book and for restoring Christs church. He was a prophet the same as the men in the Bible and the Book of Mormon. He was so because he was more meek and humble than any other man on the earth at that time.

As a former missionary of the Mormon church, I gave away many copies of this book together with my heartfelt testimony of its truthfulness.At 47 years of age, I encountered some troubling matters concerning the doctrine and history of the church. The more I studied the more I doubted the veracity of Joseph Smith's story. In fact, within two months of honest inquiry into the broader history of the church, I quit believing. Losing one's faith is akin to losing a loved one; it is a very traumatic life phase to come to grips with.Now I am no longer of member of the Mormon church. If I read, hear, or see the church's version of its history today, there is no feeling whatsoever. As a result of what I have learned, I must call the Book of Mormon a work of 18th century fiction, drawing heavily upon the King James Bible and other works of Joseph Smith's day (A View of the Hebrews by Ethan Smith).Apparently, Joseph Smith would place seer stones into a hat, hold it tightly to his face, and dictate lengthy passages of the book. By then, he was well-known for using folk magic of this sort to discover buried treasure, although he was not very successful in the former endeavor.For over 170 years, the Mormon church has grown and they claim about 12 million members today. From what I have observed, their membership is seriously hemorrhaging and inactivity is rampant.Leaders of the church have prophesied that the Book of Mormon would flood the earth. They take in 10% of the faithful's gross income and members themselves pay thousands of dollars for their 19 to 20-year-old sons to go on full-time missions. I am surprised at the church's marketing ploy to sell their book through mainstream retail outlets.If you aren't a member and you buy the book, don't be surprised if two young men come knocking at your door with the rest of the story; but they won't tell you about the \\"unfaithful history\\" or the problems associated with historical mormonism. Neither will they offer much of the meat of the religion, concerning temples and the resultant commitments devolving upon active members.I would suggest that investigators google Joseph Smith and the Book of Mormon and ask the hard questions that Mormons may or may not want to answer.Keith Vaught"},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"some of you might not believe me since this is one of the main books of the church but please listen. I may be young but I know and can almost garuntee that this is a great book! Also i am defintely not the most religious of the mormons but I know that this book is true! People criticize it because it has carnage and says and it came to pass alot but first of all this is ancient text! Of course there will be stuff like and it came to pass! And also you can not change history! Rather you like it or not there was a lot of carnage back then! It also does not focus on it but rather instaed by writing about it it shows the sorrows and greif caused by war! This book does not encourage it but rather tries to dispense of it! Would YOU change the word of god because it says carnage alot? I rest my case. all in all this is great book with great prophets of the lord whos only job is to try to help us return to god on high!

Someone who is a believing member would find it to be of value on a purely emotional level, but for the rest of us (what LDS call gentiles), the Book of Mormon has no value what so ever. I find it difficult to believe that I ever took it seriously. The book is just badly written fiction. You can get a copy here for $0.01 which is about what it's worth, but don't forget shipping and handling which makes the purchase of that rag a poor value.There are many fine books on Amazon.com that address Mormonism in a much more honest way.

The Mormon Church teaches that there is more than one god; the BOM says there is only one; the Mormons require baptism for the dead; the BOM makes no mention of baptism for the dead.

If you want the word of God undiluted, buy a copy of the Bible. And leave the Book of Mormon well alone. Incidentally, the Book of Mormon originally credited Joseph Smith with being the author of the Book of Mormon, rather than the translator.I was also intrigued to discover that as well as claiming to use a translating device supplied by God, Joseph used a seer stone that he had found down a deep hole whilst looking for some buried treasure (or water, I forget which) by using magic. The seer stone he found he used to translate the Book of Mormon by pressing it against his forehead, whilst he had a black hat wrapped round his face to keep out the light.Sounds rather too New Age or Occult to be anything nearing mainstream Christianity.

For example, there are thousands of verses that begin with the phrase \\"And it came to pass...\\" Also contained are long passages that seem to have been lifted directly from the King James Bible. These two features combine to make this book a challenging read. Challenging in that one quickly loses interest. Furthermore, there are multiple examples where words seem to have been made up by the author. For example: cumom, curelom (types of animals), sheum (a word for a crop), etc.I would not recommend this book for children because of its descriptions of violence. Examples of such include the decapitation of a drunk man, a decapitated body moving about of its own volition, and a scene where hundreds have their arms chopped off.There are also disturbing tones of racism contained in the book. In the story, when the \\"Lamanite\\" sect purportedly disobeys the laws of God, they become \\"Dark and Loathsome.\\" It should be noted that in the current version of this book, this phrase may have been changed to be more politically correct."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"Although I have always believed that a person should be judged on their characteristics and personality, their love for God is what really sets them apart.

God gave Joesph a pair of special spectacles, a breastplate, a hat, and a magic stone.

Its just an entirely different experience reading through the text, and its closer to how it was originally published. This is an incredible book, translated through the power of God, that tells plain and simple truths about the purpose of man, our relationship to God, and the divinity of Christ.One of the ways the BoM teaches is through repetition - you can see how the cycle of sin repeats itself: wickedness and destruction -&#62; humility -&#62; acceptance of gospel principles -&#62; people are happy -&#62; wealth and power increase -&#62; pride and sin -&#62; wickedness and destruction. Through these examples I have been able to correct things in my own life, and the book is a constant comfort when I have questions.Whether or not you believe in the manner in which the BoM came into existence, it is worth reading...and learning for yourself.

I read it three times and never got a testimony, went on a mission - and deeply regret the time I threw away on something I never believed and the many baptisms I performed trying to believe. It is easy to see through this book now, since not only is there absolutely no archeological, historical, genetic, geological, etc. evidence of the great civilizations documented therein, but it is now clear that Joseph Smith actually made the same mistakes in his account of the many chapters of the Old Testament Book of Isaiah more or less copied into 2nd Nephi that were made by the team that produced the King James Version of the Bible. Why? Because there was no translation of gold plates; Smith merely copied stuff from many parts of the Bible, inserted Protestant sermons he heard over and over when he was a kid, used local and family stories and names, and his very fertile imagination (read Lucy Mack Smith's accounts of Joseph's stories as a boy) for the rest.I think mormons now believe it only because they don't know what else to do. It was an embarrassment to Smith later in his life, and now to the mormon church, though its members are literally terrified to see it for what it is. Benefit from my experience and use it for a doorstop, or a short table leg.I give it two stars because of its historical significance only.And if you search for Mr. Palmer's book, be careful not to get stuck on Clayton Newell's similarly titled book, which is more fluff for the shorn sheep in the church."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"It asks you to ask God whether or not it is true.Testing God is a sin.A book written by a true prophet would not ask you to sin.It contradicts other mormon books of theology.Ask any mormon if God and Jesus are the same person.Look at 2 Nephi 31:21.Joseph Smith was a false prophet, predicting the return of Jesus in 1891, and that God would let Smith triumph over his enemies. Smith was killed in a gunfight with an enemy, and Jesus of course, did not come back in 1891.Why, if the American Indians were descended from Lehi, was there such diversity in their languages, and why were there no vestiges of Hebrew in any of them?Why does the Book of Mormon say that Lehi found horses when he arrived in America? The horse did not exist in the Americas until the Spaniards brought them over in the sixteenth century.Why was Nephi stated to have a bow of steel? Jews did not have steel at that time, and no iron was smelted in the Americas until the Spanish colonization.Why does the Book of Mormon mention \\"swords and cimeters\\" when scimitars (the current spelling) did not come about until the rise of Islam after 500 A.D.?Why does the Book of Mormon mention silk, when silk did not exist in the Americas at that time?Faith is only as powerful as the religion you place it in.

There have been books written after the official canonical Bible (now called King James Bible) that are divinely inspired, like the Qur'an, the Raatib by Muhammad Ahmad Al Mahdi, the Holy Tablets by Malachi York, just to name a few. Joseph Fielding Smith(1805-1844) is quoted as saying &quot;the teachers of religion...understood the same passages of scripture so differently as to destroy all confidence in settling the question by an appeal to the Bible&quot;. This would explain the reason why he wrote the Book of Mormon, he was tired of traditional Christianity. Note also he was a mason. He became a mason in 1842 borrowing masonic rituals for mormon ceremonies eliminating what he regarded as curruption of the original Hebrew forms. If the Mormon Bible is supposedly an ancient tablet, how are these quotes in the Mormon Bible that are verbatim from the quotes in the King James version of the Bible? Note also that if you look up the name Mormon itself, you will find that it means &quot;A Ghoul, Bugbear, Sceptre, Hobgoblin, A Gargoyle, A Spirit, Spook, Ogre&quot;.Overall, the Book of Mormon is fascinating to read, except if you're a Black person, because on p.61, 21-25 &amp; p. 201 verse 6-9:&quot;And the skin of the Lamanites were dark according to the mark which was set upon their fathers which was a curse upon them because of their transgressions and their rebellion against their brethren.&quot;"},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"When I started reading the BOM I did alittle research about Joseph Smith on the side. His life as a reputable prophet soon became suspect. However I will leave you the reader to find that out for yourself since I'm not interested in \\"second hand information\\".What I found while reading the BOM was very poor archeological evidence, racist attitudes concerning those with dark skin, and a continuation of myths taken from the King James Version.I love to go arrowhead hunting. In my collection I have an arrowhead named the Greeneville Point. It is dated at 1500 to 3000 years old. My point here is that if I, an amateur in the field can find such a tiny find, why have'nt the thousands of professionals over the centuries found the swords, breastplates, chariots, temples and cities disscribed in Mr. Smith's book? We are told in the BOM that literally millions died in numerous wars, but there is just no evidence. Of course Mr. Smith , to his credit, does tell of a few instances where God covers these sites with mountains and sinks some into the sea. However this is not done in everycase which would still leave us with a wealth of evidence. But alas there is none.Slavery was a hot issue in Joseph Smith's time. To the Mormon's credit they were anti-slavery. But people of color, both in Christianity and in Mormonism, were seen to be \\"filthy and loathsome\\" people. Wheather we are talking about the curse of Ham, or the curse of the Lamanites, judging a person's worth by the color of their skin is inexcusable.Then there is the everpresent mythological creatures. Mr. Smith, who is supposedly inspired by divine forces of truth is'nt told to correct these errors which he borrows from the King James Version. We are told of three such creatures. The satyrs, the dragon, and the mischievous cockatrice. (2NEPHI 21:8 and 2NEPHI 23:21-22)SATYRS: Part man part goat this greek myth is more well known as Pan.DRAGON: This one needs little defining. Although some translatters may see this as representing a crocadile, or even Satan himself. The important note here is that Mr. Smith fails to clear-up the confusion, but simply passes it on.COCKATRICE:Part chicken, part snake, this creature could kill you with a glance.Mr.Smith knew he was'nt the best author in the world so he covers his bases by stating imperfection in the text(MORMON 8:12,17 and latter in chapter 9:31-33). So we have to ask ourselves if GOD wanted his word to be accurate and uncorrupted why not write it himself and just let Mr.Smith find it in that form. Perfect, without mistranslation and not in Old English?Then there is God destroying whole communities because of the sins of unbelievers. I guess God does'nt have a problem with \\"collateral damage\\". (2NEPHI 23:16,18/HELAMAN 11:4-6,15:2-3)In my studies I've come to the truth that all religions are based on mythology. I have no doubt that in the future Mr. Smith's book earn him a footnote among the rest. The late Mr. Joseph Campbell once wrote that if you study other peoples religions and mythologies you will get a better sense of mythos in your own religion. As an ex-christian for over 20 years my studies have led me to agree with Mr. Campbell. But as I've stated before in my reviews, don't take my word for it.

I am humbly thankful to not be hard-hearted to the point that I cannot be taught the truth of it by the Spirit that accompanies it.

They haven't ever taken the time to meet a Latter-day Saint (which is the perferred term) without trying to evangelize to them, nor have they spoken with a missionary from the Church. Most of them just read literature that feeds thier hate! I think it is sadness that so many would spend so much time and money tearing down others' faith. How offensive to God to have church meetings often titled &quot;Get To Know the Mormons Night&quot; where the spirit of Satan is ever present and influencing those who participate in any capacity to persecute a mostly decent and certainly God-fearing people. The adversary of truth will deceive as long as people let him. Shame on those who do.I have done some research on &quot;anti-Mormon&quot; claims, one of them being that Mormons say the Native Americans were Jewish. DNA has shown the Native Americans not to be decendants of Judah. Does this refute the claims made by Mormons? I have found this NOT to be the case. The Book of Mormon peoples were decendants of Manasseh. They followed the Hebrew faith, but were not of Judah, as are Jews of today.Another misconception that pours out of the mouths of &quot;Mormon-haters&quot; is that pre-Jesus baptisms and other Christian ways found in the Book of Mormon do not fit even a simple timeline of Christianity. This is easy to debate! John the Baptist baptised before Jesus started His ministry. 'Nuff said. =)The only true way to learn about someone or something is to GO TO THE SOURCE.

If it is so true and vital to your relationship with God to know how terrible the Mormons are; if the intent of the authors of &quot;anti-Mormon&quot; literature were concerned for your very soul as a child of our Heavenly Father, then they would be GIVING AWAY THEIR WARES out of love and humility before Him who created them. The &quot;Mormon-haters&quot; message would be one of love and peace, not of disdain and willfull pride. &quot;By their fruits, ye shall know them.&quot;In comparison, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints gives away stuff all the time.

I think the members of the religion are generally good people with good intentions. However, because the Mormons are so invested in their religion, they will only present their religion in the best possible light and avoid controversial issues-- which are many. If you are looking into the religion, be sure to investigate all facets of their beliefs including their views on race and plural marriage before deciding. I think it's only fair that someone be informed of the whole religion and it's history, and not avoiding beliefs that may turn someone off of the church.Some interesting passages in the Book of Mormon include: 2 Nephi 5: 21. 3 Nephi 2: 15"},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"This book was an sad attempt by Joseph Smith to create scripture.

There is no doubt that the Book of Mormon has made an enormous impact on the lives of millions.There is also no doubt that it fails abysmally in what it purports to be. It purports to be a record of the history of early America during the millennium covered by the years 600 BC thru about 400 AD. Absolutely NO archeological evidence has ever been found to support the claim that a band of Hebrews left the Middle East and settled in the New World, becoming the ancestors of Native Americans. Some Mormon apologists have disingenuously claimed that the Smithsonian Institution has used the Book of Mormon in archeological research. Since 1951 the Smithsonian has issued a point blank, categorical denial that they have ever used the Book of Mormon as an aid to archeological research. See their website.This lack of evidence for the historicity of the Book of Mormon contrasts sharply with the wealth of archeological evidence that exists in support of the historicity of the Bible. Biblical scholars might debate issues such as dating and chronology, but none dispute the actual existence of the evidence. The issue for Biblical scholars is not do these places exist, but how do we interpret the data in the light of the text, and vice versa? Mormon scholars on the other hand have to deal with the fact that they have absolutely NO data with which to work, other than the Book of Mormon itself.Another problem for the claims of the Book of Mormon is the fact that the science of genetics has proven conclusively that Native American peoples have absolutely no genetic similarieties to Hebrew peoples but are strongly related to people from eastern Central Asia, especially those from Siberia.The only conclusion one can come to is that the Book of Mormon is what it is, namely a 19th century work by Joseph Smith. As such, it is creatively innovative and clearly the work of a religious genius and will continue to influence the relgious lives of millions. The true believers among them will be unswayed by the fact that there is no evidence for its claim that it is an ancient text. This lack of evidence will keep the rest of us in healthy skepticism re its claims of antiquity, we will continue to recognize that it comes from the fertile mind of Joseph Smith. It is a book reflects the ferment of religious ideas current in early 19th century America.Two stars as nothing more an interesting read of religious and historical fiction."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"This Book can bring a remarkable power into your life.

It will give hope and peace to anyone that reads it just like it did for me."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"Some day while you're sitting peaceably at home, two well-dressed, well-groomed, exceedingly polite young men will show up on your doorstep. If allowed, these missionaries will give you a message about God's extraordinary love, sin, repentance, and salvation. And they will also hand you a copy of one of the world's strangest books.The Book of Mormon, written by Joseph Smith, purports to be a revelation from God on par with the Holy Bible. It is a narrative about a group of Jews who flee Jerusalem and found several large civilizations in the Americas. Most people who try reading it need only a few pages to see that it's a farce. A handful of intelligent, honest, ethical, well-read people instead find it to be so beautiful and moving that it can only be divinely inspired wisdom. Why the difference in opinion? Well, the best way to answer that is to read it for yourself.The Book of Mormon begins with a Jewish man, Levi, fleeing the wrath of King Zedekiah in 600 B.C. Taking his family, they first camp by a river on the east shore of the Red Sea. After spending a time living richly by hunting and gathering fruit in that area, they travel to an uninhabited harbor called Bountiful on the south shore of Arabia. (At this point you may be asking questions such as: How could they flee Zedekiah in 600 B.C. when he didn't become king until years later? Why did they find that river when any map will confirm that there is no such river in that location? How did they hunt and gather in that region when it's a barren wilderness? And where did they find an empty harbor when the southern shore of Arabia was densely inhabited at that time in history? If you ask irritating questions like that, Mormonism probably isn't the religion for you.)After sailing from Arabia to America in a small boat, Lehi's family wastes no time in spawning a thriving civilization. Soon they split into two groups, white-skinned Nephites and inferior Lamanites with dark skin. The bulk of the book is packed with events vaguely reminiscent of the Old Testament. Nations fall into sin and wickedness, God appoints prophets to rant and rave, battles are fought, and so forth. Near the end Jesus Christ drops in (literally) to repeat the Sermon on the Mount and appoint twelve disciples. After that, it seems as if the author got bored since he rushes through centuries of time in just a few pages, kills off the Nephites, and wraps the book up with a bizarre rant against infant baptism.What to make of all this? I feel pretty confident that it's not a genuine revelation from God. Almost every page is stamped with some major mistake. First, much as defenders may hate to admit it, the book clearly says that the Nephite and Lamanite civilizations covered most of North and South America. As not even the slightest trace of either civilization has ever been found, that should wrap the question up right there. Further, Joseph Smith simply copied details from the Bible into his fictional accounts, where they don't fit at all. His civilizations raised flocks of sheep, goats, cattle, and horses, all of which were actually introduced to the Americas from Europe centuries later. The Book of Mormon mentions brass, bronze, iron, copper, and steel, yet none of those metals were mined in the ancient Americas. It mentions keys and locks, metal swords, suits of armor, ships, and anchors, which are also completely anachronistic. It has similar problems with food, drink, fabrics, tools, types of buildings, etc... At the same time, the Book of Mormon makes no mention of any distinctive animals, plants, buildings, or clothing that did exist in pre-Colombian America.As literature, it is equally far off the mark. While a few parts ring with a certain poetic resonance, nothing really stands out. Certainly nothing comes close to matching the magnificent writing of the Bible. Joseph's Smith clearly set out to write prose in imitation of the King James Version, yet his poor grasp of the language produced often hilarious results. For example, not knowing that \\"it came to pass\\" indicates passage of time, he often has dialogues or speeches where every sentence starts with \\"it came to pass\\". Even worse, Smith uses the phrases \\"come in unto\\" and \\"go in unto\\" without knowing that these are biblical euphemisms for sex. Hence those who are fluent in Shakespearean may find themselves chuckling at lines like \\"The Queen desired that Ammon should come in unto her.\\" [Alma 19:2]The morality in the Book of Mormon is basically a match for the history. The ranting prophets pretty much take their cues from the Old Testament with spiels against murder, theft, adultery, and such. Missing is any trace of the true gospel message of radical, transforming love. While your missionaries will no doubt advice that you pray to God concerning the truthfulness of this book, that shouldn't be necessary for any thinking person. It is either true or false. History, literary analysis, and religion all clearly say false.One thing is clear, that despite the notorious antics of their forefathers, today's Mormons are a very straight-laced bunch. Many Christians may see their principles and strong family values and wonder whether, despite the apparent loopiness, there is something in the Book of Mormon after all. If you're in that category, here are some important facts that the missionaries won't tell you.1) The Book of Mormon that you get today is not the original. Joseph Smith's first version, despite its supposedly divine origins, was packed with errors in spelling, grammar, usage, logic, continuity, and chronology. Over the years the LDS Church has been forced to make thousands of changes to cover up these embarrassing mistakes.2) While we can't double-check Smith's translation of the Book of Mormon because an angel conveniently retrieved the original to Heaven, we can double-check something else. Joseph Smith also wrote the Book of Abraham, allegedly translated from ancient Egyptian documents, which is also part of Mormon scripture. However, Egyptologists who have compared Smith's translation to the originals have found that it's a complete fraud.3) Joseph Smith was a professional con artist. Both before and after writing the Book of Mormon, he bilked people with fake treasure hunts. He also ran a fraudulent bank, the Kirtland Safety Society Bank, that issued phony money. He was, in short, very good and deceiving and manipulating people.4) In addition to receiving new scriptures, Joseph Smith also claimed to be a prophet who received many direct revelations from God. Among others divine revelations, he claimed that Solomon's Temple would be rebuilt in Missouri, that Christ would return by 1885, and that missionaries would bring his gospel to the moon and to a secret continent \\"beyond the North Pole\\". (His successor, Brigham Young, continued the space exploration theme by announcing that the sun and planets are inhabited.)5) One of Smith's most important \\"revelations\\" is the Great Endowment Ceremony conducted in Mormon pemples. It involves donning special clothes, being washed in a special basin, watching a hokey play about God's \\"plan of salvation\\", and learning secret code words and handshakes that will supposedly allow you to reach the highest level of Heaven after death. In reality, Joseph Smith copied almost the entire ceremony from the freemasons, who he briefly joined in 1839. Since that time, the LDS Church has changed the ceremony by removing the more embarrassing parts.6) During Joseph Smith's early life in Vermont and New York, the region was jam-packed with all manner of prophets, visionaries, and would-be messiahs, many of whom were making claims very similar to his own. Research names such as Isaac Bullard, Elias Smith, and Asa Wild and you'll see that Joseph Smith copied parts of the Book of Mormon and later revelations more or less directly from other sources.7) But wait, there's more! If you want to know plenty of other things about Mormonism that the missionaries won't tell you just search on google for \\"concerns about Mormonism\\". Then you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"So how do I describe a book that has meant so much to me?

In the spring of 1820, when Joseph was 14 years-old, he was much disturbed by the competing claims of the ministers in the area, and frustrated that \\"the teachers of religion....understood the same passages of scripture so differently as to destroy all confidence in settling the question by an appeal. Many reviewers on this board are just spouting off at the mouth. There is know way for them to claim that the book of Mormon is fictional. They can't prove it, by them saying that this book is not true is akin to them saying that GOD doesn't answer prayers and doesn't interact with humans anymore. There is no way possible to prove that Joseph Smith didn't see what he said he saw. Since that is the case then you have to take into account that it is possible that GOD preserved this ancient record for the benefit of his church in the latter days. The only way to know if this is the word of GOD is to read it and pray with a sincere heart asking in faith. The arguments against this book on this review board are weak at best. Why wouldn't the Book of Mormon be like reading the Bible. If the Bible is the word of GOD (and it is) then the Book of Mormon would read just like it. 25% of the Book is Isaiah teachings, which are for the benefit of the children of GOD in the last days. To say that the Book of Mormon is stealing from the Bible is just further proof that GOD wants people to understand his teachings better.As for the comment about the Solomon Spaulding book, that is just plain false.

It is a companion to the Bible and has been translated into 95 different languages. God wants all to read it and pray about its truthfulness.It contains the teachings of Jesus Christ through the history of the people whose lives were documented by prophets among them. The highlight of the book is when Jesus comes to visit the people to instruct and bless them and their children (see 3 Nephi Chapter 11). Anyone who believes in Christ, reads it and prays about its truthfulness will gain a testimony of it(see Moroni 10:3-5).I have read and studied the book for 5 years now and as a result have united myself with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.

This book does not tell you that:1. Mormons are expected to give 10% of their annual income to the Church.2. Mormons are expected to be interviewed at least annually by \\"bishops\\" (local men in the congregations with no psychological or pastoral training) who then ask private, prurient questions including the type of underwear they have on and whether they engage in self-stimulation.3. Mormons cannot invite their non-Mormon relatives or friends to witness their wedding ceremonies if their weddings take place in one of their temples.

It is a literal history of a group of Hebrewic Jews who taversed the Atlantic and landed in the America's about 600 years before Jesus. The American Indians are the 'literal' descendents of these Hebrewic people, yet DNA evidence have disproven the foundation of this premise. Indeed the entire book is the history of these people who never existed. The archeological inconsistancies abound. In the BoM we find horses, elephants, steel, domestic sheep, and many other animals and plants that were not found on the American continent in the time period.The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints lately refers to the BoM as 'spiritually true'. Many scholars and apologists for the church no longer hold the book as being 'literal' or a factual history, but rather an inspired book that contains truth on the nature and spirit of Jesus. This seems to be an admission of the FALSITY of the book, yet these same people can stand up and say without reserve that &quot;I know the Book of Mormon is true&quot;. I just want to know what &quot;true&quot; means.There is much better fiction out there that is engaging and meaningful, fiction that embraces the spirit of peace and helps people to new heights of understanding. By the standards of the CoJCoLDS all fiction is 'true'."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"Marjohna Kathryn MadsenThe Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Christ is an enlighting guide to spiritual truths that will improve your attitude and disposition, if you embrace its teachings. I delight in such passages as 3 Nephi 11:29 \\"For verily, verily I say unto you, he that hath a spirit of contention is not of me, but is of the devil, who is the father of contention, and he stirreth up the hearts of men to contend with anger, one with another,\\" Though I have very deep convictions about the truth and what is right or wrong, and sometimes disagree strongly with the ideas of others, this book encourages me to be meek.I also enjoyed a gem that I discovered in Alma 34:37-38, \\"And now, my beloved brethren, I desire that ye should remember these things, and that ye should work out your salvation with fear before God, and that ye should no more deny the coming of Christ; that ye contend no more against the Holy Ghost, but that ye receive it, and take upon you the name of Christ, that ye humble yourselves, even to the dust, and worship God, in whatsoever place ye may be in, in spirit and truth; and that ye live in thanksgiving daily for the many mercies and blessings which he doth bestow upon you.\\" Now isn't that just beautiful? What a cure for the ills of human conditions and relations.I will try not to belabor the point. But please forebear to hear one more of my favorites from 2Nephi 2, \\"Adam fell that men might be; and men are that they might have joy. And the Messiah commeth in the fulness of time, that he may redeem the children of men from the fall. And because that they are redeemed from the fall, they have become free forever, knowing good from evil; to act for themselves and not to be acted upon... And they are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil; for he seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself.\\" I think that is the epitome of Christian thought beautifully expressed in the elevated and susinct literary language of scripture.Now detractors have been raging against this book and its believers for a long time. Four generations of my family have faced mockery and scorn and sometimes persecution. It doesn't really bother me much. It's somewhat old news. Since the last reviewer quoted Mark Twain, I would like to quote him also, in one of his better moods, just to remind us all not to take ourselves too seriously. He wrote upon the occaision of meeting Brigham Young, the prophet after Joseph Smith was murdered. \\"The second day, we went and paid a state visit to the King (Brigham Young). He seemed a quiet, kindly, easy-mannered, dignified, self-possessed old gentleman of fifty-five or sixty... He was very simply dressed and was just taking off a straw hat as we entered. He talked about Utah, and the Indians, and Nevada, and general American matters and questions, with our secretary and certain government officials who came with us. But he never paid any attention to me, notwithstandng I made several attempts to 'draw him out' on federal politics and his high-handed attitude toward Congress. I thought some of the things I said were rather fine. But he merely looked around at me, at distant intervals, something as I have seen a benignant old cat look around to see which kitten was meddling with her tail. By and by I subsided into an indignant silence, and sat until the end, hot and flushed and execrating him in my heart for an ignorant savage. But he was calm. His conversation with those gentlemen flowed as sweetly and peacefully and musically as a summer brook. When the audience was ended and we were retiring from the presence, he put his hand on my head, beamed down on me in an admiring way and said to my brother, \\"Ah - your child, I pressume? Boy or girl?\\""},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"While I am not a 'believer' in Mormonism in any sense, I have often looked at the book of Mormon with fascination in the secondhand bookstores here. Quite often it is tucked away in the religious section like a Gideon's New Testament, alluring yet strange.I would agree with Harold Bloom that Smith is a Gnostic religious thinker. His visions have much in paralell with William Blake, though Smith believed he was receiving his visions by angels and Smith's works are not poetic as Blake's were. Looking at his biography Smith was clearly a charismatic man, a man of the people, and genuinely believed his revelations were true. In this sense he belongs to other prophetic figures such as Mohmamed, Jesus, and more recently, the Bab of the B'Hai faith.The Book of Mormon tells the story of the expulsion of the Twelve Tribes of Israel after the destruction of the Temple. In Smith's belief system, these tribes set sail for the Americas and settled there, constructing a number of civilisations. The most recent aspect of this diaspora was the Mormon movement itself, whose place in the world was given providentially by God and revealed to him by Joseph Smith.Mormonism contains many beliefs which from the viewpoint of the older branches of Christianity, are heretical or heterodox. These include seeing God as a finite rather than infinite being, seeing the Trinity as essentially three different persons but not as one being, and various other beliefs which make little sense to the outsider. The book itself is styled on the King James Bible and is probably best heard aloud rather than read.Clearly some of the claims of the book conflict with archaeological and historical evidence, but then so does the Bible and other religious scriptures. The key to a religion is not whether it conforms to scientific history but the spiritual life of the religion itself, expressed in the life and hearts and minds of believers, and no doubt to beleiving mormons, Smith's works contain the same power and beauty that the Bible does to mainstream Christians, or the Qu'ran does to believing Muslims. Clearly there is a point where 'unless you have faith, you will not understand', but one doesn't need to have faith to be interested in Mormonism and its texts."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"The Book of Mormon will bring you closer to Christ then any other book. It truly is the most important book ever! For those of you who are skeptics, please take the Book of Mormon challenge. Read it (you don't even have to read the whole thing) and ask God if it's true. Don't get down if you don't get an answer right away, but keep studying and praying about it and you will have the Holy Ghost confirm to you that it is true. What greater witness can you receive? Try it. What do you have to lose?"},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"First of all, let me state that I am a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS), or Mormon Church, as it is sometimes called. As such, I believe the Bible to be the word of God. I study the Bible faithfully and regularly, but I also believe the Book of Mormon to be the word of God. I believe that just as Jesus taught the people who lived in and near the city of Jerusalem during his life, he also visited and instructed others around the world after his death and resurrection. I believe the Book of Mormon to be an account written by men who were called by God. Most of these men were prophets, just like Noah, Abraham, and Moses.The Book of Mormon begins with the writings of a prophet named Nephi, who lived in the city of Jerusalem with his family, around 600 years before the birth of Christ. Being led by the Lord, he and his family were directed to leave Jerusalem and travel through the wilderness until they reached the sea. Once there, Nephi was instructed to build a ship and sail to what would later become America. These people, who were called \\"Nephites,\\" believed devoutly in Jesus Christ. In fact, Nephi wrote of a detailed vision he had of Christ's birth several hundred years before the event. The Nephite civilization continued for hundreds of years until Christ visited them in the Western Hemisphere, after his crucifixion and resurrection in Jerusalem. Their society persisted for another 400 years after Christ's appearance, until warfare destroyed their entire population. We do believe, however, that a remnant of the initial group, called \\"Lamanites,\\" whose leader, Laman, first sailed with Nephi from Jerusalem continued to thrive and are the ancestors of some Native American peoples.The metal records kept by Nephite prophets and other important men of the time were buried in the earth around 400 A.D. and were later discovered by Joseph Smith in the early 1800s, after Joseph was directed to their location by an angel. By the grace and power of God, Joseph was able to translate the ancient language contained on the metal plates into English, and subsequently the first copies of the Book of Mormon were printed in 1830.At this point I could choose to offer my rebuttals regarding what I believe has falsely been reported by several nay-saying reviewers, who have suggested that the Book of Mormon may be proven false based on some loosely defined historical and geological \\"facts.\\" I doubt anything I might say could change the opinions of those who believe their convictions are rooted in their subjective evidence, when even a cursory Internet search or a modest understanding of ancient North American history might allow an individual to consider the veracity of the Book of Mormon's premise.Instead, let me simply say that I believe the Book of Mormon to be true in its teachings and declarations. I believe it to be scripture, inspired by our Father in Heaven, and is indeed another witness and testament of Jesus Christ's divinity as our Savior and Redeemer. Though I appreciate how difficult it may be for anyone who has not had personal experience with the book to believe such claims, I still do not hesitate to say that I believe my family and I are blessed with greater peace and happiness and added direction and strength when we study it earnestly together. I honestly feel that these blessings are tangible and realized each time we seriously read, ponder, and apply its teachings to our lives.Much like a person who eats adequate daily servings of fruits, vegetables, and grains and partakes in regular exercise experiences greater health and vitality, I earnestly feel a lifting and strengthening and a genuine sensation of peace and serenity when I read the Book of Mormon. I can't state my feelings about this book more plainly, or more honestly, than that.My one hope is that if you are considering reading the Book of Mormon that you will do so with an honest, sincere, humble, and open mind. If you combine your reading with prayer, I believe your experience with this book will be as grand as mine."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"If you're like me, you will read many books in your life.

I think some of these people have never read it.About the book itself: It's like the Bible, but easier in many ways. The language is a little older than many modern versions of the Bible, though (like the King James Version). The main original documents were handed down through generations, then condensed and compiled, so the chronology flows more smoothly, though it isn't completely continuous.Theologically, it is complementary to the Bible. If you've never read the Bible or are just getting into Christianity, it's a great place to start. If you are already devout but wonder if something's missing or if you just have questions, it's a great place to get answers. If you aren't sure what's true, it can help you figure it out.Obviously I think it's inspired, and a great book. I've read it more than any other. Don't take my word for it.

I don't need physical evidence that this book is true. I don't need physical evidence that Joseph Smith was the translator. I don't need physical evidence that President Hinckley's sayings are true. I believe in this book. People have said that all answers to life are in it. I agree it's not word for word, but an idea to solving problems is in there.I can go on and relate why I said what I did, but it doesn't go with this book. It's full of wars, peace times, social problems and acceptance, calming warm fuzzy moments and a whole slew of other feelings you can get. It will make you mad. It will make you question things. It will help you understand that not everyone is perfect and we all need to work on ourselves.Don't prejudge. Don't hate something because a couple people have negative feelings about it. Try it for yourself. This is a spiritual book and NO ONE can have control over your spiritual life except you!As a friend has written to me about this book (with support from a bunch of other friends)...As someone mentioned before, there are two types of people who will post here- those who believe the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon, and those who hate it with a passion.Instead of taking everything anyone says on these reviews as absolute truth and undeniable wisdom, look at your own experiences with a Mormon you know. Now, NOBODY is perfect, but Mormons are taught to be hardworking, honest, upright and decent individuals. If you know a Mormon who is active in the church, and does read the Book of Mormon, chances are good that you have a good impression of them. I know some Mormons, however, who leave a bad impression...but if you were to ask them and they answered honestly, they would probably not be active or have a testimony of the Book of Mormon.So ask yourself who you're going to believe when it comes to what the Book of Mormon is or isn't about- someone who lives their life by it? Or someone who hates the church and all it stands for? Look at your Mormon friends, if you know any. See what they're about, but again, don't judge the church by the exception; the Mormon who celebrates anti-Mormon principles by the way he or she lives.To get a summary of what Mormons really believe, read their \\"Articles of Faith;\\" 13 tenants of the Mormon faith that can be found at www.lds.org.And read the Book of Mormon yourself if you want to know for sure. The reason why it is being sold here on Amazon while you could get it for free from a missionary is simply so more people can have access to it. It is being sold in places like airports, where travelers can pick it up and read it if they have an interest in it. This is not a scheme for the church to make money- there is some profit in it for the publisher and the distributor, but money is not the focus for the church.If you have any questions on the Articles of Faith, or any other questions about Mormon belief, www.lds.org is the official church website.

I read it daily (along with the Bible), because it brings God's Spirit in my life. It inspires me to make better choices, and gives me the power to resist temptations. It leads me to repent and have faith in Jesus Christ. The words of this scripture lead men, women, and families to Christ. I have been brought closer to God's Holy Son through a study of it's pages. I know MANY people, and have read many reviews of people who have had similar life-changing experiences!Those who are critical it seems look at Mormon doctrine through the window of their own religious beliefs. Is it any wonder then that it doesn't make sense to them? Have these men ever read the Book in its entirety, and then did as exhorted by the prophet Moroni, to ask with a sincere heart and real intent? Or do they simply read with the intention of finding evidence to support their own narrow views and agenda? Below is the promise made in the Book of Mormon, to pray and ask God as an individual son or daughter if the book is true. Could there be a more sure witness than one received from God?3 Behold, I would exhort you that when ye shall read these things, if it be wisdom in God that ye should read them, that ye would remember how merciful the Lord hath been unto the children of men, from the creation of Adam even down until the time that ye shall receive these things, and ponder it in your hearts.4 And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.5 And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things. (Moroni 10:3-5)There are deceivers, and there is truth. The scripture says \\"by the power of the Holy Ghost you may know the truth of all things.\\" (How do you know if you are feeling the spirit? Galatians 5:22-23) The scriptures also say \\"by their fruits ye shall know them.\\" Faithful Mormons endeavor to draw close to God by obeying his commandments. Bending our will to God's instead of the other way around will yield the spiritual growth and progression that others only speak about.There is a power in the Book of Mormon, which for me does not only come through the story line (although it is worth studying, and filled with analogies for our day), but rather from how I feel when I read it. Many righteous men and women, both anciently and in recent history, made great sacrifices for us to have this book. Take advantage of the opportunity to read it, and have that power manifested for good in your life.

I am the only man that has ever been able to keep a whole church together since the days of Adam. A large majority of the whole have stood by me. Neither Paul, John, Peter, nor Jesus ever did it.

When they can get rid of me, the devil will also go.\\" (History of the Church, Vol. 6, p. 408, 409)Yes you read that correctly. The \\"author\\" of this book felt he was better than Jesus Christ.The inside pages of this book provides a written testimony of \\"Three Witnesses\\" and then another \\"Eight Witnesses\\" as to the truthfulness of the alleged \`translation'.Let's take a closer look at each of the \\"Witnesses\\":1). OLIVER COWDERY - He signed his name as witness to the book in 1830 at the age of 24. Cowdery and Smith were third cousins. He was EXCOMMUNICATED from the Mormon Church on April 12, 1838. In 1841 the Mormons published a poem which stated \\"... Or Book of Mormon not his word, because denied by Oliver...\\" -- Seasons and Times, Vol 2, p482. In 1848, ten years after he was excommunicated, Oliver re-applied for membership in the church and was re-baptized. He never again held office within the Mormon church.2). DAVID WHITMER - He heard about Smith through Oliver Cowdery, while visiting Palmyra NY, on a business trip. He served as a scribe to Smith during the alleged translation period in 1829 at the age of 24. He left the church in 1937 and was labeled an \\"apostate\\". He was subsequently EXCOMMUNICATED in 1838. He wrote: \\"... I tell you that in June, 1838, ... [God] told me to 'separate myself from among the Latter-day Saints'... [Address to all believers in Christ, p27, 1887.]3). MARTIN HARRIS - He met Smith in 1827 at the age of 44. At the time he was married to Smith's first-cousin, Lucy Harris. Harris served as Smith's first scribe for the alleged Book of Mormon translation in 1828 at the age of 45, but was removed shortly thereafter, for making sarcastic remarks. He was later re-instated as a scribe shortly after providing Smith with $3,000 for expense of printing the first edition of the book. He was excommunicated AGAIN for the SECOND TIME, in 1842. He was subsequently re-baptized in 1870, 28 years after his second excommunication. During his life span, Harris changed his religious affiliation over 13 times. The Mormons stated of Martin Harris, \\" ... The very countenance of Harris will show to every spiritual-minded person who sees him, that the wrath of God is upon him.\\" [Latter-Day Saint's, Millennial Star, Vol 8 pp124-128.]4). CHRISTIAN WHITMER - Died 6 years after his testimony to the book BEFORE his other family members were Excommunicated.5). JACOB WHITMER - VOLUNTARILY LEFT THE CHURCH6). PETER WHITMER, JR. - Died 7 years after his testimony to the book BEFORE his other family members were Excommunicated.7). JOHN WHITMER - EXCOMMUNICATED in 1838.8). HIRAM PAGE - In 1838 he VOLUNTARILY LEFT THE CHURCH when members of the Whitmer family were excommunicated.9). JOSEPH SMITH, SR. - [Father of Smith - Author] - Stayed in the Mormon church until his death in 1840.10). HYRUM SMITH - [Brother to Smith - Author] - Died in 1844 Carthage, Illinois with Smith.11). SAMUEL H. SMITH - [Brother to Smith - Author] - Stayed in the Mormon church until his death on July 30, 1844.What I have always found fascinating with how this book came to be, is that there is NO written confirmation from anyone who surrounded themselves with Smith [author] during the writing of this book, that said they actually viewed the alleged \`Gold Plates\\" supposedly in his possession. A few of the witnesses did say they saw them with their \\"Spiritual Eyes\\".... they were shown to me by a supernatural power\\" (John Whitmer - History of the Church, Vol. 3, p. 307).The angel took the record and turned the leaves, and showed it to us by the power of God ...\\" (David Whitmer Interview with E. C. Briggs and R. Etzenhouser at Richmond, Missouri, April 25, 1884. Saints' Herald, Volume 31, page 396.)\\"I never saw the gold plates, only in a visionary or entranced state.\\" (Martin Harris - Anthony Metcalf, Ten Years Before the Mast, n.d., microfilm copy, p. 70-71).William Smith stated ... \\"I did not see them uncovered, but I handled them and hefted them while wrapped in a tow frock and judged them to have weighed about sixty pounds. ... Father and my brother Samuel saw them as I did while in the frock. So did Hyrum and others of the family.\\"Each of these men above, were related either by blood or marriage. The only ones who remained with Joseph in the Mormon church were his father and two brothers. If you also notice in the book, there is no original copy of the \\"Testimony\\", only a typed version is provided. If this book is so holy in nature, where are copies of their original signatures with their testimony?If you want to read this book for entertainment, go for it. If you are looking for deep scripture there are too many flaws to count in each and every printing. To date there have been more than 3,000+ changes made to this book.If you are buying it for historical reasons, you might want to hang on to your copy, as in 100 years or so, it will probably be one of a kind, as the \\"brethren\\" no doubt will change it again."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"The Book of Mormon is either a real description and account of the early inhabitants of the Americas, or it is not. There is no other position one can logically take. One cannot take a position that part of it is accurate, and another part was written by a frontiersman as a hoax. If any section is true, then Joseph Smith had to have translated it, as such knowledge did not exist in 1820s. He did not have a library to search and find such information.Given that any section is true implies that the entirety is true, then the next logical conclusion is that Joseph Smith was telling the truth when he said that an angel gave him the inscribed plates. This same angel gave him the tools whereby he was able to translate these inscribed plates into English.If this is all true, (again you only need to be convinced that even one section of the book is accurate), then this book is the most important find in the last 200 years. It describes a being named Jesus Christ visiting a different culture and civilization than the Jews in Jerusalem. Everyone will want to know if this is the same Jesus Christ that was born in Bethlehem, and did he tell this vastly different civilization any thing different than he taught in Israel? On top of that, it would seem that if he did in fact visit these civilizations that he was resurrected in Jerusalem and not still dead.This is very significant.

Who wouldn't want to follow a \\"prophet\\" like that?You know, poor Brigham was a little paranoid; thought everyone was being sent to \\"spy\\" on him. Bloody Brigham could not be fooled! Nope, he sent the Danites (his Destroying Angels) to kill off anyone who left the flock of Mormonism.Gee, with repercussions like that, I think I would have stayed and played along, too... Luckily in this day and age, we can actually research and come to conclusions on our own. No more \\"Pay, Pray and Obey\\".But no Mormon would blame the poor \\"prophet\\". I guess having 55 wives and concubines, (illegally, of course) could make any guy a little paranoid?But don't take my word for it; read the book of morons. Make sure you pray fervently afterward. If you don't feel the \\"burning in your bosom\\", try eating some Mexican food. You'll get the same results. (BTW, to all my Mormon friends... A little Maalox will clear that right up.)"},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I believe this book to be true. I believe that this is the accurate account of the people on the American Continent. I have found places in the book that have shown me that it was translated by Joseph Smith, not written by him.1 Nephi 13:12 foretold Christopher Columbus's voyage to America. I believe Jesus the Christ, the Son of God, went unto the people of the Americas. Although I am only 12 years old, with prayer I read this book and I testify it is a true book."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"Like the Bible, the Book of Mormon was written by many prophets and compiled into one book. These writtings were written by the spirit and can only be understood by the spirit. It is amusing to hear critics complain that Joseph Smith took verses of scripture right out of the Old Testament. The truth is, these prophets had access to the Old Testament by way of brass plates they brought with them across the ocean to the American continent. In their writtings they loved to quote scripture, especially Isaiah. Other critics offer similar complaints but it is clear they do not understand the Book of Mormon. What was written by the spirit must be understood by the spirit, so it is no wonder there is such a great division in peoples opinions about this true book."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I was going to write a long-winded review of this work of fiction, but I see that the ground has already been largely covered. Instead, let me simply add my witness that Mormonism hurts families. The Mormon church is racist, money-hungry, power-hungry and absolutely corrupt.No worries though...the Internet has allowed the dirty truth about Mormonism to reach the masses. The implosion has already started and cannot be stopped. The LDS corporate bosses are powerless to stop it...God bless the Net!!"},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"As a child I had heard the story of Joseph Smith and the golden plates after reading \\"Meet the Mormons.\\" I found the story of a boy who was searching for a true church and found an answer from angels and God to be blueprint for my own search - as I too was confused about the many denominations and sects that existed.Pretty much I assumed that the Book of Mormon was indeed true although I had never read it. One day, a few decades later, I found a Book of Mormon in a used book store and was excited to finally read the book. By that time I already knew Biblical Hebrew and Ancient Greek. I also was extensively educated in ancient religion so I knew a lot about ancient Judaism.I must admit I was sorely disappointed when I finally read the book. There was just NO WAY that these Book of Mormon characters would have foreknowledge of Hellenistic Judaism centuries before the fact! I was also amazed that Book of Mormon prophets could quote St. Paul before Christ was even born! Amazing. All with perfect Koine Greek syntax and idioms! Somehow \\"Reformed Egyptian\\" had Greek influence - even before there was any historical contact between Hellenes and Egyptians or Jews! Wow! Furthermore, some of the names were laughable. There is no way that a Hebrew would name anyone Amulek or Amleki. That is like naming your kid \\"Satanne\\" or \\"Devilman.\\" And these were supposed to be good guys. Joseph Smith obviously didn't understand much about how roots work in Hebrew when he was making up names.Despite the glaring theological and linguistic anachronisms (laying aside anachronisms such as horses!), I still took the \\"Moroni Challenge\\" to pray about the book. The answer always comes very strongly - a glaring NO. This book is NOT true and I bear you my testimony of this.Actually, I am rather disappointed because I like Mormons and think that other aspects of their religion are nice. Mormonism would have much more credibility if it ditched the Book of Mormon. As a Christian, I am aware of the danger of spiritual deception. In true Christianity, one is very suspicious of visions and instructions by angels. Many have been led into perdition because of this. Satan knows how to quote scripture and demons know how to transform themselves into angels of light.I see little difference between the spiritual deception of Joseph Smith and that of Islam's prophet Muhammed. Both were instructed by angels and revealed faiths that led people away from the true Christianity. I pray that Mormons will someday see that they have fallen for one of the many wiles of the evil one who knows perfectly well how to hide falsehood under a cover of righteousness."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"This is a remarkable addition to the cannon of available Judeo-Christian scripture. Written by numerous Israelite authors who imigrated to the New World six hundred years before the birth of Christ, the Book of Mormon is inspired by Christian and ancient Israelite wisdom, doctrine, hope and prophecy. One of the many intriguing parts of the book includes an in-depth view of how these ancient Israelites practiced the Law of Moses and how those beliefs directed their faith toward a vibrant hope in the promised Messiah.The book covers a period from 600 B.C. through 400 A.D. and provides an eye-wintess account of one of numerous civilizations that populated the New World---written as it was by multiple authors of the time. The Book of Mormon chronicles the rise of an ancient society believed to have inhabited a relatively limited geographic region along the Yucatan Peninsula in southern Central America. Included in its pages is an in-depth record of doctrines that provide a fascinating window onto ancient Israelite views of salvation, faith, repentance, pre-mortal and post-mortal life, earth life as a probationary period of mortal testing designed by the Creator, and effectively joins Israelite and Christian beliefs in a seamless doctrinal view that includes valuable teachings about the saving role of the atonment of Christ in the lives of believers.About three quarters of the way through the book, in a section titled \\"Third Nephi\\" after one of the many prophet-authors, is an account of the appearance of Christ after his crucifixion and resurrection in Jerusalem. This portion of the book details a thoroughly captivating addition to the accounts of Christ's ministry in the Old World and is an informative read for anyone interested in the spread of Christ's ministry throughout the anicent world.The book is accepted as scripture by members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (Mormons) and, like the Old and New Testaments, incorporates a complex interweaving of the writings and religious teachings of numerous prophet-leaders who lived prior to and after the advent of Christ. It also touches on the wars, government and economics of these ancient Israelites living in the Americas, but to a much lesser degree than matters of faith.The Book of Mormon is the book that informed the rise of a world wide religious movement---The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints---and is listed by Book Magazine as one of the twenty most influential books that changed America since its founding, standing alongside other classic American works like Uncle Tom's Cabin by Harriet Beecher Stowe and John Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath (see Book Magazine online listing: www.bookmagazine.com/issue29/twenty.shtml).The events surrounding the discovery of the Book of Mormon are, in some respects, as fascinating as the book itself, since they include the visit of a resurrected being---the angel Moroni who as a mortal was among the last prophet/authors to write on the gold plate record and who was responsible for depositing the final draft of plates in a stone box buried in the ground sometime around 400 A.D before his death. This resurrected prophet appeared to Joseph Smith Jr. 1,400 years later and a detailed account of his appearance can be found in the preface written in the straight forward language of Joseph Smith Jr. the translator of the Book of Mormon.Moroni instructed Joseph Smith Jr. where he could unearth the gold plate record buried in a hill not too far distant from his home in upstate New York. The finding and translating of this ancient record established Joseph Smith as a modern-day prophet for members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and in the years following these angelic visits, Joseph Smith Jr. restored numerous ancient covenants promised in the Bible as well as establishing the Church of Jesus Christ with priesthood authority from heaven and organizing the restored church with prophets and apostles similarly to how the church of Christ was organized when Jesus was on the earth.The unearthing of the ancient gold plate record marked the beginning of a prophetic call for Joseph Smith Jr. to do a work unlike any clergy in the modern world. Early in the morning of September 22nd 1827 Joseph Smith ushered into existence aditional Judeo-Christian scripture apropriately sub-titled \\"Another Testament of Jesus Christ\\" and began a dispensation of revelations destined to reach beyond his farming community of Palmyra Township and touch the lives of men and women across the earth who would listen to this new prophet tell of a latter-day restoration when God remembered again his ancient covenants with Israel. Joseph Smith Jr. translated the record from its ancient Semitic dialect and published the translation as the Book of Mormon, fulfilling ancient biblical prophecies that in the last days of the earth God would do a marvelous work among men.If you're interested in religion in general or if you're looking for a spiritually uplifting read (like I am), the Book of Mormon is worth the purchase price.

I desperately learned to manipulate myself into feeling as I read it have veto authority in my otherwise rational epistemology. But that was before I acquired the guts to critically and honestly examine my beliefs, and now that I have untangled myself, perhaps a blurb on this book's merits from someone with my background would be helpful to someone.Now that scientists have established beyond doubt through DNA analysis that all native Americans are descended from east Asians that crossed the Bering Strait land bridge during the ice age and haven't got a drop of Semitic DNA in their bodies (not to mention the fact that horses, silk, steel, chariots (hell, wheels themselves), 7-day weeks, asses, bulls, cows, domesticated sheep and goats, breastplates, etc. did not exist in this hemisphere prior to the European colonization), it is hilarious to watch how the Mormon church backpedals on its claim that the Book of Mormon, which describes an enormous Hebraic civilzation in ancient America that took all these things for granted, is real history.Now we are to believe that the characters in this charming book of fiction were of a negligible number among a large number of preexisting natives who somehow never actually get mentioned in the book, and that the founder effect somehow wiped out their DNA imprint on the archaeological record (did those FARMS dudes really pay attention in their evolutionary biology classes?).Right. So Lehite DNA was diluted into oblivion by mixing with preexisting natives, but on the other hand, the natives completely abandoned their established ways and adopted the Jewish ways of this genetically negligible population so much so and so quickly that they were willing to fight wars and risk their lives to take sides in said negligible population's silly family feud. Yeah, the Lehites arrive in the New World and almost overnight they are fighting wars, either with only a literal handful of people on each side, or with the help of thousands of natives who despite not even speaking the invaders' language, just dropped what they'd been doing for untold generations to fight over who gets to take over their own government? And no mention of whether any of the oldtimers thought, \\"hmm, we were here first, maybe WE should run the government. Nah, let's completely abandon our traditions and make the newbie foreign invader our king.\\" HAHAHAHAHA!!!!!A classic technique of the disingenuous: when reality gets in the way of your dogma, retreat into ostensibly nonfalsifiable gibberish, no matter how convoluted. This is why the religions with the oldest traditions are the hardest to prove wrong...or right. Mormonism, being still quite young, has its value in showing us how myths form.Hence my belief that Mormonism can only improve at the expense of its credibility. If it does the honest thing and squares with its history and the numerous points at which it fails to connect with reality, it will of course have trouble convincing anyone of its monopoly on God's authority, let alone that it was not an outright [...]. On the other hand, if it continues its 174-year-old trend of rewriting its history and doctrine ad hoc, it can gradually distance itself from unpalatable elements of its past that it has not apologized for (racism, misogyny, violence), but only shield the truth from the uncritical.So, study this cult if, like me, you have a perverse fascination with how crackpotness can go mainstream over time. Otherwise, go live your life and don't waste your time here."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"And it came to pass that this book doth stinketh, even doth it stinketh exceedingly.

I submit that the Bible actually prophesies of the Book of Mormon.Several biblical authors speak of a voice of truth coming out of the earth, or speaking from the dust:Psalms 85:8-12\\"I will hear what God the Lord will speak: for he will speak peace unto his people, and to his saints: but let them not turn again to folly. Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him; that glory may dwell in our land. Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other. Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down from heaven.\\"Isaiah 45:8-9\\"Drop down, ye heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down righteousness: let the earth open and let them bring forth salvation, and let righteousness spring up together; I the Lord have created it. Woe unto him that striveth with his Maker! Let the potsherd strive with the potsherds of the earth. Shall the clay say to him that fashioneth it, What makest thou? or thy work, He hath no hands?\\"Isaiah chapter 29 is a very exciting prophesy for Latter-day Saints (i.e. Mormons). I don't know of any other religion that can explain with exactness the meaning of these verses. Here are a few verses of particular interest:Isaiah 29:11-12\\"And the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I cannot; for it is sealed: And the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I am not learned.\\"We believe that this prophesy was fulfilled in February of 1828. The sealed book is the Book of Mormon; the learned man is professor Charles Anthon of New York, and the unlearned man is Joseph Smith.Isaiah 29:14\\"Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people, even a marvellous work and a wonder: for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid.\\"We believe that the marvellous work referred to here is the restoration of the fullness of the gospel after centuries of apostacy and confusion. God lives! He has not fallen silent. He will not leave faithful believers without His continuing word.Ezekiel speaks of two sticks. Think of wooden writing tablets which were common in that day.Ezekiel 37:15-17\\"The word of the Lord came again unto me, saying, Moreover, thou son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions: then take another stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and for all the house of Israel his companions: And join them one to another into one stick; and they shall become one in thine hand.\\"We believe the stick of Judah to be the Bible, and the stick of Ephraim to be the Book of Mormon.Finally, consider the words of Jesus Christ:John 10:16\\"And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.\\"Ever wonder who are these other sheep? They are the righteous inhabitants of the Americas. You can read about how they heard Jesus' voice in the Book of Mormon.You may say that this is all a great stretch of the imagination. It isn't perfectly clear to the sincere Bible student what these verses are talking about. This wouldn't be the first time that someone used a bunch of disjointed biblical verses taken out of context to try to prove something. ...I just hope that your curiosity will be piqued enough for you to read the Book of Mormon and see for yourself.I add my witness to the many others found here: This book is from God. It is the keystone of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which I believe to possess the fullness of the gospel restored. The only way to know for sure is to do what Moroni says: Ask God. Don't forget to \\"remember how merciful the Lord hath been unto the children of men, from the creation of Adam even down until the time that ye shall read these things, and ponder it in your hearts.\\" (Moroni 10:3) This attitude of gratitude will invite the Holy Ghost. Then when you ask, you will receive your answer the way I did, by the power of the Holy Ghost. As you study the Book of Mormon with the Holy Ghost as your guide, the Bible will be opened up to you as never before. Then you will have the Old Testament, the New Testament, and Another Testament of Jesus Christ."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I have read this book several times and it is amazing how I can learn something new each time I read it.

I've tried a number of times to read from cover to cover. I just don't find it that interesting. As a historical document, things seem a little too neatly packaged. All the prophecies are true because they all happened by Joseph Smith's time. And the lack of cultural and physical evidence doesn't help either. As a testimony builder, I'm not sure if it is to ensure a testimony of Christ, Smith, or both. What it is supposed to do is elicit joyful emotions. If it feels good, then it is true. I don't have a testimony not because it didn't make me feel good and give me a sense of valiance. It just didn't hold it's water in the fields of history, archeology, or even metaphysical works, in my opinion. I have read better and more profound books.This book is filled with incredible faith promoting tales of great prophet-generals, sagely kings, political turmoil that makes Beirut look like Disneyland. I can't understand a few things about the greatest part of the book, the part of Christ's visit to the Americas. He destroys all the wicked people there, but why did he never destroy the Roman empire? He speaks of the Jews not having as much faith as the Nephites. But anybody would have faith in Jesus as the Christ if he floated down from the sky on a beam of light.So, my overall opinion of the book is, read it, but if you want to find out more about Mormonism, pick up half a dozen church pamphlets.

Why not now or not too long ago. Is it so far-fetched? Read the Book of Mormon, from a complete, bible-belt raised, looking for nothing advocate. Form your own opinion, if you dare to let go of some acient doctrines just long enough to see the future. It certainly is not 100% convincing, neither is the Bible, or the Koran, however, it is heartwarming food for thought. Open your heart/mind...The Book of Mormon, as well as my first love the Bible teaches us not be afraid of the unknown, we owe it to ourselves, and to God to search out, study and sometimes embrace the unkown. Do not accept what others expect you to accept. Be brave. I truly do not feel God intended things to be accepted because someone \\"taught\\" you that this was right. I like to think He expected us to learn His word on our own. That word does not necessarily mean the \\"Bible\\" only. On an life importance scale of 1-10 I would score a 10. The knowledge about where we are going after our lives are completed, not to mention what we should do with our beautiful, short lives while we are here, does not get any more important. What you do with the knowledge is your own personal path. There is no right or wrong. Only what we believe, if those beliefs lead us to more fulfilling lives, nurturing one another on this planet,not intentionally causing harm to anything or anyone, and living our lives to their fullest potentials.Who can say, honestly that they lived in vain. God, Muhommed, Allah, The Mother Mary, Jesus, will all equally be proud. ..."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"This book has made a profound difference in my 57 years of life. I have read it many, many times and I know that it contains truth as revealed by ancient prophets and translated by Joseph Smith. He was an unlearned young man when he translated the gold plates by the power of God. He could not have done this on his own. It is a testament to the truth promised to be revealed along with the truths in the Holy Bible. It is the book of Joseph spoken of in Ezekial to go hand in hand with the book of Judah (the Holy Bible). The promise is that if anyone will read it with an open heart, desiring to know if it is true, they will have the truthfulness manifest to them by the power of the Holy Ghost. I, personally, have applied this promise and have received a witness that it is true."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"Without this book and what it represents I would be lost in life. It has given me meaning and purpose to continue through hard times. Through it I have come to know that God knows and loves me, that I am His son and that He has a plan for all of us: We are here on earth to learn and to grow to be more like Him. But he knew we would make mistakes and sin and therefore, He provided us a way to be forgiven through the eternal sacrifice of His son, Jesus Christ. By repenting and accepting Christ as our Savior we can be purified and return to live with our Father in Heaven after this life. I know the Book of Mormon is the word of God as recieved and written by prophets of old in the Americas.

I thought we were writing book reviews, not battling for good and evil and right and wrong. Why take the time to prove others wrong on a WEBSITE? Heh.Moving along, my two cents is that it's a wonderfully written book. Yes, I believe it to be truth. There are so many facts, or at least pieces of history that fit together (and science experiments trying to prove it wrong that don't make sense) that only support my beliefs. I have been born and raised LDS and my parents were converts before I was born. I left the church for nearly three years even and completely denied the truthfulness of it. I was convinced it was all lies.But I came back. I love my faith, AND I love this book. Even if it were false, I believe it would be an amazing work of fiction for a man so young and uneducated as Joseph Smith was. The stories are great!I take interest in every religion. I don't shove my ways on them. I believe [and WE believe] that everyone has the privilege to worship how, where, or what they may. I love learning and investigating other cultures and religions. I don't think life should be a constant battle of who wins.Even if Almighty God Himself came down tomorrow and said the Book of Mormon is all lies, and the Bible too [we use both], I would still claim to have believed both.

So each has that benefit. For an introduction to the basic text, without explanatory notes or commentary, the Doubleday edition is for you.However, just as critical studies have been important in elucidating the Biblical text, so too for the Book of Mormon. For an introduction to some of the issues (form criticism, source criticism, etc.), you may want to pay the extra money for Grant Hardy's \\"Book of Mormon: A Reader's Edition.\\" It contains useful annotations and comments.The Book of Mormon is a classic of religious literature.

I would have hoped that bigotry and ignorance would not have a place in our current society, but I guess such is wishful thinking. I make no apologies for what I believe.That being said, I can do nothing more than reccomend the Book of Mormon whole-heartedly. Whether as literature or as Holy Writ, the Book of Mormon is an absolute inspiration to anyone who approaches it with an open mind. The words inside are revelations from God, just as the commandments on Sinai were to Moses, and the story, while tragic, mirrors our own world with such a stunning, beautiful, and remarkable elegance that it will inspire any open-minded person to live a purer and better life.I would reccomend the Book of Mormon to any person who is willing to approach it with an open mind. For those who are closed off, it will provide little inspiration, though it will prove marvelous literature. The same may be said of the Bible. If you were to read the Bible with an adamently and dogmatically atheist approach, you derive little inspiration from it as well.Truth may be found in many places, and it is truth above all that should be important. I reccomend the Book of Mormon not only on its literary quality but on the truthfulness of its teachings. Never have I read, nor will I ever read, a greater, wholer, or truer book than the Book of Mormon."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I can't believe anyone believes this garbage. The Book of Mormon is filled with half-truths, distortions, and outright lies. The author, Moroni, is hardly unbiased. He was a Nephite whose father was killed by Lamanites. That's like reading a book about the Allied Forces written by Hitler's son. Moroni obviously has an agenda. He hates the Lamanites for killing his father and all his Nephite friends. I can't say I blame him for that, but it damages his credibility as an historian because he has a personal vendetta and an axe to grind against the Lamanite nation. Moroni further damages his credibility by handing off the translation duties to Joseph Smith, a known con-artist, and frontier philanderer. Joseph Smith had absolutely no experience or training in translating ancient documents. He was an uneducated hillbilly. Before translating for Moroni, Joseph Smith's resume consisted of \\"farm-hand\\", and \\"glass-looker\\", hardly the type of experience that would inspire confidence in the Book of Mormon translation. Why did Moroni choose Joseph Smith, a guy who spent more time chasing skirts than reading books? Maybe because no serious scholar took Moroni's one-sided view of history seriously. Maybe Moroni's buddy, Joseph Smith, was the only person who would make himself a willing co-conspirator in creating this abominable and defamatory dime store novel. The bottom line is this: The Book of Mormon was created by a vengeful Nephite in an attempt to smear the Lamanite nation. With the help of an adulterous \\"glass-looker\\", he created a rabidly anti-Lamanite book, filled with slanderous lies, white-is-right race baiting, and distortions of half truths. All I have to say is look at the scoreboard. The Nephite's lost the war, end of story. Moroni is a sad, pathetic little man trying to make sorry excuses for the loser Nephites. I feel sorry for him and Joseph Smith. Their book would be funny if it wasn't so sad."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"ONE STAR?

LDS is NOT a Christian religion. The basic tenants of Mormonism contradict the bible. It doesn't teach of one true god as the Bible does. It teaches of countless gods. Mormonism teaches man (not woman) can in fact become a god and rule over their own earth. It also teaches Jesus is the same as you and I except he was the 1st born. It teaches Satan is the spirit brother of Jesus (not biblical). Mormonism is a works based religion vs. salvation by faith (Eph 2:8-9). At the end of the bible (Gen 22:18), it tells us not to add to or take away from this book ... which is exactly what Mormonism does. Mormonism is filled with deception, racism, polygamy, and false prophesies. There are no historical documents to support the Book of Mormon. According to the founder, Joseph Smith, ALL other faiths are an abomination. Study up. He was a con man and swindler. After his \\"vision\\" that \\"told him not to join any other church but to start his own\\", he tried to join another church. The book of Mormon is supposed to be the most accurate book ever written yet it has been changed THOUSANDS OF TIMES; not just minor changes but major theological issues. There are many books that expose Mormonism for what it is > e.g. \\"Reasoning From the Scriptures with Mormons\\" etc. Please thoroughly research this faith system before getting involved as you will be forbidden to read \\"apostate literature\\". They make it extremely difficult to leave."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"the BOM as anything other than a very obvious work of fiction should seriously study the Word of God. If you have been taught the lie that the Bible was somehow \\"corrupted\\" and is \\"untrustworthy\\", then you owe it to your eternal salvation to seriously challenge these false claims. Make it an easy project initially. Start with just the following handful of verses from the Word of God. Seek the truth. If you honestly believe that these verses have somehow been \\"corrupted\\" or are \\"untrustworthy\\", then conduct some honest and unbiased research in search of the truth and try to prove that they are false. You will discover that the Word of God is worthy of your complete trust.Hebrews 4:12 For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any double-edged sword, piercing until it divides soul and spirit, joints and marrow, as it judges the thoughts and purposes of the heart.Note: Satan always attacks the Word of God and tries to portray it as in error or otherwise corrupted and in need of additional \\"revelation\\" which then contradicts the Bible.Matthew 24:11 ...and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people.Note: Christians are not being warned that false prophets may appear and may deceive many people, but that they will appear and will deceive many people. There have been many false prophets that preach lies that contradict the Word of God.Galatians 1:8-9 But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let him be eternally condemned! As we have already said, so now I say again: If anybody is preaching to you a gospel other than what you accepted, let him be eternally condemned!Note: Seriously consider the very strong warning in these verses, which was repeated for emphasis.Muhammad claimed to be a prophet of God. Muhammad claimed that the angel Gabriel appeared to him and provided new revelations contained within the Qur'an, which contradict the Word of God.Joseph Smith also claimed to be a prophet of God. Smith claimed that the angel Moroni appeared to him and provided new revelations now contained within the BOM, which also contradict the Word of God.There have been many false prophets and there is no reason to believe that they will not continue to appear and to deceive many people.II Corinthians 11:14-15 And no wonder, for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light. It is not surprising, then, if his servants masquerade as servants of righteousness. Their end will be what their actions deserve.Note: Is it any surprise that Satan masquerades as an angel of light in order to deceive people? He is the father of all lies.Ephesians 28-9 For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith--and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God-- not by works, so that no one can boast.Galatians 2:21 I do not set aside the grace of God, for if righteousness could be gained through the law, Christ died for nothing!John 14:6 Jesus said to him, \\"I am the way, the truth, and the life.

It starts with the story of Lehi (a prophet) and his family in Jerusalem around 600 BC. The Lord leads them away from Jerusalem to \\"a land of promise.\\" The remainder of the book is a recording of the people in this new land. The record ends around 420 AD. I won't spoil the end of the story by telling you how it ends.Although the Book of Mormon follows a story line throughout (similar to The Bible), much of it is doctrinal in nature. Different prophet's, leader's, and teacher's sermons and teachings are recorded. The reading in the Book of Mormon is very much like The Bible. The language is similar, the doctrinal concepts are similar, and it is made up of chapters and verses like The Bible. I appreciate the Book of Mormon because it teaches Christianity in a powerful and clear way. Different passages won't leave you with two different interpretations of the same concept. I have not yet found it to disagree with the teachings in The Bible, in fact, it seems to support and reinforce The Bible.If you want to learn the details of the Mormon(LDS) church, this is not your book. This book teaches the gospel of Jesus Christ. To learn about the LDS church, Try the Doctrine and Covenants, www.mormon.org, or order some books from LDS Distribution (www.lds.org).I don't think the Mormon church is trying to hide anything with the Book of Mormon. I think you can even get a Book of Mormon for free (www.mormon.org, they may even send missionaries to your house to teach you about the church). And if it is not free, they are cheap on amazon.com.

It is conceivable that some inventive person could have written a book that reads something like the Bible, with familiar theology taught and lived in a different historical setting. On the other hand, what if the Book of Mormon is what it claims to be, a historical record of Jesus Christ's ministry to the Americas following his resurrection? The implications would be significant. It really couldn't be a mistake of some kind. The Book of Mormon is either deliberate fiction or truth. How to decide?One could reject it out of hand as implausible. From a \\"modern\\" point of view it does seem implausible, as does much of religion from this perspective. But is someone who honestly wants to know the truth really comfortable with the circular reasoning of rejecting something because it doesn't match preconceptions? A popular guide to writing book reviews begins a key chapter with: \\"First, read the book.\\" This is good advice.What then? Should one weigh historical evidence to determine the Book or Mormon's worth? This is an honest approach and can be followed with discipline and objectivity. But before relying on it completely, consider the inconclusiveness of historical criticism of the Bible. Our knowledge of all history is underdetermined by the incomplete evidence available. There is insufficient information about the Bible--and the Book of Mormon--to determine their worth this way. Would a just God expect us to decide what to believe on this basis? Isn't there too much chance of an honest mistake and lost opportunity?So--how? Consider a passage fromThe Holy Bible: King James Version: \\"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.\\" (James 1:5) For something important, it is reasonable to expect God to answer if we make our best effort to ask. The Book of Mormon closes with a similar passage: \\"And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.\\" (Moroni 10:4) Here is straightforward guidance, consistent with the New Testament.But what about our modern perspective? Wouldn't we feel self-conscious about asking? Isn't it silly to think there is actually a God who would answer in some way we could recognize? Consider one more thing. There is a story in 2 Kings 5 about a Syrian king named Naaman who had leprosy. He was told by Elisha to wash seven times in the river Jordan and he would be healed. This seemed to him--quite understandably--to be a silly thing to do. So he didn't do it and grumbled about how silly it was. Fortunately for him, someone pointed out that he ought to try it because the effort was small and the potential benefit was great. According to the story, he was healed.Whether or not you believe Naaman's story, its implication is useful. If you want to know if the Book of Mormon has value, first read it. Then go to the small effort of asking God to tell you whether or not to believe it. The potential value of an answer is worth the small effort or any self-consciousness. Ask by yourself, away from well-meaning social pressure from family, friends, missionaries, or anyone. Ask: What is the value of this book?[Reviewer's Note: The Book of Mormon is available for free download from www.lds.org.]"},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"As a convert to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints I read this book before my conversion.

Read this book sincerely looking for the beautiful, inspirational truth it contains, and God will help you see it.Second, if you have questions about anything in the Book of Mormon, which you will, go the LDS church for an answer. It doesn't make sense to look anywhere else. If you're in the mountains looking for pure water to drink, do you drink downstream from the spring, or do you go to the source? The purest water comes from the source. If you have questions about, say, Catholicism, would you look to anti-Catholic material for answers? Of course not. You'd go to the source. Same thing goes here. If something in the Book of Mormon doesn't make sense, don't expect to find any real answers in anti-Mormon materials. Their goal is obviously not to build faith. The LDS church can answer any question you have, better than anyone else can. After all, is there anyone who knows about their doctrine and scriptures better than they do? Don't drink from downstream. Go to the source.Ultimately, God is the one who really knows whether or not this book is true. Why not ask HIM? I'm sure that God, more than anybody, is anxious to help us all know the truth."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"The greatest Book I have ever read. Written by the ancient prophets from the House of Israel on the American Continents. Translated by the American Prophet Joseph Smith. The world is crying out for such a message, and yet the principles and doctrines, prophecies and warnings are largely going unrecognized by those whom it was written for.It contains a message of hope for all, an invitation to repent, and come unto Christ. This book has brought such joy and happiness to my family that I regard it as one of the great treasures in my life."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"A very powerful book that I would place in the same category as the New Testament in its teachings of Jesus Christ. The book is a complialtion of the writings of several prophets who lived over a period of about a thousand years on the American continent. Some parts are a little more difficult reading, but many of the recorded sermons of the contributing prophets are as profound as anyhing I have ever read. I would recommend the book to anyone."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I was disappointed, to say the least, to come here and find this book has a cumulative 3 star rating; HOWEVER, the fact that it is comprised solely of 1 STAR RATINGS and 5 STAR RATINGS tells you in itself that they're something here. The opinions concerning this book are so stratified that it would be ridiculous to take ANYONE'S word for it. The only solution as I see it, is to read the book for yourself.To anyone truly desirous to learn and discover the truth behind the skepticism, this has to tell you something. Take the time to read the book, and you will have every opportunity to discover itself falsehood, or truthfullness, for yourself.I have read the Book of Mormon many times and found it to be much more than just another book. I have carefully considered its pages and prayed over their content. And most importantly, I have received a witness from God, just as the book says you can, that it is true. It has strengthened my faith in ways I could not have imagined. Along with the Holy Bible, it has helped me gain an understanding of the nature of God, and the doctrine of Christ.Again, don't take my word for it, but if you are interested in a sincere understanding of the Latter-day Saint faith, I can think of nothing more beneficial than a thorough study of the book upon which it is founded."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I have read the Book of Mormon well over two-dozen times, cover to cover; and innumerable times in part.It deserves five stars because of the following reasons:First, because it forms the central scripture of a major religion, whose members view it as literal truth and a literal historical account as written thousands of years ago on the American continent.Second, because other than the Bible, the Book of Mormon has been translated into more languages than any other book of scripture.Third, because the book is COMPLEX! Really, far more so than anything the Bible relates chronologically. Some readers get lost trying to keep all those migrating people and political diversities straight; then they accuse the Book of Mormon of not being clear and consistent. But the problem lies with those who only \\"skim\\" the book and think that they are now expert enough to judge its merits. This is a big mistake. The book cannot be fathomed in one careful reading, much less a skim of its contents. I only began to clearly understand the chronology of its interrelated stories after at least three complete readings: and then only when I mapped out the timing for myself. The chances of Joseph Smith being able to put that whole thing together seem awfully remote, imho (despite what B. H. Roberts, et al, said or may have said to the contrary). It is a far more complex plot and prodigy of timing than The Lord of the Rings, and has far fewer mistakes in it than that worthy classic (and most of the very few \\"mistakes\\" the Book of Mormon contains can be blamed on Joseph Smith's later editing - without authority to do so, imho - and misunderstandings on our part).Fourth, because it is not badly written. It is very competently written, though I agree that the style (as it comes across in English) is very staid and utilitarian. The final author of the book's contents worried about this quality in fact: that the \\"Gentiles\\" would mock at his and his ancestors' poor writing powers. But God assured him that their words were sufficient, and that those who mocked them were fools who would mourn. As a work of literature it is similar in *boring* style with the Bible, so it shouldn't be compared with great works of the literary art. (And why should it be well written anyway? The authors were warrior/priests not artists, so far as we can tell at any rate.) Actually the stories are fascinating in and of themselves, equal to anything people find interesting in biblical stories, and in some cases superior. Characters are more *alive* in the Book of Mormon, generally, than characters from the Bible; the Book of Mormon possesses the only known scriptural character portrait (that of general/captain Moroni), and the dialogue is much more involved and revealing of characters' personalities than anything in the Bible (with the possible exception of Elijah and his duel with the priests of Baal).Fifth, because the controversy surrounding its truthfulness continues, mounting in intensity rather than abating, as the years go by. Some think the book already disproven; others at least allow that it isn't proven; others still accept it as literal history; and finally there are those (as with yours truly) who believe that Joseph Smith wrote it under inspiration outside of himself, and may have even really had at one time the famed \\"golden plates\\" from which its pages are supposed to have been translated. So because the Book of Mormon remains the center of a great deal of argument, it deserves a star for being unique that way too."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"The title says it all; this is another testament of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. I cannot remember how many times I have read this book and it brings peace, comfort and hope in troubled times as well as in good times, each and every time I read from its inspired pages.The people in this book are real, they really lived here on the American Continent thousands of years ago and they knew of God and his teachings. They looked forward to the time when Jesus Christ would be born and live on earth. They lived through times of peace and times of war, times of belief and righteousness and times of rebelliousness and turned away from God. Sounds a lot like our world today doesn't it?

I know it is."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"The renowned author and heretic Mark Twain once described the Book of Mormon as \\"chloroform in print\\". Not knowing what chloroform was, I looked the word up on Wikipedia and found the following description of its use as an anesthetic:\\"Chloroform was once a popular anesthetic; its vapor depresses the central nervous system of a patient, allowing a doctor to perform various otherwise painful procedures\\"Mark Twain got it bang on, if one considers that extracting 10% of your lifetime income, 2 prime years of your life, half of all your weekends, temple oaths of obedience and deference to church leadership, and any skeptical inquiry aimed in the church's direction as an \`otherwise painful procedure' requiring \`depression of the central nervous system'.So what is the secret of this book's success? The book consists of pretty standard religious mythology. We see larger than life heroes, over the top villains (who always get their just desserts), fantastical divine interventions aplenty, and a heavy constant theme of prosperity theology. Much of the doctrinal content is either borrowed from the King James Bible (translational mistakes and all), or else it clarifies doctrinal controversies of the day (such as infant baptism) in Joseph Smith's favor. It is no better and not much worse than the Bible or Koran in these regards. Like those books, it probably owes its success to the conformational biases of its believers, which has more to do with what the book symbolizes than what the book contains.The book (as fictional books often do) does have its share of inspiring quotes and stories. To mention a couple, I always liked Nephi's example of a positive attitude in the wilderness (1 Nephi 16). King Benjamin's address contains some wonderful gems of wisdom of the \`Sermon on the Mount' variety (Mosiah 4).The book also has it share of decidedly disturbing teachings. To mention a couple, I don't see how the attribution of the dark Native American complexion to the sins of their ancestors (2 Nephi 5) can be construed as anything but racist. At one point in the book, a diabolical atheist (*gasp*) is cursed with permanent loss of speech by our prophet hero for daring to challenge the religious orthodoxy of the day (Alma 30). The Mormon God (of course) happily obliges.For its (sometimes) inspirational content, the author's obvious talents as a story weaver, and its effectiveness as \`chloroform in print' I give the book three stars. For its (often) troubling ethics and its daft assertion (Alma 32, Moroni 10) that any warm fuzzy feelings the reader experiences while reading or contemplating the book is proof of its historical and metaphysical truth (contrary archeology, linguistic, and genetic evidences notwithstanding), I give it no more."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I consider myself a lifelong student of the teachings of Jesus Christ the Holy Prophets and like most good Christians I try my best to put into effect the principals that Jesus taught. As I've studied the Bible trying my best to learn what was taught by the prophets and Jesus Christ himself, I've come across many areas that seem to be vague or missing and are left unanswered. Having read the Book of Mormon, I'm amazed at how well it compliments the teachings of the Bible, and clarifies its principals and doctrine.I strongly recommend it for anyone who's honestly trying to learn and put into action, the teachings and principals of the Bible."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"This book truely testifies that Jesus is the Christ, the Saviour of the world. This book was translated through Joseph Smith the prophet through the gift and power of God.Ask yourself this question when reading its pages....could a man who had three years of schooling written this book? And for that matter, could anyone with a life-time of schooling written such a book?"},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"Today, very few people can deny that the world is becoming more interconnected, with societies and cultures and communications becoming ever more globalized. This globalization and interconnectedness is very likely to continue into the foreseeable future.In such an increasingly connected world, it is very interesting to consider the Book of Mormon, which in 1830 described an extensive society in which Jesus Christ made visits not only to Jerusalem in the Old World, but also to a city called Bountiful in the New World, as well as to other parts of the world.The Book of Mormon describes a series of ancient families (Lehi, Nephi, and their descendants) trying to preserve their social structures (familial and communal) and their religious beliefs despite tremendous opposition, even armed reprisals and governmental persecution.Oddly enough, those who criticize the Book of Mormon fail to consider that the persecution described in the Book of Mormon was, in a prophetic sense, also the shared fate of the Mormon people as a whole: after the book's publication, they were driven by mob violence from New York to Pennsylvania to Ohio to Missouri to Illinois, and finally to Utah.Most of this mob violence was whipped up by narrow-minded bigots who nevertheless claimed to be Christians. Most of the negative reviews of the Book of Mormon I've seen are likewise narrow-minded and infused with a brand of \\"Christian\\" zeal that most true Christians would be embarrassed by.It seems impossible to me that a charlatan, however charismatic and charming, could have written the Book of Mormon. Why? Because the book was published in 1830 and describes many instances of religious persecution, yet the Mormons themselves did not suffer most of their own persecution until after the book was published. What accounts for this prescient view of the fate Mormons would suffer? It seems there had to be more than a little divine inspiration involved in such a book.Although the book contains many new names, there is a pronouncing guide at the back that provides clear assistance. Lehi, for example, rhymes with Levi (you know, like Levi jeans, or Levi the priest). Similarly, Nephi rhymes with Lehi. Most of the names, when studied carefully, exhibit a remarkable linguistic similarity. For example, the terminal \\"i\\" at the end of a name is always a long \\"i,\\" as in Abinadi, Lehi, Nephi, Moroni. Learning the pronunciation helps in understanding the text.In the end, it is fascinating to think about the implications of a religious text that talks about a society that knew about Jesus Christ, by name, centuries before he appeared in Jerusalem, and who also enjoyed a direct visitation from him, and which delivers the basic message that any believer, at any time, in any place, might be the recipient of a similar event."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I have read this book many times and each time am reminded of the amazing stories contained inside. This book has many different heros who live what they believe, stand up for their god, and do what they know to be right. I like this book because it teaches the reader so many good life lessons. The many stories are full of joy, sorrow, learning, courage, and faith. I strongly recomend this book to anyone in search of strength, and anyone who believes in christ.

In fact, I have found that studying the two books together help me to have a clearer picture of God's will for me. The Book of Mormon testifies of the Savior Jesus Christ. It teaches me to focus my life on the Savior and to accept what He has done for me. Hand in hand with the New Testament, I have a much stronger appreciation for the Atonement. Great Book!!!!! However, it is the type of reading that one must do with prayer and the spirit.

Even though it was mostly boring, it had some cool violent parts where people get heads chopped off, arms chopped off, and there were some good lessons. Just ignore the boring Jesus stuff and focus on the killing and other fun parts and you might kinda like it. Here are some of the important lessons I found in this book:If you own brass plates, don't show them off. Keep it low key, especially around the local street preacher guy. If the local street preacher asks you about your brass plates, just lie. Say, \\"Brass Plates? What brass plates? I don't own brass plates.\\"If someone orders you to hand over your brass plates, especially the sons of the street preacher guy, and you don't want to give them to them, just say no. You own them. If they insist you give them your brass plates, call the cops.If after calling the cops, the perpetrators get away, hire bodyguards to watch over you and your plates. Don't get drunk until they are captured.If you are responsible for guarding your boss's brass plates, and someone shows up claiming to be your boss, wearing your boss's clothes, and asks you to give him the brass plates, check his ID first.If you are responsible for guarding your boss's brass plates, and someone shows up covered in blood, wearing your boss's clothes, claiming to be your boss, but he doesn't look anything like your boss, and he asks you to hand over the brass plates you should say, \\"Sure boss, I'll be right back.\\" Then pretend to go into the back room to get the plates, but instead call the cops.If you are investigating the murder/robbery of a guy who was killed for his brass plates, the first suspects you should interview should be the sons of the street preacher who were last seen ordering the victim to give them his brass plates.If you are investigating the murder/robbery of a guy who was killed for his brass plates, and the prime suspects are the sons of the street preacher, don't waste time looking for them in town. Most likely they packed up everything and headed for the sea.If you are writing on gold plates, keep in mind it is really hard and Gold plates are rare. Therefore, to get the most bang for the buck from the limited gold plates you should use a secret language called \`Reformed Egyptian' which is more compact than plain english, and avoid repetitive phrases like \`And it came to pass' unless those phrases are absolutely necessary to get the point across.If you wake up one morning and realize someone turned you into an Indian, it means you are one of the bad guys. You must now kill the white guys.If you want to fix the problem of looking like an Indian, find someone who didn't get turned into an Indian, who is still white and start going to church with him. Meet with the missionaries of his church, take the discussions, and get baptized. If you follow the teachings of the white guy's church, you will turn white again.It is bad to have multiple wives. (This seems like common sense, however this rule is changed in the Book of Mormon sequel called The Doctrine and Covenants.)If you are an atheist who asks the local prophet guy to back up his claims with evidence, and the prophet curses you to be deaf and dumb, going from door to door begging for food, and you see a group of people marching down the street, do not walk out into the middle of them, unless you want to get trampled to death.If Jesus comes to visit you, keep in mind that one of the things you can wish for is immortality. So don't waste your wish on anything less than immortality. You might be able to wish for more wishes, but I wouldn't test Jesus' patience. Stick with the immortality wish. We know that one works.If someone is lying unconscious for 2 days and 2 nights and you aren't sure if he is dead or not, try smelling him. If he \\"stinketh not\\", he might still be alive.One way to impress a guy is to chop off the arms of his enemies and bring the arms to him.If you need to escape from a town because everyone's language got mixed up, the best way to escape is by the sea, with a barge.If you need to build a barge to travel across the sea after escaping from a town where the languages got mixed up, the best way to build it is to put a hole on the top and a hole on the bottom. That way you can get air by opening the top hole and if it tips over, you can still get air by opening the bottom hole which is now on top. If you accidentally open the wrong hole and notice water rushing in, just stop up the hole real quick and open the other hole.If you are building a barge to travel across the sea do not put windows in your barge. It is unrealistic to expect the windows to survive the crashing waves of the sea. If you want light, use magic, glow rocks instead.If you are building a barge to travel across the ocean, be sure to bring lots and lots of food and fresh water because the trip will take 344 days. If you need to go to the bathroom, do it over the side of the barge because the holding tank isn't very big.If you find yourself on the battlefield fighting your arch nemesis and he chops your head off, don't waste your time and energy lifting yourself up and gasping for air. Give it up. You're dead.If you want to write scriptures, use \\"verily, verily\\" a lot and instead of saying someone worked hard, say they \\"waxed strong.\\" Also, adding \\"eth\\" to the end of words helps, such as \\"he runneth very fast.\\""},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"Most of the reviews written for this book either claim that it is a work of God or that it is a complete fabrication. Setting the emotional religious aspects aside, The Book of Mormon can be appreciated as a piece of truly American Religious text. It did not originate in Europe, the Middle East, India, or China. Millions have believed it to be the word of God and it has become the foundation for one of the fastest growing religions in the world. This book started a uniquely American religion that has grown world wide. Thousands of people left the settled parts of 19th century America and traveled to the area now known as Utah and turned the desert around a briny lake into a thriving metropolis and state with a unique culture and view of the world.Very few other books through history have had such an impact other than the Holy Bible and the Koran. Whether the book is a sacred text or a fabrication really does not change the great impact the book has had on people, history, religion, and even other countries throughout the world. The book has been translated into nearly all the major world languages. It has been read by millions. To so easily discount the book as a great lie or fabrication is to minimize the impact that the book and the church on which it is based has had and continues to have on the United States and the rest of the world.If you truly want to understand the religion known as the LDS faith, you must have an understanding of the book that is the cornerstone of that faith. As one who has read it, I find the book to be a good read. The book is a positive experience with lessons and warnings about how choices and actions made today can effect future generations. The parallels to modern politics in the book are very surprising and even the student of Sun Tzu will find parallels in the battle tactics of the Book of Mormon.I highly recommend this book.

I soon came to know that the Book of Mormon is what it claims to be--scripture, and a second witness of Jesus as the Son of God and the Redeemer.I have made a serious study of the book ever since (29 years), and I have found it to be an unending source of wisdom and insight for personal and national success.I have a Master's Degree in Ancient Near Eastern Studies and have also studied the Bible seriously for the past 29 years. I have found that the Book of Mormon supports and enlightens my understanding of both Old and New Testaments. The Book of Mormon's doctrinal expositions on the Fall, the Atonement, the plan of salvation, the resurrection, the judgement, etc. are clearer and more profound--they provide added understanding to that gained from the Bible.The Book of Mormon makes clear the personal path to God. Any success I have had in developing personal virtues, I owe to my study and application of principles taught in the Book of Mormon.In addition, the Book of Mormon contains many accounts that reveal true and useful principles for national government--particularly relevant to our day and our country.I highly recommend the Book of Mormon. I know it is true; it is from God, and leads to Him."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"This book gives you a second witness of the divinity and mission of Jesus Christ.

Could a twenty something man with a 3rd grade education guess right about so many civilizations? Impossible. This has to be a true translation from someone living in the period. The dates, arrivals of peoples, rises and falterings of groups, etc. all sync up with the Book of Mormon with amazing precision (amazing that current anthropologists came so close to the true dates and times).This is a history written by prophets who clearly had a religious perspective. A secular historian living at the same time would clearly have a different perspective but as you'll see when you read it, the purpose of the book was to help others gain a personal relationship with God. This relationship is far more valuable than the history used to convey that faith.After reading the book dozens of times and continuing to do so, I believe more in its authenticity now than at any other time in my life. The proof of the book is in the relationship I gained with God by reading and abiding by its precepts. I encourage all to study this text."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"This work was translated and written by a basically uneducated farm boy, Joseph Smith Jr. It contains archeological facts and methods of ancient times that scholars are just finding out about now, such as written histories on metal plates.

God made this book possible through his servant and prophet Joseph Smith. This book testifies of Jesus Christ as He visited ancient American peoples after his crucifixion. \\"Other sheep have I that are not of this fold\\" Jesus told this to his followers in the bible; The Book of Mormon tells of these others.

I was actually ignorant of Catholic teachings, because I always thought that they knew that God was three separate and distinct beings.But when I was in the eighth grade, I heard a Catholic priest say that God was a being who, at any given time, could manifest himself as either the Father, or the Son, or the Holy Ghost. He stated that God only manifested himself as one of the three when the need arose and that the three did not exist separately. I pointed out that during the Savior's baptism, the Father spoke from Heaven while the Holy Ghost descended in the form of a dove. I also said that Jesus prayed to his Father in Heaven. He didn't pray to himself. The priest got angry, and I knew that Catholicism was not the truth.In 1980, at the age of 22, I confessed my sins to God, and knowing that my sins had been forgiven, I considered myself to be a \\"Born Again Christian.\\"I started trying to find a church to join in October 1997. It would be nine months before I would meet with success. I did, however, discover for myself that an apostasy had taken place and that the churches had \\"fallen away.\\"I first had quite a negative experience with a certain church in November and December of 1997. After attending several of their meetings and hearing them talk about Jesus Christ, I found out that they did not believe in repentance. Even when I told a group of them that forgiveness of sins comes by confessing to God that you are a sinner, they still did not have a clue as to what I was talking about.In January 1998, I saw ad on television for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints that said they would send a free copy of the King James Bible. Since I took my Bible with me to read when I rode the bus, I thought it would be a good idea to have a second one just in case I lost the one I had. I called the 800 # and ordered it, but I moved in February and never received it.I continued to search for the right church, always praying to our Father in the name of Jesus Christ that He would give me guidance. With each church that I tried, the Spirit would tell me to keep looking.By the second week of June 1998, I was getting somewhat desperate. I began fasting and praying to find the right church. I would go without eating every Tuesday and Saturday from midnight to midnight.Around the second week of July 1998, the Spirit told me to call that 800 #. I didn't have the 800 # and I got rid of my television when I moved. So, I looked in the phone book, called the Washington DC Temple, and asked for the 800 #. After I called it, they said that the Bible might take up to 4 weeks to get to me. Well I didn't want to wait, and I thought I would just go to the Temple and pick one up. (I didn't know at the time that Bibles were not given out at the Temple. Mormon Missionaries will bring one to you, or you can go to an LDS chapel on Sunday and get one from the missionaries who are there.)I checked the bus schedules and found out which bus I needed to take to get to the Temple. I went about my business of trying to expose corruption in the government and, in the course of doing so, I needed to take the very bus that would take me to the Temple. I was actually going to drop off some information with someone when I got on that bus.As the bus traveled down the street, I could see the huge trees far off up ahead looking nice and sculpted. I could see something barely sticking up over one of the trees. (It was the very top of the angel Moroni!) It grabbed my attention and I couldn't take my eyes off it. I had to know what was there. Of course, as the bus got closer, it wasn't getting any easier for me to see.The bus continued down Stoneybrook Drive and as it went around the turn I tried to look to see what was there but I couldn't see anything through the heavy foliage. Then the bus passed the signs for the Temple and the Visitors Center and I thought to myself, \\"That's where it is! I just have to get off at that bus stop.\\"I continued on to where I was going that day, and the next day I went and got on that same bus and got off at the Temple. As I walked across the parking lot, I prayed, \\"Father, in the name of Jesus I pray that I will know if this is the truth.\\"I went into the Visitors' Center and told Elder Rich, who was serving a senior mission, about not wanting to wait for a Bible. He said, \\"No problem. I'll have the missionaries over there next week.\\"Regarding the Church and the Book of Moromon, he said to me, \\"Now, you are going to have to ask God if this is true.\\" I immediately started thinking I was in the right place because I had just done that.I watched a movie about the First Vision, and I took home a pamphlet entitled \\"Testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith.\\"Elder Kevin Mills, a missionary from Jamaica, handed me the Book Of Mormon on Tuesday, July 21, 1998. I didn't know anything about the missionary \\"discussions\\" at that time and after we chatted for a bit, I said, \\"Well, I have to get started reading.\\"Elder Mills said, \\"Oh! You have some reading to do?\\"I said, \\"Yeah. The Book Of Mormon.\\" I started reading it right away.I had read the New Testament twice in my 9-month search for the right church {God was preparing me to be led to the church}, and I knew the criterion for true prophets and false prophets. It is in 1 John, 4:1-3; \\"Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world. Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God: And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.\\"The Book Of Mormon is all about Jesus Christ coming to Earth and dying for the sins of man, and the way to find salvation is to confess to God that you are a sinner. In fact, it goes into detail on it by page 19, and it keeps getting better after that.On Thursday, July 23rd, two days after receiving the Book Of Mormon, I called Elder Mills and said, \\"I know this to be the word of God.\\"I could feel the spirit at the other end of the phone line. He mentioned something to me about lessons (there were 6 missionary discussions needed before someone could get baptized), and I thought, \\"I've got the word of God in my hands! I don't need lessons.\\" I told him I would get back to him on that.I prayed about it as I continued reading the Book Of Mormon and the spirit told me to get the lessons, so I called Elder Mills on Friday and said I was going to get the lessons. He asked me if I wanted to go to church on Sunday and I jumped at the chance, as I knew I should go to church on Sunday and I hadn't been checking out any other churches.On Sunday, July 26th, I attended my first Sacrament Meeting and I was very far into the Book Of Mormon at this point. There happened to be a baptism that day, and Elder Mills and I went to it. We were both filled with the spirit and the excitement about my already having a strong testimony of the Book Of Mormon.Elder Mills said, \\"We're going to get all those lessons in this week and I'm going to baptize you next week!\\"As I took the lessons, the spirit was prompting me on things to read in the Bible while I was at home. I read John 5:19 and Revelation 3:21, and when I saw the Elders again, I pointed out that in Revelation 3:21, the Savior said, \\"To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.\\"Then I pointed out that in John 5:19, the Savior said, \\"The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.\\"I said that if the Son can't do anything unless the Father has done it, and the Son overcame and was set down in his throne, then our Heavenly Father overcame and was set down in his throne. The Bible says so, and Jesus Christ said so.\\"Does this church teach that?\\" I asked. And the Elders nodded with wide-eyed astonishment.The subject of the church not having any paid priests came up. Now, they had told me about the apostasy early on, and I had been prompted by the spirit to read Micah 3:10-11 the evening before the subject of paid priests came up. I pointed out to them that in Micah 3:10-11, it says, \\"They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity. The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money yet will they lean upon the Lord, and say, Is not the Lord among us? none evil can come upon us.\\" Not having priests who \\"teach for hire\\" was just more proof that the true Gospel of Jesus Christ had been restored.They brought up the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost, which would happen after I was baptized. I, again, had read it in the Bible the night before. It is in Acts 8:14-17; \\"Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John: Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost: (For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.) Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.\\" More proof that the restoration of the Savior's church had taken place.After attending my second sacrament meeting on August 2, 1998, I was baptized that same day. I've read the Book Of Mormon from beginning to end more than twenty times since being baptized, and I will continue to do so for the rest of my life.And I should add that the Book of Mormon was not written \\"by Joseph Smith.\\" It was written by ancient prophets and brought forth by the power of God when the only true gospel of Jesus Christ was restored in 1830. Joseph Smith was the prophet through whom Jesus Christ restored his one true church. He is not the \\"author\\" of the Book of Mormon."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"this book, a companion to the bible, offers me hope in an often hopeless world. it answered many spiritual questions and provides comfort and guidance each time i read it! i encourage you to explore the wonders of the Book of Mormon for yourself!"},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I hear all of these people talk about whether this book is true or false.

In my childhood, I went to church every Sunday and there I developed a love for the word of God. I have read the Bible cover to cover and I have read the New Testament several times over. How couldn't I? The truth that it teaches about the Savior, Jesus Christ, and the exemplary life that He led have led me to know that he is my only Savior and Redeemer.I have also read the Book of Mormon. I just finished reading it for the thirty-sixth time, and I know that it too is the word of God. It teaches and testifies of the Savior Jesus Christ. It teaches that He is the only Person through whom anyone can be saved. I know that because I've read it. It is inspired scripture of God, written by God himself through His prophets. In fact, the majority of the Book of Mormon was written before Jesus Christ's birth. Furthermore, just like the Bible, the Book of Mormon teaches that God answers prayer. I have prayed and asked God if the Book of Mormon is His scripture and He has answered my prayers by the power of the Holy Ghost. I know that God will answer the prayers of anyone who reads it and prays about it with a sincere heart and real intent. I know that because I've experienced it. This book has helped me to know that Jesus Christ is my only Savior and Redeemer. For that I am a more devote follower and believer of Jesus Christ."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"Since it was first published in 1830, the Book of Mormon has consistently been the center of controversy. The book makes two extraordinary claims: first, that it is an authentic ancient text that was recovered and translated in the early 1800s by Joseph Smith; and second, that both the writing of the original text and its translation by Smith into English were directly inspired by the God of the Judeo-Christian Bible. Thus the Book of Mormon claims to be both a reliable historical record of ancient American civilizations and a supplement to the Bible--a truly new testament for the modern era.Consequently, most criticism of the Book of Mormon has focused on these two interconnected claims. Is this book an authentic divine revelation? True believers have, over the last 170 years, united themselves to the Latter-day Saint religious movement. Disbelievers have condemned the book as either an audacious fraud or a demonic deception. The invective over the book has often grown quite personal, particularly between the main body of Latter-day Saints (also known as Mormons) and evangelical Protestants who view Mormonism as a heretical &quot;cult.&quot;In all the fuss and furor over the Book of Mormon, however, few people seem to take a truly honest view of it as literature. Whether one views it as a divine revelation written by ancient prophets or as a work of fiction by a 19th century American, I think that all can agree that the Book of Mormon is a work of literature which bears the marks of purposeful construction on the part of any human who had a hand in its creation. Even the belief that the author (or authors) was a prophet does not erase the possibility of human creative agency. After all, a divine being may inspire an author, but that inspiration must be channeled through that author's abilities as a textual craftsperson.And so the question thus arises: Apart from the Book of Mormon's value as a spiritual guide (or, if you prefer, danger as a spiritual counterfeit), is it a great work of literature? And where does it fit in the vast library of human literature? Personally, I think it's a pretty good yarn with some fascinating touches in the areas of form and style. And with regard to its place in world literature, I place it among the great body of works which consciously respond to, rewrite, or affirm the Judeo-Christian Bible: the Qur'an, John Milton's &quot;Paradise Lost,&quot; many of the poems of William Blake, other &quot;American Bibles&quot; like Mary Baker Eddy's &quot;Science and Health,&quot; novels like Zora Neale Hurston's &quot;Moses, Man of the Mountain,&quot; biblically-inspired horror films like &quot;The Omen,&quot; and many other texts.As I said, I found the Book of Mormon to be quite compelling as a story. It is truly a narrative with an epic vision: it tells the story of two great migrations from the Old World to the Americas, and of the great civilizations that rose and fell from the seeds thus planted. The overall narrative spans many centuries of war, political intrigue, and cultural clashes. It is a vast tapestry whose scope calls to mind the &quot;Star Wars&quot; saga or similar multigenerational science fiction epics.Within this greater narrative are embedded many gems of localized storytelling and poetic imagery. Check out, for example, Lehi's vision of the tree of life (1 Nephi 8), the parable of the seed (Alma 32), or the story of the Jaredite ocean voyage (Ether 6). That last story contains a marvelous description of ancient submarine-like vessels being lit by a strange phosphorescent element.The construction of the Book of Mormon should excite literary scholars interested in theories about narrative. The text has multiple narrators, some of whom comment on the other narrators. Furthermore, the book's progression moves back and forth chronologically (yet another similarity to some of my favorite science fiction sagas).Of course, the Book of Mormon has its drawbacks. While the overwhelming focus on the person of Jesus Christ makes the book priceless to the Mormon faithful, this element presents a stumbling block to the faithful of other &quot;Abrahamic&quot; religions which clash with Mormonism. And secular readers will probably find the book's Christocentricity tiresome and preachy. The book's relative lack of strong female characters has been a point of criticism. Some of the book's racial and ethnic themes (see, for example, 2 Nephi 5) are disturbing. And many will find some of the narrative voices' direct addresses to the reader to sound like spiritual blackmail of the &quot;believe me or you'll be sorry&quot; variety.Moreover, this edition of the Book of Mormon is explicitly geared towards the faithful of the Utah-based Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (and potential converts). It is thus not really an appropriate edition of the Book of Mormon for a pluralistic context (such as a literature course in a public university).These concerns aside, I believe the Book of Mormon to be an important and fascinating work of American literature--a true hidden classic. I found it interesting that one of the great American plays of the 1990s, Tony Kushner's two-part epic &quot;Angels in America,&quot; draws deeply from the Book of Mormon with regard to the play's themes, plot, and characters. If an artist of Kushner's stature can give the Book of Mormon such serious consideration, perhaps it is time for the Book of Mormon to enjoy a wider audience that can finally appreciate and discuss the text as a work of literature, and not merely as a lightning rod for sectarian controversy."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"Congratulations to Amazon for carrying the new addition of the Book of Mormon.

From a spiritual side once again there are many arguments on both ends, I can assure you that there are many that would point to the Bible and say that is the end all of revelation. A litle history of how the Bible was formed and its cronology would go a long way in dispelling this but I don't wish to get into that. Suficient to say that reading this book in no way will damn you as Paul encourages you to test all things and hold to that which is of God. You can not test this book if you don't read it. There are too many acusations flying to get an unbias opinion so form one for yourself, read it cover to cover and not litle paseges with selective use of quotation marks.

I believe it to be the Word of God, along with the Bible, and will help you establish a relationship with Jesus Christ. Good luck."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"Throughout time there has been only a small handfull of books that were claimed to be the word of God. A person could, without much work, read all of those books and decide for him/herself. Why waste your precious time worrying what other people think? Read it for yourself and make your own opinion. You can see what it is like online at scriptures.lds.org.My opinion is that this book contains (truely) the word of God. It also is imperfect, but so are we. If I could afford just one gift to give the whole world, it would be one copy of this book we are reviewing.

I gave it a 5 because it has strengthened my home and family. My family is a lot closer now. We have had many blessings from this book.Hailee"},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"Having spent two years in Australia as a missionary seeking to teach people about this book and having studied it carefully for over thirty years, I offer the following:Argument over the Book of Mormon's content, meaning, or authenticity is ultimately not going anywhere. Such arguments have been going on regarding the Bible for thousands of years. To this day half of the Bible (the New Testament) is disregarded as an unauthorized addition by Jews who reverence the Torah. See, Deut 4:2.The Book of Mormon from its title page purports to be one thing--Another Testament of Jesus Christ. New scripture from a God who is following the same pattern He has followed for generations; new scripture to complement the old. The Book of Mormon is for persons who wonder why the Bible stopped--who wonder where the prophets have gone. For a good long time the world wasn't ready to have a prophet. In the 1830's, in a country with unlimited possibility and unprecedented religious freedom, God again revealed Himself to a prophet. I find it curious that people who revere prophets such as Moses, Abraham, Daniel, the Apostle Paul and others will not test claims of a modern prophet. I wonder if Isaiah had trouble distributing his book--it demands a close reading, was doctrinally controversial and probably disturbed the governing orthodoxy. But that is the way God works, He allows us to decide whether to read the book.The Book of Mormon is the means given by God to test the veracity of the man who brought it forth--Joseph Smith. It is a test--no more no less. The Book of Mormon itself at Moroni Chapter 10 (the last chapter of the entire work) at verses 3-5 is instructive: \\"Behold, I would exhort you that when ye shall read these things, if it be wisdom in God that ye should read them, that ye would remember how merciful the Lord hath been unto the children of men, from the creation of Adam even down until the time that ye shall receive these things, and ponder it in your hearts. And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost. And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things.\\"So, instead of engaging in argument, test the Book. Read it and ask God whether it is true. I have. It is."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"First, I'd like to say that I feel like comments from the bigots who worship the Bible more than their God are a personal attack and inspired by hatred. They might even inspire hate crimes. God certainly has never taught men to hate each other. Second, the book is wonderful. It does change lives, but will not changed lives of those obsessed with hatred and seeking more religious persecution in the world. Read this book as a sacred text, objectively, but with God (if God is biased with literature, then I guess you'll just have to deal with that). This is the most important part. Read it in the context given, and not by any of the archaeology or genetics that will neither prove nor disprove it. Don't read literature that would encourage our extermination or the complete destruction of our religion. Also, how many times does the church have to repeat its name? It is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in English. A Igreja de Jesus Cristo dos Santos dos &Uacute;ltimos Dias in Portuguese. La Iglesia de Jesucristo de los Santos de los &Uacute;ltimos D&iacute;as in Spanish. What more do you want? That is the correct name of the church. Unlike a select and sociopathic few who claim to be Christian, Christians worship God through sacred texts, but we do not worship the texts themselves above God. Have you wondered why Jesus had to suffer? Did you know that His suffering went beyond the cross? The book helps me and can help anyone understand the most important event in Christianity (and, I say, in the world) and get closer to God and His Son Jesus Christ."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"This is one of the best books I've read. Its another book about the battle of good and evil. I would like to say I am not a member of the church. This book though, will keep you on the edge of your seat or it may bore you to death with all \\"and it came to pass\\". Its like reading an epic saga. It is another point of view. It is a very interesting point of view. I would invite others to read it an make up their own judgements for once and not listen to the naysayers who are biased and probably didnt read it. When reading it you can take it either of two ways. A literary work of art; or an important religous text. Just read it without a bias."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"This is an amazing book, even if you approach it merely as religious fiction. Harold Bloom, an eminent Yale scholar, said it was the work of an \\"authentic religious genius.\\" (The American Religion, ISBN 0671867377).But Mormons believe the Book of Mormon is much more than an interesting story. They believe it is scripture, a companion to the Holy Bible.Why does anyone need more scriptures, when we've already got the Bible? In the Bible, Paul said, \\"In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established\\" (2 Corinthians 13:1). Mormons believe the Book of Mormon complements the Bible, and that by studying one you can better understand the other.Joseph Smith claimed he translated ancient records by the gift and power of God, and then published it in 1830 as the Book of Mormon. He also claimed to be a modern prophet and to receive revelations from God. Isn't that blasphemy? Yes, unless Joseph Smith really was prophet. For this reason, Mormons say the Book of Mormon is the keystone of their religion. If Joseph Smith lied, then the Mormon church was founded on a hoax. If the book is true, Joseph Smith was a prophet and the church he founded was the work of God.Millions of people have read the Book of Mormon, and have felt the Holy Spirit testify to their hearts that its words are true. I encourage you to read it with an open mind and an open heart, and decide for yourself. I have read it many times, and this book is amazing. It gives me spiritual strength and it helps me try to follow the teachings of Jesus, as taught in both the Book of Mormon and the Bible. I have felt the witness of the Spirit that this book is true.Just as you can't prove God exists, you can't prove the Book of Mormon is authentic. Ultimately, you must take these on faith. That's the point of this life's test - to walk by faith. However, this does not mean there is no evidence that that the Book of Mormon is authentic. For starters, I recommend you look into these two books by Hugh Nibley: Since Cumorah (ISBN 0875791395) and Lehi in the Desert and the World of the Jaredites (ISBN 0875791328 or ASIN 0884940225). Also read the essay on the Book of Mormon in this book: Storyteller in Zion, by Orson Scott Card (ASIN 1573458082).As you read the Book of Mormon, ask yourself, \\"Could this have been written by a barely educated, 25-year-old farmer in the early 1800's?\\" The narrative and the cultures described are complex. The events span 1000 years of history. The language is rich and often literary. The ideas are profound, yet in harmony with the Bible.Mormons believe the purpose of both the Bible and the Book of Mormon is to lead a person to Jesus Christ and His teachings. The central theme of the Book of Mormon is Jesus Christ. It contains many witnesses of Him. Here are a few samples:\\"We talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ, and we write according to our prophecies, that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins.\\" (2 Ne. 25: 26, page 100.)\\"For three days and for three nights was I racked, even with the pains of a damned soul. And as I was thus ... harrowed up by the memory of my many sins, I remembered to have heard my father prophesy unto the people concerning the coming of one Jesus Christ, a Son of God, to atone for the sins of the world. Now, as my mind caught hold upon this thought, I cried within my heart: O Jesus, thou Son of God, have mercy on me, who am in the gall of bitterness, and am encircled about by the everlasting chains of death. And now, when I thought this, I could remember my pains no more; yea, I was harrowed up by the memory of my sins no more. And oh, what joy, and what marvelous light I did behold; yea, my soul was filled with joy.\\" (Alma 36: 16-20, page 299.)\\"And now, I would commend you to seek this Jesus of whom the prophets and apostles have written, that the grace of God the Father, and also the Lord Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost, which beareth record of them, may be and abide in you forever.\\" (Ether 12:41, page 511.)\\"And the angel spake unto me again, saying: Look! And I looked, and I beheld the Lamb of God going forth among the children of men. And I beheld multitudes of people who were sick, and who were afflicted with all manner of diseases, and with devils and unclean spirits; and the angel spake and showed all these things unto me. And they were healed by the power of the Lamb of God; and the devils and the unclean spirits were cast out. And it came to pass that the angel spake unto me again, saying: Look! And I looked and beheld the Lamb of God, that he was taken by the people; yea, the Son of the everlasting God was judged of the world; and I saw and bear record. And I, Nephi, saw that he was lifted up upon the cross and slain for the sins of the world.\\" (1 Nephi 11: 31-33, page 21.)\\"O how great the goodness of our God, who prepareth a way for our escape from the grasp of this awful monster; yea, that monster, death and hell... Hell must deliver up its captive spirits, and the grave must deliver up its captive bodies, and the bodies and the spirits of men will be restored one to the other; and it is by the power of the resurrection of the Holy One of Israel.\\" (2 Ne. 9: 10-12, page 73.)"},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"what a wonderful book this is! in companionship with the holy bible it is a wonderful way to learn abot God and the meaning of life. it truly is another testament of Jesus Christ."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"How can a book which brings people closer to Jesus Christ be anything but great.

COMDecember 25, 2004My appreciation of the BOOK OF MORMON as a volume of scared scripture is based upon a personal relationship with God. Varied experiences throughout my life have led me away from Him or toward Him. As I have read and studied the BOOK OF MORMON at different times in my life I have learned a lot about myself. I have learned a lot about my Savior, Jesus Christ.For me the BOOK OF MORMON is \\"another testament\\" of the Savior and His work on behalf of His Father. It is a modern-day, comforting, motivating witness of God's love for each and every one of us on the face of this earth. I know the BOOK OF MORMON as a companion volume to the BIBLE. The BIBLE is the stick of Judah. The BOOK OF MORMON is the stick of Joseph. (See Ezekiel 37: 15-19.)It makes sense! The BOOK OF MORMON does not negate the BIBLE. The BOOK OF MORMON answers important questions and makes the BIBLE more meaningful and clear to me. The BOOK OF MORMON affirms the truths to be found in the BIBLE.At this season of the year, most of us have once again read the Christmas story as recorded in one or all of the New Testament gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John? (I.E., Luke 2:11-32...) Yet, just as awe-inspiring, if not more so for me, are BOOK OF MORMON prophecies regarding the Savior's birth--and the events leading up to it. \\"Christmas in Zarahemla\\" is a glorious story recorded in the Book of Helaman, Chapters 14 & 16, as well as in Third Nephi, Chapter 1.I consider myself lucky to have a copy of the BOOK OF MORMON and the BIBLE! I trust the words I read in both--for both tell me that God lives and that Jesus Christ, His son, is my redeemer. As I \\"exercise faith\\" I am happy and reassured. To know that God is the same yesterday, today, and forever is one of the most profound correlates I have found between the BOOK OF MORMON and the BIBLE. What an impact this has on my life! In this fast-paced, unpredictable, often unsavory world, I have God on my side. God is reliable. God is someone upon whom we can all depend--no matter what.I highly recommend the BOOK OF MORMON to you if you wish to deepen your relationship with God. Start off by reading Chapter 10 in the Book of Moroni--the conclusion of the BOOK OF MORMON."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"My life became a mess over the years and I no longer wanted to exist.

It changed my life. I could feel the saviors love like never before. It gave me the courage and strenght to go on and turn my life around. Now 15 years later I'm ever so grateful I decided to open it up. Everyone needs to read with an open heart and find out for themselves. I can't convey the difference in my life today.

Quite frankly, I love the book. I know that the Bible is the word of God. I know this because of how it makes me feel as I read from it's pages. I know that it persuades mankind to believe in God and to love each other. I believed that the Bible was the ONLY word of God until I actually READ the Book of Mormon.What an amazing experience. As I read from it's pages for the first time, I felt a warm feeling inside each day as I read it, as if I was being filled with energy. I read it as scripture, but also as history and philosophy. The teachings make so much sense. And many things that aren't very clear in the Bible (evident by the thousands of religions that believe in the bible, however ALL believe different things) became so very clear upon reading the Book of Mormon. The Book of Mormon testifies to the truth of the Bible. I understand why the phrase was added &quot;another testiment of Jesus Christ&quot;, because like the Bible, the Book of Mormon testifies that Jesus Christ is the Son of the Living God. This book has brought me so close to Christ and answered questions that I wouldn't normally have been able to have answered.I recommend reading the Book of Mormon and contacting the missionaries from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (the fastest growing church in the world) to learn more about the Book of Mormon and other scriptures that God has revealed to men on earth.God does speak to mankind in our day, just as he did in the time of Noah and Moses. If you listen, you can hear.I know that the Book of Mormon is true. That it is the word of God and was translated by Joseph Smith a true prophet of God. I know that these things are true because I have prayed and asked God if they are true and I have received answers to my prayers. And you can too."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"The Book of Mormon, written by Joseph Smith, is a perfect example of the perceptions and views of people living in the early 1800's. It claims to be an historical record of the Native Americans. The book describes the dark skin of the Native Americans to be a curse from God. It teaches that the natives changed their skin color at different times depending on their righteousness. The Book of Mormon claims that white skin is desirable over dark skin, or it's own terms \\"dark and loathsome\\" to describe dark skin and \\"white and delightsome\\" to describe the lighter skinned people. This is a perfect example of the racial opinions and attitudes of the people in the 1800's.Even though Mormons claim that the Book of Mormon is an historical document, written by prophets, it is very problematic in it's descriptions of the Native Americans and their way of life. Apart from calling them \\"dark and loathsome\\", the Book of Mormon also claims that the Native Americans had horses, steel swords, metal armor, chariots along with a host of old world flora and fauna. It is commonly known that the Native Americans did not have Horses, the wheel, steel swords etc. until the Europeans arrived.I recommend reading this book if you enjoy reading a piece of history. Joseph Smith convinced many people that the book was a real historical record written by prophets in the Americas. Many people even today ignore commonly known facts so they can still believe in it.I find little value in the Book of Mormon as spiritual guide, but it can be fun to read to see what the prevailing opinions and views of religion were in the 1800's that is why I give it 4 stars"},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"This book has changed my life. And one of the greatest things about this book was that it contains a promise that to anyone who reads it and if they ask God whether it is true or not, that God (not friends, family, or any other man or woman) will let you know whether it is true or not - by asking through prayer. If you ask in all sincerity, you will get an answer to your prayer. I did, but that was my own experience. The Book of Mormon promises that anyone who reads the Book of Mormon and asks God whether it is true or not will receive their own answer (Moroni Chapter 5, verses 3-5; on p. 529)."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"This book contains aditional testimony about out Lord Jesus Christ, it is truely a marvelous work and a wonder.

The \\"missionary\\" version, handed out by the guys with the white shirts and black name tags, has a soft cover that is dark blue in color.The free book, the standard LDS Church edition, on just about every page, has up to half of the bottom of each page full of little footnotes and also references to the other books of scripture had by the LDS Church (the King James version of the Holy Bible, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price). Most of these footnotes and references are probably useless to anyone who is not a member of the LDS Church, who just wants to know what this book says.This edition of the book, which was authorized by the LDS Church a few years ago, leaves out all of the distracting footnotes. What you get here is just the text, and it makes reading this book much easier for people who are new to it and simply want to know what it says. Even members of the LDS Church who don't care for the numerous potentially-distracting footnotes might prefer this version of the book.Mormonism's foundation is this book, and the book is even called by Church members the \\"keystone\\" of their religion. A central doctrine of the book is that God reveals truths to mankind and anyone can learn to be recipient to this revelation. The last chapter exhorts the reader to sincerely pray to God and to let God be the ultimate authority, confirming the truth (or not) of the book.Whether or not a person is willing to take this test, this version of the book is very helpful for anyone who seeks to truly understand the foundation of Mormonism and Mormon doctrine. I would argue that reading the Book of Mormon is essential to understanding Mormonism.This review is written by a former agnostic, who converted to Mormonism in 1998 after reading this book in its entirety. In my opinion, as with many others who adhere to Mormonism, this is the most important book on Earth and it is absolutely true."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"It seems like the majority of the other reviews are concerned with attacking/defending the text and theology of the book itself. I'm not really concerned with that, especially as a non-Mormon who has no inherent hostility towards or sympathy with the LDS Church and/or its variants, just an interest in religious literature.For non-specialists or casual readers, there are essentially three different versions of the Book of Mormon available:* the softcover copies distributed by the Church's formidable missionary network.* the Penguin Books edition (also softcover) of the 1840 printing.* the Doubleday edition here, in hardcover.Each has its merits and liabilities.The Doubleday edition is a hardcover copy, far more durable than the Penguin paperback or even the official Church copy. Also, Doubleday's edition uses a finer quality of paper--this makes the book a little bigger in size, but gives it a heft that suggests quality. The text of the Doubleday edition, unlike that of the Penguin, conforms to the divisions and content of the most current LDS Church printing.The presentation of the text itself is something of a compromise. Unlike the official Church edition, the Doubleday version does not contain a substantial interpretive apparatus--that is, the footnotes and cross-references, along with much of the book introductions, are omitted. This deletion could be a problem for newcomers, especially those looking to understand how the LDS Church believes the Book of Mormon relates to the Bible and to their own internal canon of scripture. However, unlike Penguin's novel-like format, the Doubleday version retains the LDS Church's present versification and double-column format, making this a usable work for believers who want a somewhat heavier, higher-quality edition of their sacred book.The font, line spacing, and general page design make this a highly readable version, especially as opposed to the Penguin edition's almost interminably dense paragraphing. Discreet headings that summarize or prefigure chapters give a nod to the Church's official interpretations without being too imposing.Penguin's version includes a lengthy introduction placing the Book of Mormon in the context of Joseph Smith and American religious experiences. The Doubleday version includes only the Church's official preface (\\"The Book of Mormon is a volume of holy scripture comparable to the Bible...[et al].\\")In sum, the Doubleday version is a careful and respectful repackaging of the Church's official version in a somewhat more secular wrapper. Unlike the Church missionary copies, this edition is not primarily concerned with proselytizing; unlike the Penguin edition, it conforms nonetheless with the Church's official teachings and text. It occupies a middle ground, and will likely appeal to believers wanting a nicer copy for the bookshelf and to non-readers who would like a \\"genuine\\" copy (it does bear the Church's imprimatur, apparently) without being proselytized in the process."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"The title states clearly what the book is.

The record clearly shows that Doubleday approached the Church requesting permission to publish the book.3. \\"The book is dull and boring, don't waste your time\\" To the dull and boring in society this review is very appropriate.4. \\"This book mentions almost nothing about Christ\\" Amazing!

I will be the first to admit that we like any church has inactive members. I am a little puzzled though. How come this book has produced a church that has such an amazing vitality, organization, and growth rate that it now requires one of the largest constuction projects in the world? Currently we are constructing 451 new quality chapels per year. Our world wide humanitarian aid donations alone, exceed the entire operating budget of many churches. All of the church's growth, construction and operating functions are conducted in the divine wisdom of DEBT FREE status.

Regardless of debaters for both sides, I just want to say how this book affected me. I read it for the first time 4 years ago, and it effect still hasn't left me. When I read it I was amazed at the complex literary style - it surprised me how much of a real story it told. Of course, if I read it when I was sleepy or not interested it was really boring, but in that aspect I place it next to the New Testament - it has a message that is understood only by people who are willing to understand (that's why there are so many people who don't get it). Anyway, this book gives a fresh view on Christianity without debasing it - instead of getting the story of Christ from the Middle East, this tells the story of Christ from somewhere in America, where Christ visited. It is a very interesting read, a gem. Give it a try, someone below said that it's available for free, so just go that way ,it's good, and I feel it is true."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"&quot;... shall every word be established.&quot; (2 Cor. 13:1) No other revelation from God is attested to by so many modern witnesses or has been reaffirmed personally by the Father and Son as this book of scripture.Shall we fail to ignore this veritable &quot;cloud of witnesses?&quot; (Heb. 12:1) Eleven witnesses besides Joseph Smith, Jr. saw and handled th plates from which the Book of Mormon was translated. Three of these men saw the angel who brought the plates and heard a voice from heaven declaring that the translation had been done by the gift and power of God and was true. All eleven men signed sworn legal affidavits attesting to these events as firsthand witnesses. Despite persecution, attempts to discredit their testimonies, and even the excommunication of some, NONE of these witnesses ever denied his testimony of these events. The dying words of the three witnesses leave no doubt along with the added testimonies of their friends and relatives who took part in these events that Joseph Smith's account of the origin of the Book of Mormon - Another Testiment of Jesus Christ was true."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"My Great-great-great-great grandfather was on the 1847 Brigham Young pioneer journey to the Great Salt Lake and then made the trip a few more times to and from Winter Quarters.

It has absorbent sheets of paper: great for the occasional coffee spill.6. It's good for getting rid of Jehovas witnesses - try to give it to them as they try to give you the Watchtower.7. It works great to scare a \\"naughty\\" pet: throw it across the room in their direction- makes a nice thud. *note*-try not to actually hit the pet.8. It's good for evening out that wobble on your kitchen table: rip off desired amount and place under uneven leg9. It worked great to make \\"hills\\" under my batting in my Christmas village.10.

Just pick up a book on history, real history. Or DNA. Or Archaeology. Or Anthropology. Or Botony. Or Chemistry, Metalurgy, or Zoology. If it's science, then it proves this book wrong.

But since this review is specifically about The Book of Mormon, I must give it 5 stars. I would give it 10 stars if I could.--George Stancliffe"},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"Many of the reviewers on here have mentioned how boring the Book of Mormon is. Even though I don't agree with the other things they say, they're right about the book being boring. Of course it's boring. Aren't all religious books boring? I read the Bible, and I consider it to be boring too.Readers have to realize that these religious books weren't meant to entertain. Just the opposite actually. They were meant to educate and enlighten. Just like school. Is school entertaining or fun? No way. But is it important? Absolutely. So, for what the Book of Mormon is- a text book of sorts- it's very good.Readers from any faith, whether they believe in the divinity of the Book of Mormon or not, can learn from this book. For a second, let's just pretend that it was written by man (it was actually translated, but let's just pretend.) Even if it's actually an elaborate work of fiction, it's still a good, moral primer. It teaches values that are important not only to Mormons, or Christians, but to human beings.If you're looking for an entertaining book, I'd be glad to recommend one. If you want to become a better person, read this one. And once you get into it, you just might start enjoying it. There are a lot of wars and conflicts that take place, and some of the people in it(good and bad) are entertaining, on a certain level. Anyway, if you want to read it, go ahead. But if you haven't read it, don't bash it. If you have, feel free. At least you'll know what you're talking about."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"Joseph Smith Jr. (1805-1844) claimed that in 1823 an angel of God named Moroni visited him while he was living in upstate New York. This angel told him of a record of the ancestors of the American Indians who were descendants of the house of Israel. Smith claimed to receive several other visitations from this personage and many others who gave him a basic understanding of the history of these people. Smith also claimed that through the power of God he was able to translate this record which was written on golden plates into the English language and that a person could know that he was a true prophet and that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints which he founded was God's kingdom once they gained a witness from God that the translation of this record (which is the Book of Mormon) was a true record (i.e. not fictional) of these ancient inhabitants of the Americas. The leaders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have also consistently encouraged anyone who can show that the book is false to do all they can to correct the wrongs and frauds of the Church. These leaders make this claim because they seem to have been quite certain that the Book is truly what it claims to be.The historical setting for the book starts in the tower of Babel approx 2300 BC with a group of people called the Jaredites who cross the sea in barges where they carry all sorts of grains, animals and honeybees with them in their barges and come to the Americas which was given exclusively to them by God after the great flood in the days of Noah. These people spread throughout the whole continent and eventually become very wicked and God lets them destroy themselves around 600 BC and the Americas are then given to a new group of people who are all Israelites. Church leaders have consistently taught that the American continents were given exclusively to these group of Jews and that a knowledge of it would be kept hidden from all other people until about the time of the coming of Columbus. Therefore Joseph Smith and the rest of the Mormon church leaders were quite certain and confident that all of the Native Americans were descendants of these people and full-blooded descendants of Israel.In recent years scientists in the fields of archaelogy, anthropology, linguistics and most recently genetics have concluded conclusively that the principal ancestors of the Native Americans were individuals who descended from migrators over the Bering Straits from Mongolia and/or Siberia several thousand years ago. They've also found no evidence at all about any such Israelite groups as described in the Book of Mormon. Scientists who are defenders of the Mormon faith now generally support the claims of these scientists and now claim that the Church never really taught that the principal ancestor of the Native Americans were these Book of Mormon people or that what Joseph Smith and other early Mormon leaders said was just their opinion based on incomplete information. The most common hypothesis of the defenders is that the groups who came to the Americas around 600 BC from Jerusalem mixed with the natives of Mongol descent. Yet this hypothesis directly contradicts the teachings of Smith, others and the text that the Americas would be kept hidden from all other people. Another common hypothesis is that the Hebrew groups who came around 600 BC came to some obscure place and we just haven't yet found their descendants. Yet this hypothesis directly contradicts the teachings of Mormon leaders that all or almost all of the Native Americans are of hebrew blood and descent. The reader should be reminded that Smith claimed to get his information from heavenly messengers and that Smith and other Mormon leaders claimed several times in the &quot;thus saith the Lord&quot; tone that indeed the American Indians are indeed Jews. The reader should also be reminded that Mormon church leaders are recognized by the church membership as being God's authorized representatives to give the world a fulness of truth and to learn firsthand from God about his plan and all truths.The current church leadership has never addressed this issue and in fact they refuse to let third parties examine many early documents that might help scholars better understand the issues involved. Instead they encourage people everywhere to pray to God for guidance and to gain a testimony that they are telling the truth and that the Book of Mormon is true. The assumption is that those who don't gain this special testimony witness from God are not living according to God's commandments and they need to repent in some way in order to really know that the Book of Mormon is true. The Church to this day has always stated that its truthfulness rests on whether or not the Book of Mormon is honestly true. The Church has a massive missionary program in place with the hope that the honest people of the world will come to know that the Church is true and that they will join the Church. I encourage you as you study this book that you consider these things and ask yourself if the Church is really being completely honest and truthful so that you can know for yourself whether or not its true."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ is a great companion scripture to the Bible.

I am currently reading 10 pages per day, which means it will take me 53 days to complete this time. Its stories seem to speak to me personally everytime I open it.

The end where Jesus comes in is good. And that's about it. The middle of the book is so slow I would rather poke my eye out with a pencil. I think that the reason why people have a good 'feeling' when they pray about this book is because of the many chapters taken from the bible, and the fact that it talks about Christ. This is a work of fiction from a con, Joseph Smith, promoted by a false religion that sugar coats (and fabricates) it's own history so people won't leave."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"This record is marvelous way to come to know who the Savior is and is a companion with the Bible. It testifies of the Savior and His dealings with the people living in ancient America before His birth, during His mortal life and after His resurrection. It clarifies many things the Bible does not and answers many questions the Bible introduces. For example, when Christ says to his desciples, \\"Other sheep I have which are not of this fold.\\" He is speaking of the people in the Americas, the very people the Book of Mormon is a record of. Read it with an open mind and you won't be able to put it down. It is a life changing event."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"This is a handsome edition of a book that has had a life changing impact on millions of people since it was first published in 1830. Doubleday has worked with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to put together this edition. It is clean, easy to read, has enough information to help the unfamiliar understand what the Book of Mormon is and what it represents. It is divided into chapters and verses exactly as the edition published by the Church. The difference is that there are no footnotes or cross references to other books of scripture. There is a pronunciation guide at the back as well a short guide to doctrinal subjects that point the interested reader to relevant verses.I understand that this book upsets many people. It has ever been so. For millions of us, the Book of Mormon, along with the Bible, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price, is scripture that was brought forth by the gift and power of God through the Prophet Joseph Smith. People who would never consider defaming the Koran or the Bhagivad Gita will go out of their way to attack the Book of Mormon. Why they can't leave it alone is a further evidence, to me at least, of its divinity. But I am perfectly content that others regard this belief as deluded and demonstrably false. I thank them for their concern and urge them to keep on the path they feel to be true.If you have ever wanted to read the Book of Mormon, but didn't want to meet with any missionaries or a member of the Church, this is a perfect edition for you. And if you want to write me and ask me about my beliefs, feel free."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I love the Book of Mormon. I remember a Mormon leader, Gordon Hinckley saying:\\"Believe in the Book of Mormon as another witness of the Son of God. This book has come forth as an added testimony to the world of the great truths concerning the Master as set forth in the Bible. The Bible is the testament of the Old World. The Book of Mormon is the testament of the New World, and they go hand in hand in testimony of the Lord Jesus Christ.\\"I can't understand why those of other faiths cannot accept the Book of Mormon. One would think that they would be looking for additional witnesses to the great and solemn truths of the Bible. We have that witness, my brothers and sisters, this marvelous book of inspiration which affirms the validity and the truth of the divine nature of the Son of God. God be thanked for this precious and wonderful testimony. Let us read it. Let us dwell upon its truths. Let us learn its message and be blessed accordingly\\" (meeting, Baltimore, Maryland, 15 Nov. 1998; quoted in \\"Recurring Themes of President Hinckley,\\" Ensign, June 2000, 18-19).\\"Another Mormon leader, David Haight, saying, \\"\\"The Book of Mormon did not come forth as a curiosity. It was written with a definite purpose-a purpose to be felt by every reader. From the title page we read that it was written \`to the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that JESUS is the CHRIST, the ETERNAL GOD, manifesting himself unto all nations.' The message it contains is a witness for Christ and teaches the love of God for all mankind. Its purpose is to bring people to accept Jesus as the Christ. The book tells of the actual visit of Christ to ancient America and records the teachings and instructions He gave in clarity and great power to the people. The Book of Mormon substantiates the Bible in its teachings of the Savior, speaks of Christ more than any other subject, and teaches that our Savior is the Redeemer and Atoner of mankind, constantly emphasizing that He is the central figure in God's plan of salvation. This divine record makes converts to its message and to His Church, which teaches it\\" (\\"Joseph Smith, the Prophet,\\" Ensign, Dec. 2001, 28).\\"Hinckley also said, \\"Its appeal is as timeless as truth, as universal as mankind. It is the only book that contains within its covers a promise that by divine power the reader may know with certainty of its truth.Its origin is miraculous; when the story of that origin is first told to one unfamiliar with it, it is almost unbelievable. But the book is here to be felt and handled and read. No one can dispute its presence.All efforts to account for its origin, other than the account given by Joseph Smith, have been shown to lack substance. It is a record of ancient America. It is the scripture of the New World, as certainly as the Bible is the scripture of the Old. Each speaks of the other. Each carries with it the spirit of inspiration, the power to convince and to convert. Together they become two witnesses, hand in hand, that Jesus is the Christ, the resurrected and living Son of the living God.Its narrative is a chronicle of nations long since gone. But in its descriptions of the problems of today's society, it is as current as the morning newspaper and much more definitive, inspired, and inspiring concerning the solutions to those problems.I know of no other writing that sets forth with such clarity the tragic consequences to societies that follow courses contrary to the commandments of God. Its pages trace the stories of two distinct civilizations that flourished on the Western Hemisphere. Each began as a small nation, its people walking in the fear of the Lord. Each prospered, but with prosperity came growing evils. The people succumbed to the wiles of ambitious and scheming leaders who oppressed them with burdensome taxes, who lulled them with hollow promises, who countenanced and even encouraged loose and lascivious living, who led them into terrible wars that resulted in the death of millions and the final extinction of two great civilizations in two different eras.No other written testament so clearly illustrates the fact that when men and nations walk in the fear of God and in obedience to his commandments, they prosper and grow, but when they disregard him and his word, there comes a decay which, unless arrested by righteousness, leads to impotence and death. The Book of Mormon is an affirmation of the Old Testament proverb, \\"Righteousness exalteth a nation: but sin is a reproach to any people.\\" (Prov. 14:34.)While the Book of Mormon speaks with power about the issues that affect our modern society, the great and stirring burden of its message is a testimony, vibrant and true, that Jesus is the Christ, the promised Messiah. The book bears witness of him who walked the dusty roads of Palestine healing the sick and teaching the doctrines of salvation; who died upon the cross of Calvary; who on the third day came forth from the tomb, appearing to many; and who, as a resurrected being, visited the people of the Western Hemisphere, concerning whom he earlier had said: \\"And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.\\" (John 10:16.)For centuries the Bible stood alone as a written testimony of the divinity of Jesus of Nazareth. Now, at its side, stands a second and powerful witness to lead mankind to the Lord.\\"Also, Another leader, the late President Benson, said, \\"From the Book of Mormon we learn how disciples of Christ live in times of war. From the Book of Mormon we see the evils of secret combinations portrayed in graphic and chilling reality. In the Book of Mormon we find lessons for dealing with persecution and apostasy. We learn much about how to do missionary work. And more than anywhere else, we see in the Book of Mormon the dangers of materialism and setting our hearts on the things of the world. Can anyone doubt that this book was meant for us and that in it we find great power, great comfort, and great protection?\\" (Ezra Taft Benson, \\"The Keystone of Our Religion,\\" Ensign, Jan. 1992, 2)The Book of Mormon is a great book for those who want a great testimony of CHRIST, the Savior."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"Initially, I was impressed by its use of the King James style of the English language, and when I prayed about it I thought it might be true. Fortunately, I also had the common sense to read supplemental texts (like exmormon.org) and find out that the BOM should simply be used for entertainment purposes. By the way, do yourself a favor and don't waste your money on this book. Just ask any old Mormon for a copy and you'll get more than you could ever want."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I do not intend for this review to be scholarly; rather, my intention is for it to be spiritual--after all, that is the tone of this book.If you are searching for assistance in BECOMING a disciple of Jesus Christ, or DEEPENING your discipleship of Him, then prayerfully reading and applying the teachings of this book, especially in conjunction with the Old and New Testaments, will do the trick!I have read The Book of Mormon multiple times and have found it to be a splendid guide to discipleship of the Lord! I am not qualfied to define what constitutes a \\"good\\" guide to discipleship, but I am qualified to declare this: My cumulative experience in reading and applying the teachings found within this book causes me to believe very (oh my, how words are inadequate!) strongly that Jesus is truly the Savior of the world and that becoming more like Him is the most important thing any human being could ever do.Nephi, a prophet and the first writer in this book, declared, \\"For the fulness of mine intent is that I may persuade men to come unto the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob [all of which are references to Jesus Christ], and be saved\\" (1 Nephi 6:4, words in brackets inserted by me).Towards the middle of the book, there is an account of the conversion of a king. In this account, the following was attributed to that king: \\"O God, Aaron hath told me that there is a God; and if there is a God, and if thou art God, wilt thou make thyself known unto me, and I will give away all my sins to know thee, and that I may be raised from the dead, and be saved at the last day...\\" (Alma 22:18).In this book, there is an account of Jesus Christ's appearance to a group of people on the American continent after His resurrection and ascension. As He addressed those He had called to lead this people spiritually, Jesus said, \\"...what manner of men ought ye to be? Verily I say unto you, even as I am\\" (3 Nephi 27:27).The prophet Moroni, the final writer in this book and he who buried it for a future generation (i.e., us), counsels the reader: \\"...I would commend you to seek this Jesus of whom the prophets and apostles have written, that the grace of God the Father, and also the Lord Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost, which beareth record of them, may be and abide in you forever. Amen\\" (Ether 12:41).Finally, from the Introduction, we read, \\"Concerning this record the Prophet Joseph Smith said: 'I told the brethren that the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book.'\\"These brief passages are some of my favorites! They help give a glimpse of why I feel The Book of Mormon is a splendid guide to discipleship of the Lord. Without reservation, I recommend this book to that end."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I have read this book and prayed to know if it was true.

Although I drew inpiration and guidance from nearly all of the texts I sampled, the Book of Mormon touched my heart and spoke to my spiritual side with more force than all of the other works combined.There will be many who criticize this Book because they have hard feelings against Mormon people or the institution of the LDS Church. I would not advise that anyone read or refuse to read this Book based on those critical comments (or, for that matter, based on my praise for this Book!). I would suggest that you consider reading this Book if you truly want to know if God lives, if Jesus is his Son and the Savior of Mankind, and if the Gospel provides answers to life's most vexing questions (i.e., who am I, where did I come from, where am I going, etc.) The Book of Mormon will answer these questions.

That is my opinion, though not one without reason. If you question this, then please research the matter yourself (before any conclusions are jumped to).

Overall, I couldn't be much happier with the purchase."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"First published in 1830, the Book of Mormon has been continuosly in print since then, for over 170 years. It has been translated into dozens of foreign languages. Millions of people have read it, many receiving free copies from Mormon missionaries (the LDS church - the largest of the Mormon churches - has a full-time missionary corps of over 50,000). Many of those have accepted its claims and joined one of the many Mormon sects which accept it as divinely revealed scripture. Many others - probably the great majority - have read it and recognized it as a fantasy tale written in the early nineteenth century.The book purports to be a translation - made with divine assistance - of gold plates on which the ancient inhabitants of America wrote their own religious and secular history. It describes these inhabitants as Israelites, having been divinely led to America at the time of the Babylonian destruction of Jerusalem six centuries before Christ. It describes their culture, their prophets, their many wars, a supposed post-resurrection visit by Jesus to America, and the final destruction of the more civilized inhabitants about 400 C.E. by the more savage ones, who are the ancestors of the American Indians.No non-Mormon historian, anthropologist, archaeologist or other expert in pre-Columbian America accepts the Book of Mormon's (non-religious) claims. Rather than being an accurate description of ancient American culture, it describes what a relatively uneducated person in the time of Joseph Smith might suppose it to be - similar to his own American, European-based culture, with steel, horses, chariots, glass, compasses, coins, wheat, cattle, flocks, and so on. None of these things were known to the ancient Americans. Nor does it accurately reflect how Jewish immigrants to America might have lived, since it shows a great ignorance of Jewish religion and culture. More than that, the book shows no indication of familiarity with genuine ancient American life or history.The book is filled with many other anachronisms. Much of its religious material is merely copied almost word-for-word from the King James English Bible translation, putting many words of the New Testament writers into the mouths of American prophets who lived supposedly hundreds of years before Christ. The supposed historical material is largely a reflection of commonly held ideas in Smith's time about the origins of the American Indians, and mostly based on a book published by a New England pastor just a few years before Smith wrote the Book of Mormon, called \\"A View of the Hebrews\\", by Rev. Ethan Smith (no relation), first published in 1823, with a second edition in 1825. (See David Persuitte's book \\"Joseph Smith and the Origins of the Book of Mormon\\"). That notion - that the Indians are descendants of ancient Israelites - has been so thoroughly disproven by science that even many Mormon scholars now admit that Smith's claims on that issue were wrong. (See Simon Southerton's book \\"Losing A Lost Tribe.\\")Hundreds of books have been written by Mormons to support the claims made in the Book of Mormon. Hundreds of others have been written to expose the book as a work of fiction. Interestingly, the defenders of the book's claims generally urge readers of the book not to read anything ABOUT the book - especially anything negative - but rather they urge the reader simply to pray to God and ask whether its claims are true. Unfortunately, it seems that God sometimes tells readers that it is true, but apparently he tells many other readers that it is a hoax. Why else would one find dozens of copies in the ten-cent bin at every thrift store in the country? Or perhaps most people feel that they do not need God's help in confirming that they are reading a fantasy tale - however religious it may sound - and not a description of real life or real events in a real place."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"Is this book worth a look to someone not a member of the LDS faith?I recommend The Book of Mormon for a variety of reasons. First, it provides a fascinating look at unique personal and national histories with a moral focus; how does a culture thrive (or not) based on its keeping Universal Truth? What builds, and destroys, a nation? What builds, and destroys, a person's soul?Second, this book provides layer upon layer of meaning. High reread value. You can find meaning on every (and I mean every) single page, regardless of the occasional challenge to get through it due to its Old Testament-like language. It covers very personal issues and how those things we struggle with on a day-to-day basis can build (or unravel) an entire civilization.Lastly, it is a rare book that challenges the reader to know for themsleves if it is true. The book has the guts to claim it is Universal Truth. It claims anyone can know it is real.

I gave it a 5 because it has streaghthened my home and family. My family is a lot closer now. We have had many blessings from this book."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"This is the book that started the now 12 million member Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 1830 -- unquestionably one of the most important books ever published in the United States. No library is complete without it.Mormons accept the book as scripture, even more \\"perfect\\" than the Bible since they claim it was written directly and only by ancient prophets living in the Americas from 600 BC to 400 AD, hidden from the world, and then revealed to and translated by the first modern prophet, Joseph Smith.Those who believe the Bible to be God's word and draw inspiration from its passages will want to see if God also speaks to them from the Book of Mormon. Proclaiming itself a \\"second witness for Jesus Christ,\\" the Book of Mormon principally recounts the history of a family and their descendants who, at the command of God, leave Jerusalem prior to its conquest by the Babylonians in 600 AD, travel along the Red Sea, build a boat, sail to the American continent and develop into two societies often at war with the other. The \\"righteous\\" organize churches and practice baptism, awaiting the promised earthly ministry of Jesus Christ who appears and ministers to them for several days following his crucifixion and resurrection in the old world.Students of antiquity know that many of the historical criticisms heaped on the Book of Mormon when first published in 1830 proved false over time -- for example, it is now known that ancient societies did write on metal or even gold plates and that boat travel from the Middle East to America was possible during 600 BC.The greatest value of the Book of Mormon is to persuade the reader to \\"come unto Christ.\\" Sure, the 1830 language, which compares with the King James Version of the Bible commonly used at the time, is somewhat stilted. Yes, Mark Twain called the Book of Mormon \\"chloroform in print\\" (as if the Bible does not possess the same attribute). Still, the Book of Mormon contains passages as powerful and moving as any found in the Bible. No passage in the Bible explains the meaning of life as fully as the second chapter of II Nephi, the second book in the Book of Mormon."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"Joseph Smith, the author of the book, was a convicted conman who eeked out a meager existence as a scryer, hiring himself out as a treasure hunter. He perpetrated [...] against his neighbors by promising to find buried treasure for farmers in his community in upstate NY. When he failed, he was brought up on charges, tried and convicted. The records of those convictions are in the counties in which he committed his [...], mainly New York state. Smith continued his larcenous career, using peep stones to hunt for treasure, never finding any. He escaped jail several times by running away and hiding.When treasure hunting proved fruitless, Smith found a more lucrative yet still [...] venture using his peep stones. He found a different kind of treasure, the \\"golden Bible\\" which came to be known as the BofM. Using a hat and his peep stones, Smith translated the golden plates which he claimed to have received from an angel and from which the BofM supposedly derived. The amazing thing is, Smith was able to translate these plates by looking at the peep stone in the bottom of a hat. The plates weren't even in the room when this \\"translation\\" took place!Why, if the BofM is the record of people living on the North American continent before during and after the time of Christ, is this book so close to the King James version of the Bible? In fact, in many places, the BofM is almost a verbatim copy of the Bible. How could Smith, a convicted [...], translate an ancient record using a peep stone placed in the bottom of a hat? How could these records be written in a language Smith called reformed Egyptian---a language linguistic scholars insist has never existed? Why is Smith the only one to have seen these plates? Where is the archaeological evidence supporting the existence of these ancient BofM people? Why has the Mormon church become silent concerning the origin of the American Indians? For over one hundred years the Mormon leadership claimed the Indians are descendants of these ancient Jews who are the BofM tribes. Is it because DNA research has discovered that the American Indians are descendants of Asian people, not Jews?If the BofM is what the Mormon church claims it is, why is there absolutely no corroborating evidence to support its authenticity?

The Book of Mormon is not intended to be some great work of literature or fiction. It is meant as, and is, scripture and revelation that has come from God to man. Yes, there are many parts that are not gramatically correct and even a part or two that is a little tedious. But the book is the Word of God. It is another testament of Jesus Christ. It would have been impossible for Joseph Smith, having a third-grade education, to write a book of this style or magnitude without divine help.I can gurantee that those who have read the Book of Mormon and have not recieved anything from it have not sincerely opened their hearts and pondered on the possibility that it might be true. Even if you doubt, you can always ask God:\\"If any of you lacketh wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not.\\" ~ James 1:5 (New Testament, King James Version)All you have to do is sincerely ask, and you will be answered. I can gurantee it. I asked if the Book of Mormon was the true word of God - and I got my answer."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"The Book of Mormon is a work of fiction with its origins in the desire of early nineteenth century Americans to explain the remnants of Native American civilization they were aware of. Finding it incredible that the Indians could have made such a civilization on their own, the author imagined that a group of exiles must have come over from the Holy Land centuries earlier.Just who wrote the Book of Mormon is hard to say. I tend to think Joseph Smith did. Yes, he was uneducated, but he was certainly a smart young man. Considering his later writings, I don't see that the Book of Mormon was beyond his abilities.As far as the merits of the book itself, certainly it has some. The plot takes some interesting turns. As literature, though, the book is frankly dull, especially in the last half. The Book of Mormon deals in black and white: the characters are either wicked or righteous. Real people aren't like that. Whatever Smith's merits as a writer, creating believable and interesting characters wasn't one of them. Unlike real history, the plot of the Book of Mormon also tends to follow a neat path of \\"wickedness leads to destruction\\" every time. At best, taking the Book of Mormon as scripture tends to be a distraction from the real problems of society and our planet.Most scientists who are not historians of 19th century America tend to dismiss extreme religious books like the Book of Mormon as beneath their notice. In a way you can hardly blame the scientists, because the Book of Mormon is contrary to pretty much everything that is known today about Native American civilization. However, I think the scientists are wrong to ignore religious works. The Mormons are today a group with serious political power; they are well represented in Washington, especially in the intelligence community. No matter what your own beliefs are, in my opinion it is important to read the works of people you disagree with. If you are a fan of the Book of Mormon, I would urge you to balance it by reading contary views. I would suggest the books \\"Ghost in the Universe\\" by Edis, and \\"The Demon-Haunted World\\" by Carl Sagan."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I read it... over and over as I was told to do.

Joseph Smith was a liar and deserves punishment, not reward, for his actions. He was an evil man."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"There is no doubt that as a religious text the Book of Mormon makes facinating reading. There is no doubt that the Book of Mormon has made an enormous impact on the lives of millions.There is also no doubt that it fails abysmally in what it purports to be. It purports to be a record of the history of early America during the millenium covered by 600 BC thru about 400 AD. Absolutely NO archeological evidence has ever been found to support the claim that a band of Hebrews left the Middle East and settled in the New World, becoming the ancestors of native Americans. Some Mormon apologists have disingenuosly claimed that the Smithsonian Institution has used the Book of Mormon in archeological research. Since 1951 the Smithsonian has issue a point blank, catergorical denial that they have ever used the Book of Mormon as an aid to archeological research. See their website.This lack of evidence for the historicity of the Book of Mormon contrasts sharply with the wealth of archeological evidence that exists in support of the historicity of the Bible. Biblical scholars might debate issues like dating and chronology but none dispute the actual existence of the evidence. The issue for Biblical scholars is not, do these places exist but how do we interpret the data in the light of the text, and vice versa? Mormon scholars on the other hand have to deal with the fact that they have absolutely NO data with which to work, other than the Book of Mormon itself.The only conclusion one can come to is that the Book of Mormon is what it is, namely a 19th century work by Joseph Smith. As such, it is creatively innovative and clearly the work of a religious genius and will continue to influence the relgious lives of millions. The true believers among them will be unswayed by the fact that there is no evidence for its claim that it is an ancient text. This lack of evidence will keep the rest of us in healthy skepticism re its claims of antiquity, we will continue to recognize that it comes from the fertile mind of Joseph Smith. It is a book reflects the ferment of religious ideas current in early 19th century America.Two stars as nothing more an interesting read of religious and historical fiction."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"On November 16, Thomas R. Spencer of Chapel Hill, NC wrote a favorable review of the \\"Book of Mormon.\\" One of the claims in his review is incorrect.

This publisher provides the best-referenced scholarship I have seen on the \\"Book of Mormon.\\""},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"Most of the Mormons I have met in my life have been decent, kind people. Actually, \\"most\\" is perhaps an unfair word--I can't think of a Mormon I've known who wasn't a genuinely good person. My experiences have led me to believe that there must be something in their religion, or in their culture, to account for this. Whatever it is I was looking for, I did not find it in the Book of Mormon.Now, please understand, religion is a matter of faith. I happen to be an atheist, and so I cannot see the Book of Mormon in the same way as a believer can. On the other hand, my perspective gives me some unique insights, as well. So does my background in history (a B.A.) and my having read other religious texts such as the Bible, the Koran and the Bhagavad-Gita.Disclaimers aside (and, I know, the faithful are going to hate what I have to say no matter how many disclaimers I lay down), I must report: I did not like The Book of Mormon.As a religious text, it is a disappointment: it seems to encourage racism, as God makes people black as a punishment; the work only touches on morality lightly and superficially (people who agree that Jesus is/will be the Son-of-God are good, those who disagree are bad).As an entertaining read, it is a disappointment: for the most part, the Book is a collection of sand-dry war records with almost no color or detail. This is an example of how the Book reads: \\"And then, behold, Group A made war upon Group B and there were many men slain in Group A because they opposed liberty, but Group B remained almost untouched. Yea behold, 420 men in Group A were slain, but only 10 were slain in Group B. And behold, the next year Group C made war upon Group B and Group C was destroyed save for a small number, for they had opposed liberty.\\" Seriously. This is what it is like for hundreds of pages.As a historical record, it is a disappointment. Frankly, the Book of Mormon is fradulent. It claims to be the records of Israelites who fled Israel before the Babylonian Captivity--the \\"lost tribes\\" who wound up coming to America; the forerunners to the Native American tribes. However, the book throws around concepts like \\"liberty\\" as though these were fully developed concepts at the time. It also throws around the name \\"Jesus Christ\\" as the ancient Mormon prophets supposedly knew of his coming. It is strange that the Book of Mormon contains no sketchy hints requiring explanation or special pleading, as can be witnessed in people's explanations of Daniel or Isaiah or other Old Testament prophecies. No, the prophets in the Book of Mormon are direct, to the point, and accurate. Eerily so. Tellingly so.Further, the Books explanation of the existence of Native Americans runs contrary to the modern evidence of the Asiatic landbridge and DNA, etc. Also, and despite the fact that the Book of Mormon has reportedly several authors (of the various books, like the Bible), the style of each book seems remarkably similar. It is unlike the Bible in this respect; Ecclesiastes is very different from Chronicles which is very dissimilar to Jeremiah which is very unlike Exodus; John does not resemble Matthew stylistically. The Book of Mormon feels like one consistent voice spinning one narrative. This is because one man--Joseph Smith--did write the entire thing, and then he claimed that he found it buried in upstate New York with the help of an angel.You see, that is what accounts for the knowledge of modern politcal concepts such as liberty. That is what accounts for the similarity in narrative styles by the \\"different authors\\" of the Book of Mormon. That is what accounts for the knowledge of Native Americans, but lack of knowledge as to their actual origins or DNA evidence, etc. It is because one man wrote this book on the American continent before the discovery of DNA and other forms of evidence. You see?As I said, I'm an athiest. It was never very likely that reading The Book of Mormon would convict me, or convince me, of much. On the other hand, I enjoyed reading the other religious books I'd read much more than this one. I think that those other works are more entertaining, more important morally/religiously, and more important historically. However they might be mistaken, I do not believe that they were written with the same intentional fraud out of which was born the Book of Mormon.The faithful Mormon will love the book, and will hate me (or if not, at least what I say); that's fine. I understand. But this isn't a good book in any sense. It is a waste of time, energy and effort, and I rather grieve for those who are told from their infancy that it has some relevance to our world."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"This is a fictious book written originally by Larry Spaulding but stolen by the printer and surfaced as the Book of Mormon.

So the Jesus of whom they are speaking must be the Biblical Jesus.The first paragraph of the &quot;Introduction&quot; to the Book of Mormon reads:&quot;The Book of Mormon is a volume of holy scripture comparable to the Bible. It is a record of God's dealings with the ancient inhabitants of the Americas and contains, as does the Bible, the fulness of the everlasting gospel.&quot;Here we see the Book of Mormon being 'linked' to the Bible, therefore, our assumption that they mean another testament - besides the Bible, is obviously correct. [As an aside: notice the above introduction says the Bible also contains 'the fulness of the everlasting gospel'. The Mormon Church teaches that parts of the Bible are missing, and that which remains is largely corrupted. Since that is what they believe, why does the Book of Mormon introduction say otherwise?]Imagine you wrote a biography of Elvis Presley and it became world famous; a standard reference work for anyone wanting to study the life of &quot;The King.&quot; Then, years later, I wrote another biography of Elvis Presley - However! The Elvis Presley of whom I wrote was not the famous singer but somebody quite different who just happened to have the same name. Now, if I put on the front cover of my book:&quot;Another biography of Elvis Presley.&quot;I would be giving a false impression. Because those words would suggest I was speaking about the same Elvis Presley as you, since I claim it is 'another' (a second) biography.A different Jesus?For many years Christians have claimed that the Jesus of the Mormon Church is a different Jesus than He of whom the Bible speaks. This claim has been denied by LDS Church leaders who have insisted they worship the same Jesus. The Jesus of the Bible.Hinckley's admission:On June 4, 1998 whilst on a visit to Paris, France. President Hinckley bore his testimony of Jesus Christ. While doing so Hinckley spoke of those outside the church who claim Mormons do not believe in the traditional Christ, he continued:&quot;No, I don't. The traditional Christ of whom they speak is not the Christ of whom I speak. For the Christ of whom I speak has been revealed in the Dispensation of the Fulness of Times.

There are EXACT verses that say \\"the messiah is God in the flesh.\\" The Book of Mormon teaches one Heaven and one Hell. There are never any Degrees of Glory talked about. At least not until Doctrine and Covenants. Yes, reading the Book of Mormon will make you think that the LDS believe what Christians do, but once you get into their other books of scripture (Pearl of Great Price and Doctrine and Covenants) this all changes.

If you are looking for a Christian religion to believe in and you want to try Mormonism, you'll have to read this book. You'll only have to read a couple passages near the end, though, that tell you to pray to God asking if the book is &quot;true&quot;. The text says that if you receive a warm, fuzzy feeling, that means it's true. After that, you can contact the missionaries and get yourself baptized. You don't need to read the whole book; lots of Mormons never do.If you are looking to study Mormonism as a religion, culture, cult, or some other type of organization, you'll need to read this book at least a little. But also read the original version (you can buy it on Amazon, apparently), because there seems to be a difference between the current and past versions. Also, read lots of other books about Mormons, and make sure you know the agendas of the writers, so that you know how biased their information is. I would say that authors have a tendency to be biased when it comes to religion.If you are looking to be entertained, I have no idea if you'll enjoy it. The writing is rather crappy (that is my opinion as a writer). It can be quite repetitious. It has little stories that can be entertaining, in a mythical-folklore-larger-than-life kind of way.

A good portion of the book is plagiarism of the Bible, perhaps explaining the familiarity and comfort that those who convert from christianity find in the book.The truth is, the book was written in the early 1800's by a charismatic man (Joseph Smith) looking to start his own following...in search of wealth and prestige after many failed attempts at mysticism (searching for gold through peep-stones and divining rods). As his movement grew, so did his lust for power and women (beginning his practice of polygamy which was carried on by succeeding \\"prophets\\" indulging their own lust for the ladies). Many members left the fold at that time due to disgust (well, a lot of men stayed...hmmmm, wonder why?).Modern day mormonism has distanced itself from it's sordid (polygamy) and bloody past (mountain meadows massacre...where some odd 100 to 200+ innocent pioneers were butchered by faithful mormons while crossing Utah...the scapegoat of the massacre, John D. Lee, a sort of godson of Brigham Young, vehemently claimed to his death that the massacre was ordered by The \\"prophet\\" Young). Blood Oaths in secret temple rituals were abandoned only in the last ten years or so. Blood \\"atonement\\" still exists in Utah, where convicted murderers have the \\"option\\" of death by firing squad. But now even that practice has a movement for abolishment to coincide with our more civil times. Also take note of the issue of full fledged memberships for the \\"black man\\" and their view of the American indian. It was only in the 1980's after much political pressure that a convenient \\"revelation\\" from their \\"prophet\\" that the african american and black people across the globe have been allowed full rights and privileges of membership. Prior to that, they were viewed as lesser human beings...offspring of Cain (of Bible fame) that were cursed and less valiant. Up until the last few years, the language of the \\"most true and correct book on earth\\" (as it is often referred to), referred to american indians past and present as \\"a dark and loathsome\\" people. Whites of course were referred to as \\"white and delightsome.\\" Naturally, those descriptions have been recently changed to something more politically correct.So why bring all this up in a simple book review? Because it is important to note that the book is a constantly evolving work of fiction, re-written to suit the day and age we live in. Also noteworthy is the effect the book has on faithful mormons. Critical reviews of the book are met with responses such as \\"I testify this book is true.\\" \\"God revealed the truthfulness to me\\" and so on and so forth. Sane and compelling arguments and evidence by skeptics of the book are not answered with logical explanations or sanity, they are responded to with accusations of persecution, apostacy, heresy, sinful disposition, or accusations of satanic conspiracy.Truth is often sought by people with a real quest for knowledge. Others fall to what comforts them or removes the arduous task of finding truth. Some fear the consequences when truth is discovered. The mormon faithful fall into the latter category. Other \\"small\\" and \\"gramatical\\" revisionsP.S. Yes I have actually read the book...and many other scholarly and \\"spiritual\\" mormon books and scripture. I have also read exhaustive studies by individuals and bipartisan researchers with factual scientific and historical evidence which thoroughly discounts the book and other mormon claims. Doesn't that make for a balanced review? :)"},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"Why would anyone give even a dime for this poorly written boring 19th century pulp fiction, even if you are a theologist interested in Mormonism?

You'll have to correct that!The Community of Christ (formerly the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) has published a replica of the 1830 version. I'd recommend that instead, if you tend to be masochistic. The ISBN is 0-8309-0025-X.The truth is though, the Book of Mormon isn't going to give you a good picture at all on the beginnings, or doctrines, of the Mormon church. For that, you'll have to read at least the revelations of Joseph Smith, Jr., called the Doctrine &amp; Covenants.The &quot;Doctrine&quot; part used to consist of the so called Lectures of Faith, but the church removed that part (leaving the title of the book untouched, though) when the inconsistencies became too embarrassing. That's why we nowadays only have the &quot;Covenants&quot; part.

At the time Joseph wrote this book, there was both in America as well as Europe a trend to idealize past societies and James MacPherson's Ossian legends he wrote in Scotland were an early example. Joseph Smith was much influenced by Solomon Spaulding, who like many people were influenced by the Ossian legends. The Book of Mormon is a purported history of native americans, postulating that they were descendents of the inhabitants of Israel, descending from a prophet named Lehi. In general, the protagonists in Joseph's book end in \\"i\\" (eye) such as Lehi, Nephi, Moroni, etc. Many of the antagonists end in \\"hor\\" such as \\"Corihor\\", \\"Nehor\\", etc.An over-riding theme of the book is the early nineteenth century wisdom that \\"pride preceeds the fall.\\" Many stories within the book talk about a humble people gaining wealth through their righteousness only to turn against God and to become prideful. This pridefulness results in their downfall and only becoming humble again results in the material and spiritual blessings of God. This theme is consistent with many New England calvinist philosophies about gaining wealth through righteousness and losing wealth or status through wickedness.This book is important in American literature because of these morality lessons and what they say about America. Those values spread throughout the country in the puritan diaspora of which Mormonism is an important component.No serious scholars actually believe the Book of Mormon to be an actual history of the peoples of the Americas. DNA, linguistic and other evidence clearly contradicts those claims (for more information, read \\"Insider's View of Mormon Origins\\" by Grant Palmer). True believers of the religion will \\"bear testimony\\" with tremendous sincerity and the book plays an important role in their religious life. But when the book is looked at in the perspective of showing the morals and outlooks of Americans in the early 1800s, it is a significant work for historians to study. Also, the volume being advertised is very nicely bound with a very attractive cover and will be an attractive addition to your book collection."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"When Jesus Christ came among the Jews, His own people, the great majority of them rejected Him. To the true follower of Christ, this fact would hopefully seem extremely surprising. How could the very people who had the prophecies of Christ, who knew of His covenants, who knew of His characteristics, and who knew of His future condescesion among the children of men, possibly reject their very Redeemer when He stood before them in the flesh? Please stop and really think about that for a moment. God's own people, who should have known Him best, not only rejected Him to His face, but murdered Him.However, there was a small minority of Jews who recognized their Redeemer. How? What was different about them? The Bible gives us the answer. Consider Matthew: he was a Jew who was well acquainted with the Old Testament. In his book, he repeatedly \\"proves\\" that Christ is the Messiah by quoting the words of the prophet Isaiah, among others. Isaiah prophesied wonderful things about the First Coming of Christ in Jerusalem, and each was fulfilled. However, this was not all that he prophesied about. He spoke many words about the last days, saying \\"In that day\\" again and again. He prophesied clearly of a time when a sealed book would be brought to an uneducated man. He spoke clearly about truth coming out of the earth, about messengers traveling to the islands (continents) of the world, gathering the house of Israel, God's covenant people, before the SECOND Coming of Jesus Christ.When Christ utters a prophecy through His prophets, such as He did with Isaiah, all of them will be fulfilled. The question remains, then: Are these prophecies being fulfilled, and if so, how? Are we like Matthew, who knew and recognized the fulfillment of all these glorious things happening around him and took part in them, or are we like the Jews, fulfilling the roles of the ignorant and decieved, rejecting the very source of light and salvation as it stands before our face?I promise you that the Book of Mormon is in reality the very work and word of Jesus the Christ. I also promise you that the Bible is the very work of word of Jesus Christ. I promise you, PROMISE you on His behalf, that if you will read the Book of Mormon and sincerely ask God if it is true, He will manifest the truth of it unto you, as the prophet Moroni promised, by the power of the Holy Ghost. You will then KNOW, as I and a rapidly increasing number of God's children know, that miracles still continue today, because you will literally experience one. All of your struggles, all of your pains will be soothed and swallowed up in incredible joy: every noble hope and dream you have will be answered upon your head. Fear will leave you; life will finally make full and perfect sense. You will come to know your God and His Son, our Redeemer Jesus Christ, in a way that you never could have conceived, even if you already know the Bible very well. Matthew knew the Old Testament very well before the coming of His Reedemer, but there were even more glorious things the Lord wanted to tell Him. I proclaim these promises fearlessly: as members of the true Church of Jesus Christ in the last days, we know who we are and we know what we know. We know who we follow; we were invited to do so, and now we invite others in love. Matthew had to have faith to know that Jesus was the Christ; seeing was not enough, as evidenced by the rejection of the Messiah by the majority of the Jews, all of whom saw Christ with their physical eyes just as clearly as Matthew did. We too must have faith, even when the majority and possible even those closest to us do not believe. Yet I know that if we try, if we TRULY want to know, we WILL be blessed to know. I give that as a promise on Christ's behalf. I love Him with all my heart."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"*not a book review*If you are going to write a review, write it on the book.

Besides, it makes for dull reading. My suggestion is that you first evaluate Joseph Smith's translation skills by viewing 3 facsimiles and Joseph Smith's explanation of same in The Book of Abraham (BOA). The facsimiles were copied from Egyptian papyri buried with four mummies. Unlike the gold plates which were taken back by the angel Moroni, parts of the papyri are still around in the vaults of the Mormon Church. According to Egyptologists, Joseph Smith's interpretations and translations of the Egyptian characters on the facsimiles are incorrect. The Egyptologists say the facsimiles are part of a standard burial document and have nothing to do with the biblical Abraham.You can get the BOA by ordering the paperback version of the Triple Combination from Deseret Books for $5.95. The Triple Combination includes 1) the BOM, 2) Doctrine and Covenants and 3) The Pearl of Great Price.

When one reads the Book of Mormon, in light of the recent natural disasters that have beset our globe, one is comforted with the peace of a loving God and loving Saviour.

As you see from the various reviews of this book here on Amazon, you will notice that there are two general opinions: (1) This book changed my life, or (2)This book is evil and false. It seems amazing that the same book can elicit such divergent opinions. But it is actually appropriate that a book that adds another afirming testimony of the divinity and reality of the Savior, Jesus Christ should receive the same polarized reaction the the Savior himself received during his life on this earth? Christ was either hated or loved, beaten or embraced, crucified or exhaulted--there was no middle ground. So too, the Book of Mormon leaves no room for indifference. The only way to know who is telling the truth is to read it for yourself. Read it with an open heart. Ponder what is being said. Then humble yourself enough to sincerely ask God to help you to know whether it is true or not.As for my personal review, I have no doubt of it's truthfulness and it's ability to make me a better person, husband and father.

My forebearers remained in Utah and I was born and raised there. Like Bob, I also discovered (to my horror) in my early 40s that the leadership of the church (from the very beginning down to the present day) had been less than forthcoming about truths of all sorts. I was serving as a councilor in a bishopric (leadership of a congregation) at the time and had just concluded reading the entire Book of Mormon per the challenge of our Stake President (a leader of 5-10 congregations).I've read the Book of Mormon cover-to-cover many times and selections therein many more times than that. In my opinion, the Book of Mormon essentially adds *nothing* to the doctrinal content of the Bible - it merely gives an early 1800's Campbellite interpretation thereof. Some consider this evidence that Sidney Rigdon (a prominent Campbellite minister and an early Mormon convert and leader) was the source of the doctrinal content. The theories on the book's authorship can be quite fascinating to one who has an interest in that area.I further believe that it could disappear tomorrow without impacting the doctrine of the LDS church at all. In fact, its disappearance would eliminate a number of glaring inconsistencies with past and present doctrines and practices of the LDS church. Just one of these is the nature of the so-called \\"Plan of Salvation/Happiness.\\" The Book of Mormon is crystal-clear that there is no chance for repentance after death - quite at odds with the key LDS doctrines of post-death proselytizing, repentance and vicarious baptisms and sealings.All of that aside, the Book of Mormon could be exactly what its proponents claim and still be irrelevant to the cause of the LDS church. Why? Simply because there are other branches of the church founded by Joseph Smith who lay claim to being the lawful successor (both in God's eyes and according to the laws of man), branches which hold the LDS church in Salt Lake City as being apostate to one degree or another. The widowed first wife (out of at least 34) of Joseph Smith did not follow Brigham Young. Rather, she threw her lot in with others. If one is apt to pay any heed to the claims made for Joseph Smith, they should be prepared to explain why the equivalent claims of inspired translation and revelation claimed by and for James Strang are invalid.I gave it 2 stars for the same reasons that Bob did."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"The Book of Mormon is a magnificent work on many levels.

It seems some can leave the church, but they can't leave the church alone. Please read my thoughts on this book...The Book of Mormon is a second witness of our Savior Jesus Christ. It was translated by a prophet of God, Joseph Smith. Among many other things, it documents the visit of Christ to the Americas after his death and resurrection. In the Bible, which we Mormons also believe to be the word of God, Christ says, \\"And other sheep I have which are not of this fold:them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.\\" (John 10:16) After Jesus Christ was resurrected, he came to visit those that believed in him in the Americas. It is a beautiful account, and I encourage you to read it.I am 26 years old and have read the Book of Mormon several times cover to cover. A prophet named Moroni gives a challenge towards the end of the book,\\"And when ye shall receive these things, I exhort you the ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost. And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things.\\"(Moroni 10:4-5)I have taken this challenge and I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that this book is the word of God. I know this because of the overwhelming feeling of peace and joy I feel when I read it. If you believe in Jesus Christ you owe it to yourself to read the Book of Mormon and pray about its truthfullness. It does nothing but testify of the divinity and mission of our Lord Jesus Christ. I know these things to be true."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"As a sociologist and member of the American Academy of Religion, I find most of the reviews of the Book of Mormon not be helpful, on the one hand, and kind of curious, on the other hand. Clearly, most are from partisans (either strongly for or against) and not about the text itself or as holy writ of a significant world religion to be accorded the kind of respect one would for sacred writings of other religions.I am among those who (many years ago) received a free copy and read it, both as religious text and as literature. It is not the kind of reading one takes lightly or for fun (altho' apparently some read it for ridicule). But then, neither does one do so for the Bible or Upanshids or Koran, etc. As religious text I found it very interesting and worthy of study, as suggested by some major religious studies scholars, e.g., the eminent Jewish scholar Jacob Neusner and a prominent professor at Harvard Divinity (whose name escapes me for the moment). I found reading the Book of Mormon to be much more akin to the Bible than to such things as Calvin's \\"Institutes\\" and other systematic theologizing.It is something one should read for oneself rather than decide on the basis of critics or supporters. It has many beautiful poetic passages and inspiring moral sermons, like some of the best sermons I have heard delivered by a few Protestant preachers.Is it historically accurate? Is the Bible? Who knows? But the jury is still out on both of those. However, one should not read it as a history text but as a human story, as something that portrays principles about the human condition and human society as people pursue various values and beliefs.What I do wish is that the publishers would provide a little more background for understanding its origin and its place in an expanding world religion and as part of global diversity of belief systems, not just the text itself.Finally, I'm not sure why I would buy this particular edition rather than get another free copy from the Mormon Church.\\"Lament\\"Ithaca, NY"},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"For the record, I read the entire text. But, as early as the middle of the book of I Nephi, which happens to be the very first, I realized my rating would be 5 stars. How does one rate the Christian bible, the Hebrew bible, the Qur'an, or any other book of theistic beliefs?Ultimately, each interlocutor will be requested at some point - in most cases at several points - to take a leap of faith. Whether one is willing to take that step is dependent on a litany of factors, many of which may not hold as much meaning for another investigator. Yet, it seems to me the major consideration is to gain some minimal understanding of the diverse concepts that influence different groups at variable levels. It has been recently reported The Church of the Latter Day Saints is the fastest growing denomination of Christianity. That alone is justification enough for me to spend some time with the basic text to their belief system.The Book Of Mormon is best understood with a conversational familiarity with the Christian bible. For the Mormon, it is Scripture, another testament of Jesus Christ. I am not sectarian, however even if I did subscribe to a specific religious theory, it would be difficult for me to dismiss another based exclusively on the premise at some point in time, the heavenly Father chose to terminate direct communication with his progeny. If the idea Noah could receive divine instruction to build an Ark offers concordance, it seems perfectly plausible alternative blueprints could be proffered to Nephi to cross the expanse of what we now know as the Atlantic Ocean. The New Testament is a new covenant, indicating God is susceptible to a modification of guidelines, who am I to state he didn't hedge his bets at a much earlier juncture?The book is tedious but so is the Old Testament. It is shortsighted to criticize or dismiss without taking the time to explore. I may not agree yet this holy testimony deserves the same amount of respect and reverence as we typically offer to the wider held beliefs."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"The age-old adage, \\"Don't knock it 'till you've tried it,\\" applies here. Many will post their disgruntled views here about why you shouldn't read the Book of Mormon. Only you can decide whether or not it is true or powerful in your life. I read the book for an assignment as a teenager and prayed about it with no heavenly response. I attended Stanford University and married. I attended law school. I had a child. I was very unhappy in my marriage and in life. I didn't know what I believed in anymore. I read the book again, but this time I did a \\"critical\\" reading in the literary sense. What was in those pages and could they help me? I had read the New Testament in high school and had come to love Jesus Christ. I needed more direction in my life than I had. I read the Book of Mormon searching for answers - not to criticize it, not to condemn it, not to judge it. When I finished the book, I put God to the test. I had such an overwhelming feeling of love, light and power come over me after that prayer that stayed with me for at least 20 minutes. In that period of time, I knew that the Book of Mormon was true and that Jesus Christ was alive and my personal savior. From that point in my life I committed to follow Him and help and bless as many people around me as I could. I am still on his path. There are remarkable conversions to the knowledge of Christ in the Book of Mormon, like Saul's conversion in the New Testament. I feel that I had one of those experiences; but, it required a real desire to know with a willing heart to believe what was written. The Book says that those who believe in Christ will believe in these words (the words of the Book of Mormon) because they are his words. I encourage you to read with a believing heart and put God to the test. He always keeps his word."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I have read this book for the past 24 years. I first read it when I was 18. During that time, I've lost count how many I've read it. Like all great books, classics included, each time I've read it, I've learned something new. I've always walked away a better person.The book is a history of a people who fall in and out of love with the God of Heaven. These people are taught of Jesus Christ and His eventual coming to this earth to redeem all that believe on His name. Some believe and act on those beliefs while others choose not to. Those choices create a vivid picture of how belief and faith in Jesus Christ or lack thereof shape a nation.A historical pattern existing in every culture that has ever exists is again reaffirmed in this historical text. Faith, prosperity, pride, and destruction are experienced over and over again. Like all eternal truths or laws which govern all of existence, the principles taught in this book by the lives of these people help me to stand watch in my own life reminding me that Jesus Christ is the only Light by which I can safely be guided."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I was given the Book of Mormon to read about twenty five years ago by my father and I read a chapter or two and put it down. At that time, I was not ready to read this book. Then, 1995, two missionaries came to my home and shared the Book of Mormon with me. I was inspired to read this book to see if it was really true. Over a period of a year I read this book until I had completed it. By the time I finished to Book, I knew that it was the word of God. My scientific training had taught me to be skeptical. My spiritual training had taught me how to be open to the promptings of the Holy Spirit. Through these two, I came to know beyond a shadow of a doubt that this was the true word of God. It changed my life. I joined the LDS Church. It brought me closer to my dad and my family. It made come to understand the power of my dad's testimony of the LDS Church which is documented in his book, [...] Since reading the Book of Mormon in 1995 and 1996 I have read it many times and read it almost daily.

This book, for me, was a revelation. I'm not stupid. I'm not a fool. I'm not closeminded. I don't live in Utah, Idaho, or Missouri. I have a small family and my dad is only married to one woman.I believe. But this is not between you and me, you and Joseph Smith, you and Scott Tippets, or you and Mormon. No. This is between you and whatever being you might give the chance to believe in. Don't listen to others.This book was not meant to be easy-reading. It was not meant to be a bestseller. It was not meant to schlepp your money from you. People want you to read it. They don't care how, just that you do. You can get the book for a single cent. People will be willing to pay the shipping cost for you. You could order it for free. The Mormon church is not out to get you, to brainwash their members, to fool around with history. If Socrates, Einstein and R. Buckminster Fuller had anything to tell us, it is that humanity is stupid, and to trust anyone from a single person to a mob to a congregation on this is foolhardy. Trust yourself and God.I don't care how you get this book. Just read it. Please."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"This book changed my entire perception of religion. It provided insights that led to questions about life, God and religion that I was afraid to ask myself. Is much of it the same as the Bible? Yes. That's because the source that inspired its authors is the same that inspired the Bible. There are four Gospels in the New Testament; are they fradulent because they repeat?The Book of Mormon is so valuable because it restores many things that were lost from the bible during centuries of translation. The Bible has been rewritten so many times, what we currently have can not be considered all that has been revealed to man from God. Ancient scrolls discovered in the Dead Sea show differences, ommisions, and additions when compared to the modern King James text. Does the Book of Mormon fill all the missing gaps? No. But it does certainly provide valuable insights into Christianity. This book is a powerful witness for Christ, it's what the whole book is about.Read the negative reviews of this book here, and observe the language and tone with which they are written. The anger and bitterness is obvious, and damaging to the claims with which they are made. In fact, some of the claims made against the Book of Mormon and Joseph Smith are almost identical copies of the accusations and claims made against the Savior during His ministry among the Jews.Read this book, it won't hurt you. You just might come away from the experience with much more then you would of thought possible.This book changes lives, it did mine.

Understand that the very nature of this book demands that the reader make a choice to either accept it as the Word of God and therefore be under obligation to join The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints or see it as fiction and avoid the often dramatic change in lifestyle that membership in the LDS Church demands. Of course if one is a member of the LDS Church and no longer wishes to conform to the strict standards of conduct espoused by the Church they must somehow find a way in their mind to disavow the divinity of The Book of Mormon or forever see themselves as hypocrites.I have read the book of Mormon numerous times, I have no doubt that it is divine in its origins and I accept it as Scripture, revelation from God. I have also read many of the current antagonistic works concerning this amazing book and on a purely intellectual level find virtually all of them to be contaminated by the author's bias and subjective views. The honest scientist or historian recognizes that conclusions are almost always contaminated by subjectivity and does not pretend otherwise. It is my own subjective judgment that most antagonistic works only fain objectivity. Of course apologist works also lack objectivity however they typically do not pretend to be objective.There are many good honest people who believe the book of Mormon is a fallacy and there are millions who believes it is revelation from God. Where might one find an objective answer to the book of Mormon question? I suggest that you consider accessing the only review that is truly objective, the only review that finally matters, in the words of the book it self;Moroni 10:3-5...when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"At first, I was surprised this book was getting such negative reviews, but it's obvious that many of the reviewers have not even read it, but come here to spread an agenda.

Rather than rely on the word of some very poorly informed reviewers, get a copy and read for yourself. It contains many truths and can lead you closer to God. Many of the angry things these people have said are true of the Bible as well, so it's all in perspective.

The first time I read it, I read it from cover to cover like a novel. It was amazing to me the spiritual insights I gained as I read about God's dealings with the ancient inhabitans on the American continent. Even though I was young, I could understand that when the people were righteous and followed the teachings of the prophets of God, they were happy and prosperous. When they became wicked, the reverse was true.It is a wonderful witness of Jesus Christ. There are prophesies about Jesus Christ throughout the book. It tells of His visit to the American continent, and His dealings with the people living here. It teaches that Jesus is the Son of God, the Savior of the world and that he was resurrected.I have read the book many times, and each time I read it, I learn new spiritual truths and know that it is true history of the people who lived on this continent.This book should be read with an open mind. If the reader has a prayer in his heart, he too will be given a conviction of the truthfulness of the book, its translator, and the teachings it contains.The Book of Mormon has been a guide for righteousness throughout my life.

But for anyone who doesn't even acknowledge the religious aspects of this book i have a parable for you.There once was a man tilling his field, 175 years ago, when he found a diamond. He was very happy with his find and set it on display so that everyone could could admire the natural beauty in the diamond. After a time, people came and began to refute the diamond. Many said that it was not possible that he could have found a daimond and that is was a fake. Finally many jewelers who were considered experts on diamonds were brought in to test the diamond. Some firmly believed it was a true diamond. Others denounced it. And still others said they didn't want to say one way or the other lest they tarnish their reputation. Then one jeweler proclaimed taht is was, in fact, a synthetic diamond. An incredibly made synthetic diamond. But a synthetic diamond nonetheless.It was then pointed out that to have made such an incredible diamond in the technological state the world was in 175 years ago, was even more unlikely and incredible than if the farner had indeed found the diamond.I know this book is the truth, and was inspired of God. In the words of Gamaliel, \\"Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel and this work be of men, it will come to nought.

I strongly recommend pen and paper for keeping track of the characters. If you are reading it as a story, skip the section entitled 2 Nephi after the fourth chapter.The message of the book relates to how Jesus Christ is the Savior of the world and how following His teaching brings blessings. For Christians looking for a way to better understand how to draw nearer to Christ, this book provides practical solutions.

I know I will come down to a lot of Mormons as an anti-Mormon and I do not wish them to think that because I do not hate other people. I will just say that if people want to get close to God, study the Bible. And if they want to know if the Book of Mormon is true, study it with the Bible and not as an independent work. I believe the Spirit testifies of truth, but if we're not careful, we can swallow untruth with it. Test everything against the word of God, hold to that which is true.

Although I am Mormon (a struggling Mormon), the thing I respect the most about the LDS Church is that they encourage members and non-memberes alike to find out for themselves. Make their own decisions. So make your own. Even if you don't want to buy it here, there are ways to get a copy free. Just go to [...].Every religion has a group of people that are against it.

The best course is to read the Book of Mormon and decide for yourself rather than rely on any one person's review. I have done that repeatedly over the past 25 years and have come to firmly believe that the Book of Mormon is the word of God, as is the Holy Bible, and stands as a second witness that Jesus Christ is my Savior.

(Psalms 85:11) Truth shall spring out of the earth. (Isa 29:1-5) A marvelous work and a wonder to be brought forth out of the ground. (Isa 29:11-12) A book that is sealed, delivered to the learned man. (Isa 29:13-18) I will proceed to do a marvelous work among this people, even a marvelous work and a wonder. (Isa 42:9) New things do I declare: before they spring forth, I tell you of them. (Isa 45:8) Let the earth open, and let them bring forth salvation. (Ezek 37:14) I shall place you in your own land. (Ezek 37:15-20) Stick of Judah (Bible), Stick of Joseph (Book of Mormon)(John 10:14-16) And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice (Rev 14:6-7) Everlasting Gospel to be brought forthPaul wrote to the Corinthians that, &quot;In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established&quot; (2 Cor 13:1). Many of the biblical prophets were shown in vision the last days and the coming forth of the Book of Mormon. Many of the Book of Mormon prophets testified of prophets dealings with Christ among the Jews, of which dealings are contained in the Bible. God is the author of both. Joseph Smith was a special and chosen vessel of the Lord, called and commissioned to do a very important work in restoring Christ's church back to the earth and bringing forth an additional witness of His gospel and divinity. Nearly all other churches have and teach out of only the Bible, and yet the teachings differ dramatically from one church to the other. God has given us the Book of Mormon today as a second witness, (thus Paul's law of witnesses)and therefore, the doctrines and teachings of the gospel cannot as easily be misinterpreted and misunderstood because there are two witnesses. They both testify of the same gospel and are authored by the same God, even Jesus Christ, our Savior. Don't rely on the wisdom of men to determine how you live your life. Get on your knees and ask God what's true(James 1:5), and be willing to submit to the answers you recieve from Him. Read, Ponder, and pray with 1: a sincere heart 2:with real intent and 3: with faith in Christ and God's promise will be kept.

I think in my first reading the theme was love. God loves his children. He has a covenant people who he takes care of, if they keep there part of the promise. His arm of mercy is 'always stretched out.'He keeps his promises to Abraham, and preserves his seed by guiding them out of Jerusalem before it is destroyed. Maybe the greatest display of love is when Jesus Christ himself appears to God's children in America. He repeatedly delivers his children and makes their burden light. In companion with the Bible, you can come to know God better and feel his love as you read this book. I testify it is God's word. Read it yourself with faith and prayer, and you will know."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I'm reviewing the ebook, not the content.The format of this book on the kindle is cumbersome. It starts with the table of contents and then as it presents the verses each verse is headed by the chapter and verse. This format is followed in each chapter. It's not at all pleasing to look at much less read.I was looking for the Book of Mormon in more of a book format. I have this version in print and it's closer to book format than the basic Book of Mormon. Unfortunately, you would never know that based on the Kindle format.For the price of $3, it was very disappointing.I also purchasedThe Book of Mormon: 1830 Original Edition (LDS) (Kindle Preferred Active Table of Content Edition)for $0.99 and this was exactly what I was looking for.

Christ did visit the America's after his life on the earth and his resurrection and the people of this continent at the time did look forward to him coming fo the first 600 years that this record covers.

It can change your life for the better."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"The Book of Mormon contains the spiritual and historical records of ancient inhabitants of the American continent. Comparable to the Bible, it contains the writings of prophets who were striving to lead the people to follow God's commandments. The most exciting part contains the account of Christ's visit to America after His resurrection.I have read the Book of Mormon many times and learn each time I reread it. I have learned about how to find peace and joy in my life and how to be a better person. It has also helped me have greater faith in Jesus Christ and His teachings to all people.The most important part of the Book of Mormon is the challenge contained therein to read it, ponder, and sincerely ask God if it is a true book. The promise is given that one really can know that it is true by the Spirit of God, which brings peace and enlightens one's understanding."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"In a nutshell, the Book of Mormon is an account of a prophet (Lehi) and his family who left Jerusalem during the reign of Zedekiah, just before it fell to Babylon. The account tells how Lehi and his family were guided by the Lord across the \\"great waters\\" to what is now known as the American continent, where two major groups were formed: the Nephites (who, for the most part of the account, were righteous and believed in Christ) and the Lamanites (who were primarily hateful and violent, believing that there would be no Christ). The book covers the wars of the two peoples, but more importantly, it focuses on spiritual matters, such as the words of the prophets. What is by many considered the climax of the account is the visit of the ressurected Savior, Jesus Christ, to the American Continent to administer to the Nephites (as they were of the house of Isreal, specifically, the line of Manasseh). The account concludes with the fall of the Nephites into wickedness and their consequent destruction by the hands of the Lamanites, who had become more righteous and are the principal ansenstors of the Native Americans. A breif account is also given of another people who came to the Americas before the Nephites and Lamanites: the Jaredites (who came out from Babylon when the Tower of Babel was destroyed). This people, too, fell into wickedness over the centuries and was destroyed.In my opinion, the true value of the Book of Mormon is in it's \\"fruit\\", or it's teachings. While it gives a historical account, the primary goal of the book's cheif compiler (a Nephite prophet named Mormon, for whom the book is named) was to preserve the spiritual treasures of his people, such as:\\"When ye are in the service of your fellow beings, ye are only in the service of your God.\\" (Mosiah 2:17)\\"Wickedness never was happiness.\\" (Alma 41:10)\\"I will go and do the things which the Lord has commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall provide a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandth them.\\" (1 Nephi 3:7)\\"For it must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things.\\" (2 Nephi 2:11)\\"Adam fell that men might be; and men are that they might have joy.\\" (2 Nephi 2:25)\\"Charity is the pure love of Christ.\\" (Moroni 7:47)\\"By the power of the Holy Ghost, ye may know the truth of all things.\\" (Moroni 10:5)Also given in the account are many stories, as well as a few particularly precious allegories (namely the allegory of the Olive Tree found in the 5th Chapter of the book of Jacob and the vision of the Tree of Life found in Chapters 8 and 11 of the First book of Nephi).Much of the language of the Book of Mormon is poetic, similar in many ways to the Old Testament. Also, as the name of the Christ and His coming were made known unto the prophets of the Nephite civilization, who in turn made them known unto their people, there is a constant struggle in their record with those who are \\"Anti-Christ\\" and fight against the spread of the doctrine of Christ, a circumstance that many in this day and time can no doubt relate to.In addition, some of the prophets in the Book of Mormon were granted a vision of our day and time. They wrote many of the things they saw, including telling of Colombus and the colonization by \\"Gentiles\\" of the \\"Land of Promise\\" (the Americas), of a society filled with many things \\"of curious workmanship\\" (advanced technology), of the coming forth of the Book of Mormon like a voice crying from the dust and the subsequent rejection by many who will say \\"A Bible! A Bible! We have got a Bible, and there cannot be any more Bible.\\" (to which the Lord responds in part, \\"Know ye not that there are more nations than one?\\"), and of \\"secret combinations\\" both anciently and in our day which result in the destruction of nations.In his closing statements at the end of the Book of Mormon, Mormon's son, Moroni, tells that he has seen our day (\\"I speak unto you as if ye are present, and yet ye are not. But Jesus Christ hath shown you unto me, and I know your doing.\\") and he knows that many will reject his words and the words of his father. He recognizes the opposition that will rise against the Book of Mormon and invites those who recieve it to \\"ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you by the power of the Holy Ghost.\\""},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"The Book of Mormon helps the reader gain a better understanding of the mission of our Savior, Jesus Christ. It is a companion to the Bible and helps the reader to better understand the writings of the Bible. Since the Book of Mormon has not passed through the hands of many translators it is easy to understand and does not leave the reader wondering what is missing. I know that if you read the Book of Mormon with a pure heart, wanting to learn more about God, you will be touched by the Spirit and you will know of it's truthfulness."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"The Book of Mormon is very enlightening and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it.

The Book of Mormon is not a particular genre. It contains elements of Action, Adventure, Violence, Mystery, Spirituality and Debauchery. The reading level varies, but averages at about 8th grade level. I read the Book of Mormon more often than any other book and Highly Recommend it. While it is stimulating reading, it is also spiritually uplifting and can bring one closer to God. See Moroni Chapter 10 verses 3-5."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"Coming from an immigrant family to this country and having a family rooted in the belief of God, Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost. Discovering the Book of Mormon clearified many aspects of Christ teachings and also helped my understanding of the inhabitants found on this side of the world. Much of the book of Mormon supports the teachings of the Holy Bible and gives clarity to scriptures understanding.I am an educated man with University degrees and have studied religions over the years. Yet the logic of the Book of Mormon is easy to except and understand. Their is nothing in this great Book that denies the teaching of the prophets of old found in the Bible. Yet in every page you get an account of the correct teachings of Christ.The Book of Mormon is an account of the inhabitants of this continent. The rise and fall of many civilizations. How power and envy can destroy a society. Having lived in Mexico, Central America and South America, I have walked where many before me have walked. The great buildings and the many master pcs. the left behind shows the physical proof found in the Book of Mormon. Many have tried and continue to try to prove the Book of Mormon and the Bible to be incorrect and filled with error and yet they continue to be testimonies of Jesus Christ.To read this book is to gain a testimony of Christ and to gain a testimony one need not me a learned man, but be a man in search of faith and a belief greater than himself."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I recommend this book to anyone. It has the true gospel of Jesus Christ and includes Christ's teachings from Himself. This is an excellent companion to the Bible. It's passages teach the pure love of the Savior.This book comes from ancient prophets as they relate their history and journeyings from Israel to the Americas and their history about 500 years before the birth of Christ. Read along as the ancient inhabitants of the American Continents receive a visit from the Son of God.Make your own assessments of this book. Don't rely on anyone's review. Rely on God."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I was one of the many that also spent two years peddling the book. I peddled in Chinese if that makes a difference. Ho hum. While peddling the book, I had real problems with the historicity of the book. It seemed to me that it was written in the 19th century, not compiled in the fifth century and translated. My favorite part is where this dude goes on and on about \\"fruit of the loins\\". That is just the funniest phrase ever. Say it real fast, \\"Fruit of the loins\\". Then the guy, I think Joseph from the old test, prophesies about Joseph who is the son of his father with the same name joseph. Wow. Joe Smith must have been real excited when he \\"translated\\" that. It's like when your on TV or something. It must have been a cool feeling. Look at me, I'm in the book! How convenient for him. If anyone questions his authority, he can say \\"Look, the Book of Mormon says I am the prophet, Nah!!!!!!\\".It is said it is a book for our time, and well, that's right because it was written in our time. Well actually, it is a book for our great great grandparents time, which is when it was writt... er i mean \\"translated\\".As for the stories and plot, others have commented on it. It is fairly shallow and addresses alot of 18th century issues. It is not a book to be read when you are sleepy, or when you have anything better to do. I gave it two stars because ....... it is free if you go to a mormon church. There. Oh yeah, and \\"fruit of the loins\\".I do feel strongly that is is a work of fiction about the fictional land of \\"promised land\\". The value of the book is up to you. I won't encourage anyone to read it, but if you feel a burning desire, take an antacid.Just remember that if you really think God cares whether you're a Mormon or not, I don't.Testimonies are such programmed garbage. I don't trust the tesimonies for Amway and I'm not going to trust them from the Mormons. Most religious fans (short for fanatic of course) will \\"bare\\" their testimony that their religion is somehow \\"truer\\" than all the rest. Hooey. I'm tired and need to go to bed, good night."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"Life changing and thought provoking. Because of what it claims to be, an ancient record translated by Joseph Smith intended as a companion to the Bible we have today, this book should be read by every person before a decision is made about its truthfulness. With all the controversy surrounding it, it is impossible to form a true opinion without first hand knowledge of its contents. Truly another testimony of Jesus the Christ."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"For those critics who have been friendly to Mormons and have not made personal attacks on us or the founder of our faith, thank you for not being antagonistic towards us. It's refreshing to see that some critics can still be magnanimous.I do have to say, however, that it sounds like many people have done a lot of reading _about_ the Book of Mormon, but have they actually read _the Book of Mormon_? For over 15 years I have read hundreds of reviews on the Web and in books that cite all kinds of outside sources in an attempt to dissect the book without ever really opening it and reading its pages. It's one thing to base one's research upon the doubts _other_ critics have about the credibility of the claim that it was translated rather than authored by Joseph Smith. It's quite another to read it straight through and make your own, informed conclusions.To truly be able to claim credibility in your review of the book, you will have to research like a credible scholar. To do this, you need to actually read it from cover to cover to get familiarity with its structure. Then, you need to read it again for understanding. Then, read it again as if you were a member of the faith it promotes, trying to see it the way someone who believes in it would see it. Then, read it again just in case you missed something. There's a lot in the book, so missing something is common, as faithful members of the LDS church will attest.As you're reading and/or after you've read, please come to http://americantestament.blogspot.com and we'll discuss.Once you've read the Book of Mormon several times, other sources you may find of use in adding balance to your critique include:Journey of FaithJourney of Faith: The New WorldExploring the Lands of the Book of MormonPopol Vuh: The Definitive Edition Of The Mayan Book Of The Dawn Of Life And The Glories OfThe Annals of Cakchiquels & Title of the Lords of TotonicapanThose are only a few. The rest can be found by looking at web sites that LDS Book of Mormon scholars are publishing.My own view of the Book of Mormon, apart from a spiritual testimony of its veracity, is that it is hard to refute on a purely academic and scientific level. The degree of internal consistency with its own timelines, characters, voices, and themes is astounding. Comparing it with more widely accepted ancient literature through historical, archaeological, anthropological, and theological lenses has brought me even closer to the conclusion that it is indeed what it claims to be. There are themes, practices, and traditions in common with Middle Eastern peoples that were simply not known to Joseph Smith nor would they be until after his martyrdom. I am no longer so much in awe of that as I am at secular researchers who seem to be actively choosing to ignore such facts as they try to piece together the puzzle. They simply ignore the \\"picture on the box\\" that the Book of Mormon offers and try to do everything on their own."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"Karl Marx once said, \\"Religion is the opium of the masses.\\" Now I'm no believer in Marxism, but his statement about religion is VERY true.I was given this book by Mormon missionaries trying to convert me. I love to read so I read this book, but admit that the last couple chapters I just skimmed because in all honesty the book was very boring.I also found it quite offensive for a few reasons:1. The Book of Mormon has Jesus killing multitudes of people! As a Christian I do not believe Jesus EVER killed2. The Book of Mormon is VERY racist, praising white skin, and insulting black skin.3. The Book of Mormon claims that American Indians are descendents of \\"Lamanites\\" (Jewish people),when anyone who knows anything about history knows that American Indians are descendents of people who came from Asia across the Bering Strait.But, regardless of how fictional it is, was it a good read? No. The only thing that kept me reading was the true fascination over how any human being can believe this book is the word of God? And I was very distracted by all the \\"And it came to pass.\\"I have one question which the missionaries couldn't answer for me. Why if Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon from \\"reformed Egyptian,\\" did he use Elizabethian style of English? No one in his day talked like that, so why did he use this type of English? The reason the Bible is in this type of English, is because at the time people were translating the Bible into English, they did speak English in this way. So it's clear to me that Joseph Smith was simply copying the Bible. Also it's also very clear that Joseph Smith really plagarized the Bible when writing his Book of Mormon.But like I said, it's not just Mormons. Have you ever tried to convince a devout Moslem that the Koran is false and that Mohammad was a womanizing fraud (which by the way Joseph Smith was too)? Or a Catholic that the rosary is wrong? Or a Jehovah Witness that they're wrong, or a Jew, or a Baptist or any born-again Christian, or a Buddhist, ..... if anything when you see that there are over 5000 religions in this world and you study the history of how people did the craziest things in the name of their religion, you really have to marvel at the nature of human beings!"},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I loved finding Jesus Christ talked about so beautifully as being the only way to salvation.

Not only did I find no contradictions to traditional doctrine of the birth, death, resurrection and second coming of Christ, but I found that I was uplifted and drawn closer to the Lord as I read it.What more could you ask for from a book that claims to be another testament of Jesus Christ?"},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I have read this book many times.

I know it is true.I have read the anti-book of mormon opinions that are full of hate and animosity. I don't understand the drive. Why try to destroy what has brought millions of people joy, peace, comfort, and a greater understanding of God's plan for his children.I have attended this church for over twenty years. I have never heard of such teachings of hate or disdain of other people or other religions, only good uplifty Christ-centered teachings of love, patience, and forgiveness.It is an original book of scripture translated by Joseph Smith, not written by him.I invite everyone to read this book for themselves, ponder its teachings, and pray to ask God if it is true.

The result? I was married and my wife and I raised three daughters with both the Bible and the Book of Mormon as guides, with wonderful results.The Book of Mormon strengthened our faith in the truthfulness of Bible sriptures. It helped my wife and I to teach principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ with power and effectiveness. This book has helped my family to be more at peace by giving us a spirit that allowed us to get along better with each other.The Book of Mormon is full of references to the Savior Jesus Christ. It proves the Bible to be inspired, for prophets of the Western Hemisphere had long ago foretold the coming of the Messiah, of His birth in the Old World.The Book of Mormon not only supports the truth in the Bible: It mentions things not as well covered in the Bible, such as infant baptism and the nature of universal resurrection. It confirms the Bible's proclamation of eternal reward for following Jesus Christ and of the eternal negative consequences of rejecting Jesus Christ.Read the book with sincerity and prayer and feel of its truthfulness for yourself."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I love this book.

When you read it, the holy ghost will tell you that it truly is the word of god.Just for you sceptics out there, keep in mind these facts. Joseph smith was 18 years old when he translated this book, with no education whatsoever. He translated it in 81 days. 12 people saw the plates that they were origionally written on, and none of them ever denied their testimony. Joseph Smith lived a life of grief, standing up for the things that he knew were true and that he could not deny. The book of mormon is testified many times in the bible. Evidence from ancient american sites depict many of the accounts testified in this book.As a member of the church of Jesus Christ of latter day saint, I testify that this book is the keystone of our religion, as you dig deeper into our religion, you will find that there is a great opposition toward it, but as the only true church, it will prevail against evil. The testimony of Joseph Smith will live on forever, the church will never get smaller, and there will continue to be many miracles involved with the members of this church.

The most pronounced is the claim that the Book of Mormon contains a record of a people of Hebraic origin that populated the Americas, thus making it a history of the Americas. Unlike the Bible (Old and New Testament) where we know the location of the major cities and countries, to date, Modern Archaeologists have not been able to locate any of the cities mentioned in the Book of Mormon. Also, animals such as the horse, cow, sheep, a number of plants from the old world and other items (such as steel) are mentioned as existing in the Americas by the Book of Mormon, yet, these old world animals etc were not in the Americas until after the European encroachment. Also, recent studies into DNA and indigenous inhabitants to the Americas show that the population came from a Mongoloid stock and not from a Middle Eastern stock.As a book of inspired fiction I would say that it is worth reading.

I must say that I'm very, very impressed.My guess is that most of the people here who have shared negative reviews have never even read The Book of Mormon all the way through, and if they have, then they likely didn't understand what they were reading.The Book of Mormon is everything that it purports to be - ANOTHER TESTAMENT of JESUS CHRIST.This is not a book about genetics.This is not a book about zoology.This is not a book about metallurgy.This is not a book about anthropology.This is not a book about linguistics.This is not a book about geology.This is not a book about archaeology.This is not a book about botany.And this is not a book about horses.This is a book about Jesus Christ.

In chapter 8 of 3rd Nephi we can learn of the signs of the Savior's crucifixion. Jesus Christ is the Lord and Savior of the whole earth - the signs of his birth and death were recognized the world over by those who believed in him - just like today the signs of his second coming are recognized by believers the world over. But my favorite part begins in chapter 11. The resurrected Jesus Christ appears to the inhabitants of the ancient Americas. These people had just suffered major destruction. Their cities had been destroyed. Their homes and belongings were destroyed. Many of them had lost friends and loved ones. They were tired and dirty and hungry. And they saw Jesus Christ - in the flesh. He invited them to come unto him ... to feel the prints of the nails in his hands. He taught them his gospel and prayed unto the Father on their behalf. He invited them to bring their sick and injured unto him. He layed his hands on their bodies one by one and he healed them. He invited them to bring their little children unto him. He blessed their little ones and angels descended from Heaven and ministered unto them. He ministered unto these people in much the same way as he had ministered in the New Testament. One by One. Individually and Personally. This is the way He wants to minister unto each of us today. He wants us to have a personal relationship with him. From the Holy Scriptures he beckons us &quot;Come unto Me&quot;. Jesus Christ is the answer to all of our problems and struggles in this life. He doesn't take all of our problems and struggles away - he helps us bear them with a glad heart, a joyful countenance, and a quiet peace that cannot be found anywhere else. Jesus Christ is the real thing - the everlasting. I am writing this review on Christmas Eve 2000. I love the Christmas Spirit - The spirit of giving, the spirit of sharing, the sprit of peace, joy,and love - The Spirit of Christ. May we all have this Spirit in our own individual, personal hearts and in our families, communities and in our world is my prayer always. In the name of Jesus Christ.If you share these same desires I invite you with all my heart to read The Book of Mormon, and The King James version of the Holy Bible. Learn of the prophesies, the teachings, and the life of Jesus Christ. Come unto Him and recieve Him into your heart - pray unto the Father in his name - express your gratitude for his blessings and ask his blessing on your life and your family. There was no room for him in the inn - Let's make room for him in our hearts."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"There have been over 440,000 copies sold through amazon.com. The Book of Mormon was recently ranked among the top ten most influential books in the history of America by Book Magazine. It is a volume of holy scripture that goes hand in hand with the Bible. It testifies of Christ- that He lives and loves us. It is an account written by ancient prophets (just as the Bible is) yet this record is about God's dealings with people who once lived in the Americas. Why not read the book yourself to discover what is has to offer?"},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"The Book of Mormon was written by ancient prophets and spans time from about 600 BC to around 421 AD. It tells of an ancient civilization on the American continent (mostly Nephites, Lamanites, Jaredites) that waver from good to bad, back to good, and worse etc., until finally most of the righteous followers of Christ are gone. And then Moroni, the prophet, gives us a promise. He says that if we read the words contained on the plates, if we ask God in faith, He will tells us of its truthfullness. And you know what the great part of it is? It works! Unlike the greatest literature of the most respected authors, the BoM is interactive. Shakespeare, Hardy, Poe, or any of the best can't make such a claim! If you have a question, ask the author. He'll answer it for you. I know this because I tried it.I want to share with you, the reader, and the world that I know beyond any doubt that the Book of Mormon is true. It testifies of Christ in a most powerful and undeniable way. Although men may unite against it and form entire groups and armies to &quot;prove&quot; it untrue, one simple fact remains. It IS true. Critics can't change it, and neither can I. All you have to do is read it humble yourself before God. Ask in faith. It will change your life."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"After reading this book it changed my life for the better."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"My father's family was active in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, but he left his church as a youth. I myself was not raised in the church, even though I had been baptized at age eight, to please my grandmother. I seldom ever attended meetings, because my mother was totally Anti-Mormon (or any organized religion, for that matter).I was first invited to read the BoM when I was only 17, back in the 70's (I am now 47 years old). I can't say it was easy to read; especially if you aren't use to reading scripture-type books. Even so, I enjoyed the feeling I got, as I continued to read it myself.When my mother found out I was reading this book, she was very angry. She insisted Joseph Smith was at worse, delusional or best, an epileptic with seizures. She had never read it herself, so I chose to ignore her attacks of the book; scoffing it off as blind bigotry (or perhaps it was a touch of my own teenage rebellion). For that matter, my father had never read the book either, but he didn't mind my reading it. In fact he secretly encouraged me to (but don't tell your mother) LOL.As I got into the book, the conflicts of the core family (and eventually civilizations of people) all began to intrigue me. There are epic battles between good and evil. I enjoyed the heroic characters and events in the book.There are also basic guidelines by which to \\"live by\\" much like the Bible directs. My favorite part of the book is towards the end, where the Savior, Jesus Christ appears to the decedents of that original core family.Even though it greatly disturbed my mother, I myself did not believe a mere man could write such a record; let alone anyone mentally ill or otherwise. There had to be more to Joseph Smith than what my mother professed.I began to believe it could actually be a record of an earlier people. Not only did the book seem totally plausible to me, there is even a passage or verse that invites the reader to decide if it is TRUTH or NOT: See Moroni 10:4.I took that challenge to heart and asked God myself if the book was true or just the vain imaginations of a man (written close to 175 years ago). I asked God, with faith; I felt blessed and incredibly enlightened by my prayer/s. When I would pray about the book or the Church I would receive a wonderful feeling, which I wish I could have bottled and savor at all times.I began attending The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (LDS) regularly. I gained a strong testimony and took the Church's teaching to heart. I so much wanted to retain the feelings I received about the Church. \\"With all that is wrong, with the youth of the world,\\" I caught my mother telling her aunt, \\"at least she is active in her church and I don't have to worry as much, as I did my sons!\\"Wow, what a confession, even though she insisted that it was all \\"just a teenage phase\\"! Nope I am now 47 years old (as stated earlier) and I have raised my own family in the Church. I am still very active today (and a Temple recommend holder) and continue to read the BoM. I continue to reap benefits from studying it, sometimes just a single verse, other times several chapters.After my father's death, 10 years ago, my mother was very comforted by (as she calls it) \\"My Daughter's Version of Heaven\\". Now in her old age, she insists she is too old, to attend church, but she has become a fierce defender of the TRUTH of its wonderful \\"FRUITS\\" to her friends.Don't allow a negative review or anyone to dissuade you from the TRUTH! God will give you the ability and blessings to know for yourself! READ THE BOOK OF MORMON (ASAP)!"},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"Having read many great books this Book of Mormon has a more spiritual feel than any other book out there. If one could rate spiritual lvls between 1-10, 10 being the most spiritual and Christ centered than the BOM would be a 10 w/o doubt and the only solid 10 out there. For reference point the Holy Bible probably scores a 8.75 on the same scale. In other words, the BOM has no comparison for truth and spiritual knowledge amongst books today."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"Like the Bible, if you read the Book of Mormon with the intention of gaining truth, wisdom & comfort; that is what you will receive. You cannot receive these things if you read without truly wanting to know if what you are reading is true.I began searching for things of God when I was about 14-15 years old. Living in a rural area north of Springfield, MO; the closest church to me was a Baptist church. I went there for several years & was a member of the Baptist religion for approximately 30 years. I always thought how cool it would be to have lived when there were prophets & apostles on the earth.In 1976, I came in contact with a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I had never heard of this church or it's beliefs. I was told of living prophets & apostles & that Jesus Christ had appeared before ancient people in the Americas. This jogged my memories of history classes; when the Aztecs thought Cortes was the \\"White God\\" returning. I realized that in order for this god to return; he would have had to been there before.The Book of Mormon gives an account of Jesus Christ appearing to the people in what is believed to be South America. This account begins in 3rd Nephi: Chapter 11. It to me was one of the most beautiful passages I've ever read. I know this story is true & not fiction as some have claimed. The Spirit of the Lord filled my heart with that truth.Being a Baptist; I still listened to others & all their anti-Mormon talk. I spent 21 years finding out for myself that the things they were saying were not true. Most of the things could be traced back to 1 or 2 sources of individuals who were bitter because of being reprimanded for serious problems.In 1997, I was baptized a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. My life made a profound change. My spiritual experiences have been like none I've ever known. Some, much to sacred to even mention. Most of these have been because of what I have learned from the Book of Mormon, the life of Joseph Smith Jr & the words of the living prophet today: Gordon B. Hinckley.I suggest for anyone who wants to know about the true teachings of Jesus Christ to read the Book of Mormon; but with your heart ready to receive the Spirit of the Lord. He will not dwell where there is contention.Oh yeah; the member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints I came in contact with in 1976... We've been married for 30 years & have raised 5 daughters."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I love this book. First and formost I love how it teaches about Jesus Christ, and how it consistantly agrees with the bible. The scriptures can be so confusing sometimes so it's nice to have to different books who are in complete harmony with each other to compare and better understand. I have read this book a couple of times now, and everytime I read it, it seems I find something new that helps me in my life. I have found that it applies to whatever trial I might be having at that particular time in my life no matter how small or how severe. This world can be very confusing and scary sometimes it's comforting to know that the Lord is watching over us and that he is aware of our trials and triumphs!!! I love this book and I know that it was inspired by God! Please read it and if you have any doubts just say a prayer asking the lord, You definatly can't go wrong following his advice!"},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"Any good Mormon will tell you that Joseph Smith had a fifth grade level education when he dictated this book to his scribes, and boy does it show. The book is a repetitive, juvenile, uncoordinated, rambling chore to read, written in the lowest style imaginable. There are wars and stuff on just about every page and Christ comes and everything but the plot and all the characters are poorly developed. What is a secret combination? Apparently you have to read it a whole lot of times to make any sense out of it, but it certainly isn't worth the effort."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"The Book of Mormon is a testament to the narcissicism of Joseph Smith--a man who neither walked in the footsteps of Jesus Christ nor understood the profound implications of Jesus's teachings. The LDS church presents it as another testament of Jesus Christ, but it is nothing more than a transparent imitation of the King James Bible. However, while the KJV is lyrical, stirring and replete with tales of sin and redemption, the Book of Mormon is a boring, anemic, overwhelmingly bland reproduction.Supposedly, the BofM is a history of the peoples living in the North American continent before, during and after the time of Christ. However, no archealogical evidence of the existence of these peoples has been unearthed. Why? Surely they didn't vanish into thin air. The LDS church says the BofM was translated from golden plates hidden, by an ancient warrior, in a hillside in upstate New York. The translator of the plates was Joseph Smith, the first prophet and president of the LDS church. However, no other person besides Smith ever saw these plates and their existence has been questioned by LDS and nonLDS scholars alike. Did they also vanish into thin air along with evidence of the lives of the people (Nephites, Lamanites and others) these plates chronicled?As historical fiction, this book fails to capture the reader's attention. As scipture, the BofM is a usurpation of the KJV of the Bible, although it pales in comparison. It professes to be a history of people who vanished without a trace, written by a man with a dubious past and an incredible imagination."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"All I have to say is that for a book to be for sale on Amazon for barely a month and already it has 108 reviews has got mean something, and those are only the 108 that were appropriate enough to leave posted. Obviously there is a reason this book polarizes people so much. Whether you believe the book or not, I believe it is a book to be reckoned with. So, love it or hate it, I think everyone should check it out. If you don't want to spend the money, you can get it for free from any Mormon, but that also means you may be invited to listen to a message from the missionaries as well. So, be warned."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I have not really known much about the Book of Mormon until a few years ago. I have heard of it, however, I have never really looked into it until recently. I have to make a comment that an amazon book review is not really the appropriate place for &quot;proving&quot; that the book as well as the religion is false. That would take many books to &quot;prove&quot;, and people who do it end up looking rather ignorant (case in point, see the review entitled, &quot;good firewood&quot;, and the use of the old, tired Revelation 22: 18-19 argument).In any case, I will now attempt to &quot;review&quot; this book. I personally feel that the book was well writen. For an 18 year old boy to write it in 6-8 months (especially if you believe he did it without divine intervention) is simply phenomenal. It is interesting that, being writen by a farmboy, it's divine origin is still being debated to this very day, and by learned professors none the less. With religious feelings aside, the historical aspect of this book is reason enough to read it, not only for religious reasons, but for philosophical and historical reasons as well.I do tend to agree with many other reviewers (in point- &quot;why is this book even on here?&quot;) that the vast majority of people who gave the book a bad rating most likely have not even read the book, and if they did, read it in the completely wrong mindset. Thus, I will most likely have a poor rating for this review no matter what I say, merely because I rate the book with 5 stars.To conclude, I will say that the book is definitely worth while to read, but don't buy it. You don't have to buy it, because this exact copy can be obtained for free from any LDS church-- no strings attached. You will save $5 and will receive it faster. Also, if you are so opposed to the church but would like a copy anyway, you won't be paying for the book, and thus will not be supporting the church. It's better for everyone! :)---Christoph"},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"This is a book that requires you read it with some nebulous spiritual guidance, suspend common sense, reason and logic and ignore any reliance on any facts or evidences. It is based on the alleged-claimed visions of Joseph Smith, a 19th century man steeped in Protestantism who was born in 1805 and is the foundation for the American religion of Mormonism which was organized in 1830 after he produced the Book of Mormon. This book is nothing more than a book of fiction about imaginary people which draws heavily on the King James version of the Bible, The View of the Hebrews, by Ethan Smith (no relation), the Solomon Spaulding Manuscripts and other sources which sound suspiciously like his own family. If you are willing to believe that Joseph Smith had visions and saw angels and many of the Biblical characters, then it will appeal to you as some sort of complimentary book to the Bible. It is interesting to note that no where do any of the witnesses to these claimed &quot;golden plates&quot; which are supposed to be the basis for this book state that they ever saw anything with their physical eyes. Instead they use such phrases as &quot;spiritual eye&quot; (Martin Harris-one of the witnesses) and &quot;shown by a supernatural power,&quot; another &quot;witness.&quot; One must ask the question, if these records were real, why did it require faith and prayer to see them by some metaphysical, spiritual means? These kinds of documented reports show clearly this is a book based on beliefs in angels, the supernatural and other metaphysical notions. Obviously, there are no evidences of any tangible source to validate this book which is claimed to be written in an unknown language called: Reformed Egyptian. It has remained as some source of &quot;truth&quot; only in a spiritual sense as it relies heavily on the Christian principles in the Bible. It is a mildly interesting read, but very laborious to wade through because of the repetitious phrases such as: &quot;and it came to pass.&quot; One can see clearly that this book is only for Mormons who have a &quot;belief&quot; in their brand of subjective truth. I would not recommend it."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I read the Book of Mormon daily.I find something inspiring each time I read it.I have been reading it since 1959 and have not yet found anything within its pages that contradicts the Holy Bible.

After 150 years of revisions, mostly grammatical and spelling, the book is still extremely difficult to read due to the horrific King James English used in it.The book amazingly enough also managed to answer a lot of questions people were asking about religion, Masonry, etc. in western New York state during the 1820's. But if the Mormon church wants to try to attract people to their corporation, I mean church, they should really consider updating the language in the Book of Mormon."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"This is exactly as described it is another set of books aka \\"biblio\\" from the latin for book containing records of the words of God's prophets from approximately 600 BC to the 5th Century AD. It covers the history of the people who left Jerusalem in 600 AD and travelled across the ocean and settled in the Americas where other peoples currently existed. There is also reference to a much older civilization which had settled there from a much earlier period following the Tower of Babel recorded in the Old Testament of the Holy Bible.Overall, it is a reinforcement of the teachings of Jesus Christ with the most significant difference being that there was only one translation in the early 19th Century versus multiple translations and copies of the Holy Bible from numerous sources which make up the current Holy Bible. Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints maintain that the Holy Bible, Book of Mormon and the Doctrine & Covenants (modern revelation since the early 19th Century) are considered canonized scripture and all testify of Jesus Christ of the New Testament (the same one prophesied about in both the Old Testament and Book of Mormon prior to his birth, baptism, ministry, atonement, death, resurrection and ascension into heaven before the original apostles.)This book has been an important strengthening of my testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ and his birth in Bethlehem, baptism by John the Baptist, ministry including the many miracles, atonement, death and literal resurrection which are taught to be literal not just figurative stories from a moral fictional Bible but an actual account by prophets of God the Father.

I find it ironic that those who ridicule this book, haven't ever really read it.

Like any other book, it deserves a read, they you can juge for yourself. I believe that anything that testifies of Christ and his teachings and helps people to become better can't be all that bad. I don't think I have ever met anyone who, by reading the book of mormon, has decided to go out and do bad things.

As such, it has been something of an embarrassment to Mormons not absolutely convinced of its authenticity. They would prefer emphasis on the Holy Bible--especially the New Testament--as opposed to a document that many people, both Mormons and non-Mormons, have problems with.I will not comment on the basic scholarship of the 'Book' except to say that much of it was lifted whole cloth from Isaiah and other books of the Bible. Also, as a supposed inspired translation, it has serious problems. Joseph Smith and his Mormon followers spoke and read Nineteenth Century upstate New York English. They didn't speak like the Elizabethan translators of the King James version of the Bible. Nevertheless, Elizabethan style prevails throughout. Why would God, Jesus or one of their angels seen fit to translate this document into archaic English?Suspiciously, the Book of Mormon story has much in common with the revelation of the Holy Qur'an to Muhammad. The unlettered Muhammad, who is troubled by religious uncertainty, is visited by the Angel Gabriel who recites God's word to him in the form of the Holy Qur'an. The near child, Joseph Smith, also troubled by religious uncertainty, is visited by the angel Moroni who again reveals God's word. The two stories are too similar to be accidental which leads to one of two conclusions. Either God contacts his Prophets via angels...or...Joseph Smith deliberately imitated Muhammad's method of revelation.Also, demographically, the book is suspect. Genetic studies suggest that most of Amerind precursors originated in Northern Asia, not the Middle East. Yes, there is some evidence of admixture of European genetics but, again, this is European. The Book of Mormon peoples were iron-age people which accords with their supposed temporal origin in the Middle East. Despite extensive archaeological digs throughout the Americas there is no evidence of iron tools and weapons described in the Book of Mormon. Why? Did they all rust away? Why do we have iron implements from Africa, Asia, and Europe even older than the purported dates of the Book of Mormon peoples?And really...the Amerinds were CURSED with dark skins. By what evidence is dark skin a curse or is this simply evidence of common nineteenh century racism? Also, the gold plates--the extremely important document of vanished people--was buried in an Indian mound in New York? What evidence is there that New York ever had a high level of native American civilization? Weren't all the higher Amerind civilizations--with gold metallurgy--only in Meso and South America?Some have questioned how the boy, Joseph Smith, could have known that the ancient Native Americans had achieved a high level of civilization. The fact is that even in Smith's day, much was known of ancient mesoamerica and the Inca Empire. The great scholar William Prescott published his excellent 'The Conquest of Mexico and the Conquest of Peru' with extensive descriptions of Native American civilization in the 1840's.In any event, the Mormon Church has spent millions digging for Book of Mormon 'proof'.

Most of those that believe it think that God has spoken to them in some way telling them it was \\"true\\" (it came to us through the power of God).

How implausible it really is to believe the book of Mormon was translated through looking glasses in a hat while nobody really even saw the translation happening because JS was always behind a curtain while translating it?Of course a book that claims to be a manifestation of God's power and is followed by millions of people worldwide (though a small investigation will reveal that the Mormon churches claim of 12 million is seriously inflated) will create a polarized effect. Those who leave the church often feel seriously jaded and want to help other people out of what they believe is a fraudulent arrangement. Most of the people who leave the church, however, leave it alone. The defenders of the Mormon church like to say people leave the church but can't leave it alone, but they only hear from the people that meet that description.

When the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon was not made manifest to me, I faced a monumental problem.Beginning at age twelve I was summoned into the first of many closed-door \\"worthiness interviews.\\" A couple times each year I was required to meet alone with a local religious authority and be asked fifteen standardized questions. My answers would determine my standing in the religious community and ultimately my destiny. If I could meet the requirements outlined by my bishop during this interview by giving all \\"yes\\" answers I would be rewarded. I felt that my security and well-being depended upon providing correct answers, something not unlike my classroom experience as a junior high school student.My bishop asked me question #1, \\"Do you have a firm testimony of the gospel as restored to the earth through Joseph Smith?\\" In the second question he asked if I accepted and sustained the current prophet of the LDS Church as ultimately the only person on earth with legitimate and God-ordained priesthood authority. As that authority was bestowed upon Joseph Smith by heavenly visitors then properly passed unto the current leader, my being able to answer question #2 correctly hinged upon my getting question #1 right.And my being able to get question #1 right hinged upon my obtaining that testimony promised in the Book of Mormon. Once I had a sure witness of the truthfulness of the book, I could know for certain its translator Joseph Smith was a prophet of God and I could trust his account of the \\"restoration\\" to the earth of \\"the one and only true Church.\\" I could know for certain that the line of priesthood authority given Joseph Smith during visits from John the Baptist and three of Christ's apostles was real. I could know for certain that the leaders of the LDS Church today still carried that same authority (question #2's correct answer).So I redoubled my efforts and prayerfully searched the pages of the Book of Mormon. Beginning at age fourteen, I attended one class period each school-day taught by the LDS Church. That class was part of a four-year-long educational program designed help me learn the truth of this book. I studied hard and earned all A's. I memorized dozens of verses contained in the Book of Mormon. After another slow and careful journey reading it cover to cover, I prayed for a testimony. Despite my eager readiness to believe, the truthfulness of this book was not made manifest to me.I was in a true conundrum and became quite anxious about my situation. Other young people, many of them children much younger than me, had often stood in the pulpit and publicly shared their testimonies. \\"I know this Church is true, I know Joseph Smith was a prophet of God, I know the President of the Church is a prophet of God,\\" they would say. Many adults stood and proclaimed that they knew \\"beyond a shadow of a doubt\\" that these things are true. It became imperative that I gain my own testimony of the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon.I delved into a sincere and careful third reading of the Book of Mormon. I was ready and willing to believe. Sensing my need for the adult approval and personal self-esteem that would come with my testimony, I prayed with all the faith I could muster. Still I did not receive the prized testimony that would secure my future. The truthfulness of the Book of Mormon was not made manifest to me. After years of sincere testimony-seeking, I felt hopeless and sunk into teenage depression.A recurring nightmare began before my high school career ended. In it, it is semester's end and just days from graduation. As much as I wanted to, I have not completed even a small fraction of the requisite coursework. My classmates all appear to be happy and are moving on. I feel like an utter failure and experience near-panic when I assess my situation. It is painfully obvious that I will not complete the required coursework in time.Twenty-five years later I can honestly say the Book of Mormon has in many ways shaped my destiny. Not possessing a testimony of its truthfulness left me unable to conform to the requirements of the LDS faith. I became a perceived threat. I remain estranged from my Mormon family and small Utah community. I have often been the object of misunderstanding and sometimes the object of fear or pity. My lonely and painful existence has been a tribute to this most influential book."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I think its unfair for people to forget about the great writers of our time.

It has brought me the greatest joy. I read it's pages and I am filled with light. It is a companion book to the bible. With two testaments of Christ we can more easily understand principles and come to know God. Christ is the very center of the Mormon religion. Anyone who believes otherwise is mistaken. We are Christian. In every way as a people we seek to follow Christ. Although others may mock, we need pay no heed. Many have different ideas and principles. We respect that. However, although man may philosophize all he/she desires.... One thing stands true- that is God. We cannot change God by our theories. The only way to know God and know Truth is through prayer. Mormons are not out to &quot;Convince&quot; others. Each person has the opportunity to find out for himself. To pray and ask God and in faith receive answers. This book is scripture like the bible.As Mormons we merely want to share. We have no reason to convince. We only want to share the joy that comes from this book and the principles that bring true and lasting happiness.It is utter Irony that this book is being rated in such a manner. The nations of the world will be judged by this book and it's teachings. I would not criticize the Holy Bible for the same reason. Sacred Scripture is of God. &quot;Fools mock but they shall mourn.&quot;There are not enough superlatives to praise this book. There is no denying the spirit of God felt in its pages.It is truly God-given and a blessing to my life. I stand with over 11 million members who love and cherish this book as scripture.

The LDS prophet has said that either the Book of Mormon is true or false; either Mormonism is true or the greatest fraud perpetuted on mankind. It is important to read this book, consider the positive *and* negative educated opinions of it, and decide for yourself."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"First published in 1830, the Book of Mormon has been continuosly in print since then, for over 170 years. It has been translated into dozens of foreign languages. Millions of people have read it, many receiving free copies from Mormon missionaries (the LDS church - the largest of the Mormon churches - has a full-time missionary corps of over 50,000). Many of those have accepted its claims and joined one of the many Mormon sects which accept it as divinely revealed scripture. Many others - probably the great majority - have read it and recognized it as a fantasy tale written in the early nineteenth century.The book purports to be a translation - made with divine assistance - of gold plates on which the ancient inhabitants of America wrote their own religious and secular history. It describes these inhabitants as Israelites, having been divinely led to America at the time of the Babylonian destruction of Jerusalem six centuries before Christ. It describes their culture, their prophets, their many wars, a supposed post-resurrection visit by Jesus to America, and the final destruction of the more civilized inhabitants about 400 C.E. by the more savage ones, who are the ancestors of the American Indians.No non-Mormon historian, anthropologist, archaeologist or other expert in pre-Columbian America accepts the Book of Mormon's (non-religious) claims. Rather than being an accurate description of ancient American culture, it describes what a relatively uneducated person in the time of Joseph Smith might suppose it to be - similar to his own American, European-based culture, with steel, horses, chariots, glass, compasses, coins, wheat, cattle, flocks, and so on. None of these things were known to the ancient Americans. Nor does it accurately reflect how Jewish immigrants to America might have lived, since it shows a great ignorance of Jewish religion and culture. More than that, the book shows no indication of familiarity with genuine ancient American life or history.The book is filled with many other anachronisms. Much of its religious material is merely copied almost word-for-word from the King James English Bible translation, putting many words of the New Testament writers into the mouths of American prophets who lived supposedly hundreds of years before Christ. The supposed historical material is largely a reflection of commonly held ideas in Smith's time about the origins of the American Indians, and mostly based on a book published by a New England pastor just a few years before Smith wrote the Book of Mormon, called \\"A View of the Hebrews\\", by Rev. Ethan Smith (no relation), first published in 1823, with a second edition in 1825. (See David Persuitte's book \\"Joseph Smith and the Origins of the Book of Mormon\\"). That notion - that the Indians are descendants of ancient Israelites - has been so thoroughly disproven by science that even many Mormon scholars now admit that Smith's claims on that issue were wrong. (See Simon Southerton's book \\"Losing A Lost Tribe.\\")Hundreds of books have been written by Mormons to support the claims made in the Book of Mormon. Hundreds of others have been written to expose the book as a work of fiction. Interestingly, the defenders of the book's claims generally urge readers of the book not to read anything ABOUT the book - especially anything negative - but rather they urge the reader simply to pray to God and ask whether its claims are true. Unfortunately, it seems that God sometimes tells readers that it is true, but apparently he tells many other readers that it is a hoax. Why else would one find dozens of copies in the ten-cent bin at every thrift store in the country? Or perhaps most people feel that they do not need God's help in confirming that they are reading a fantasy tale - however religious it may sound - and not a description of real life or real events in a real place."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"The Book of Mormon (BoM) is an interesting book. It is like the most religious books, filled with intricate stories and exotic names. One is amazed by its view of the world, struck by its strong personalities, sad by its interpretation of the human nature and wishful about its hope for us humans.BoM contains 14 different \\"books\\", bearing the author's name. According to BoM itself and its preface, these \\"books\\" are really 14 parts of three different ancient goldish plats, which in turn are summaries of several other plates. These summaries have been made by a redactor, the 4th century CE soldier/prophet Mormon and his son, Moroni.In all, BoM tells the story of three different families with friends (between 20-40 people) who leave Middle East in different periods of time and at god's command head for America. The majority of the book is about the second colony which leaves for America in 600 BCE. This colony suffers by frictions between older and younger brothers, frictions that are cemented into the offspring, leading to the separation and the establishment of two people: the ligh-skinned Nephites and the dark-skinned Lamanites. During their lifetime, they meet the third colony, Mulekites and find the remnants of the first colony - a great civilisation called the Jaredites. The wars descripted are not that child friendly. The different migrated groups become very blood thirsty in their fights, but somehow god seems to take sides in these bloody wars - and help the good ones.We never know where all the action takes place, but are given lots of names of cities, lands and rivers, so it could be every where or some where in America. I think that it must be a restricted area in America, because everybody gets to meet everybody in some odd way.The colonies described develop the same evil tendencies:- they become rich and start to boast,- they cling to beliefs such as god is forgivable and will save every body regardless if they regret or not, or that there is only one god and that he has no children,- they establish secret societies, \\"robber bands\\" which creates anarchy, because these robbers communicate thru secret oaths and signs etc and therefore undermine stability and rule of law,- they deny miracles, ministering by angels and the holy spirit- they become strong selfish individuals- they mock god and the prophets.The pictures I get from BoM is diverse. According to its story, the Lamanites could be plausible ancestors of some Indian tribes in America. One reason for believing this is that the Lamanites are described in the same way the Indians were described by European: that they are in a devilish statem savages and cannibalists. I totally reject this view of Indians, and do not find the description of Lamanites objective.The language of Book of Mormon (BoM) is oldish. There are lots of \\"knoweth\\" and \\"ye\\". There are too much repetitions of verbs, phrases and expressions, that makes you bored, like \\"or in other words\\", \\"and it came to pass\\", \\"for behold\\".Everything in BoM is just like the bible an either-or: either you follow a straight path and come to paradise or several wrong paths and go to hell. There is a clear picture of dual ending, which one can notice in every religion.There are not many women mentioned in the book: only three women are named (five if you count Jesus' mother Mary and Eve, the foremother). God talks always to men, they are always kings, rulers, judges, priests etc. They are always given what they asked. This view of women is different from mine - every era had had its own. However, the story the prophetess, Akish and the faithful queen (anonymous) are wonderful.I recognised many wordings from the bible scriptures, but they have been evolved in some way, there are modified and sound different, you know, they have an American touch for a European like me, for example: New Jerusalem will be built in America, \\"the house of Jacob or Israel\\" is referred to the Indians, \\"the Gentiles\\", to the Americans and of course, the climax in the middle for the book: Jesus' visit to America! Besides this, Moses is mentioned a lot and Isaiah is overquoted!The Christian Messiah is the focus of the book - BoM people believe in him both before his coming and after. Whatever the people do, they bear his name. Even though I do not believe in a historic Jesus, I found a strong, powerful, meek and glorified Jesus in BoM, one that is proud of having been crucified and proud of having saved the world. He is not the agonised Jesus of Getsemane. He is as maybe many Christians expect him to be, when he comes back again - powerful and almighty, read III Nephi!The fact that BoM supports a Jesus that is supposed to be historical and gives him qualities that he could only have acquired when New Testament was written, makes the book a religious thesis, rather than a historical overview of ancient American Christians.The preface contains the coming forth of Book of Mormon and its editing by the young Joseph Smith, prophet for more than 150 BoM-believing groups in US. Thru revelation, he found the plates, dug them up from a hill, Cumorah, and translated them using holy glasses \\"interpreters\\" by the power of god.In BoM there are prophecies about the coming forth of BoM, where a man called Joseph will translate them. In BoM there are a lot of stories who are like Joseph's, especially Mormon's own story, where he digs up some plates in a hill called Shim - later Cumorah! Another prophet, king Mosiah used also holy glasses or interpreters to translate some other holy plates.However, in it one finds an idealised Christianity - Jesus answers almost everything that he never did in New Testament, such the meaning of the communion, baptism of children etc. For me, as a liberal Christian, the BoM cements the literalist fundamentalistic view of Jesus and the bible. I am impressed by Joseph who wanted to revitalise Jesus for his own time and for us today. Even though he had to make up this wonderful story of plates, dug up in Cumorah in order to establish an ancient basis/proof for a real Christianity - he managed for people then and now to create a new framework of understanding. He made Jesus real thru BoM, thru his actions (besides polygamy!) and thru his utter confidence in god's role in America and the world. Thus, if the book makes a person come to the Christian Messiah, then Joseph has succeeded well."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"What missionaries will do is get you to pray to see if thisbook is true. If you end up thinking it is true you are blessed, andif you get the wrong answer you are deceived- Catch 22. This book hasbeen &quot;corrected&quot; over 3000 times since the first edition(you can buy facsimile of the original on Amazon). Some of these canbe passed off as editorial mistakes but others are serious changes inmeaning which reflect current LDS doctrine. This is strange since oneof the central tenets of Mormonism is that it is the most perfect bookin the world, and that the Bible is mistranslated.To boot this bookdoesn't talk of the central tenets of modern Mormonism (they emergedafter the book was &quot;translated&quot;) such as baptizing the dead,the spirit world, eternal marriage, eternal progression, and theplural Gods doctrine. In fact the Book of Mormon is monotheistic andspeaks of hell, but as more and more revisions get made to it thesewill disappear as many already have.Nonetheless this is animportant book in American culture and even literature (it is a dullread- Twain called it &quot;Chloroform in print&quot;) and has startedover thirty different sects... maybe slightly ironic since JosephSmith was told to start a united church not a divided one! One thingyou will never hear from a Mormon (because few know this) is that ALLthe witnesses of the Book of Mormon left the church. Joseph Smith'sson left the Utah church and entered the Reorganised LDS, and so didJoseph's first wife Emma."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"Joseph Smith once said \\"I told the brethren that the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts than any other book\\" (The Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, page 194).The vast majority of Mormons will confirm that they believe in this statement, yet the Book of Mormon does not contain many of the doctrines taught in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.As a matter of fact, the BoM contradicts Mormon theology in many important doctrines.Here are just few examples:The BoM teaches that the authority to baptize comes from Jesus Christ (3Nephi 11:25), but the LDS church teaches that this authority was given to Smith by John the Baptist.The LDS church teaches that, before the \\"restoration\\", there was a complete apostasy (History of the Church vol.1 page XL), but 3Nephi 28:1-8 denies that.The LDS church says that God was once a man and, through obedience to Mormon doctrine, death and resurrection, was elevated to godhood (Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, page 342-345; Lorenzo Snow, Millennial Star, vol.54). The BoM, on the contrary, teaches that God is eternal (Moroni 7:22), He is not a glorified man (Alma 22:10; 31:15; Mormon 9:9-11; Moroni 7:22; 8:18), and He is unchangeable (2 Nephi 27:23; 29:9; 3 Nephi 24:6).Mormon doctrine states that God is a personage of flesh and bones (Doctrine and Covenants 130:22); however, the BoM teaches that God is a spirit (Alma 18:24-28; 22:10-11).Mormons are polytheists (B. McConkie - Mormon Doctrine page 576-577; Journal of Discourses vol. 2 page 345), yet the BoM clearly states that there is only one God (the testimony of three witnesses, 2 Nephi 31:21; Mosiah 15:1-4; Alma 11:28-29,44; Mormon 7:7).Mosiah 2:39 shows that hell is a place of torment, but LDS theology denies that.Polygamy is strongly condemned in the BoM (Jacob 1:16; 2:23,24,27,31; 3:5; Mosiah 11:2,4; Ether 10:5,7); strangely enough, first president and \\"prophet\\" Joseph Smith married over 30 wives and plural marriage was widely spread in the early church; the LDS church was forced to renounce polygamy in 1890 as a necessary condition for Utah to achieve statehood, therefore, today Mormons do not practice it; but polygamy as a principle was never renounced (see Doctrine and Covenants section 132 and Mormon Doctrine by B. McConkie page 579).Mormons teach the LDS \\"gospel\\" will be preached to the dead in the spirit world, thus giving them a chance of salvation; the BoM, on the other hand, teaches that salvation must be obtained in this life (Alma 34:31,33,35; 2 Nephi 9:38; Mosiah 15:26; 26:25-27).One of the LDS missionaries favorite techniques to convince people of the veracity of their message is to tell them to pray to know whether the BoM is true, and, they say, you will receive a \\"burning in the bosom\\" as a confirmation from God. The BoM denies that, and teaches that we are to search Scriptures to determine the truth (Jacob 7:23).The BoM teaches that there are only two destinies after death (1 Nephi 15:35; Mormon 9:23; Alma 3:26; 40:26; 41:4; Mosiah 16:11; Helaman 14:18-19; Ether 4:18; 2 Nephi 2:28-29; 9:16; 28:21-22; 3 Nephi 27: 11, 17), but Mormons believe that there are three kingdoms in the spirit world: Celestial, Terrestrial and Telestial (Doctrine and Covenants section 76).So, if this book is \\"the cornerstone of the Mormon religion\\", why don't Mormons teach the doctrines contained in it?"},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I have met some missionaries and they all told me to pray about whether the Book of Mormon is true or not? Okay, so I thought, \\"you can't just tell me if it is true or not?\\" So am I suppose to pray about everything to know if it is true or just the Book of Mormon? I mean, does praying even work to determine if God exists or not? If praying does work, then everyone would know that God exists but yet there are some who are not sure. Can someone simply pray to know if they will have a baby girl or baby boy, or if there are other life forms in another part of the galaxy, or if they will get a raise in a month or two, when and where the next earthquake will occur, or what the answer is to a test question, or even which religion or church out of all the religions and churches out there is/are correct (Judaism, Christianity, Islam, etc)? If praying worked, then we would have all the answers to these questions by now.I have prayed and still have not got any answer. I don't think that by simply praying will you get an answer to your questions, and I also think they know this but they just don't tell you. From my experience, it is usually only real actual physical evidence that will answer a question for you or for someone to actually experience those events, which of course we are unable to know about since we are not from that time period of Joseph Smith 1800s and were not around to actually see him physically discover the gold plates and to translate them, or whether he just wrote it himself just as H.G. Wells wrote War of the Worlds or Hemmingway wrote The Sun Also Rises. And also we are unable to know of the intentions at the time the religion was founded.I don't need to pray to see if a Chemistry textbook is true or not, so why would I have to for the Book of Mormon? And I have yet to hear a Chemistry professor say \\"pray to find out if the Chemistry book is true or not.\\" If the book works, then the things it talks about in there will also work and be reproducible, and if a formula in it doesn't work, then it will also show to not work in an experiment and be wrong. I don't need to pray about it to know if it works or not or if it has any effects. The same thing with a math book, or a physics experiment book. I don't need to necessarily pray about it, to see if it is true or not. I just have to try it out.When they asked me to pray to see if the book was true or not, this made me think \\"I don't even believe these missionaries know if it is true or not themselves and they are just waiting to see what my opinion is.\\" I mean, what is there to pray about in the book?I know, if I was truly trying to convince someone that something was true, I would point out how it was true and give instances or examples. It is called the burden of proof, which makes an argument a lot more convincing. Something is much harder to believe if it can't be proven. If the Book of Mormon is not about whether it is right or wrong but about faith, then why do they say that \\"I know that this church/book is true.\\" which would then not require faith?The Book of Mormon is a book about two civilizations that existed on the Americas thousands of years ago, which I have never heard of in school history books. Either the book was completely made up by Joseph Smith or someone else (because it is said that Joseph Smith was 14 and uneducated when the book was written) using his wild imagination like H.G. Wells writing the Time Machine or War of the Worlds which are both works of fiction and imagination, or he really was somehow visited upon angels and led to some gold plates in some fields where he later translated into the Book of Mormon. I think most people would believe the former was true, since I have never heard on the news of anyone ever being visited upon angels ever since Joseph Smith's claims that he had been.To me the Mormons are a very well organized religious system that emphasize strong family values and a healthy lifestyle, and which makes most of their money through regular 10% tithing of their members, which then allows them to build their temples, stake centers, church buildings, and publish their literature throughout the world.They are also slightly different from other Christian churches like Catholics, Protestants, Non-denominational, in that in order to enter certain buildings such as the Temple you have to have be Temple worthy. And not to mention that Joseph Smith, to them, was a prophet that restored the true church of Christ on the planet, which some people would disagree with.I find this amusing with most religions and that is of the many differences among these so called divine churches. I mean, if churches were divine, wouldn't God somehow get it right the first time instead of having so many different churches like the Catholic Church and then the Protestants who later were protesting against the Catholic practices, and then of course the Latter Day Saints or Mormons who claim to be the true church of Christ? Why didn't the Mormon church happen earlier if it was the \\"one true church of Christ\\" instead of in 1830 after Judaism, Muslims, Catholics, and then the Protestants? It makes me wonder and question a lot about religion and if there really is any type of divine intervention among them or is it just simply man-made."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"The message of The Book of Mormon saved my life, and then it healed my soul.\\"I glory in plainness; I glory in truth; I glory in my Jesus for he hath redeemed my soul from hell.\\" - 2 Nephi 33:6"},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I have read the Holy Bible and the Book of Mormon.

Note the following:PART OF THE PREFACE TO THE BOOK OF MORMON COMPOSED BY JOSEPH SMITHAs many false reports have been circulated respecting the following work, and also many unlawful measures taken by evil designing persons to destroy me, and also the work....notwithstanding my utmost exertions to recover it again....Satan had put I into their hearts to tempt the Lord their God, by altering the words, that they did read contrary from that which I translated and caused to be written; and if I should bring forth the same words again, or, in other words, if I should translate the same over again, they would publish that which they had stolen, and Satan would stir up the hearts of this generation, that they might not receive this work....Wherefore, to be obedient unto the commandments of God, I have, through his grace and mercy, accomplished that which he hath commandedSLIGHT CHANGES TO SHOW THAT JOSEPH SMITH COULD COMPOSE BOOK OF MORMON SCRIPTURE:As many false reports had been circulated in the land, many unlawful measures were taken against Nephi by the evil designing Lamanite king. But notwithstanding Nephi's utmost exertions, Satan had put it into their hearts to tempt the Lord their God, by altering Nephi's words, that they did read contrary from that which he caused to be written as testimony on gold plates. And it came to pass, that Nephi said, If I should bring forth the same words again, or, in other words, if I should write the same over again, they would publish that which they had stolen, and Satan would stir up the hearts of Lamanites, that they might not receive this work. Wherefore, to be obedient unto the commandments of God, I, Nephi have, through his grace and mercy, accomplished that which he hath commanded.The preface also shows the back-tracking style found throughout the Book of Mormon.Note the following examples:l. \\"I have charity for the Jew--I say Jew, because I mean....\\"2. \\"And now if Christ had not come into the world, speaking of things to come as though....\\" (Supposedly written in 148 BC-before Christ)3. \\"...so long as there should be a band of Christians remain to possess the land--For thus all the true believers of Christ....\\" (Supposedly written in 73 BC)4. \\"And behold in the end of this book...Behold I do not mean the end of the book of Helaman, but I mean....\\"5. \\"...it must needs be expedient that Christ-for in the last night an angel spake unto me that this should be his name....\\" (Written in the sixth century BC)6. \\"...and if I should bring forth the same words again, or, in other words, if I should translate the same over....\\"7. \\"...that my name should be had for good and evil among all nations, kindreds, and tongues, or that it should be both good and evil spoken of among all people.\\"NOTE: Number \\"6\\" (above) was written by Joseph Smith in his 1830 preface of the Book of Mormon, a preface now deleted, and number \\"7\\" was also written by Joseph Smith as he later described his visit with an angel.Also, remember that Joseph Smith didn't know when to quit talking. His prayer for the dedication of the Kirkland Temple, according to the guides, was a couple hours long. Thus, again he demonstrated his ability to spin scripture as fast as his scribe could write it down.Published in 1830, the original Book of Mormon bears all the marks of a novel written by a relatively uneducated man. Some 4000 changes have been made in grammar (also deleting the overuse of \\"and it came to pass\\").Also, some significant errors corrected (King Benjamin was dead at one point and it was changed to Mosiah). In addition, it contains errors that are found in the King James Bible at the time.Taking the popular folklore of the lost white race of \\"Mound Builders\\" and that the Indians were descended from the Jews, Joseph Smith had all the makings of a novel set in his lap. He was not a scholar, but he used a few books as references--notably \\"View of the Hebrews,\\" published in Poultney, Vermont, where his chief scribe and third cousin, Oliver Cowdery, came of age.The project took about a year. At the age of twenty-two-and-half, Joseph Smith dictated 116 pages over a two month period. When these pages were lost or stolen, he waited some nine months (with some composition in between) before starting again. Then after three months, he completed his novel at age twenty-three-and-a-half.At the time, Joseph Smith was not a teenager or \\"farm boy\\" as many Mormon writers say, deliberately confusing Joseph's teenage visions with his dictating of the Book of Mormon. He was a married man of 22-23 when he began his novel.Note, also, that Joseph Smith didn't have to \\"write\\" a single word. He had various scribes do that as he \\"translated\\" from behind a curtain by looking at a magic stone placed in a hat.For a fascinating look at the problems of the Book of Mormon, read \\"American Apocrypha,\\" a collection of essays by former Mormons. American Apocrypha: Essays on the Book of Mormons (Essays on Mormonism Series)The following is from an essay by Professor Edwin Firmage, who tells a compelling story of how he came to abandon his belief that the Book of Mormon is an ancient document. The other essays in this book are also fascinating. Highly recommended for anyone interested in the Book of Mormon.Professor Edwin Firmage, Jr. writes:\\"Nearly twenty years ago, as a first year-graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, my ambition was to become another Hugh Nibley, whose writings I loved since I was twelve....\\"\\"Still a neophyte, but armed with German and a little Arabic, Greek, and Hebrew, and intent on acquiring the requisite apologetic tools, I cameo Berkeley to study ancient Near Eastern languages, particularly Egyptian, the language of mysteries par excellence.\\"Not long after my arrival, I was asked to teach the Book of Mormon in the Gospel Doctrine class in my Berkeley ward. I welcomed the opportunity, as it would give me a chance to delve deeper into the book. By any standard, my wife and I were faithful Mormons who attended church, visited the temple, and prayed together. I expected my study of the Book of Mormon to result in an increase of faith as it had done on my mission. But within six months, I no longer believed the Book of Mormon to be an ancient text.\\"To this day, I am not sure how it happened, although I can isolate several issues that played a role in my change of mind....I have often thought that what happened to me in Berkeley was fundamentally a conversion, or, if you like, an anti-conversion. The process had all the inscrutable suddenness that characterized some of the conversions I had witnessed as missionary. Like a conversion to faith, the effect of my change of mind propagated with amazing speed. Almost overnight my whole outlook on life was different.\\"\\"The remaining pages of this essay will present a few of what, for me in 1984, were discoveries of some importance. These do not by any means constitute a comprehensive explanation of the Book of Mormon. Nor are they offered as proof of my thesis that the book is modern, but as examples of how the assumption that is modern resolves otherwise significant difficulties.\\"Further, there is no archaeological evidence for the claims of the Book of Mormon. Read the following:Robert J. Sharer is Professor of Anthropology and Curator of the American Section of the University Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania. His fascinating and heavy book analyzes the Maya from every angle. Although Sharer does not mention the Book of Mormon, he does give a devastating answer to those who would link Meso-American civilization with the ancient Hebrews, placing such theories squarely in the 19th century.Sharer writes: \\"After more than a century of gathering and analyzing archaeological evidence, we have discovered nothing to support the idea of intervention by people from the Old World.\\" \\"This is not to say that accidental contacts between the Old and New World peoples could not have occurred before the age of European exploration\\" (p. 6).\\"On the basis of the available evidence, then, the courses of cultural development in the New and Old Worlds seem clearly independent of each other and devoid of significant contact until 1492\\" (intro., p. 7).The ancient Maya civilization, Sharer continues, \\"are to be \`explained' not as a product of transplanted Old World civilization, but as the result of the processes that underlie the growth of any culture, including those that develop the kind of complexity we call civilization.\\"\\"The idea, which either explicitly or implicitly asserts that the peoples of the New World were incapable of shaping their own destiny or developing sophisticated cultures independently of Old World influence, is still popular in quarters.\\" \\"But this is but one more popular myth devoid of fact, for the evidence points unmistakably toward the evolution of civilization in the New World independently of developments in the Old World.\\"Lastly, every Mormon should read Robert Silverberg's book, \\"The Mound Builders: The Archaeology of a Myth.\\" This book provides the context for the novel called the \\"Book of Mormon.Mound BuildersAnother great book is Robert Wauchope's 150-page \\"Lost Tribes and Sunken Continents: Myth and Method in the Study of the American Indians.\\"Lost Tribes & Sunken Continents: Myth and Method in the Study of Ameri"},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"As a piece of literature or an expression of literary art, the Book of Mormon holds merit. If one were to encounter the Book of Mormon in its children's book form, it would be apparent that the stories are powerful and stimulating to the imagination. The problem lies in the overly exerted, drawn out, and repetitive tone of the actual Book of Mormon; with its artificially stilted, quasi-16th century styled English that is in no way consistent with the ordinary thought and speech patterns of the 19th century. Of course, the purpose of this review is not to add another critique of the perceived tastefulness of this book, because all such attempts are purely subjective. Due to the preceptive nature of this book, and the obligatory demands imposed on supplicant minds by the doctrines of and associated with this book, it is of greater necessity to place a deeper perspective of the Book of Mormon in real space and real time.Mormonism represents the final westward culmination of a religious system having its roots in the Near East. Catholicism was the Romanization (Europeanization) of Judaism, followed by the Church of England as the Anglonization of Catholicism. Puritanism was the colonialization of Anglicanism, and then Mormonism as the frontier westernization of Puritanism. All part of a collusive process to bring the memetic structure of Judeo-Zionism to the status of paradigmatic dominance.To write the \\"translator,\\" Joseph Smith off as an under-educated simpleton is a serious lack of thought given the deeper motives involved. The Mormon followers are right in saying that there is no way an uneducated farm boy from Vermont could have invented such a complex and elongated text buried in tons of intricacies that are the cornerstone of a modern institution - perhaps the wealthiest church on the planet. It is more accurate to assume that Smith was one of many Masonic agents (Agent Smith) narrating a manuscript which was to become the foundation of a church (political arm) that would help shape the West in the image designed by the forebearers of the industrial complex.The Book of Mormon cloaks an elite corporate-capitalist agenda which would have been taking form around the time of first publication. There was a book written by an H.V. Andersen called \\"The Book of Mormon and the Constitution\\" which elucidates all the political trappings of the Book of Mormon. Andersen, a general authority of the Church, believed that the United States of America, founded by righteous men raised up by God, came into existence for the very purpose of bringing forth the Book of Mormon \\"from out of the earth\\" to all nations, kindreds, and tongues. Andersen in his book, declares the Nephite nation a proto-capitalist system in the spirit of the John Birch Society. He then goes on to cite the movement of a secret combination (secret society) called the Gadianton Robbers, who parallel in doctrine today's communists, democratic socialists, and even plain critics of industrial exploitation. One thing leads to another and the righteous Nephite-Capitalists are lured by the seductive doctrines and priestcrafts of the Gadianton Robbers. Then, the Lord, having sent his prophets to warn the Nephites of their fornication with the teachings of the Gadianton Band, exacts punishment over the Nephite nation by \\"delivering them up into the hands of their enemies,\\" the Lamanites. This seems to be a ploy to scare adherents into total compliance with the economic desires of the plutocracy.What here becomes apparent from the relevant complexity of the book is that, Smith had sophisticated help. Although he lacked formal education, he may have had a talent for self erudition. It is within reason to believe that Smith was performing a vital function in a much grander scheme.A closer look reveals the Protestant Reformation along with other movements, were the beginnings of a more westward direction toward greater literalism in scriptural myth interpretation, detachment from nature, and unrelenting fragmentation of the human mind. This inevitably leads to a stripping bare of the original mysticisms and aesthetics of the world's older religions; a process which will aid in preparation for a society as described in Aldous Huxley's Brave New World. A left-brained world that would be devoid of poetic meaning, artistic depth, and inward spiritual contemplation.The Mormon Church, finishing what began more recently with the Calvanists, enacts the final move from esotericism to exotericism in religious and philosophical thought. Even more evidence of this comes when one observes how they have made the Trinity into three separate (fragmented) personages, two of whom are flesh and bone. Mormonism boasts a doctrine of eternal exaltation in which men can become gods of flesh and bone, thus compounding the obsession with flesh and matter. This is by far the most obvious in a series of anthropomorphic religions. Likewise, Mormonism began the trend of trivializing religious architecture by building fluorescent lit churches that look more like office buildings than places of spiritual gnosis; a trend that has been taken up by other Christian churches as well.At first, spiritual thought is monopolized, then literalized, and then drained depleted, left with nothing more than a dry, meaningless hull of songs, pageants, and shallow discourse that is then made to compete with pure spiritless atheism and economic materialism which will win out in the end, leaving nothing more than a feelingless population where each individual is a lonely cog in an intensified cycle of production and consumption.We have come a long way since the age of the shamans who had a more organic and cyclical view of creation. We have been made linear and inorganic, and have been taken from a synergistic relationship with the natural world to one that is fragmented. The advent of every new religion serves the purpose of matching the raw untamed spirituality of the innerbeing to the outer demands of political and economic conformity. The Book of Mormon, along with the Doctrine and Covenants, the Pearl of Great Price, and the King James Version of the Bible, acts as a substitute for real spirituality while subconsciously planting political memes in the minds of unsuspecting readers. Smith, a high initiate of the Masonic craft among others, carefully crafted the Book of Mormon to brace the new faith and ideology. The collective consciousness has been tampered with, organized religion has again taken its toll, and Mormonism is the fulfillment of this gospel."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"Doubleday's Edition of The Book Of Mormon (ISBN: 038551316X)This new edition of the Book Of Mormon (BOM) has the revised and corrected text of the 1981 Standard Edition of the BOM, without the footnotes. It includes the front matter of the Title Page, the Introduction, Testimonies of Three and Eight Witnesses, plus the Prophet's Testimony from the Pearl of Great Price, and the Brief Explanation About The Book Of Mormon. So if you have a recent edition of the BOM, a triple, or a quad, you already have the information. The only difference is that there are no footnotes.This edition has several advantages over the Standard Edition (ISBN: 0967686555), which, by the way, can be gotten for free at http://www.mormon.org/freeoffers/0,17785,2071-1-1,00.html. With the footnotes gone, the book is far more readable. You do not have the little superscripts and the blocks of numbers at the bottom. Although it is still in double-columns, it is far easier on the eye, and therefore the mind. The chapter and verse numbers are there, but the absent footnotes make a difference.Since we have one standard edition, I find at times that my eye gets into grooves and habits. For example, as I hit the end of a column, my eye glosses over text. I miss words, ideas and concepts this way. By having another text, it compensates for being so visially oriented. I get the approved text, but with a variation of page placement.For readability, I always suggest the reprint of the 1830 First Edition (ISBN: 083090025X). Here, the text has only chapter division (which are longer than in the Standard Edition), and had no verse divisions. Within the chapters, the text divided into single-column paragraphs, as in a conventional book. It is easier to read, but there is no way to stud from this text. Furthermore, the text was not revises and correct. Although this is not a problem-most of the alleged 4,000 changes are mere punctuation and prose-style-it is always best to stick with the most current revelation.The book also has two more subtle features. First, the dates of events are included in the chapter headings, which has been done for several; years now with foreign language editions. Secondly, there is a selective Reference Guide at the back, after the pronunciation guide. It begins with reference to Christ and His mission, People, Doctrines, and Places and Events. It is by no means an adequate index or Topical Guide. However, it does the job for someone new to The Book Of Mormon.Another difference is the binding, page size and page with. The Church of Jesus Christ has been trying to get the BOM in a cheap format, so that price would not preclude anyone from owning a copy. This edition seem more like a conventional book, with thicker paper, easy-read font, and a cover that appropriately meshes with the contents of the book.This book is beautiful, and is not as flashy as Deseret's Heirloom Edition, or Covenant's Heritage Edition of the BOM. It would work well for a non-member, without overwhelming them. I also thinking it would be god for personal study. Not having footnotes forces you to focus on the immediate text and flow of the message, logic, and doctrine.Kendal Brian HunterAuthor \\"Consider My Servant Job\\" (SIBN: 1555177522)"},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I was 'given' this book by two missionaries of the Mormon Church a few weeks ago. They asked me to read and study various chapters but I read the entire book instead. Having read many religious books over the past 10+ years I can honestly say that the Book of Mormon is nothing to get excited about. Essentially, it is a watered down version of the King James version of the Holy Bible with different, but similar, personal experiences occuring throughout the entire volume.It seems to me as though the author, Joseph Smith, attempted to write in the style and manner of the Holy Bible. There is noting contained in the Book of Mormon that will lead any person closer to God than is available on the market today.Sadly, I did not have a life changing experience that I was promised by the young missionaries and will continue to search for the true meaning of life the best I can.For a poorly written book that has plagarized the Bible, this Book of Mormon deserves 2 stars. The only reason I didn't give it one star is because there are some really cool battles in the later chapters."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"The highest rating, only for the very best book ever to come to this world.

I recommend this book to anyone who is searching for the truth, anyone in need of comfort, anyone who would like to become closer to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, anyone who longs for true happiness- I recommend these words of inspiration and strength to anyone and everyone. Pick it up, and you will see just what I mean."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I find it kind of difficult or bizarre to be rating something like The Book of Mormon.

And, hopefully, you'll discover the same goodness I have."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"Amazon's description of this book says that the Book of Mormon was translated by Joseph Smith in 1829.

It's fiction."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"When most of us decide to select or purchase anything, be it a car, home, TV, or any other big ticket item we apply the principles of critical thinking, and analysis of all the evidence and findings of fact. This would include comprehensive research of all available data, such as consumer report magazines before making our selection. We make our final selection based on the facts we have obtained through our study and analysis of all available evidence. How many of us make prayer to God as part of the selection or purchasing process? Why don't we? Because we put more faith in objective findings of fact, right?I believe the same logical process of critical thinking and analysis of the findings of fact should apply in our selection of books to read and more importantly how to judge the claims made in this or any other book.If we exclude critical thinking, including analysis of the findings of fact and simply apply prayer, and faith based reasoning, then any conclusions we reach will most likely be faulty.I would encourage anyone wishing to obtain and read the Book of Mormon to use the same critical analysis of all the findings fact, before making their final decision.Two other books I highly recommend for important background information on sources of the Book of Mormon are: 'An Insider's View of Mormon Origins' by Grant H. Palmer. Mr. Palmer LDS Church member and retired Mormon church educator, was recently disfellowshipped by the Mormon Church for research and findings of fact which conflicted with accepted LDS Church teachings on Joseph Smith and the origin of the Book of Mormon. The second book I would recommend would be 'Losing a Lost Tribe, Native Americans, DNA and the Mormon Church' by Simon Southerton. Southerton is a former Mormon Church Bishop. Southerton's book provides DNA analysis that contrary to Joseph Smith's teachings Native American's,(Indians), are not of Jewish descent, but Asian,(Siberian).Most of the reviews endorsing the Book of Mormon here are insisting we ignore the critical thinking process and analysis of the findings of fact, and simply rely on prayer, and faith based reasoning."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"Nothing sarastic about this title. The book and the religion put together are nothing more than a cheap set up for a mini-communism.

The book is filled with references to Native Americans being dark as \\"filthy\\" and \\"loathesome\\", which shows just what attitude Joseph Smith had towards them.Doing private research I found proof this book is a work of fiction. NOTHING IN IT IS SUPPORTED BY CURRENT ARCHEOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE. However, the church delivers sappy commercials and a wealthy image promising people happiness it cannot deliver, so many people join, although most people become inactive almost immediately.To non-mormons and doubters, do your research right here on the net.

No historical, anthropological, linguistic, or genomic data corroborates the Book of Mormon's fantastic claims of a pre-Colombian civilization of Jewish ancestry in North America that fought with steel swords, died in the millions, herded cattle and elephants, practiced monotheism, and toted around gold plates on which to write their history.Debunking the lies I was taught in my youth has been the most liberating experience of my life.The mormon missionaries distribute the Book of Mormon for free.

It claims to be the word of God, on par with the Bible. That is a big claim that sets it up for a hard fall. Most people in Christian countries no longer believe that the Bible is the word of God, so belief in another book, translated from an ancient record, as the word of God alongside the Bible, is a very, very tall order.What proof is there of this enormous claim? Not much. The more you dive into the origin and historical context of the Book of Mormon the more confusing it becomes. There is not \\"irrefutable\\" evidence one way or the other. You can either believe or not, and find plenty of evidence to back your position up. The book itself invites the reader to pray about its authenticity. So by its very claim and its proposed method of investigating that claim, the book sets itself apart as not for the casual or curious investigation. To approach the book sincerely, one has to confront its claim, and to investigate the claim, one has to believe that God can and does steer people toward truth.I have read, studied, and yes--prayed about the Book of Mormon. I sincerely believe that God is light and good and that he helps me recognize the things in my life that are light and good. I firmly believe, even know, that the Book of Mormon is the word of god. I believe it so strongly that I've patterned my life after it. I still lead a fairly \\"normal\\" life--I'm a software executive who likes to enter triathlons and ski in my spare time--but the light and knowledge I've gained through the Book of Mormon has made all the difference for me.

There is no more dubious accounting engaged in than when Mormons try to count their numbers or hide their money.Without question the book has had an impact on the history of the United States, particularly the west. 120 innocent members of a 1957 wagon train were slaughtered by Mormons at a place called Mountain Meadows, hundreds of Mormons died tragically when their religious arrogance became intolerable to their gentile neighbors in Missouri and Illinois. Even more died when Church leaders promised them they could use handcarts to travel west to Salt Lake City despite building them out of shoddy materials and leaving too late in the season to make the journey safely. The Mormons introduced America to modern polygamy, a blight that has continued to plague the country nonstop since Joseph Smith first decided it would be a good idea to have sex with young girls.Can the Book of Mormon be believed? Sure. If you have a lot of faith and a lot more gullibility. I know, I bought the whole shebang for more than forty years and the Church was able to extort more than $50,000 out of my pocket by using my faith as a weapon against me.Don't bother buying this book. You don't need to. It will only be a matter of time before some guilt ridden Mormon offers you one for free."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"It's sad when a majority of those writing a review of this book do so under the guise of subjectivity. They pretend to have read the book as it was 'intended' to been read - when in reality all they have ever done is (mostly likely at best) skimmed thru it; or they rely on others who claim to have read it. I am not a Mormon, but I've read the book. Could it be true? Possibly. At the very minimum, it is no less difficult to prove or disprove than the bible. The only hard evidence of the bible is that some of the cities actually exsisted, that some of the people were real, other than that - What proof is there that Christ actually lived? Just because the Bible 'says it's so' doesn't make true. Faith - that old tricky word, I have Faith that the Bible is true - I don't need anyone to dig up a rock with the name Jesus Christ scrawled across it to 'prove' to me that he lived. I have faith that he lives - based on many many reasons. Now - - whether or not the Book of Mormon is true...... That I am working on. Regardless, the words of the book ring true, they do not contradict the Bible, the do not confuse the situation (at least for me) at all. After all, when Christ lived, walked the Earth ( and I have faith that he did) there was more to this world than just the Lands of the New Testament - there was a whole world out there.... the Apostles were told to go to all points of the earth and teach the Gospel of Jesus Christ...... why couldn't it have happened? No one today can conclusively say that it didn'thappen - a simple lack of evidence does not mean that it didn't happen, nor that it couldn't have happened. It just means in due time we'll know. So, for me - I'm not looking for signs in the heavens, I'll let the Holy Spirit whisper to me, I will let the Lord lead me home - at least I hope so. Until then, I would love for Amazon to switch out their soap box platform for something a little closer to the ground. I would hate to see anyone fall as the pontificate about the evils of a book that they know so little about.Merry ChristmasGG"},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I've read the Book of Mormon many times, and continue to study it daily for inspiration. It is a truly another testament of Jesus Christ. Each time I read it, I find more insights and applications to the difficult times we are living in. It teaches how to raise a family that will stay together. It teaches how we should support our governments and contribute to helping the poor. It teaches the dangers of pride, being materialistic and self centered. It shows many examples of how peoples and cultures were destroyed because of terrorism, and the dangers of not doing anything to correct the evils of society. It is a book written for our time.

[...]I know with every fiber of my being that the Book of Abraham papyri contained a common Egyptian funerary text. [...]I know that the Mormon Church has taught for the greater part of its history that the Native Americans descended from Jews, that the DNA evidence conclusively proves otherwise, and that FARMS is in the process of the largest backpedal the Church has ever seen.I know that the Church has taught that the highest realm of the highest degree of postmortal glory can only by attained by those engaged in polygamy, that Joseph Smith and Brigham Young each had over 30 wives and that Joseph Smith sired children outside of even the historically-recorded marriages. I also know that the Mormon Church is still responsible for letting its polygamous offshoots go unpunished in Utah and Arizona.I know that the Church taught that the Negro was inferior from the pre-earth life and that most Mormons still think that blacks are inferior.I know that the Church taught that some crimes and sins fell outside the realm of Christ's atonement and could only be atoned for by the shedding of blood. I also know that the Church carried out blood atonement regularly.I know that that First Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve, and the upper levels of the Seventies all draw salaries from the Church and that the higher salaries are all quite substantial.I know that the temple [...] without connection to ancient Hebrew temple rites and that it mimics and borrows from 19th-century Masonic rites.I know that the Church's tithes are huge and that it profligately is in the process of wasting money consolidating its ownership of central Salt Lake City, Utah.

I brought away a copy from Salt Lake. The book is a curiosity to me, it is such a pretentious affair, and yet so &quot;slow,&quot; so sleepy, such an insipid ;mess of inspiration. It is chloroform in print. If Joseph Smith composed this book, the act was a miracle-keeping awake while he did it was, at any rate. If he, according to tradition, merely translated it from certain ancient and mysteriously engraved plates of copper, which he declares he found under a stone in an out-of-the-way locality, the work of translating was equally a miracle, for the same reason.&quot;The book seems to be merely a prosy detail of imaginary history, with the Old Testament for a model; followed by a tedious plagiarism of the New Testament. The author labored to give his words and phrases the quaint, old-fashioned sound and structure of our King James' translation of the Scriptures; and the result is a mongrel-half modern glibness, and half ancient simplicity and gravity. The latter is awkward and constrained; the former natural, but grotesque by the contrast. Whenever he found his speech growing too modern-which was about every sentence or two-he ladled in a few such scriptural phrases as &quot;exceeding sore,&quot; &quot;and it came to pass,&quot; etc., and made things satisfactory again. &quot;And it came to pass&quot; was his pet. If he had left that out, his Bible would have been only a pamphlet.&quot;. . . The Mormon Bible is rather stupid and tiresome to read, but there is nothing vicious in its teachings. Its code of morals is unobjectionable-it is &quot;smouched&quot; from the New Testament and no credit given.&quot;"},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"You will notice that people who write about this book either love it or hate it.

It does what it says it does: it convinces the reader that JESUS IS THE CHRIST. And contrary to what is said in your local Christian bookstore, it seeks to prove that THE BIBLE IS ALSO TRUE. Don't beleive me? Look it up on the introductory page. This is the book's purpose and mission.This book is true. Fellow followers of Christ, of all denominations, this book is for you.

It testifies simply that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. He willingly sacrificed himself for all mankind. It explains the role of grace in mankind's salvation. It explains where we came from, why we're here on this earth and where we go after this life. It explains how one can develop a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.I recommend it for anyone who would like to get to their Savior better. The book contains an invitation to the reader.

I was raised a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, and had read this book off and on throughout my life. I knew that the principles were true, but I had never needed them more than at this time.I read this book and I was able to understand more of the teachings as they related to me. I was able to learn more of the principles that Jesus taught of Justice and Mercy. I came to a full knowledge that what had happened in my life would be able to be fixed, through repentance and forgiveness. I have never felt so loved, and optimistic of the future before. I have even learned to apply these principles to my family everyday.I would like to bear my testimony of the truthfulness of this book. I know that Joseph Smith translated this book from the ancient record. I know that the teachings and happenings are true. I would tell everyone to read and ponder this book, and then to follow the admonition in Moroni 10: 4-5. I know that the teachings and principles contained here are the keys of salvation and happiness to all men."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"Gosh, how does one review such a book. I was raised as a Scientologist, became a Jehovah Witness, after several years I left to became a oneness Pentecostal, found the Book of Mormon at a used bookstore on the discount rack (it was only $0.05 and there were numerous others there also, all waiting for a good home) and bought it on a whim. It did not look like it had even been opened or looked at. I opened the book up at random and read Omni 1:25 which reads in part, \\"I believe...in the gift of speaking in tongues...\\" and I was hooked. A few days later when I prayed to God about the book I very much felt the indwelling of the spirit and started speaking in tongues. My wife came in on me, became overcome with the spirit and started to translate. (She never read the book before then but after this experence she did!) I still haven't joined the church yet, (the ward congregation is sadly lacking in the spiritual gifts -there seems so very little JOY in their worship it is somewhat sad for a church which the precious book they have - it seems more like going because you have to, and not at all like PRAISING in Joy and Happiness the one who created us) and that have been my only objection to joining (learning a foreign language is not really what tongues is all about - ANYONE with determination can do that). While I love the new truths of the Book of Mormon I am not all that fond of the church and its services. I do not go to be entertained but WORSHIP means more than just punching-the-clock.

I brought away a copy from Salt Lake. The book is a curiosity to me, it is such a pretentious affair, and yet so \\"slow,\\" so sleepy; such an insipid mess of inspiration. It is chloroform in print. If Joseph Smith composed this book, the act was a miracle -- keeping awake while he did it was, at any rate. If he, according to tradition, merely translated it from certain ancient and mysteriously-engraved plates of copper, which he declares he found under a stone, in an out-of-the-way locality, the work of translating was equally a miracle, for the same reason.The book seems to be merely a prosy detail of imaginary history, with the Old Testament for a model; followed by a tedious plagiarism of the New Testament. The author labored to give his words and phrases the quaint, old-fashioned sound and structure of our King James's translation of the Scriptures; and the result is a mongrel -- half modern glibness, and half ancient simplicity and gravity. The latter is awkward and constrained; the former natural, but grotesque by the contrast. Whenever he found his speech growing too modern -- which was about every sentence or two -- he ladled in a few such Scriptural phrases as \\"exceeding sore,\\" \\"and it came to pass,\\" etc., and made things satisfactory again. \\"And it came to pass\\" was his pet.

And it came to pass that I, TANSTAAFL, having been born of Mormon parents, therefore I was taught somewhat in all the learning of my father; which included the Book of Mormon, and having seen many afflictions and cognitive dissonance in the course of my days because of the fact that I was raised in the Mormon religion and having read the Book of Mormon nigh unto twenty times, nevertheless, yea, having had a great knowledge of the goodness and the mischievousness of Loki, therefore I make a book review of the Book of Moron.2. Yea, I make a record of my review in the language of English, and not Reformed Egyptian - the language of the Book of Mormon, because everyone knoweth that no one speaks Reformed Egyptian anyway. Behold, I make an abridgment of the review upon computer which I have made with mine own hands; (the review, not the computer) wherefore, after I have abridged the review then will I make an account of mine own review and if thou findest this sentence difficult for your understandings to comprehend then thou wilt not enjoy reading the Book of Mormon, for I make the record of my review in the idiom of the book of Mormon author. Yea, verily, it came to pass that more confusing than Yoda-speak it is.3. And it came to pass that thus were written the first two paragraphs of my review. And I know that the review which I write true; and I make it with mine own computer; and I make it according to my knowledge. And thus passeth away even the third paragraph also.4. And it came to pass that my review having been limited to 1000 words by the amazon.com web-site, I realized that my choice of writing style, that being the style inflicted upon the reader by Joseph Smith Jr., Author and Proprietor of the Book of Mormon, was not a good choice for one limited to a small number of words, or for that matter an odd choice for the inhabitants of the ancient Americas who supposedly had to inscribe the lengthy and frequently rambling and meaningless prose on gold plates where space was at a premium.5. And it came to pass that this part of the review, yea even the middlest part, I shall shew unto you the parts of the review that review the book of which I revieweth. And it came to pass that I chose not to detail in this review the thousands of revisions which the Mormons made to the book after Joseph Smith wrote it, which was supposedly perfectly \\"translated\\" by a gift from god, or the many anachronisms which the author included, yea not even the horses that the ancient Americans supposedly had despite the fact that the horse arrived with Columbus nor the steel weapons. Nor even shall I comment upon 54 chapters dealing with wars that bear no resemblance to the actual wars that took place in the ancient Americas, yea and I especially shall not comment upon the accounts of wars with nonsensical accounts of million man armies fighting to the last man and their bones and steel weapons disappearing from the face of the earth. Yea, and it followeth that I also chose not to comment on the many plagiarisms and yea, even plagiarisms of mistranslations, which were included in the book. Yea, verily I chose not to comment on the writing or the story of the book, which Mark Twain called \\"chloroform in print,\\" especially since I find that remark highly disparaging to chloroform. For it came to pass in the commencement of my preparation for the writing of the review, I realized that a review of the book which pointed out its flaws would be so long, yea, so long as to be longer than the book itself. Yea, and thus passeth away even the middlest part of the review, the longest paragraph, even though it merely toucheth upon the thousands of give-aways as to the fraudulent nature of the book. For yea, this review cannot contain even a millionth part of what was so poorly written in the Book of Mormon.6. And it came to pass that I decided that my review of the book should mention, before concluding, a list of some of the main themes of the Book of Mormon, and yea I verily mention them thusly: (1) Killing is good, if thou art a teenager and thou hearest voices in thine head telling thee to kill someone, preferably someone drunk so they cannot fight back. 1 Nephi 4 (2) If thou disobeyest God, he will curse thee with a dark skin, 3 Nephi 5:21, Jacob 3:5, Alma 3:6, but (3) If thou art a personage of dark skin, God will make thee white and delightsome, if thou wilt consent to join his church. 3 Nephi 3:15 (4) After Jesus, yea even Christ Our Lord, was killed, he camest to the Americas and killed millions of Native Americans, 3 Nephi 8-9, and (5) Women art completely insignificant except occasionally as breeding stock, passim.7. And there are many things more which transpired in the Book of Mormon which, in the eyes of some, would be considered great and marvelous, but despite having read the book upwards of twenty times, I cannot remember even one.8. Thus, I make an end to my abridgement of my review, yea, and now I bid unto all, adieu. I soon go to rest in the paradise of mine abode, until my spirit and body shall again recover from the taxing effort of writing in such a nauseating style.

Those people benefitted from the time the Saviour spent with them. Their record of these events were recorded on golden plates and handed down through generations until through Heavenly Fathers direction they were handed to Jospeh Smith for translation to be delivered to the people of this dispensation. The Book of Mormon is the word of God. He loves his children and wants all of them to learn of his Gospel and return home to live with him. He has provided the tools and the Book of Mormon will give you the guidance and direction you need to make decisions and deal with problems of today. I love the Book of Mormon.

As a worthy companion to the Holy Bible, the key to the vindicating power of this book is found in the subbook titled The Book of Moroni, Chapter 10, verses 4 and 5.

The book teaches us to be more charitable and loving. The first time I read the book, I noticed that I felt closer to my family and to God. I have read this book several times both in English and in Russian. I have also read the Old and New Testaments and I can tell you that this book will change your life.

It tells of their history, challenges, and miracles throughout a timespan of 1000 years until about 400AD. (Another section also tells of a group of people that came to the Americas at the time of the Tower of Babel talked about in the Bible.) It tells of prophets who received direction from God, wars of many people, and interesting, thought provoking stories.My favorite part of the book is in 3 Nephi when Christ comes to the Americas after his resurrection. He comforts the people after they had gone through so much war, natural disasters, contention, people going astray from the gospel teachings, etc. Jesus also takes time to spend with the little innocent children and blesses them.Jesus Christ is the most influencial person that has ever lived on the earth and this verse in 2 Nephi 25:26 of the Book of Mormon is my favorite. \\"And we talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ, and we write according to our prophecies, that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins.\\"This is a wonderful book that has helped my family grow closer together. My 3 year old daughter loves the stories."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"My first of many thoughtful, prayerful readings was 50 years ago. My studies of the Book of Mormon and of the Bible compliment each other. My readings in each have prompted greater appreciation and understanding of the other. Each witnesses to me of a Living Christ, of a Redeeming Christ and of our need to love Him and our neighbors, in word and deed, as He has loved and loves all of His and Our Father's children.Neither the Book of Mormon nor the Bible purports to include every word that God has revealed to all the prophets and apostles He has chosen. Neither was meant to be treated as a scientific, philosophical or historical work. The personal meaning of each is enhanced by a growing faith in Christ. Neither work justifies any hateful attacks by anyone on anyone or on any belief system."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"This is a wonderful book that provides a testament of the divinity of Christ. The messages contained therein are simple; they are ones of faith, hope and the promise of blessings that come through obedience to the teachings of Christ. During this Christmas season, I strongly encourage those who have not read the Book of Mormon, to do so. You will find additional witnesses to the birth of Christ and his ministry while here upon the earth.The gospel of Christ was not taught only among the ancient Jews. To that end, by reading this book, you will find that the gospel message is still available to all who are seeking answers.The reading of this book may or may not convert people to the LDS church, but it will provide its readers with an uplifting and rewarding experience. This book has taught me to be a better person. It has taught me the importance of love, charity and enduring faith through times of tribulation.Please don't allow negative reviews that attack the LDS Church turn you away from this book. It's been said that by their fruits you shall know them. I can't explain the reasons behind so many hateful attacks, but I can promise you that it isn't a principle that is taught in this book."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"It's as good a time as any that The Book of Mormon is being published and offered on this grand of a scale.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"The more I read this book, the more \\"contrived\\" I came to believe it is. My mother read this book to me several times as a young boy and I continued reading it into adulthood. My feelings regarding it changed over time. I went from accepting its claim to doubt to ultimate rejection. The more I read it the more contrived I found it. It so conveniently answers the religious difficulties of the 19th century Joseph lived in.One example (there are many) is infant baptism:\\"Behold I say unto you, that he that supposeth that little children need baptism is in the gall of bitterness and in the bonds of iniquity; for he hath neither faith, hope, nor charity; wherefore, should he be cut off while in the thought, he must go down to hell.\\" Moroni 8:14.Die while *thinking* about infant baptism and you are going straight to hell? Wow. Melodramatic? Convenient? Does this sound like an ancient prophet speaking or a religious revivalist trying to put the catholics in their place in 1830? Doubt entered my life.DNA testing by geneticist at BYU reveal than native americans can trace their ancestry to 6 Chinese mothers. I've read the apologetic answers to the dna questions but rather than clear the issue up, they just seem more convoluted and dishonest than ever to me.I still have warm feelings towards the book because of the experience of reading it with my mother. Several of the stories in it will never be forgotten and some of the characters were my personal heroes growing up. However, I no longer regard it as a historical account and don't care to spend any more time on it. I find it very ironic that rather than the \\"most correct book on earth\\" and deserving of an honored place on my bookshelf, it is much more suited to the fiction section."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"The Book of Mormon truly is the Word of God. I have read the Book of Mormon many times. The Book of Mormon teaches about God's dealing with mankind and of His teachings through his holy prophets. This is priceless information. The answers to the questions of who we are, why we are here, and where we are going are answered by the Book of Mormon. The Book of Mormon testifies of God's love for us, Jesus Christ's incredible sacrifice, and that God wishes to guide us back to His presence. For those who have not had the opportunity to read and ponder this incredible book, there is an invitation to all: to read, ponder, and ask God if this is truly His word. If you ask in faith, He will confirm in your heart and in your mind that this book is His, and that it's teachings can bring you closer to him. I have read, pondered, and prayed and can tell you that the Book of Mormon is the word of God. It's teaching have shown me how to live and how to truly be happy. Let it do the same for you."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I have to wonder after reading some of the reviews here, why people must strain to find evil in good. Some reviewers accuse plagarism--which seems funny since, when quoting God in Israel, the things said in the bible must be repeated in the Book of Mormon, which takes place in the Americas. Why? Because God is the same always...Why would he tell people in one place one thing, and then tell the people in another place, something else again? And when exactly did he stop using prophets? Why? They seemed to have done a pretty good job in the Old and New Testaments. Since God doesnt usually make mistakes, why would he be different simply because he was commanding people in a different part of the world? All these things are answered by common sense, which I guess is lacking in those trying to discount another faith's gospel. I wonder how marvelous the world would be if they spent as much time perfecting their own faith in their lives as they do tearing down someone else's...to claim thousands of changes to a manuscript simply because it was edited into chapters and verses with grammatical paragraphing is misleading at least and dishonest at most. And yet, I dont feel anger over their actions as much as pity and sadness. They need our prayers, to get past their anger and hatred which makes them ridicule another's passion, being mean-spirited and vindictive, all in the guise of being 'real Christians'. May God bless all those who have the intelligence to seek out the truth themselves...notice we dont tell you to believe us---we ask you read and pray and decipher for yourself. How can your own prayers deceive you?"},{"Title":"Picture Me Cute As Can Bee","review":"My 2 year old loves looking at this book.

Her examples are contemporary and clear, and her interactive worksheets are even better. Since I need to do lots of outlining before I start writing, this book gave me specific ways of strenthening my own process and planning, especially plotting, my personal weakness. Her advice on queries, synopses, and finding an agent or publisher were also clear and realistic--I have some of the same rejection letters she shows, maybe from the same agents. She also lists several references and websites as other resources, many of which were new to me. All in all, this is the best book on writing mysteries I've found, and I know I'll wear it out going back to re-read it."},{"Title":"Writing and Selling Your Mystery Novel: How to Knock 'em Dead with Style","review":"Writing instruction books penned by writers are a dime per every two dozen. Most of their advice amounts to a re-packaging of every writer clich&eacute; available for free: Show, don't tell; write a character bio; use he said/she said; conflict, conflict, conflict. Rarely does anything write-home-worthy come down the pike that we haven't read elsewhere. So it is with a mix of openness and skepticism that I picked up WRITING AND SELLING YOUR MYSTERY NOVEL by Hallie Ephron.The result? A good primer for beginners, but mostly just another rehash of generic advice to the more seasoned writer. Ephron covers everything in this book: Characterization, dialogue, selecting a title, setting, plotting, suspense, revision, marketing, polishing, selling--I mean she covers it ALL. She also includes copious charts and graphs that illustrate her points for the reader's personal use. This is what makes it such a good, comprehensive tool for someone just getting into writing who could benefit from an all-in-one resource. But as much as that's a strength of the book, it's also a weakness. The book is too busy with charts, and Ephron breezes through every imaginable subject so quickly that she rarely scratches past the surface. In this way, WRITING AND SELLING is malnourished inasmuch as it's comprehensive.For intermediate to advanced writers, there are a few good chapters in here. I particularly enjoyed the ones on plotting and suspense, and Ephron's itemization of different plot twists and turns, when coupled with the chapter on suspense, is almost worth the price of the book alone. So, if you're just starting out, feel free to buy WRITING AND SELLING YOUR MYSTERY NOVEL to get your beak wet. Then go deeper with DON'T MURDER YOUR MYSTERY or SELF-EDITING FOR FICTION WRITERS."},{"Title":"Writing and Selling Your Mystery Novel: How to Knock 'em Dead with Style","review":"At the heart of every mystery novel lies a puzzle for the story's hero, and the reader, to solve. In the beginning the mystery seems to be about one thing, but in the end it turns out to be about something else.To make it work, the writer develops a string of events and presents them in a series of twists and turns. The main story is tangled with sub plots and complicated by characters that may or may not have something to hide.Writing and Selling Your Mystery Novel takes you from planning a mystery novel to targeting potential markets and agents.Beginning with the premise and continuing through to title selection, Part I provides a step-by-step guide to the process of planning a mystery novel. At the end of each Chapter the writer is instructed to add to the blueprint at the end of the section. The blueprint is the basic framework for a novel. By the end of the planning section the writer has a completed blueprint and is ready to write.From the mystery novel's opening scene to its coda, Part II provides a guide to the writing process. It discusses crafting scenes, introducing characters, creating mystery and maintaining suspense. This is where the real work begins -- writing the first draft.Part III suggests a range of techniques for polishing a novel. No one writes a publishable first draft. This section guides the reader through revision, pacing and characterization.The final section gives tips on finding an agent and a publisher. Part IV shows how to prepare a query packet and send a manuscript out into the world. If the mystery is a good one it will find a home."},{"Title":"Writing and Selling Your Mystery Novel: How to Knock 'em Dead with Style","review":"With Hallie Ephron, you get a wise mentor, a compassionate and savvy best friend, and a secret weapon: insight and instruction from a successful pro and her impressive posse of mystery-author stars. It's like having your own personal writing teacher and coach--every question you have is answered, as well as the ones you wouldn't know to ask. Fun to read, innovatively and imaginatively organized, and as interactive as the reader chooses to make it, this is sure to become a keep-on-your-desk classic, and a much-used, well-worn reference book. This is definitely not just for newbies--but word to the wise: Mystery-writer wannabes will want to be the first to read it--so their competitors in this demanding market won't get their hands on the good stuff first."},{"Title":"Writing and Selling Your Mystery Novel: How to Knock 'em Dead with Style","review":"I bought this book because I recently had an idea for a historical romance with a strong mystery/suspense plot. I've never tried to write a full-on mystery before and I felt intimidated. The idea of having multiple suspects and subplots and dropping (and hiding clues) felt overwhelming to me.When I looked through the books offered on Amazon for mystery writing, I saw many reviews that said the books were less about mystery writing and more about writing in general, which was not what I wanted. I already own books on writing and I've studied writing, so I just wanted a book to explain the particulars of the mystery genre. This book was perfect.The book is divided into four main sections: Planning, Writing, Revising, and Selling Your Mystery Novel. Each section includes several chapters. The first section covers the basics: The premise, the sleuth, the villain, the crime, the suspects, etc. The Writing Section explains dialogue, point-of-view (POV), how to insert clues and make them seem unimportant next to red herring clues. There is also a chapter on how to write the action/suspense scenes.As other reviewers have stated, this book contains a lot of exercises. Some of the exercises relate to using examples from your own work-in-progress and some exercises are based on excerpts from other books that Ephron presents and you have to continue the dialogue or write another version of the scene.I enjoyed this book because it broke things down in a way that was easy for me to understand. I found Chapter 17, Writing Investigation: Clues, Red Herrings, and Misdirection, to be very helpful. Page 157-158 in my edition explain how to distract the reader from realizing the significance of a clue. The chapter on the villain is basic, but useful. One important question it asks is: is the crime appropriate for the villain? Is the villain strong enough, smart enough, dumb enough for this crime? What kind of villain would commit this type of crime? Why would he or she choose this method?There is also some useful stuff on POV: examining the way different characters talk and using tone and sentence structure to highlight the difference between characters.One of the things that came through clearly in this book is that no one ever writes a brilliant first draft. There is always going to be something that has to be layered in or re-worked later. It was a relief to me to really understand this. I mean, I have done it (completely reworked a plot or a scene after writing a first draft), but somehow, I forgot that during this process of planning out my historical mystery.Ephron is very thorough and includes information on picking out agents, publishers, critique partners, and even book doctors. She even includes a checklist to see if a small press publisher is reputable, which is useful for the novice writer. Writers who have been around a while or who are active in writers groups may already know some of this information, but it's useful if you're new to writing or new to mystery writing.There is also an example of a query letter and cover page and what formatting is required. This is a selling point in my opinion because when I first started writing, I found that many books gave you advice on how to write but not on proper submission formatting. Where should your contact information be on the title page? What font or spacing should you use? The only thing that would have made it better would have been an example of a synopsis.This is an excellent book because it gives a lot of advice for 248 pages and if you only have money to buy one book on mystery writing, I think this is a great one to start with."},{"Title":"Writing and Selling Your Mystery Novel: How to Knock 'em Dead with Style","review":"Hallie Ephron's new How-To book is one of the best books on writing mysteries that I've ever read.

It will tell you what you need, how to start, how to get to the end, and how to finish. Then it will tell you what to do to revise your novel, who to get to read it before you market it, and how to start the process of getting an agent or an editor. If you believe you have a book in you, and you follow the directions, you WILL wind up with a finished product. The quality will reside in your skills as a writer, but the technical aspects will be taken care of.WRITING AND SELLING not only tells you what to do, it tells you what NOT to do (which is probably just as important), and gives examples. Ephron has exercises in every chapter, specific suggestions for each phase of the writing process, and references for further research. She even gives technical advice on how to use tools already available to you, on your computer, in the revising and editing process.WRITING AND SELLING is basically a workbook for a first-time writer.

Ephron writes from experience and respects writers willing to give novel-writing a go; she does not talk down to her readers or fill her pages with useless advice such as \\"don't forget to do XYZ, but don't do it too much.\\" The exercises and instructions she includes will not write a book for you, but they will help you understand what you will need to successfully accomplish to write a book of your own.

Helena is displeased with the return of the prodigal daughter who acts anything but the proper debutante from her \\"shoe-polished\\" hair to her freaky footwear. Instead, Veronica acts like a rebellette without a cause as she struggles with keeping the family reputation in high society while doing the disco scene.At a disco bash at Luna Ticks, John Penn, renowned cover artist of Page magazine, meets Veronica. He decides she would look great as his next cover model. Through Page magazine, Veronica meets cover peer rock star Davey Name. They begin a secret tryst that is exposed by the media. Needing to escape the frenzy, Veronica volunteers at an orphanage in Katmandu where she blunders into a free Tibet movement seeking a covergirl, preferably homegrown.COVERGIRL: CONFESSIONS OF A FLAWED HEDONIST lampoons the let them eat cake lifestyle of the rich and famous, shreds the American superiority complex, and tears apart the media celebrity frenzy while providing a fun coming of age satirical tale. Veronica is a fascinating protagonist as she walks a thin line between the family reputation and adhering to Lauper philosophy that \\"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\\". At times the plot can go over the Himalayans, but no one will care as the heroine struggles to enjoy life yet do the right thing to make her dad hold her in high regard not understanding that as his beloved offspring he always will regardless of what she does.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Covergirl: Confessions of a Flawed Hedonist","review":"I saw Maura Moynihan on the Today show and I got the false impression that this book was the biography of her interesting life spent abroad. I was half was through the book wondering why the author continued to refer to herself in the 3rd person before it hit me that this book was fiction.The book has so many characters that aren't developed so it's hard to remember who is who. Then the author inserts all these weird photos of herself in the book that have nothing to do with the story. She wrote a blurb in the front of the book explaining she followed some \\"style\\" of writing that allows for this, yeah whatever.The book has 4 parts to it, for the 4 different countries it takes place in. I got through 3 parts and it was a difficult slow read because I was so bored and never got to know the main character to even get a liking for her. The whole book is one conversation after another with a dozen different people with no real insight to what the main character is thinking.Don't be fooled by the pretty cover art, this book isn't worth the read."},{"Title":"Zagat Survey 2006 New York City Restaurants (Zagatsurvey)","review":"The Zagat Survey of NYC Restaurants is becoming less and less useful. Rather than serving as a valuable means of \\"tracking\\" the progress of restaurant quality, as some have alleged, the Survey increasingly takes on the role of \\"cheerleader,\\" as evidenced by the steadily increasing trend of ratings (e.g. a 20 Food rating in place of an 18 several years ago for comparable quality) and by the growing predominance of \\"upbeat\\" quotes in the reviews.A case in point is the supposedly Argentine-Italian \\"Sosa Borella\\" with two branches in Manhattan. The review tells us that the menu here is \\"terrific.\\" One's first clue to the completely inauthentic character of the \\"Argentine\\" portion of S.B.'s menu is the ubiquity of chicken dishes, including a chicken-containing(!) \\"Parillada.\\" The knowledgable diner will search in vain for such Argentine staples as morcilla, matahambre or ensalada russa. Likewise, the ubiquity of mashed potatoes negates all claims to authenticity of either the \\"Italian\\" or \\"Argentine\\" aspects of the bill of fare.How, then, does Sosa Borella get a Food rating of 20? Only by the votes of people who are completely ignorant of actual Argentine cuisine and are content with familiar U.S. cooking enlivened slightly with hints of something foreign. Here, the recently-floated theory that superior wisdom and accuracy can be derived from the accumulated opinions of the ignorant and the inexpert falls flat on its face.

For the most part, the review was pretty close with a few exceptional misses along the way. The breakfast at Norma's was a huge disappointment despite the rave review by Zagat as one of the most hailed breakfast joints in NYC. I thought the food was rather bland and uninspired. In addition, the reviews for Cafe des Artistes and The Modern was way off. Both of these restaurants have great ambiance and decor, but when it came down to the food... well, it left much to be desired. Can anyone say, \\"Way too salty or bland!\\" I thought the reviews for Le Bernardin was way too generous. The dining experience between Daniel and Le Bernardin was like night and day, with Daniel striding far ahead of Le Bernardin. Le Bernardin was still plenty good, but not the out of this world experience I received at Daniel.Where it did get it just right were the lunch bargain reviews for Jean Georges and Gotham Bar and Grill. Zagat hailed the lunch at Jean Georges as the steal of the city and boy were they right! The 3-course prix fixe lunch at $24.07 was sure bliss and highway robbery!It also hit it on the dot about the friendly staff at Union Sqaure Cafe. The dining experience at Daniel, Nobu, and Grammercy Tavern were out of this world, just as Zagat had described.The addition of cross streets for each restaurant made the navigation a simple task.Overall, Zagat nailed 12 out of the 15 restaurants on the dot.

Dicha persona al pasar el auge de su fama por haberse salvado, se entrevist&oacute; en aquel entonces con un novel periodista que escribi&oacute; su historia en forma de relatos seriados en el peri&oacute;dico El Espectador de Bogot&aacute;, ese periodista es Gabriel Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez, tiempo despu&eacute;s esos relatos narrados de excelente manera por aquel joven, se documentaron para hacer un libro, el Relato de un N&aacute;ufrago, que estuvo diez d&iacute;as a la deriva sin beber ni comer, que fue proclamado h&eacute;roe de la patria, besado por las reinas de la belleza y hecho rico por la publicidad, y luego aborrecido por el gobierno y olvidado para siempre.Relato de un n&aacute;ufrago cuenta la historia de Luis Alejandro Velasco, una historia que te gancha de inmediato, a pesar de que el t&iacute;tulo te dice de manera resumida, el principio, desarrollo y fin de la historia, quedas prendido de su contenido, que dif&iacute;cilmente soltar&aacute;s la misma, hasta no haberla recorrido de principio a fin.La carga, el contrabando que portaba aquel buque de la armada, se hab&iacute;a soltado y hab&iacute;a provocado la ca&iacute;da de hombres al agua: Luis Rengifo, Ram&oacute;n Herrera, Miguel Ortega, Guillermo Pozo, fueron algunos de los desafortunados accidentados, los cuales Velasco hab&iacute;a visto morir, el que m&aacute;s le hab&iacute;a impactado era Luis Rengifo, quien desesperado antes de ahogarse, y al ver a Velasco en la balsa, desesperado le gritaba \\" rema para ac&aacute;, Gordo\\", \\"Gordo, rema para &eacute;ste lado\\"...esas frases hab&iacute;an quedado en la mente del n&aacute;ufrago sobreviviente por mucho tiempo...El primer d&iacute;a: La gran esperanza de que pronto aviones de la marina, ir&iacute;an en su rescate, al enterarse del accidente, lo manten&iacute;a alerta viendo el horizonte, tranquilo, controlado, esperando ser visto y rescatado, pero nada suced&iacute;a ese d&iacute;a, pero no hab&iacute;a impaciencia a&uacute;n...Segundo d&iacute;a: Los tiburones llegan puntuales a las cinco, Velasco coincidentemente portaba un reloj cuando el accidente se present&oacute;, y se percat&oacute; de que d&iacute;a tras d&iacute;a, la llegada puntual de los tiburones era, las cinco de la tarde..muchas historias tendr&iacute;an que pasar a&uacute;n con ellos...Tercer d&iacute;a: Nada sucedi&oacute;, la desesperaci&oacute;n empez&oacute; a poner los nervios alterados de Velasco, nada, nada..Cuarto D&iacute;a: La p&eacute;rdida de la noci&oacute;n del tiempo, en que d&iacute;a estamos, en que d&iacute;a vivimos, cuanto tiempo ha transcurrido, que pasa si llego a una isla de can&iacute;bales?..La imaginaci&oacute;n empezaba a jugar parte importante del control o descontrol de la situaci&oacute;n, la sed y el hambre eran ya desesperantes, los rayos del sol y la sal del agua, laceraba ya su cuerpo, hab&iacute;a dolor profundo en la garganta, en el pecho y debajo de las clav&iacute;culas, hab&iacute;a que tomar agua salada?.Quinto d&iacute;a: Las alucinaciones, Jaime Manjarrez aparec&iacute;a al bordo de la balsa, y las pl&aacute;ticas se establec&iacute;an, los deseos de morir empezaban a aparecer...Ansiedad, angustia, desesperaci&oacute;n..eran las sensaciones que habr&iacute;an de ser constante en las horas, que significaban vidas, de Velasco el N&aacute;ufrago...Y a pesar de que sabemos con anticipaci&oacute;n que el hombre hab&iacute;a de salvar la vida, llega un momento en que nos sentimos tan compenetrados con la narraci&oacute;n, con los detalles, algo muy propio de Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez, que olvidamos lo que suceder&aacute; y vivimos el pasado en el presente, y nos angustiamos y agobiamos con el personaje que sufre, que llora, que desespera...mil historias a&uacute;n por venir y vivir con ellos...que comi&oacute;?, que bebi&oacute;?, como sobrevivi&oacute;?

I first became familiar with Andrew Shields' writing at a web site he set up which showed off his fan fiction. (I won't reveal the URL, but type \\"Andrew Shields\\" and \\"Web of Shadows\\" at A9 and you should find it.) I was so impressed with Andrew's writing that I asked him to write some stories for me, which he kindly obliged. But I did not buy \\"Shifting Tides\\" simply because I felt I owed Andrew a favor. Rather, I was confident that through Andrew's storytelling gifts, he could make me care about characters and a story completely unlike anything he had ever written before. In that, I was not disappointed.The back of the book says that \\"Shifting Tides\\" \\"blends elements of fantasy and Western fiction.\\" It's true that the Western which used to be as much a staple of literature and comic books as well as film and television has fallen steeply into decline. If you don't believe me, look at Amazon.com itself---there are seperate categories listed for Mysteries & Thrillers, Horror, Fiction & Literature, and ScienceFiction & Fantasy....but no Westerns. And this is only a decade and a half after \\"Dances With Wolves\\" and \\"Unforgiven\\" won Best Picture! Well, Andrew Shields has resurrected this near-dead genre from the grave, pilgrim. Forget any ideas of this being an \\"alternate\\" Western where the cowboys travel to different planets in spaceships, ride to towns in landspeeders, and use blasters or phasers to shoot the bad guys. In the Far Reaches, if you are not travelling by horse, train, or stagecoach, you have to walk. Steam power is still king and the internal combustion engine has not been invented yet. And if you go to a saloon after a long day of travelling, be very wary of an old coot named \\"Tarp\\" Johnson who offers to sell you the casing of the bullet legendary gunfighter Jonathan Hale used to kill the varak outlaw knownas \\"Spook.\\"One of the biggest pleasures of this book is seeing how faithfully Andrew manages to convey the conventions of the Western that most of us are already familiar with. You almost expect to see the train that our protagonists travel in for a good portion of the book to announce stops in Abeleine, Tombstone, or Virginia City. But however much it resembles the Old West, the Far Reaches is NOT the United States of the late 19th Century. Aside from the changes in geography, the biggest difference between this book and the traditional Western is the addition of three alien races....kree, varak, and chod. Humanity is at war with the last species, and readers anxious to make parallels with American history may make the mistake of assuming that the chod are the equivalent of Native Americans that were forced onto reservations to make the settlement of the West possible. A betteranalogy would probably be to either the Cylons or Orcs. These chod are anything but noble, but they are savage and relentless. If humanity loses this war, which forms the backdrop of the novel, man will lose a lot more than just territory.Anyway, the action of this book focuses on an ensemble of characters as they journey further out into the West...or the Far Reaches...to complete a perilous journey. The central character is Jonathan Hale who will be familiar to everyone who is remotely familiar with Westerns. He is the legendary former marshall/gunslinger who reluctantly comes out of retirement after receiving a mysterious telegram. (Try hard NOT to think of Gary Cooper.) He recruits his former deputy, Moses Forbes, who is now a successful merchant but used to be the toughest \\"chodbuster\\" in the Reaches. Unlike Hale, Forbes relishes the chance to relive his former days of glory and get out of the house. They hook up with another former deputy of Hale's, named Redgrave. Redgrave is a former sherriff who is now a travelling barber who travels with two slaves as companions, the mysterious klee named \\"Trip\\", and a female varak named Karis. But he has another profession which slowly becomes apparent through the course of the book, and becomes linked with Hale's mission. Another former associate, but less welcome than the others arrives with the arrival of bounty hunter \\"Tarp\\" Johnson and his teenaged son Max. (How these two get their names is a good story in and of itself.) Tarp is an annoying old coot/comedy relief character who never knows when to stop talking or quit when he is ahead. Max is just as embarrassed of his father as Tarp's former colleagues, but Tarp proves to be very resourceful when the chips are down, and his son actually takes after his old man more than he realizes at first. I won't give away the whole plot, but Shields does a very good job of delineating five very different characters and creating good team chemistry as they interact amongst each other. When the going gets tough, he follows a very rule that has made his fan-fiction stories a must read for me---\\"everybody....gets...to...do...something....cool.\\"There is one more thing that needs to be addressed, and that is the \\"s-word.\\" I know that a lot of readers have already decided not to buy this book because I have revealed that one of the heroes is a slaveowner. It will make no difference that he is a good owner and that his slaves are devoted to him. All I can say is read this book anyway, and pay close attention. There is reference to an abolitionist movement and hints that Hale may have played a role in this \\"underground railroad.\\" There is also a scene where some racist townsfolk threaten Karis because she's a varak and they don't like her \\"kind.\\" But nothing is as it seems on the surfacem, and the alert reader will note that the relationship between master and slave is not what it seems. Like much of the action in the John Ford film \\"The Searchers\\", this subplot is not directly adressed, but it is there for the reader to see. Which brings me to another thing I like about this book---Andrew doesn't try to explain everything about the Far Reaches universe. He gives you just enough information to understand what is going on, but leaves many hints about other stuff that the reader will learn more about in future sequels. And as for me, I eagerly antipate reading the second Far Reaches novel sometime next year!"},{"Title":"Tastes Like Chicken : A Novel (Files, Lolita)","review":"This book had me laughing so hard it hurt.

The story opens at Reesy and Dandre's long awaited wedding but before the \\"I Do's\\" can be exchanged an incident from the past rears its very UGLY head and the excitement begins. Files opens a floodgate of drama and it never stops throughout the book.It seems like Reesy's marital woes and personal trauma permeate everyone around her and no one close to her is left unscathed. In this episode, although the spotlight is primarily on Reesy, it is almost equally shared with some familiar and new supporting characters. Surprisingly, the dynamic duo, Tyrone and Tyrene (Reesy's high-profile attorney parents), experience a crisis so devastating that their very foundation is threatened, while Reesy's sassy grandmother opens the closet exposing some familial skeletons that are eyebrow-raising (to say the least). Fans will learn more about Misty's husband, Rick, who has unmentionable issues that threaten their marriage; Dandre's physician father and his fantasies; and a new character, Sleazy, a stand-up comedian, who, despite his stage name, actually comes through in a big way.As with the other Reesy/Misty books, Files upholds her tradition of keeping the novels fresh and funny by interjecting the latest and most hip language, musical references, and urban expressions in her dialogue and settings. Yet, her appeal continues to be universal as this episode is well written and perfectly paced making it a real page-turner. It is a perfect release for the summer season and will no doubt be a BIG hit for fans of the series.

Knowing she will not be able to figure things out, nor put her life back in order without Reesy's assistance, Misty's life flashes before her eyes, but not before fate decides to pay her a personal visit.Ms. Files's humorous character development, flawless continuity, and mouthwatering scenes brings to life a hilarious yet compassionate tale that will have you begging for the serial to continue.-Monique Baldwin-Worrell, founder of Flavah Reviewers"},{"Title":"Tastes Like Chicken : A Novel (Files, Lolita)","review":"I'm writing this as I'm finishing the book, so if my thoughts are all over the place, blame it on what I just read. Funny? This book??? I laughed ONCE--at the fried chicken audition. Before I say anything else I must say this book was quite engaging--as all are of Files' books--but once again she needs to work on her ending. Just like &quot;Gettin' to the Good Part,&quot; the ending leaves a WHOLE helluva lot to be desired. What is it with Lolita Files and flimsy endings? But I digress--before the end comes the story, and the story (complete with totally ridiculous, utterly transparent plugs for books written by Files' two best friends) is, well, silly to the point of pointLESS. Files stays remarkably true to her main characters though: bad decisions are Reesy's perpetual trademark and Misty is just as dingy as ever. In her defense, Lolita Files displays her remarkable skill with keeping the reader hooked to the point that we're helpless to get off the ride even if we anticipate how badly she'll leave us hanging. I agree with the other reviewers in that Files was WRONG for leaving the loose ends dangling on Tyrone and Tyrene and that situation, and I thought the &quot;chase to Cali and avoid&quot; mess was retarded as hell too. I also don't know what the 'Tastes Like Chicken' title is about; however, I didn't BORROW THIS BOOK FROM THE LIBRARY because the title sounded appealing 'cause it didn't, but because it was by Lolita Files, an author whom I truly believe is not living up to her potential. Lolita has the skills to be a truly great author if she would just embrace the fact that she was not born to emulate EJD with the drama and find her own &quot;TRUE&quot; shine, as Tonya Marie Evans would say. Okay, if anybody found any lesson whatsoever in this story, please tell me what it was 'cause I missed it. What's funny is how in each of Lolita's books her characters move around just like she did--from Florida to New York to Cali, but she is SO good at inserting landmarks. I was on that street with her in front of the Manhattan Beach Marriott next to the movie theater!"},{"Title":"Tastes Like Chicken : A Novel (Files, Lolita)","review":"I'm a big fan of Ms. Files and have read and enjoyed all of her previous novels.

I've just finished this book and I was very disappointed to say the least. It felt like this was a rushed book. Alot of loose ends were not tied up (possibly b/c there will be another book?). The book was a little unrealistic for my tastes. I know alot of black people and most of them do not have money just laid up somewhere. It seemed like Ms Files wanted to make a fairy tale, romantic, fairy tale but was in a hurry to make the release date. I'm awfully glad that I did not pay full price for this book. Definately a good read for all you insomniacs or 3rd shift workers but not a neccessity to your library."},{"Title":"Tastes Like Chicken : A Novel (Files, Lolita)","review":"Lolita Files is by far my favorite author yet, the ending was just ridiculous.

This is a wonderful epilogue.Reviewed by aNNof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"Tastes Like Chicken : A Novel (Files, Lolita)","review":"What a disappointment!!! I don't even know where to begin when it comes to this book. First of all, the title has absolutely nothing to do with any element of the story. One wonders if this were not just a marketing ploy to get unsuspecting readers to buy it... like me. The author does a very poor job of making this a likeable story. She introduces characters and then drops them like hot potatoes with no development whatsoever. She spent more time detailing Reesy's 3 dogs than she did some of the main characters. The relationship between Hill and Tyrene was never believable; Tyrene's anger at her husband was never fully explained. This story had too many loose ends and no real resolution except at the very end. Why would you follow someone all the way to California and then never make an effort to see them? Then follow them all the way back to the East Coast and then hunt them down? What was the purpose of Zoe and Chloe; they added nothing. I could go on and on..... Ms. Files, you missed the mark on this one!!"},{"Title":"Tastes Like Chicken : A Novel (Files, Lolita)","review":"Reesy is finally ready to walk down the aisle.

I read the first two parts as well. The characters in all three books were just so amazing to me. Usually when I read books and they have second parts to them, they're boring. But I must say this one was not. It's a must read 4 everybody. Ms. Files definitely did her thang. And especially in Child of God 2. I hope she makes a fourth part to the book. I would love to see how Reesy and Dandre,Rick and misty, Tyrone, Tyrene and Hill are all doin."},{"Title":"Tastes Like Chicken : A Novel (Files, Lolita)","review":"Tastes like chicken???I don't know what that is a reference too, but I do know this book was not a good read. Sure the girls- Reesy and Misty are back. I was looking forward to reading their adventures, but it was not their adventures, it was more like the Reesy show, and her show did not get good reviews. From the beginning it had potential, the trip to California added even more potential, but then it basically just ended with a bunch of loose ends, with undeveloped plotlines. Sleazy was funny, but who was he? Heck if we the readers know. The twins role in this book and it was boring, and pointless. Rick, ok he needs help... I guess we have to wait until the fourth installment of this series to see how this mess ends. I think the author should have spent less time, calling out names, (Maxell, Malika Yoba, Eric Jerome Dickey) and spent more time ending storylines.I must admit this book was funny, but so is an episode Seinfeld, and there is no charge to watch it. This book costs $$$. I enjoyed the part about the dogs. I googled that breed to see if I saw a resemblance to a cat, I did not. The Tyrene/Tyrone storyline was unappealing. Overall, I doubt if I would want to read yet another book about these same people. After all the whole storyline could have been wrapped up in this book, not extended to a fourth book.

Only a \\"surprise\\" guest shows up at the wedding and the nuptials are halted. This is where the drama begins...the story revolves around Reesy who embarks on a trip across county to get away from the madness, Misty and Reesy's parents.I loved the book...my only complaint is to Ms. Files. Don't leave us waiting several years for a sequel. We tend to forget the essential pieces to the story."},{"Title":"Tastes Like Chicken : A Novel (Files, Lolita)","review":"Really enjoyed the read. Wasn't to happy with the way the story went with Misty, and Tyrene Relationship. But all well that end well. I think LL done a Fab job. Keep up the good work, cant wait until the next big Read. Please bring Misty and Reecy back in the near future."},{"Title":"Tastes Like Chicken : A Novel (Files, Lolita)","review":"Looks like some readers are in need of closure....I agree that the ending left a lot to be desired...however, that's what keeps a loyal fan anticipating the next volume in this intriguing saga of the lives of Reesy and Misty. How long did we patiently wait for this continuation? I'm happy to patiently wait for the next....I'm hooked!Reading Scenes from a Sistah and Getting to the Good Part are a MUST before picking this one up. This story ended exactly how I wanted it to. The love between Reesy and Dandre is beatiful. I didn't think anything that occurred was unrealistic. Despite popular beliefs, some African-Americans do come from money. Also, I can't count the numbers of times I've wanted to pack my bags and drive straight across the country...leave my worries behind - start anew. Who says that's the answer, but I commend Reesy for having the strength to do so. What I wouldn't do to have a friend like Sleazy in my corner. I look forward to reading the outcome of Tyrene, Tyrone, and Hill. I also can't wait to read more about Misty and Rick. 5 stars!"},{"Title":"Tastes Like Chicken : A Novel (Files, Lolita)","review":"Each character wanted to judge another for their own faults, but could not realize their own situation.For example, Tyrene, was yelling and calling everyone else wrong, when she was a common-law wife for years and never set the right example for her own daughter. Along, with this, she cheated with the father of her daughter's fiancee, one of the main persons she could not stomach. Tyrene, may have had these feelings all along and not realized her emotions being drawn into the desire of her not only from Dr. Hill.Next, you have Tyrone, he is just as much blame in setting a bad example for the daughter. He could not for years speak his mind or opinion. But when, it came to a very drastic problem, he decided to let it out the wrong way and at the wrong time. Also, not telling his daughter about the common-law marriage, being one of the Panthers, and last but not least, orgies his wife and him were having. For being lawyers, they could have settled their case another way in court. He decided he wanted to go kill his wife and Dr. Hill, but through God his friend Trini caught him just in time. Was the guilt over the fact his wife was cheating or was it over the fact who she was cheating with?Dandre, he needed to have forgiven Chloe and Zoe and helped them to reform from the loose life. Instead he just had gotten rid of them and had them to moved somewhere else, but from his own frustration and guilt. At least he did have the \\"somewhat decent Sleazy\\" to show him how to come to an understanding of forgiving others as well and accepting them for not being perfect as well. Even though Dandre, knew he was in love with Reesy, he still accepted her faults, but in the beginning he did not when he caught her cheating. Dandre, is a former playboy, \\"Ex-Ho.\\" But from what I understand in previous books, the two of them are more compatible for one another than a little.Misty and Rick altogether, were deceiving one another. They wanted the love and the romance involved, but to their own hidden agendas. They could not come to realization when it really should have been stated clearly in the beginning of how what was to be expected out their marriage.There's a lot to be said, when it comes to forgiving, but let us not withhold our own inhibitions, to deceive others by judging one another. Especially, when judgement day will come.... I apologize, if I am retelling the story, but it tells you how much I enjoyed the book, my movie in other words. And I wanted to say much more about Dr. Hill and the main character Reesy, but they had to learn to forgive and forget also."},{"Title":"Tastes Like Chicken : A Novel (Files, Lolita)","review":"I enjoyed Taste like Chicken.

Just keep on writing!"},{"Title":"Tastes Like Chicken : A Novel (Files, Lolita)","review":"The novel started out strong, however, I found the small but big words very distracting. Reesy in the beginning sounded more mature, but she seemed to regress in California. The hip-hop references, too much emphasis on SEX, more SEX, and more SEX was a put off. The grandmother and parents were the most interesting/intriguing characters who really kept me turning the pages. Still, the whole Cali scene was suitable for a teenie-bopper junior book club because it just didn't fit with the diction...Anywho, it was my first read by Miss Lolita and I can't say I was disappointed, but, I didn't feel hyped either."},{"Title":"Tastes Like Chicken : A Novel (Files, Lolita)","review":"This book is an fun read it had me laughing and at awe with the characters.

Reesy and Dandre are like hot cakes thier relationship is strong if it wasn't for their love for each other they've would of been done a long time ago.

Fortunately, it only took me a day to complete. While the writing flows linear from one chapter to the next, it does offer a glimspe at a world of exaggerated fiction--good thing! I have read all of Lolita's books with the hopes that the continuing sagas would at least demonstrate character growth thus making the characters more dimensional. Their lives are just too segmented. Whatever happened to characters that focus on the whole person?If the intentions of this book was to explore seemingly dysfunctional, materialistic, surface relationships and an expected ending tied in a cute little predictable bow then the mission was accomplished. Don't get me wrong sections of the book was hilarious and entertaining but left you wanting to know more about the folks.Reesy continues to run away from her problems, unbelievable scenes occur that are questionable and an attempt to resolve issues seemed rushed at the end. Hopefully this is not a cliff hanger for more to come . . ."},{"Title":"Tastes Like Chicken : A Novel (Files, Lolita)","review":"I have not read the previous installments of this literary soap opera, But I can't imagine the characters having any growth at all from the preceding books.The situations are forced, the solutions are fantasy-like, and the characters are basically all rich, black people who do little more than act like Jerry Springer candidates. There is talent in her writing, but the formulaic, quick-gotta-end-it climax, along with the implausible cliff-hanger really tried my patience.Since this is the 3rd book, with the same characters, and they are still this clueless, let's just tell them to shove it. The author can either pander to a fan base looking for a black, The Young and the Clueless, or raise her characters to challenge themselves, and us.Please, if you choose to continue this series, give your characters a base. Enable us to feel as if this person is real and has a personality, rather than being a conveyance to your next set-up.I guess what bothers me is that the writer doesn't seem to have worked very hard on this book. She gives out anecdotes, as opposed to a storyline. This reminds me of an old O'Jay's song,....Got to give the people what they want.We want more of an effort from you. The talent is there."},{"Title":"Tastes Like Chicken : A Novel (Files, Lolita)","review":"I didn't know what to expect when I borrowed this book from a friend, but it turned out to be a jewel.

Reesy and Misty find out in this book what love has to do with everything. Don't not pick this up expecting some sappy romance novel. This is a page-turner. Don't borrow it!! It needs to be in your howm library. I am about to purchase a copy now!!"},{"Title":"Tastes Like Chicken : A Novel (Files, Lolita)","review":"Reading Tastes Like Chicken had me craving chicken. It was not because the book talked about chicken a lot, but the title alone had me yearning. Ms. Files introduces the reader to variations of the word \\"chicken.\\" It can be a coward, a chickenhead (slang for women who are golddiggers), or the bird that produces meat or eggs. How do you like your chicken?The readers were first introduced to Reesy and Misty in Scenes From A Sistah and later in Getting to the Good Part. Now they're back again and the opening scene is at Reesy's wedding. Only she doesn't get married and the story takes off from there. It seems her fianc&eacute; Dandre has a hidden past and the skeletons fall out the closet at the most inopportune time...their wedding day. Now he has to prove his love to take-no-prisoners Reesy. She's not putting up with any bull, so she hightails herself far away from her problems in classic Reesy and Misty fashion. She even packs some fried chicken and white bread for the trip.Misty has her own issues to deal with. She finds out her husband Rick has been less than honest with her. He makes a life altering decision without her consent. Although devastated, she realizes, \\"you can run but you can't hide.\\" She decides to stop running and to start fighting for what she loves and believes in and tries to work it out. She tries to share this revelation with Reesy who is too stubborn to understand.Get a plastic bag (or paper bag), batter the chicken, fry it, season it and add some sauce; spicy sauce for the chicken wings and spicy drama to the story. Tyrene and Tyrone, Reesy's parents, are an added subplot. I can't forget Hill, Dandre's father, who serves as a hot number himself. If you've ever heard, \\"save the drama for your mama,\\" this subplot gives a whole new meaning to the saying.Tastes Like Chicken is hilarious. I couldn't stop laughing and craving chicken. While reading, I called a friend and asked if she had read it. She said no. I recommended it by saying, \\"That chile sho' can tell a story. By the way, can I get your grandmama's recipe for fried chicken?\\" She laughed. For the ultimate feel good; do the right thing; unconditional love type novel of the year, Tastes Like Chicken gets the award. Flawless. Beware: you might feel the urge to eat some chicken during or after reading this book. Whelp!

Since then, her writing has matured and although I cared for Misty and Reesy back then, it has been a pleasure to watch them evolve into more complete and complex personalities. I really enjoyed &quot;Tastes Like Chicken&quot; because in addition to Reesy and Misty, peripheral characters like Tyrone and Tyrene were given more attention.

The events that follow involving the crazy antics of Reesy's parents and Misty's husband, and the lengths that Dandre is willing to go through for love are both hilarious and heart-wrenching.I would recommend this book, along with Getting to the Good Part, as they are both great reads.

Ms. Files left a lot of loose ends possibly because there will be a fourth installment to this book. In my opinion she could have closed the saga of these two women and made this the last book.

I didn't think that I would want to hear about the same characters again, but Ms. Files wrote this book so well, that it doesn't matter that these are characters she has already written about. The book was excellent!!! I suggest this book for book clubs to read."},{"Title":"Tastes Like Chicken : A Novel (Files, Lolita)","review":"I am a fan of the Misty Fine/Reesy Snowden books. Scenes From A Sistah was good. Getting To The Good Part was even better (I much prefer Reesy's character to Misty's). But Tastes Like Chicken was...eh. While I enjoyed reading about Reesy's impending marriage and Rick and Misty's post-honeymoon life, this book could have been so much more. There were so many plot twists, I had to step back and regroup (and how could Reesy NOT tell the difference between a puppy and a kitten? What was that all about?). As for the Misty/Rick twist...I'm still trying to adjust, it was that creepy. Sleazy was the best character in the book, sort of an urban Yoda. The interactions between Reesy and her feisty grandmother were always entertaining. There were a few unresolved storylines that were rather obvious in leaving the door wide open for a fourth Misty/Reesy book. Die-hard fans will purchase the book regardless. I'm glad that I checked this one out of the public library."},{"Title":"Tastes Like Chicken : A Novel (Files, Lolita)","review":"Taste like ChickenLolitas Files 5 starsThe story of Reesy and Misty continues...With Taste like Chicken it keeps getting better.

I belong to a Christian bookclub and even though we tend to choose only Christian fiction, we decided to read it because it looked like it might be fun for the summer. THIS BOOK WAS THE BEST! We were calling each other back and forth all night long. It was almost impossible to wait for the bookclub meeting to talk about it. Every body loved it, which makes us wonder if maybe a little Reesy (or heaven forbid, Tyrene!) lurks in all of us. We're going to go back and read the other two books that go with this one.

Better than KFC!"},{"Title":"Secrets of Self-Employment: Surviving and Thriving on the Ups and Downs of Being Your Own Boss","review":"I found this book to be quick and easy to read, with very applicable and down-to-earth information about the rites of passage to the entrepreneurial world. Their advice does not focus on actual business management, although they do offer wonderful tips on such topics as time and paper flow management. Instead, they address all the things typical business texts and professors do not mention. I have an MBA from a top 10 business school, and I am learning more from this book about the psychology of starting a business than I ever did in school.The Edwards have helped me to understand the fears and doubts I have had over the last few months, while I have been contemplating leaving my well-paying and secure position at a large consulting firm. Until I picked up this book I thought I was the only one who questioned their decisions and their capabilities as an entrepreneur. Now I know that everyone has similarly scary feelings, and that there are ways in which we can minimize them, and even take advantage of them. Every page offered some form of support or valuable advice, and I felt myself gaining confidence with each chapter. I also learned more about myself and what type of business I would prefer, after reading their description of classic entrepreneurs vs. &quot;propreneurs&quot; (their term for individual professionals and craftspeople). I have gone from a state of anxiety to gung-ho enthusiasm!It is apparent that these authors speak from direct experience, not from a podium in front of a classroom. They are brutally honest about their own mistakes and doubts, which serves to make a positive and helpful connection with the reader."},{"Title":"Secrets of Self-Employment: Surviving and Thriving on the Ups and Downs of Being Your Own Boss","review":"People who look to this book for a how-to manual on financing, marketing, incorporating, etc. will be disappointed. And that's OK, because it offers something much more precious - peace of mind. That's not to say there isn't general advice about some of these issues and even some real targeted suggestions to solve certain problems, but the focus is more on the mindset of being your own boss, at start-up and beyond. A step-by-step, &quot;put Tab A in Slot B&quot; book almost seems like putting the cart before the horse after reading this. If the mind isn't ready or is struggling, everything that comes after will be a struggle too despite the best instruction manual.I am in the process of opening my own business after being &quot;downsized&quot; for the last time. Some days have been up and some days have been down. Some days I thought I should throw in the towel and go live in a hut somewhere far, far away. This book has shown me that all of this is normal and has shown me how to use the up moments and push past the down ones to get what I want. It's amazing the way the authors almost seem to step inside your head. They are supportive, clear and offer real, usable advice to keep on track mentally, exult in your victories and deal with the difficulties as they arise. The format is conversational, friendly, uplifting and confidence-building.This book will be part of my &quot;business bible&quot; collection - those books I will refer to again and again as I grow my business."},{"Title":"Secrets of Self-Employment: Surviving and Thriving on the Ups and Downs of Being Your Own Boss","review":"Paul and Sarah Edwards are probably one of the top leaders in the Home-Based Business revolution.

Their advice are genuine and come from personal experience as well as extensive research on other self-employed individuals. Getting this book would be a great asset to anyone, especially those considering a home business. This book is well-written and easy to understand.

The Edwards' format is easy to read and they go through all the possible setbacks of self-employment and how to avoid them. I've been a freelance writer for two years, but anyone - whether starting to work on their own or in the business for 10 years - can learn from this book. It's well worth the price."},{"Title":"Secrets of Self-Employment: Surviving and Thriving on the Ups and Downs of Being Your Own Boss","review":"Pay no attention to the fact that this book was written in 1991/96. The concepts in it will still apply in the year 2591 and beyond.As long as humans think, they will certainly have bad thoughts which will hurt their chances of being successful in their own business. This book show you how to overcome those negative thoughts that you will have from time to time as you build and grow your business. In fact it applies to all areas of your life, not just business.In business, you must convince other people that you are worth investing in. You'll have successes and failures. What is most important is that you bounce back up from your down times.This book has an amazing reference section right in the middle with darkened edges called \\"The Emotional Road Map\\". It lets you identify the negative emotion you are feeling, and shows you how to overcome that emotion, so you can get back to being productive in your business. Since it's your business, you'll need to kick yourself in the butt when you need it. This book shows you those secrets.If nothing in your business is going well, and you're depressed and angry that everyone else is doing better than you, that type of feeling can destroy your chances of success. What this book shows you is how you can stop looking at how far away you are from your goal, and instead look at how far you've come from where you've started. That helps you keep on moving toward your goal.I wish someone would turn this into a movie, then more people would learn from it, and maybe we would have a much better economy. With some much negativity in the world and on TV and the web, you really need a way to stay sane. Read this book, memorize it's lessons, and apply them daily, and you'll be much better off because of it."},{"Title":"Secrets of Self-Employment: Surviving and Thriving on the Ups and Downs of Being Your Own Boss","review":"As others have indicated, this is a book that addresses the psychological aspects of being self-employed as a small business owner or solo practitioner. Definitely one of the best business books on the market that offers honest and \\"real world\\" advice despite being written several years ago.Highly recommended reading for anyone thinking about starting a business - but especially for lifestyle entrepreneurs. The book refers to these type of entrepreneurs as being \\"propreneurs.\\" The authors were ahead of their time as more and more entrepreneurs are starting businesses and choosing self-employment for lifestyle (as opposed to strickly monetary) reasons.It's also a very good reference book which can be used as a self-mentoring or self-motivating device especially when business is down and one feels like giving up his or her dreams of personal and/or financial independence."},{"Title":"Secrets of Self-Employment: Surviving and Thriving on the Ups and Downs of Being Your Own Boss","review":"I would like to take this opportunity to recommend the book not only for people who want to become self-employed, but also for job hunters and people who just plain feel that they are at the end of their rope.I'd like to express great gratitude to Sarah and Paul Edwards for a book that was like a shining beacon during a very dark period of my life. I still have my copy and re-read it every few years.I encountered this book soon after it was published in 1996. I was seriously ill, had been downsized from my job -- along with almost all of my co-workers -- and was starting a home-based business to support me. I was also looking for part-time work in my field, as I was bankrupt, and in debt.This book was instrumental in helping me set up a tiny home-based business that helped me survive, financially and psychologically, for several years until I was able to find a full-time job in my field again.The book is basically a psychological guide to working on your own -- while it has practical details on starting your own business, the largest portion of the book deals with positive ways to keep yourself focused, motivated, energized, and efficient on a day-to-day basis when you are working for yourself.Much of its advice can be useful to job hunters -- job hunting is actually like a job in which you are the employer, marketing yourself -- and for people who are depressed and/or in terrible life situations, the book is full of advice on maintaining an optimistic and realistic outlook in your planning and activities amd how to find creative solutions to situations that look hopeless.Among the most helpful sections of the book are how to keep motivated and keep moving when bad incidents or catastrophes occur. Sarah and Paul Edwards examine regular difficulties -- you created a product, but your client didn't pay for it -- to Xtreme problems:\\"Tricia Holderman actually tried unsuccessfully to pull out the cord on her life-support system when doctors told her they didn't know what more they could do for her.\\" The Edwardses discuss how Ms. Holderman got through this situation, and eventually rebuilt her business.I am about to change careers, into two new careers -- one working for other people, and another one for after my \\"retirement\\", in which I will be working full-time for myself -- and this book is back on my desk!There are plenty of books out there about the practical aspects of setting up your own business -- including some by the Edwardses -- but this book will give you the psychological coaching and support you need, whether you are starting your own business, job hunting, or just trying to get through a very long, dark tunnel period of your life.If I could give it more than five stars, I would."},{"Title":"Secrets of Self-Employment: Surviving and Thriving on the Ups and Downs of Being Your Own Boss","review":"My answer to \\"ratu\\" is simple: Yes, you can read a \\"how-to\\" book and build your own house and be proud of what you achieve--until the roof leaks..., etc., etc., etc!

Why spend your whole life working under 1 person's clock, with only one set paycheck(a lousy one at that) when you are capable of so much more? To me having your paycheck dependent upon only one person is much riskier than getting the same amount if not more from lots of other people.

Berkey uses an analytical approach rather than a narrative one to portray the religion as being in a state of constant development during these years. His work highlights the diversity contained within Islam. Indeed, the book might have been entitled THE FORMATION OF ISLAMS. In describing Islam's formation, Berkey divides his book into four broad sections: \\"The Near East before Islam;\\" \\"The Emergence of Islam, 600--750;\\" \\"The Consolidation of Islam, 750--1000;\\" and \\"Medieval Islam, 1000--1500.\\"In the first section, Berkey describes the late antique milieu that produced Islam. The areas of the Fertile Crescent and the Arabian Peninsula were politically unstable because of Byzantine and the Sassanid influences in these areas. Both in politics and religion, Berkey feels that Islam followed patterns of what came before it, while incorporating particularly Arabian elements such as an emphasis on tribal identity.In the second section, Berkey analyzes the early years of the Islamic movement. He portrays the new religion's earliest years as a time of flux, and he asserts that the movement had a long process of maturation. Muhammad did not present the Arabs with a crystalline theology and polity; rather, the Islam developed in relationship to its political and religious context. Berkey portrays Islam as having a high level of religious indeterminacy during this period, while simultaneously being prone to sectarianism.In his third section, Berkey explores the crystallizing that occurred in the Islamic traditions. Politically, the Abbasids adopted the trappings of an imperial court, demonstrating continuity with what came before. Berkey asserts, however, that the real force in Islam at the time was the urban middle class and that the Caliph failed to wield real religious power. Shia disappoint concerning the Abbasid caliphs caused that movement to further define itself, but in doing so also caused further fracturing. Berkey explains the fascinating development of Twelver Shiism, as well as the Ismaili Shiism of the Fatimids. During this period of Islamic history, the broader Muslim community began to define what it meant to be Muslim. This form of Islam would become known as Sunniism, based on sunna which means way of life. This branch of Islam relied heavily on the consensus of the community (umma). The Sharia became the manifestation of the community's will and its traditions, and the jurists (ulama) became the custodians of those traditions. This role of tradition, as well as that of the jurists, became a means to maintain unity in the Islamic world, in spite of the fractious nature of the successive political regimes that arrived in the Middle Period.In the fourth section of this book, Berkey investigates what he apologetically calls \\"Medieval Islam.\\" During this period, the Islamic areas were ruled by \\"alien\\" regimes, many of which were Turkic. Berkey suggests that these regimes relied heavily on the jurists and traditional Sunniism because of the \\"otherness\\" of the ruling class. This common bond proved beneficial in light of the area's political fragmentation."},{"Title":"The Formation of Islam: Religion and Society in the Near East, 600-1800 (Themes in Islamic History)","review":"I'm a biology major who read this book as part of a history course I took to fulfill a history requirement. As such I found it to provide a great base of knowledge. It mixes in a healthy amount of narrative style that makes it easier reading than other books of similar subjects that I've read. I say its for the \\"enthusiastic newcomer to the subject\\" because though this book is easier reading than others it did come from academia, and thus can occasionally be slightly thick reading, but in my opinion is well worth it. In short, if you're really interested in the history of Islam, this is a great book, but if you're looking for some casual reading you might want to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Formation of Islam: Religion and Society in the Near East, 600-1800 (Themes in Islamic History)","review":"This book argues that the development of a distinctly Islamic religious and social identity took years, if not centuries to develop. It did not spring full blown from the mind of Mohammed.While the thesis of the book is stated initially, the development of the argument is too often interrupted by frequent modifiers or asides, which interrupt the thread or flow of the argument. A chronological ordering of events would be a great help. It would also be helpful if Arabic words or phrases were translated parenthetically in the text or in a footnote.The above critique makes this book a difficult read."},{"Title":"The Formation of Islam: Religion and Society in the Near East, 600-1800 (Themes in Islamic History)","review":"Berkey states that his book is for students and those interested in Islamic history. However, one would need to read a real textbook in order to have the foundation necessary to understand his work.His scholarship and attention to detail are above reproach, but the style of writing and content assume that the reader already knows quite a bit about Islamic history. That, and the plethora of words in Arabic, leave his history as very bland and confusing."},{"Title":"Brewing Quality Beers: The Home Brewer's Essential Guidebook","review":"This is the first book I bought before I brewed my first batch from extract--the beer turned out great and I've never looked back.

Generally the information is all 20 years old, so there is nothing cutting edge here for homebrewers.I guess if this was my first homebrewing book from 20 years ago, I would wax poetically about it too.Additionally, the format of the book is smaller than it appears, although the dimensions are listed correctly.Unless you want to pick up this book for historical reasons (like me), skip over it and head to the current standard for beginning brewers, John Palmer'sHow to Brew: Everything You Need To Know To Brew Beer Right The First Time.

In addition, it is easy to read and understand."},{"Title":"Smith and Roberson's Business Law (Smith & Roberson's Business Law)","review":"Law can sometimes seem to be a dry, tedious subject. However, it's also an important topic for any businessperson to understand, so they can navigate the world of contracts, responsibilities, and liabilities with at least some understanding of what the issues are. I enjoyed Smith and Roberson's Business Law as a solid foundation in the topic.I'll note that this eighth edition is from 1991. Even so, I found the information quite useful and imagine that the basic information is still fairly sound. The discussions on the history of law, what law is all about, and how law and ethics comingle have been ones that have been going on for thousands of years.The examples provided in the text are great. We get everything from references to A Clockwork Orange to people deliberately causing checks to bounce. The examples make sense and help us relate to what is going on. If someone sells video recording devices, and people buy them to make copies of copyrighted material, who is at fault?These are good not only for lawyers to know, but also for normal businesspeople. It's better to know what to do beforehand, and not to get embroiled in a lawsuit, vs having to go through the years of pain afterwards to undo the mess.On a down side, there are over 1200 pages of text, plus an additional 300+ pages of end material. This isn't a book you can prop up on your lap to read through easily. Also, if you need help in a specific area, it's not easy to quickly find what you want and to study about it. This is definitely where an ebook version would do much better. You could read the book without \\"bearing the weight\\" literally of the entire tome in your hands.

After moving to Seattle, I wondered why the weather in Northwestern America might be like this, and Katrina desaster was also a motivation for me to want to understand how weather works. And I have no desire to try to understand it in expert level (nor do I have time to do so).First of all, this book is not for weather majors or experts.this book is for general readers who don't have a clue about how weather works but want to know. For that purpuse, I haven't found any better book than this. I'm not a geologist or weather expert. So, I can't say how accurate this book is. However this book explains things so well with a lot of beautiful pictures. Saying that this book doesn't have any content, all misinformation, etc. is simply over-exaggerating minor mistakes that any books might have. Go to the bookstore and see it yourself. You will love this book.Even though you don't like the content for any reason, the beautiful pictures themselves will worth the money. However, there is no reason why casual readers who want to know about whether would not like the contents of this book. Don't let skeptic's over-exaggerated nitpicking discourage your owning this wonderful book.This is one of the books from which you can learn science without studying, and with pleasure.

First though, let me say the book does contain a nice collection of pretty pictures. That's about all its got going for it.First off, the book has no actual content. Every two pages is spread of pictures with a small paragraph loosely relating to a supposed topic. The pictures don't really relate, however. So basically, you're not going to learn anything about weather from the text.Fine, it is a \\"visual\\" guide. There is a major fundamental flaw here as well. The captions of the photos are laced with errors, misinformation, misleading statements and demonstrate an apalling level of cluelessness on the part of the authors/editors. It is very clear someone went trolling through the stock photo agencies and grabbed some \\"weather related\\" photos and then more or less made up captions for them.I have only a limited background in the topics covered, but just in thumbing through I found numerous errors including obviously incorrect dates, geographic errors and claims that images were of phenomona that they clearly don't represent. Worse still, a wide varity of images are also altered with no indication that they are artists renderings or photo adaptations.In summary, pure fluff, minimal content, and most of the content that does exist is flat out wrong, either through neglect, ineptitude or plain fabrication.Flip through it in the library or bookstore but otherwise don't waste your money or encourage future publication of this low-rate psuedo-science garbage."},{"Title":"Weather: A Visual Guide","review":"Weather is one of the major homes of chaos theory.Fractals are mathematical equations that give beautifulpattern but also appear as clouds and turbulent natural events.The turbulent wake of an island shot from the air is very likepatterns seen in fractal Julia sets.As a coffee table book in the time of global warmingand climate change this book is a very good way for people to see what weather is and how it becomes climate as an overall pattern in nature."},{"Title":"Weather: A Visual Guide","review":"I had gotten this book for a Christmas present. My wife had checked it out of the library so often that I decided to get a copy for her. It is an extremely informative book with a well written set of explanations for the weather patterns seen and experienced. It is lavishly illustrated and that makes for holding the attention of the general readership. I highly recommend this for anyone interested in learning more about the weather over and above their local forecasts. It would also be a great reference for teachers."},{"Title":"Weather: A Visual Guide","review":"I wouldn't have purchased this book had I seen the reviews on Amazon, but I came across it in a bookstore and was very impressed. I like that it's very broad and thorough, but at the same time very concise and full of pictures. Each spread covers one topic, with perhaps 2 paragraghs and 4 - 5 pictures. What I like about it is that it reads almost like a coffee table book instead of a textbook. Yes, there are a lot of pages, but it's easy to flip through and look at captivating images, and learn a lot just by reading captions or brief descriptions.

The Canudos episode has had two major previous chroniclers, first Da Cunha's classic eyewitness account &quot;Rebellion in the Backlands,&quot; &amp; Vargas Llosa's &quot;War of the End of the World,&quot; familiar to US readers. Levine's scholarly history does not have the literary merit of its predecessors (though it's still quite readable). But it is analytically superior, because in documenting the historical background &amp; religious orthodoxy of the Canudos community Levine reveals his subjects as well-rounded historical actors rather than incoherent fanatics. He thus restores the humanity of this tragic episode's victims, not least by showing how they exemplified millenarian patterns found elsewhere. The well-chosen illustrations make the book visually striking too. I would not hesitate to assign the paperback to advanced undergraduates. It is the definitive modern interpretation, &amp; ultimately it will stimulate more research &amp; revised perspectives. We cannot ask more of a good historian."},{"Title":"Vale of Tears: Revisiting the Canudos Massacre in Northeastern Brazil, 1893-1897","review":"I read this book on recommmendation by a friend.

Detective Sonchai Jitplecheep of The Royal Thai Police Force in District 8 is back with another case in his career. A farang(foreigner) is found dead in his mother's brothel Old Man's Club with his penis mutilated. Chanya, one of the girls of the club is a suspect. Colonel Vikorn, Sonchai's superior and co-owner of the club, orders him to carry out the investigation. The farang is a CIA operative in Bangkok recruited to report terrorst activities post-9/11 in Thailand. Sonchai starts his investigation and enters the world of terrorism and the japanese body art of Tattoo, which will help him to solve the case. Great read. Must read for the readers of 'Bangkok 8'. Sonchai gets better with time."},{"Title":"Bangkok Tattoo","review":"I wouldn't have thought John Burdett's BANGKOK 8 could have been topped, but the author has produced, in BANGKOK TATTOO, another sensational novel. Here again, detective Sonchai Jipleecheep of the Royal Thai Police pursues the killer through backstreets and bordellos, among alcoholic Westerners in Thailand for the sex trade. And what a killer this one is! Having read hundreds of mysteries through the years, by masters and beginners, I was stunned by the resolution of this book. Burdett is familiar with both the city of Bangkok and Thailand as a whole, its lovely landscapes and bustling streets, and his descriptions are phantasmagorical, making reading his works addictive. This novel, like its predecessor, is satisfying on many levels -- erotica, horror, mystery, literary, humor -- yet his characters are sympathetic if not always likeable. Reasons for various characters' behaviors help one understand their choices, in a world steeped in corruption and poverty. This guy is terrific. Encore!"},{"Title":"Bangkok Tattoo","review":"I enjoyed Bangkok 8, so I decided this book would be worth a read. The first half was very well done, albeit with a few annoyances (overruse of Farang, weak narrator voice, idiotic CIA characters), but it really deterioated once the tattoo artist came into the story. The intriguing plot between Zinna and Vikorn was completely dropped. And the last 50 pages were so ridiculous and uninteresting that it was only with great force did I finish the book. Not reccommended."},{"Title":"Bangkok Tattoo","review":"Unfortunately Bangkok Tattoo is nowhere as good as its prequel, although still worth picking up if you enjoyed the previous book by John Burdett. A lot of what set Bangkok 8 apart from others of its ilk has been repeated here, and that is one of the problems with this book. In Bangkok 8 the lead character's Buddhist faith, and habit of addressing himself directly to the reader, didn't come across as being contrived - this is not the case in Bangkok Tattoo. Time and time again, Sonchai would address the farang, waffle pointlessly about this and that and Buddhist believings and only serves to slow down the plot.And the plot is the other issue with the book. It is very much a stop and start affair, and a major thread in the plot, a drug war between Club owner and Sonchai's police boss Colonel Vikorn and army General Zinna, at one point suddenly comes to a screaming halt in the middle of the book and only is clumsily and unsatisfactorily resolved in the final chapters of the book. The whole thread of this story comes across very much like needless padding, as if the author decided he needed to add some pages to bulk out the novel.The main plot, involving the brutal murder of an US intelligence operative, is also somewhat of a miss-mash. It begins promisingly enough with the promise of Muslim intrigue and involvement in the murder, and the CIA also becomes involved but when the plotline is resolved, the protagnist seemingly comes out of left field, and their movativation for murders seem random and ultimately pointless.What is still good about Bangkok Tattoo is that once again, John Burdett has created some very interesting characters, from the Sonchai the Thai cop and Vikorn his boss, to Chanya the Thai hooker with a heart suspected of murder, to the CIA operatives, to the Muslim iman and his son fearing a holy war should his followers be accused of the murder of the CIA operative. Mitch, whose murder instigates the whole story, descends into a hole of drink and drug addled madness, his slide into oblivion well portrayed by the author. Most of all, Burdett has made the sleazy side of Bangkok city, with its sex trade very much a character in its own right."},{"Title":"Bangkok Tattoo","review":"Imagine my surprise when I saw Bangkok Tattoo in the new release section. I snatched that bad boy up right away! I was really excited for another chance to read more about Sonchai, my favorite police detective in the Eastern hemisphere. Another great noir read. The book is well written, characters are well developed and the pace is one in which you can allow yourself to be immersed in the story and Thai culture. I like that Sonchai really wants to be and is a good person but realizes that human morality isn't so black and white and is more gray and murky than most people are willing to admit. Great book!"},{"Title":"Bangkok Tattoo","review":"Reading the stinging reviews as well as the 5 stars, it's amazing to me how the haters even get to appear. This book is fabulous and another example of Burdett's imagination and knowledge of place, people, and religion. I often think the naysayers are motivated by something other than the quality of the book and the incredible atmosphere it creates. Like, maybe Burdett dissed them at some time or offended some religious/political bias. Taken on its own, Bangkok Tattoo is magical and doesn't fail to make me sweat in the sex parlors of Thailand. I have been in the places Burdett describes and he is spot on. The story delivers.Ron LealosAuthor of Don't Mean Nuthin'"},{"Title":"Bangkok Tattoo","review":"Cultural masochism, a vicarious Bernard Trink eye view of Bangkok nightlife, East-West cliches, finger pointing moralising and cultural preachments aside I still find Sonchai hard to resist! Burdett writes so well! To be fair he also makes some very salient points regarding western values though I cant help feeling that the modern Thailand has been less subjected to those values than whole heartedly adopted them but then who wouldnt? the temptations are insuperable. I also find it hard to believe that Police chief Vikorn, no matter how humble his roots, would ever drink Mekhong Whisky!...and also in one of the books I read, didnt Sonchai stick his feet up on a table? As for Thai attitudes towards Westerners...well Johns right...we just dont count if we did he wouldnt be allowed to return to Thailand. Just another Farang author writing in English about his take on their country and people, no worries. I do love reading his books though. Maybe time to leave the mean streets of Bangkok and venture elsewhere dinner was great but now my palate is becoming jaded."},{"Title":"Bangkok Tattoo","review":"Take a wild ride through a culture that is at the same time grounded in the hard-core facts of economic survival, but equally steeped in mysticism.

I had precious little time to step outside of the common tourist sites and visits, except for sampling some wonderful local food. These books suggested how much I could be missing, rich as they are in local color. While fun, silly, and a bit over the top - they also move the reader a bit outside their comfort zone as Burdett does his best to provide a view through local eyes and remind those of more delicate sensibilities here in the USA that judgments of other people, other situations are not always so easy. While Bangkok 8 was arguably better, this is still enjoyable.One of my favorite lines from the two books was one Thai's take on the corruption in their government and tax evasion as a superior system to the US -- \\"[in Thailand] you get exactly the government you pay for here\\".Through the looking glass, indeed."},{"Title":"Bangkok Tattoo","review":"Bangkok Tattoo is a great novel to read to understand Bangkok, the flesh trade, Buddhism and above all have good fun doing so.The novel has a great plot, real characters, contrarian views on the flesh trade and the extent of corruption in developing countries.The plot line is based on a Detective in District 8 police whose mom runs a bar which is funded by the colonel in the police force. There is a murder in the bar involving one of the best performers. There are innumerable sub-plots and sudden twists that keep the reader engrossed for the relatively short read across the 300 pages."},{"Title":"Bangkok Tattoo","review":"This isn't as great as its predecessor, but its still flavorful, perverse and compelling. But I must say that Sonchai seems different from the earlier book. Here he's not quite as thoughtful, his religious musings don't seem as authentic. He's more cynical and jaded - pun intended."},{"Title":"Bangkok Tattoo","review":"As spicy as a four-pepper pot of Pad Thai, BANGKOK 8 whetted our palates for a second course. Author John Burdett serves it up in BANGKOK TATTOO with asbestos mitts, brim filled with culturally diverse, eclectic and exciting characters. His Buddhist monk cum Bangkok police detective, Sonchai Jitpleecheep, is the singularly most complex and exotic police detective to be found in current noir detective fiction.In his first highly acclaimed novel we are introduced to Sonchai, a troubled young detective under the tutelage of Police Colonel Vikorn, head of Bangkok's notorious Precinct 8. Sonchai is the half-breed son of a vanished American GI and one of Bangkok's most successful concubines. Now retired, she has the connections needed to allow her son entr&eacute; to what she hopes will be a life away from the bitter streets of the Red Light district.These hopes are upended due to his familiarity with the business end of Bangkok's seamy sexual underworld. His Buddhist monastic training has rendered him incorruptible, but his upbringing has left him unblinkingly aware of the dark hazards that can befall those who ply the trade.In BANGKOK TATTOO he becomes inextricably entangled in a plot that involves the FBI, CIA, Muslim clerics, Al Qaeda operatives, and ghoulish figures of the Thai underworld. It seems that the love of his life, the beautiful Chanya, is a chief suspect in the grisly murder of a CIA agent, found dead in her room. Sonchai follows a trail of evidence that burrows into a feud between the Thai military, upper echelon police and international terrorist groups. Mere suicide bombings pale against the toll of the highly lucrative drug and sex trade, as always at the root of the strife.Burdett creates a vivid sense of place and offers a cast of colorful villains and anti-heroes that favorably compare to the worlds of James Lee Burke and Michael Connelly. His writing is literary in style, reflective and philosophical in nature, yet filled with action and suspense often delivered with tongue planted firmly in cheek.Bring on the third course, Mr. Burdett. We're ready with a six-pack of Singha beer in the cooler.--- Reviewed by Roz Shea"},{"Title":"Bangkok Tattoo","review":"Having lived in Bangkok one year as an expat, I was very curious about John Burdett and his three books set in Bangkok. I got ahold of the second one first, Bangkok Tattoo. I have since ordered the other two. The humor makes you laugh outloud! It is right on. I loved his calling the reader farang, or foreigner. It is a word I heard often in Bangkok as the Thais commented to themselves about the many foreigners in their midst.Burdett has written an intriguing mystery. It contains, among other things, a humanized Thai whore; a mainly corrupt group of Thai cops and detectives; a CIA agent lost in his own mind; a philosophical Thai narrator and countless facts about the street life in Bangkok. The murders are horrendous and unique. The asides about Buddhism are wonderful. I can't wait to sink myself in to Bangkok 8, and I highly recommend this talented writer to mystery lovers everywhere.Cheryl Smith"},{"Title":"Bangkok Tattoo","review":"I had read Bangkok 8 and was eager to get this when it came out in paperback. It is a strange and bizzarre story but once again Burdett draws you into a world that I could never imagine. His writing is so vivid.

And I can't wait to read the next one."},{"Title":"Bangkok Tattoo","review":"Wonderful book by Burdett. I liked it better than Bangkok 8, which I felt was a little too intense and raggedy. This book is intense also, but with greater clarity. I thought the characters were better developed; the plot, though more byzantine and exhuberant, easier to follow. But of course, the star of the book is Bangkok. What a fascinating city! The author's ability to create a (mostly) honest cop, deeply immersed in Buddhism, and steer him through a kaleidoscope of conflicting, shifting cultural boulders to a believeable and compelling ending, is truly a literary tour de force. Very enjoyable book."},{"Title":"Bangkok Tattoo","review":"Sequels seldom live up to their predecessors.This may be an exception.Royal Thai Police Detective Sonchai Jitpleecheep is back and just as engaging as he was in his previous incarnation in \\"Bangkok 8.\\"There probably isn't another detective like him anywhere in the world. How many other police detectives are also Buddhist arhats and pimps? It's been said Buddhists revel in contradictions and Sonchai is a prime example. And, that's part of the joy of reading his adventures.Here Sonchai is called upon by his chief, Police Colonel Vikorn (who is also his mother's partner in The Old Man's Club, one of the more unusual brothels in Bangkok) to \\"investigate\\" the murder of an American CIA agent. The victim had been gutted, The murderer appears to have been Chanya, the highest earner at The Old Man's Club, who went to a hotel with the man and returned with her clothes soaked in blood.Vikorn, apparently not willing to give up Chanya's value to the club, concocts a scenario in which the killer is not the girl but Al Qaeda, a cover-up that suits other representatives of the CIA who soon join the fray.Struggling to find balance between his own ambition, pragmatism, Buddhism and feelings for the girl, Sonchai is dispatched to Thailand's dangerous southern border to seek a handy Muslim suspect or two.Several sub-plots add spice to the mix - Sonchai's efforts to help Lek, his new cadet, a katoey (transsexual in progress); Vikorn's feud with his arch-enemy, Army Colonel Zinna; Sonchai's growing love for Chanya. There's another murder or two, an intriguing array of characters - prostitutes, Muslim fundamentalists, Japanese Yakuza, a mad tattooist - and not a boring page in the novel.The best part is, Sonchai gets the girl and, since the last sentence ends without a period, we may hear more of him."},{"Title":"Bangkok Tattoo","review":"Author John Burdett, who has spent a good deal of his life in Hong Kong displays a passion and keen understanding of Eastern ideology, which he demonstrates in his bizarre thriller \\"Bangkok Tattoo\\".Protagonist Sonchai Jitpleecheep, a detective in the Thai police is also the part owner of a Bangkok sex club called The Old Man Club. His mom, Nong, the club's madam and reknowned ex-courtesan has revealed to Sonchai that one of the girls has apparently brutally killed one of her johns. The girl, the gorgeous Chanya, who Sonchai is secretly in love with, is their most accomplished and highest earning hooker. Wishing to protect her and their investment, they conjure up a cover up with the help of chief of police, the corrupt Colonel Vikorn.It turns out that the murdered man, Mitch Turner, who had been disemboweled and mutilated was a CIA operative monitoring Muslim activity in Thailand after the 9/11 terrorist attack. Colonel Vikorn wishing to protect his interests in the burgeoning Thai sex industry wished to portray the murder as being perpetrated by Al-Qaeda, much to the dismay of the local innocent Muslims.While all this is going on we learn that Vikorn is at odds with Army chief General Zinna. Zinna who is also dirty, is the kingpin of the distribution of illegal drugs particularly heroin and morphine. Zinna and Vikorn have an ongoing feud which has murderous repercussions as they both try to screw each other.Eventually CIA operatives arrive in Bangkok to investigate. More murders occur with the same M.O., victims have their penises severed and their backs splayed of skin. Sonchai carefully skirting around the varying agendas of the players in this affair and protective of his beloved Chanya endeavors to find out what really happened.Burdett weaves an incredible tale using the Thai sex industry and lawlessness rampant in Bangkok's District 8 red light district as a backdrop. The obvious dichotomy of life there is laughably evident as the corrupt players follow devout Buddhist tenets, performing good deeds to counterbalance their sinful existence."},{"Title":"Bangkok Tattoo","review":"I loved Bangkok Tattoo, not only for its sheer entertainment value, but for the lessons it teaches.Precisely because morality IS ambiguous, our quaint and misguided Western outlook on how other countries should behave, more often than not, skews our relationships with them.Bangkok Tattoo is a great book from several perspectives. A beautifully written engrossing read with a fine plot, unforgettable characters, up-to-the minute perspectives of what's currently going on in the world, and an intelligent and subtle look at Buddhism make this book deserve the five stars I am giving it. Highly recommended. One of the best mysteries I've read in several years."},{"Title":"Bangkok Tattoo","review":"In Bangkok Tattoo (the sequel to Bangkok 8), Sonchai Jitpleecheep-Thailand's peerless Buddhist detective-is hot on the trail of the killer of Mitch Turner, a CIA agent found dead and grotesquely mutilated in a hotel room. At first, the primary suspect is Chanya, a prostitute who works out of The Old Men's Club-a bordello run by Sonchai, his mother, and the incomparable Colonel Vikorn. Vikorn then cooks up a scenario whereby Chanya admits killing Turner-but only in self-defense. The story then mutates into the killing's having been perpetrated by Al Qaeda.The rest of the book finds the reader following Jitpleecheep as he investigates the killing. The problem then becomes one of plot. Along the way, John Burdett seems to have forgotten that he is writing a murder mystery that happens to take place in Bangkok. Instead, what we get are a lot of ruminations by Jitpleecheep on the vast superiority of eastern culture over the west and why it's perfectly acceptable and economically advantageous for Thai girls to become prostitutes. The adventures of Chanya as she plied her trade in the United States also take up a good part of the book. This all becomes tiresome by about page 250 or so.Bangkok Tattoo is \\"densely atmospheric\\" as the blurb on the book flap suggests. Unfortunately, after a pretty good start it ultimately becomes boring. And the outcome is rather similar to Roald Dahl's short story \\"Skin.\\" What Burdett needs is a good editor-the book could have been a hundred fifty pages or so shorter. But then, we wouldn't really have a novel, would we?"},{"Title":"Bangkok Tattoo","review":"Rebeccasreads highly recommends BANGKOK TATTOO as a positively enchanting, weirdly engaging, always affecting \\"whodunnit\\" and why -- with a difference: Buddhism in our modern world walking the streets of sin.As with BANGKOK 8, John Burdett takes us into the underworld of Royal Thai Police detective Sonchai Jitpleecheep & The Old Man's Club he owns with his mother, where his best working girl seems to have not only killed her customer, she flayed him alive. Why? Surely not because he was so ugly, nor because he was CIA.As Sonchai observes his boss & mentor, Vikorn, work the angles, he follows the clues through his beloved city, & we see his Buddhism at work as he ponders on life, love, law & lechery.BANGKOK TATTOO has an intense & lyrical voice which insists you suspend your plodding farangi (foreigner) expectations.Riveting!"},{"Title":"Bangkok Tattoo","review":"a lot of others have commented that Bangkok 8 was a superior book. they're right.this book suffers badly from the author's imposition of his own voice over his character's. i find it hard to credit that a buddhist would take up such a vituperative stance toward westerners. lord knows western culture needs a good, solid critique right now, but somehow i don't believe it would come tripping out of a buddhist's mouth. buddhists after all are known for their tolerance of human--including western--foibles.so all i can assume is that the author is having one of those horrible culture shock swings, wherein his own culture looks really, really bad to him. maybe a vacation would help."},{"Title":"Bangkok Tattoo","review":"While I enjoy books about Southest Asia police work this one went a little over the top in its vivid descriptions of the sex life in Bangkok, and drug use. I often visit Thailand on business and have never seen the corruption the author tals about. Relative to drug use NONE of the Thai officers I know are users. The book gives a bleak desciption of Thai life and if believed could lead some not to travel there. The culmination with the mutilation style killing really ruined the mystery portions of the novel. I will buy no more John Burdett novels."},{"Title":"Bangkok Tattoo","review":"This was an enjoyable book. It kept me wondering what would happen. Now I want to listen to the next book. As with Bangkok 8, I think the ending could be better."},{"Title":"Bangkok Tattoo","review":"\\"Tell me Farang\\", how does it feel to know you threw ten bucks down the toilet. Burdett's first effort was a heroic surprise and garners a charitable 2 stars for this throwaway -- a cynical, cloyish, BORING effort to rake in the cash. A singular dearth of ideas, uncommonly purple prose, and a patronizing view of Thais and Farang alike. Look, if you need a vicarious make-believe Thai thrill whose extreme literary pretentiousness raises it just above a virtual Patpong hand-job, then, well, plunk down your chips and -- the real price tag -- your precious time. I'd awaited this follow-up eagerly. Now I think it would be a tender mercy if Burdett returned to lawyering and laid down his pen."},{"Title":"Bangkok Tattoo","review":"I've been a repeat visitor to Thailand; John Burdett was recommended to me as accessible insight into Thai Buddhist culture, a fun read rather than an academic work.And this is exactly what Burdett accomplishes in Bangkok Tattoo: a well-paced, seamy mystery set in a Bangkok easily recognizable to those who've been there, that gets into the Buddhist mind and Thai culture.The descriptions and imagery vividly paint scenes that I might have seen during my travels; the writer is clearly writing about a city and culture with which he's intimately familiar. The style is crisp and snappy, a \\"page turner\\".Closed-minded readers may find some of the story shocking or coarse (Thai attitudes towards sex are much different than those in the West), but even those readers should persist to gain some understanding of the Thai culture. It's a culture that's not been hobbled by a history of crippling constructs like \\"original sin\\" or damnation/salvation, a culture that naturally lends itself to balance. And there's a nice plot twist at the end, too!Highly recommended for both an entertaining read and for insight into a vibrant, important culture."},{"Title":"Bangkok Tattoo","review":"Every page insults with racism, romanticized prostitution and corruption. Burdett's first book, 'Bangkok 8', gave insight into the Thai culture through the character of devout Buddhist Sonchai. In this book, Papasan Sonchai has clearly left the Path."},{"Title":"Bangkok Tattoo","review":"Overall I enjoyed both this and Bangkok 8. The underworld fabricated by Mr. Burdett coupled with his descriptions of an exotic city are very intriguing. His prose is both spartan and engaging. I could do without the constant cliches of the obtuse \\"Western mind\\" and the enigmatic \\"Asian mind\\". I also tire quickly of the characterization of every American government entity as corrupt and stupid and everyone else in the world- especially the developing world- as imbued with great wisdom. Still, the characters are interesting and more or less believable. I think this book suffers from the same flaw of Bangkok 8- the plot resolution just isn't credible here either. This made most of the final 30 pages or so a bit disappointing, but it was the same with Bangkok 8. Mr. Burdett also seems to have a serious- and disturbing- fascination with flaying. In Bangkok 8 a woman was flayed with a whip and here in Bangkok Tattoo several murder victims were flayed with surgical precision. A final note- the cover art of the paperback is excellent."},{"Title":"Bangkok Tattoo","review":"Burdette's book is little more than the World According to Burdette in which America is the root of all evil and the object of all scorn. I lived in Thailand for 3 years, speak the language passably well, and can say with some degree of authority that if you want a good perception of Thai culture, you'd be much better off reading Mulder's \\"Inside Thai Society.\\" Mudler's book is far deeper than the Lonely Planet guide, which was probably Burdette's main source of information. Burdette's protagonist, Sonchai, supposedly the \\"only honest cop\\" in Bangkok and semi-arhat (arhat's being, for lack of a better analogy, a saint), moonlights as a pimp, runs errands for his police colonel boss' who profits from drugs, prostitution, and making porn movies. When he's not making a dishonest baht, Sonchai spends his time pontificating about why America is so bad and laughable. This book is what some people believe is a \\"good introduction to Buddhism?\\" I can understand why this might appeal to some people, but that doesn't make it a good book, whether as an illustration of Thailand, the Buddhism of that country, or the people that live there."},{"Title":"Bangkok Tattoo","review":"I read the first few pages at a friend's house (in Bangkok) and thought this might be better than Bangkok 8, so I went out and bought a copy for my flight home. Burdett's previous novel was a good read despite a heavy dose of Thai stereotypes. Unfortunately, \\"Tattoo\\" quickly descends into a poorly informed anthropology lesson about Thailand that meanders through a high concept plot that also concerns things Burdett knows little about. The plot builds on two common SE Asian stores and 1990s headlines about the CIA. The first story line is a variation on a common and truth based Thai tale: the violent death of a US GI/sailor/Marine, whose body is found in a divey bar or sleazy hotel after a joint US-Thai military maneuver (if it happens in Bangkok) or a large organized R&R; (if it happens in Pattaya). This happens about once a year and an old colleague of mine used to be the guy who had to handles these. Burdett turns the GI/sailor/Marine into a CIA agent, who seems to be a cross between Graham Greene's Quiet American (based on an actual CIA agent) and Forrest Gump. Story element #2 is a variation on the \\"Air America\\" legend of CIA operations in Laos financed by opium dealing, which has been raised and to varying degrees, debunked over the last 30 years. Finally, Burdett adds CIA agents turning for money. Unfortunately, he knows little how CIA agents are recruited, what motivates them or how much they're paid. His agents are oafish characters who make the dead agent look like a genius.Along the way, Burdett uses his tiresome and didactic \\"Farang...\\" device to give us various pieces of misinformation about Thailand. Muslim Malaysians appear where ethnic Chinese Malay usually predominate (the border massage parlors Sungai Golok), Western sex tourists pop up in places where Westerners are rarities, and the description of working girls from NE Thailand borrows from the mythology of young women from the villages of a different region where sex work came to be something of a cottage industry. The Isaan women who serve foreigners come from a different world where they are much less tied to the village, much less respected there, and much more interested in ending up with a foreigner. In one spot, Burdett can't decide if he's in Patpong (which features \\"ping pong shows\\" is for tourists) or Soi Cowboy (which is more sedate and for expats) some distance away. These kinds of details wouldn't aggravate if Burdett was less interested in telling us over and over again what he \\"knows\\".Ultimately the plot falls apart with its cartoonish CIA gents (who would be better cast as small town or suburban cops in a xenophobic place like Indiana), its ludicrous assumptions about their motives (Burdett thinks a PhD holding case officer would make as much as a senior administrative assistant), and the tiresome use of his \\"Farang...\\" storytelling device. Burdett is skilled in the use of stereotypes about people from the US, although his fellow Brits only do slightly better.Bangkok has had an explosion of really lame fiction and non-fiction written by expats and graduate students over the past decade. It's entertaining place full of paradoxes, sleaze, corruption, cuteness (the sappy popular culture never seems to make into books), and unexpected places of tranquility. It certainly deserves a decent book and definitely deserves something better than this smug string of cliches and misinformation."},{"Title":"Bangkok Tattoo","review":"I'd forgotten how funny these books are. Just the rundown of the girls working for Sonchai and his mom is worth the price. And the great east/west comparison, talking about how murder is normal, but dissecting the act of, say, flaying, psychologically, as only being capable of coming from a Western mind. Morbid, dark, and hilarious.The trouble with a sequel, especially a sequel to this book is maintaining great things from the first that people would then come to expect. So, the humor--check! I did hope there would be more revelations of self, but, so many of the characters were repeats, that you can't ask for everything.I hope that these books don't misrepresent a slice of Thai culture, but I really enjoy how it is all presented. John Burdett again lays it all out without preamble, letting things simply transpire, and doesn't forcefeed you any leads, red herring or hooks. You are left to simply enjoy the story instead of putting down the book, thinking too hard, and going back to pages to hunt and peck for the most recent clue. To me a mystery novel is that--a novel to be read, and not a 300-page word search looking for the answers before the end. That's what a re-read is for.It's easy, as an American, to accept the original reason behind the murder at the center of the book, but, towards the end, when it is revealed why the man was murdered , and the \\"matter-of-fact\\"ness of it, is something more tragic and petty than even the most paranoid FARANG mind can conjure.When all is revealed, the importance of, not good evil, but balance and karma is again emphasized as in the first book, and the plot is satisfyingly concluded. My biggest criticism is that, someone, the voice of this novel wasn't the same fun-loving and spiritual tone as the first book. This one was more bitter, cynical, and critical of others, in comparison to Sonchai's former acceptance. His keen analysis turned more into judgments, and, while a good book in and of itself, will leave readers wondering what happened in between one and two."},{"Title":"Bangkok Tattoo","review":"If you have enjoyed reading the other books featuring Detective Jitleecheep in Bangkok; you will also take pleasure in this fun, interesting and complicated story.

I enjoyed this novel even more than the first I think - perhaps because I already \\"knew\\" detective Sonchai Jitpleecheep, and looked forward to another sojourn into the wonderful world of Thai thinking. As with \\"Bangkok 8\\", the restlessness and futility of the western capitalistic mind is very cleverly portrayed, and I couldn't help thinking yes, dammit, I think like this all the time!Apart from the thought provoking philosophy, this is also a bumper of a detective story that well deserves to share your bed as you read through the long night. Looking forward to \\"Bangkok Haunts\\""},{"Title":"Bangkok Tattoo","review":"Bangkok Tattoo is the second, and hopefully not last, chapter in the life of Detective Soncahi Jitpleecheep of the Royal Thai Police, who finds himself investigating another bizarre murder where appearances are often deceiving. Like Burdett's first book, Bangkok 8, it's full of atmosphere like and contains crisper plotting and a more satisfying ending, which is welcome, since the story telling of Bangkok 8 was not its best feature. I really like Burdette's nuanced and clever sense of humor sprinkled throughout the book.What really makes this book a pleasure to read is all the interesting, unique, yet believable characters. And Burdette creates a strange, yet compelling logic of the Bangkok underworld. Jitpleecheep's boss on the Royal Thai Police, Colonel Vikorn, is basically a gangster, and virtually every fact of the investigation is twisted to suit some other purpose, and yet, you can see it all sort of works in a distinctly Thai way. Even the CIA, which comes across initially as a bunch of bumbling farangs (non-Thai), wise up over time and prove to be equal to Jitpleecheep's savvy."},{"Title":"Bangkok Tattoo","review":"As a sequal to Burdett's first novel set in Thailand , Bangkok Tattoo provides a good plot , more bizarre twists and turns then the first book did, and more characters who live in and around the seedy red light industries of Bangkok. As in the first book Americans, specifically CIA agents are used as foils to draw cultural distinctions and to provide some of the mystery and suspense that drives the action.Burdett writes well, with a healthy dose of humor added in to make his novels entertaining and relatively quick reads."},{"Title":"Bangkok Tattoo","review":"In Bangkok Tattoo, we are reunited with the enchanting Detective Jitpleecheep who, while still trying desperately to walk the Buddhist Middle Path, is investigating another grisly homicide and reluctantly helping his mother run a popular brothel on the side. To complicate matters further, Sonchai has fallen in love with the extraordinary Chanya, prostitute extraordinaire, who also happens to be the prime suspect in the murder. While as casually risqu&eacute; as its predecessor, Bangkok 8, with plenty of insight into the city's famous red light district, this entry also deeply explores Buddhist philosophy and provides more of that fascinating social commentary on the disparities between the West and the East. I enjoyed this entry even more than the first, right up to the last paragraph, a finale of whimsical artistry that had me smiling with secret delight (at 4:00 in the morning). Sonchai is utterly unique. I think I've fallen in love with a fictional character."},{"Title":"Bangkok Tattoo","review":"Burdett knows Bangkok and Thai culture and expertly weaves it into this wonderful, sexy, underground, intellectural whodunnit.

Burdett's return to his characters in this sequel is still clever, intermittently funny, but the jokey, thumb-your-nose-at-the-West tone overwhelms the plot, which veers to the Baroque.Let's hope the second sequel will be a return to form."},{"Title":"Bangkok Tattoo","review":"This is a well written thriller that gives a good feel of the setting--Thailand and it's capital Bangkok. It captures the casual Thai attitude towards prostitution: the main male character, a policeman, and the main female character, a call girl, eventually get married. Tensions between the police chief and his rival for political power, the army chief, may or may not be so, but do not challenge the imagination. When an American is killed and it is discovered that he is a CIA agent sent to spy on Muslims in the south of Thailand, everyone is too ready to believe that the crime should be blamed on a known Islamist terrorist group.Spoiler alert--it is not so. The truth is stranger and somewhat gruesome involving a Japanese artist with a gambling addiction and who owes lots of money--to the wrong people, naturally."},{"Title":"Bangkok Tattoo","review":"This is the third John Burdette book I've read, and I'm a fan. The \\"hero\\" in this one is a Bangkok detective, but the supporting cast of characters are as interesting and important as he is to the plot, which, like the others I've read, is not exactly straightforward. Since I've spent time in Thailand and Bangkok, however, one of the more interesting aspects of the book to me was the portrayal of the city, country, and the way that Thais (and particularly Buddhists) think. I don't know if Mr. Burdette is really accurate in his portrayal, but it is nonetheless interesting and amusing and enjoyable. I won't talk about the plot, except to say that it's a murder mystery with strange twists, but I think you'll find it enjoyable."},{"Title":"Bangkok Tattoo","review":"but why is the second book so much money....for the kindle edition? how come? that seems a bit unfair. or, very unfair. this series, starting with the spectacular \\"bangkok 8\\", looks to be wonderful, but it would cost me almost $24. to read the next two books in the series......that's the kind of thing i can't afford right now, but i'd sure love to read the books.looks like, in this case alone, i may revert to paper. gotta try to read the other books in the series....i was mesmerised by the first one, \\"bangkok 8\\". oh you didn't read it? well, get on that, right away, as long as you are not easily offended. read some of the reviews first to see if it's your thing."},{"Title":"Bangkok Tattoo","review":"The predecessor Bangkok 8 is nothing short of perfection for a detective story.

Great characters throughout. The author's nimble mind and the pertinent, good-humored, and restorative islands of Buddhist level-headedness amidst monumental traffic jams, brazen villainy, and frantic action make for a satisfying, lively read."},{"Title":"Bangkok Tattoo","review":"In Bangkok, Nong, part owner of the Old Man's Club, calls her son Royal Thai police detective Chai Jipleecheep and her partner, Chai's superior Colonel Vikorn to inform them that one of their ladies, Chanya killed a visiting American. While Nong thinks killing customers is bad for business, Vikorn informs Chai that the homicide was an act of self defense without visiting the crime scene or interviewing the woman who has confessed. Chai persuades his boss to come to the hotel room where the murder occurred. The victim not only had his penis removed, but possessed an interesting Visa that allowed multiple reentries over the next two years. In other words Mitch Turner was from the CIA.Vikorn knows self defense or homicide means the CIA, the FBI, and the Thai government will be all over them from head to toes. Instead Vikorn, needing to protect his investment decides to throw the blame on Al Qaeda, which will make the Americans happy. While Vikorn tries to con the Yanks and his superiors, Chai conducts inquiries into the homicide because he has problems accepting that even an opium dazed Chanya would commit mutilation.This Thai police procedural is a wonderful tale starring an interesting detective trying to remain honest when surrounded by corrupt individuals including his mother. The secondary cast provides insight into the society as well as set an amoral tone to the tale that only seemingly Chai counters. The official inquiries are cleverly designed to occur below the radar screen of the Americans seeking the Al Qaeda connection. Fans of exotic locale who-done-its will enjoy this fine tale and seek Chai's previous solid investigative tale (see BANGKOK 8).Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Bangkok Tattoo","review":"Ok like everyone else I loved Bangkok 8... but the characters we know and loved from the first book return here only to insult the reader. Which might have been forgivable had the rest of the book actually been well written which it was not. There was no action no intrigue or even a mystery. The narative is disjointed and in the middle of the book is a very long section of a Thai hooker's exploits in America, completely ignoring Sanchai for nearly 100 pages. So in the end this book was pretty pointless if only to call the reader a dumb Farang on every page."},{"Title":"Bangkok Tattoo","review":"Just reading the convoluted meandering storyline is as good as a drug trip.

Not your mainstream type mystery, but well worth reading."},{"Title":"Bangkok Tattoo","review":"Detective Sonchai Jitpleecheep takes another walk through the seedy side of the Bangkok flesh trade in order to solve a gruesome murder. A puzzling question is why the grisly mutilation of the body? The answer is a big surprise and a big wow. Score one for author John Burdett for coming up with a creepy original storyline. Where I was a little disappointed in his ending to \\"Bangkok 8\\" I was more than pleased with the conclusion to \\"Bangkok Tattoo.\\" Won't give anything away here but if you enjoy this genre then you will really enjoy \\"Bangkok Tattoo.\\"All of the colorful characters are there - the prostitutes; corrupt police and army generals; Japanese gangsters; CIA agents. It's through Sonchai's eyes that we see Thailand not from a Westerner's perspective but from a Thai's. The lives of the bar girls, Buddhism, and Thai society are brought to light in a way few outsiders understand.I would recommend reading \\"Bangkok 8\\" first since it introduces most of the characters and the settings that continue into \\"Bangkok Tattoo.\\" However, if you start with the latter you will still be in for a mesmerizing read."},{"Title":"Bangkok Tattoo","review":"Chanya, the most profitable lady at the Old Man's Club, is holed up with an opium pipe, her blood-soaked clothes decorating the stairs to her room. A couple of streets away lies is the mutilated corpse of a farang (foreigner) and a single rose in a plastic mug of water. The Thai Royal Police Colonel Vikorn dictates Chanya's statement, phrasing it in such a way as to cover all possibilities when blame is cast. Police Detective Sonchai Jitpleecheep artfully transcribes Vikorn's report, because that is how things are done here in District 8. Unfortunately, the mutilated corpse is CIA and the victim's ID carries inherent problems. The murder could be blamed on Al Qaeda, but how do you justify a terrorist/castration murder?In Bangkok, where pragmatism rules the day, the Colonel is also a gangster and the police often supplement their salaries by working in brothels. Such is Sonchai's case, policeman by day, dedicated papasan by night. Sonchai is following the path of the Buddha, but constantly challenged by Vikorn's manner of doing business. A Muslim shows up at the club where Sonchai is overseeing the girls as they attach themselves to customers. Disdainful, the Muslim, Mustafa, unfolds a picture of the dead man, then leaves his card. Mustafa's father is an imam, who welcomes the detective, explaining that his network has been tracking the CIA agent. Now the imam is worried about being blamed for the murder, a convenient answer to everyone's problems.What is so fascinating about this novel is the total immersion in Thai culture, from Buddhist practices to ancient rituals, alongside the very practical approach to the vagaries of human sexuality. This is a country that happily accepts all its differences, a finely tuned morality tempered with understanding for the many challenges that face the people who coexist in a difficult world. To read it is to think it, to experience life surrounded by the exoticism of Eastern values and thought processes. Throughout, advice is narrated to the \\"farang\\" reader, explaining the easy order of business in Thailand, \\"Farang, tell your evangelists not to bundle salvation with the work ethic. It really doesn't play in the tropics.\\"Bangkok Tattoo is a complicated slice of drama, an angst-ridden CIA agent hopelessly in love, tormented by his duty and religious beliefs vs. his amorous obsession; the Americans' interminable quest to tie every violent act to a subversive plot by Al Qaeda to undermine the moral of the American people; the naturally pragmatic and corrupt system of the accommodations of the Thai personality; and a group of Muslims trying to avert an excuse for war in their part of the country, hyper-aware that they are the bogeymen du jour. The ubiquitous Sonchai watches all unfold, reporting to Vikorn, yearning for Chanya, a dutiful son and conscientious policeman. Sprinkle in a Japanese tattoo artist, the community of katoeys (transsexuals-in-progress), a couple of gruesome murders that include castration and flaying, a dash of karma and mix well. This is the perfect recipe for a spicy Eastern mystery that is uniquely satisfying. Luan Gaines/2005."},{"Title":"Bangkok Tattoo","review":"In John Burdett's first novel, Bangkok 8, he introduces his protagonist, Detective Sonchai Jitpleecheep of The Royal Thai Police District 8, a Buddhist with a strange sense of humour when it comes to \\"farang\\", the white westerner, and an uncanny ability to see peoples past lives when he first meets them, and a sixth sense, usually dreaming about the case in question, communicated through his dead partner. Sonchai is certainly a bizarre character, a part time pimp for his ex prostitute mother, working their highly successful brothel in the seamy red light district of Bangkok, \\"The Old Man's Club\\", and partners in the business with his boss, Colonel Vikorn, the cunning Thai gangster and head of the city's police force. It's business as usual until one of their top working girls, Chayna, comes stumbling back into the club drenched in blood, to discover her \\"john\\" back at the hotel room, castrated and skinned. When questioned, the poor girl is stoned on opium, forcing Vikorn and Sonchai to write the confession for her, and quickly get her out of town, because the victim, unfortunately, is CIA.Bangkok Tattoo is a very entertaining read because the cast of characters, prostitutes, pimps, transvestites, drug dealers, Japanese gangsters, Chinese diplomats, are all written extremely well and highly unusual, making the story out of the ordinary, down right strange at times, and enormously interesting.Sonchai Jitpleecheep does not care much for \\"farang\\", using this word countless times throughout the narrative. (A bit too much) In a word, he believes all westerner's are schizophrenic, media drenched, materialistic, lacking any spirituality, puritanical and hypocritical, and exceedingly stupid. The CIA characters are bumbling and for the most part, lost; and the Old Man's Club clientele are middle-aged sex deprived ex hippies that require Viagra to have a good time. There's not one \\"farang\\" in the entire book with any redeeming qualities whatsoever, but I guess that's part of the novel's charm.I found this novel to be much better than Burdett's last effort. He was finding himself in Bangkok 8, and has settled into the characters with Bangkok Tattoo. He's much more comfortable with his style and it definitely shows in the writing.If you like the crime/thriller genre from a slightly bent perspective, from eastern Thai Buddhist eyes, you'll like this book. A fast-paced, entertaining read."},{"Title":"Bangkok Tattoo","review":"\\"Cynical\\" seems a wan description of the world of Sonchai Jitpleecheep. Many readers will have a hard time with Sonchai, who advocates prostitution as a worthwhile way for poor Thai girls to get rich quick, and who doesn't bother to conceal his utter contempt for post-911 America and Americans. If you hold your Western morality dearly, better skip this one.On the other hand, if you're up for a stylish, sexy, rollicking good read with oodles and oodles of plot, dripping with exotica of every description, then welcome to Sonchai's world. Sonchai's mom, an ex-hooker turned clubowner, and the ever-inventive Colonel Vikorn (with his limo blasting \\"Ride of the Valkyries\\" through its sound system at all times) are characters who will make you laugh out loud--that is, when you're not squirming over the moral dilemmas they pose (and then leap past, with the greatest of ease). You may think you've read it all on the moral ambiguity front, but Burdett takes all those wised-up detective stories and raises the stakes to another level entirely. When you find yourself rooting for a young male cop to be successful in his sex-change operation, you'll know Burdett has gotten into your head. It's a great ride! Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Bangkok Tattoo","review":"Like a lot of other reviewers, I read and loved Bangkok 8. What a great read. I was surprised to find- after I finished it, that it wasn't written by a Thai. Sonchai was a real person to me.Now I read Bangkok Tattoo and I wonder what happened to Sonchai? What comes through is a Brit slamming the U.S. and the west in general through the voice of Sonchai.What's the purpose of having the CIA being the fools in the story? The female boss of the CIA officers is a lesbian? Why's that? Why isn't MI6 the object of ridicule? Why is the word \\"farang\\" in every other sentence? I get it- I get it...it's a derogatory word for westerners, right?I hope Burdett keeps writing in the series. I also hopes he lets Sonchai act like a Thai Buddhist and not like some political commentator on the Chris Matthews show."},{"Title":"Bangkok Tattoo","review":"Bangkok Tattoo is the follow-up to John Burdett's acclaimed Bangkok 8 featuring Thai police detective Sonchai Jitpleecheep.This novel finds Sonchai investigating the gruesome murder of a CIA operative Mitch Turner - with the twist that the prime suspect, a Thai prostitute called Chanya, works in the strip club part owned by Sonchai, his mother, and the corrupt police captain Vikorn. As he untangles this little mystery he in turn runs across the Muslim troubles in south Thailand where Turner was a CIA operative, the drug trade, the corrupt army, and his corrupt police Captain who he must appease, not to mention the U.S. CIA.Where does it all lead? In a completely unexpected direction eventually, making for another rather interesting visit with Sonchai. As readers of Bangkok 8 will know, Sonchai is not corrupt, but walks a grey area in the seedy areas of life as he empathizes with the travails of others - particularly given he is the son of a former Thai prostitute who now owns a strip club (read brothel). His empathy for others and his unique outlook make for a rather interesting character where the first person narrative, in which this novel is written, works very well.Bangkok Tattoo is as good, and in some ways, better than Bangkok 8 and well worth reading."},{"Title":"Bangkok Tattoo","review":"I first read about this detective in \\"Bangkok 8\\" and was eager to read \\"Bangkog Tattoo\\". Even more surprising and pleasing! The detective is the head pimp in a brothel whose manager is his mother and silent partner the local police chief, his boss. The detective is a devout Buddhist. The detective is in love with the brothel's number one call girl whose profits have made her the hero of her home village. The detective sees who you were in your past lives. Confused yet?It all hangs together positive and upbeat and pokes thoughtful fun at \\"western\\" ways and attitudes. A Hollywood starlet forces a factory to release underage kids as workers... so the parents hire them out as sex slaves instead.I recommend it because it's different, it's entertaining, it's thought-provoking, and it encourages us \\"Farang\\" westerners to lighten up a little in our Puritanical ways..."},{"Title":"Bangkok Tattoo","review":"Somewhat overratedJohn Burdett's \\"Bangkok Tattoo\\" is the follow-up to widely praised \\"Bangkok 8.\\" It's hard to pigeon-hole these novels, though at their heart they are police procedurals - Thai style. About half-way through \\"Bangkok Tattoo,\\" you start to wonder just when the story is going to kick into gear. Oh, you've had your gruesome murder in the first few pages (with more to come). But what you've got to contend with is detective Sonchai Jitpleecheep's discursive musings - that seem nearly endless. Sex, the West, Thai culture, sex change operations, the Buddha, police corruption, Burdett lays it on thick in order to establish atmosphere. But he's skillful in this because he always circles back to the main thread of the story: the Why of the death and mutilation of a CIA agent. There are red herrings galore, but when you do finally find out how his death came about, there is a sense of being cheated a bit - which is exactly how I felt after I finished \\"Bangkok 8.\\" Burdett is too good a writer not to know he is doing this. And as plot device, the red herrings serve the further purpose in this particular novel of further indicting the West's black and white view of reality. (Gee, we're such children. And the Muslims are of course the good guys.)Anyway, late in \\"Bangkok Tattoo\\" his somewhat ineffective detective admits as much as things draw to a horrible, but fitting conclusion: \\"there's nothing like the Buddha when it comes to anticlimax.\\" And this scene plays itself out wonderfully, very noirish, very bizarre. But what bothers me is the whole set-up leading to this conclusion. Arguably, the clues are all there from page one, providing Burdett the opportunity to rail against the \\"farangs\\" for most of the book. It doesn't take long before you start seeing polemical similarities with the latter day (and now lesser) le Carre. One possible twist however, that by novel's end one wonders, in the expletive-like way Jitleecheep slings the term\\"farang\\" (foreigner) around, being part American himself, if there isn't some sense of self loathing operating. Until that's clarified, hopefully in an upcoming effort, the detective's dripping cynicism seems unearned or, worse, unbelievable. As a result the cultural makeup of the detective seems tacked on, it lacks the level of cultural integration that, for example, Martin Cruz Smith brings to his wonderful cynic-cop Arkady Renko. You get the sense that Jitleecheep is less a personality and more a Thai connect-the-dots, with authorial cynicism meant to be the glue to hold it all together. In other words, Jitleecheep, despite all his religious posturing, lacks the very center he seems to think most westerners lack. One more, and minor, complaint. Burdett probably needs to familiarize himself better with more realistic pay grades for upper level CIA operatives. Then again, if he's right, no wonder we can't hold on to good talent."},{"Title":"Bangkok Tattoo","review":"I was introduced to British Author John Burdett via his brilliant, \`Bangkok 8' (2003). I was heading to Bangkok and wanted a gripping Thailand-fiction read. He delivered. Burdett has an uncanny ability to shed cultural insights regarding the steamy and seamy streets of Bangkok better that any guide that I took with me. When his follow-up, \`Bangkok Tattoo' was released I was in the front of the line.All of the unforgettable characters remain: Sonchai Jitpleecheep, the main protagonist, a Buddhist police detective with a classical education and the son of an ex-prostitute, Mother Nong, who now owns a brothel in Bangkok, \\"The Old Man's Club,\\" in partnership with Sonchai's \`oh-so-corrupt' Colonel Vikorn.The East and West, yin and yang, kindness and kinkiness continues. Burdett added a melange of Japanese tattooists, Muslim fundamentalists, American capitalists, street drugs, third world country corruption and of course, sex. It all starts with the macabre murder of a CIA agent in a room in his mother's brothel. What more could you want for the long flight to Bangkok?Is the book as good as \`Bangkok 8'? Almost. Though there is powerful mixture of images and insights, his romanticizing of the Thai society in direct contrast to his Yankeephobia is excessive. The \`Silence of the Lambs' spin-off is a given, and, unlike \`Bangkok 8', the pace of the writing flags somewhat, half way into the book. So? So nothing. This is still a highly enjoyable, hard to put down, read. Not for the squeamish. Strongly recommended.Sidenote: consider, as an additional book for your flight bag, the salubrious: 'Sightseeing: Stories' by a new Thai-American writer, Lapcharoensap. Lapcharoensap moves beyond the sex industry of Thailand, and though he doesn't sidestep the grit, the overcrowding, and the poverty within Thailand, he sees another side of Thailand that is nearer to Nirvana."},{"Title":"Bangkok Tattoo","review":"Detective Sonchai Jitpleecheep is back. The hero of Burdett's Bangkok 8 is once again called upon to use his wits and intuition to solve a baffling series of murders in Bangkok.While working at The Old Man's Club, Sonchai's mother's brothel, Chanya, the club's highest earner, is implicated in the murder of a CIA officer. Soon, an attempted cover-up unravels and conflict with the country's Muslim south is too possible. More CIA officers arrive, Sonchai reads Chanya's journal kept during her years in America, and a Japanese tattoo artist on the lam from the Japanese mafia appears. While trying to decipher the meaning behind it all, Sonchai walks a delicate balance between his Buddhist detachment and his ambition to rise in the police force.Burdett paints a vivid and lurid picture of life in Bangkok. Westerners in general and Americans in particular are depicted as louts at best and schizophrenic at worst. In Burdett's world, Americans have lost theirs souls by embracing the religion known as consumerism, where nothing matters but the continued accumulation of material possessions. In the meantime, they have sacrificed the attainment of anything more meaningful. At one point, Sonchai marvels at an act of extreme benevolence made by Chanya and rather plaintively says that she is a better Buddhist than he is. Americans, on the other hand, don't know who they are. They're a mass of psychotic tendencies. They don't know how to relax. They can't enjoy life because they're too busy pursuing a meaningless consumerist lifestyle, where much is bought but nothing is gained.By contrast, Thais are laid back. They, too, embody contradictions but do so willingly. By making conscious decisions about their lives, they can mitigate the karma that attaches to them by their wrong decisions. Something Americans are unable to do because they are unable to admit that they might be wrong about anything.It's a fascinating look at the seamier side of Thai life. As one who is visiting Thailand for the first time later this summer, I am eager to see this vital and thriving city. Burdett notes in a short postscript to his novel that most visitors to Bangkok have a wonderful vacation and never encounter the sex trade, drugs, or police corruption. That's a nice reassurance.&lt;em>Bangkok Tattoo&lt;/em> is a well-written, intricately plotted mystery, and it offers a bit more to the discerning reader. The end of the story nicely sets up the next installment. I hope that Burdett doesn't keep us waiting too long."},{"Title":"Bangkok Tattoo","review":"After reading this book, I sent copies to my 23- and 26-year old sons, who plan to go to Thailand for Christmas. I warned them that this might change their plans--they might just take the next flight out. This author is a real find. His characters are interesting and complex, and his love for the country and people is obvious. When I read a detective story, I don't want to be able to figure out the ending, but I want the author to be \\"fair\\"--not to point me to paths the story is never going to take just to keep me guessing.

One sniffs the self-loathing of the academic elite who somehow finds it enlightened to find fault with his own culture. The self-agrandizing subtext being that HE is immune from these trappings.As with the first novel, we find people killed by snakes (or eels), and a celebration of the freedom of the kah toey transexual life. It seems that Burdett had only one set of ideas, but took two novels to tell them in. If you've read the first, you've read the second. However, if you like the characters, you will enjoy them again here."},{"Title":"Bangkok Tattoo","review":"Don't waste your time, the author uses the word Farong about every other sentence.

There is a somewhat interesting description of Bangkok and it's seamier side, in fact I think that is the only side of Bangkok you will read about in this book.There is supposed to be a mystery here somewhere, but I didn't think it was worth my time to keep looking for it. Finally after about half way through I gave up. I was luckily able to sell my copy on Amazon at a small loss."},{"Title":"Bangkok Tattoo","review":"Depravity and anti-Americanism on virtually every page. At least up to page 54 where I gave up on it. Exotic locale not withstanding."},{"Title":"Bangkok Tattoo","review":"I went straight from the first novel in this apparent series, the thoroughly amazing _Bangkok 8,_ to this one, so all the richness of Burdett's portrayal of the city and its lower social layers was still fresh in my mind. The second book is equally good, though a bit different. Having established the milieu, the author is now free to pursue the complex plot without too many explanatory digressions. Detective Sonchai Jitpleecheep of the Royal Thai Police finds himself (against his better Buddhist judgment) handling the day-to-day operations of a successful new brothel established by his mother, a retired prostitute and nascent feminist (and a marvelous character). He's also besotted with Chanya, a very astute practitioner of sex-for-hire in his mother's operation, who (in the Thai way) is also somewhat innocent at heart. And Chanya was involved with Mitch Turner, a CIA operative in the southern, Islamic part of Thailand, who was also smitten with her. And Turner is now dead, in a particularly gruesome way, and apparently at Chanya's hand. Of course, simple investigation of the murder is not an option, given the CIA's habit of blowing things out of proportion, plus the Agency's conviction these days that every bad event in the world must be traced back to Al Qaida -- which could cause a religious civil war in Thailand. Besides, Sonchai's boss, the brilliantly corrupt Police Colonel Vikorn, is the majority stockholder in the brothel and he doesn't want to lose Chanya's services. But there's more! In fact, there are layers upon layers here, and (like the first book) you should read slowly to understand and savor each plot twist and social nuance. And I haven't even gotten to the business about the tattoos yet. The humor is delightful, the offhand descriptions of Bangkok are fascinating, and the background of a Buddhist society that succeeds in the mundane world by being very, very different from Euro-American culture is thoroughly intriguing. I shall be waiting eagerly for Sonchai's next appearance."},{"Title":"Bangkok Tattoo","review":"Eastern spirituality pervades this earthy, carnal Thai-set mystery, narrated by police detective Sonchai Jitleecheep, a devout Buddhist who also helps run his mother's business, a brothel geared to the Viagra set and financially backed by Sonchai's boss, Police Colonel Vikorn.The action begins with what seems a straightforward, if inexplicable and grisly, murder of a \\"farang\\" (foreign) customer, an American, by the brothel's biggest earner, beautiful, smart, tough Chanya. Playing a wily Watson to his brilliant, mercurial, gangster boss, Sonchai transcribes the statement Vikorn and Chanya have crafted, one that should satisfy the American authorities while absolving Chanya, who Sonchai hopelessly loves.But Mitch Turner is no ordinary American. He was CIA, sent to Bangkok in the aftermath of September 11. The local Muslims are worried, as well they should be, since the uncovering of a local Al Qaeda tie would be a feather of promotion in any agent's cap.Between the spies, the revelations and emerging complications concerning Chanya and the dead man, as well as the bloody developments in the ongoing feud between Vikorn and his military counterpart, drug Kingpin General Zinna, Sonchai nearly forgets the sudden email contact with his never-met American father.Zany, raunchy and sarcastic, Sonchai's energetic narration plunges through the dark, teeming streets of Bangkok with native skill and navigates contradictions with Buddhist aplomb. Surprises abound, skewing expectations in a pleasurably disorienting manner.Burdett, an Englishman who lives in Hong Kong, developed a strong interest in Theravada Buddhism, the type that is practiced in Thailand, and Sonchai's devotion creates a provocative paradox, given the story's level of violence, sex and corruption.Sonchai's mocking disrespect for \\"soulless\\" Western culture occasionally exhibits a particularly Western self-loathing, and his view of the Thai bar-girls as cheerful, well-respected sex workers sounds like familiar male romanticism but Burdett does it all with such wit and personality that few readers will be bothered. Well written and fast paced, this second in the series (after \\"Bangkok 8\\") offers a perspective on Southeast Asia and post 9/11 paranoia that is as challenging as it is stylish and entertaining.- Portsmouth Herald"},{"Title":"Bangkok Tattoo","review":"This is the second of John Burdett's novels featuring Detective Sonchai Jitpleechee of the Royal Thai Police. The son of a prostitute and a Vietnam-war era GI, and part owner of a Bangkok girlie-bar, Sonchai is the only honest cop in the city of drugs, sex and Buddhism. In Bangkok Tattoo, Sonchai investigates the macabre murder of a CIA agent, and stumbles into the morass of post-9/11 paranoia and ineptitude.I opened Bangkok Tattoo with huge anticipation. The first book in Burdett's series, Bangkok 8, staked out spectacularly fresh terrain in the police procedural genre.In Bangkok 8, Sonchai offers a uniquely jaundiced but somehow profoundly sympathetic guide to commerce and justice in the Thai capital. Bangkok 8's Sonchai Jitpleechee was a true descendent of all his illustrious homicide detective predecessors; though few of them have ever visited the places he goes in body, mind and spirit. Think Carl Hiassen on steroids and mindbenders and then some. Bangkok 8 was a book crying out for a sequel.But here's the rub. How do top something so truly original and genre bending? We all know the old Hollywood saw about sequels. Could Quentin Tarantino do a sequel to Pulp Fiction with Samuel Jackson, Ving Rhames, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis all playing the same characters, all doing more or less the same shtick? Or, think Get Shorty and Be Cool.Sadly, Bangkok Tattoo reads as if the publisher insisted on a quick cash-in sequel to Bangkok 8. The entire enterprise is shoddy. Burdett seems to have lost his narrative arc - this second book stumbles all over the place. The author's views on the hypocrisy and soulnessness of western culture, and of the ignorance and arrogance of American policy in Asia (all views which I share), are constantly shoved down the reader's throat. Just in case you don't get the point, you the reader are addressed as \`farang' (foreigner/barbarian) throughout. Sonchai himself has undergone a major personality transformation (gender transformation being a central theme of both Bangkok 8 and Bangkok Tattoo). The sensational and original plot and setting of Bangkok 8 are pushed beyond the realm of Asian camp to the simply ridiculous. Sonchai's didain for farang culture seems to mirror this book's disdain for the reader.This is evident not just in off-the-scale plot excess, but also in minimalist editing. Bangkok Tattoo is peppered with so many lapses of narrative and errors of fact that only a true fan of Bangkok 8 could persist to the end. A hunk of morphine found on a dead CIA agent morphs into heroin and back into morphine in just three pages (the distinction between the two is vital to the plot). Through the book, rock music provides the counterpoint to Sonchai's contempt for western culture - but the \`real' Sonchai would know that Eric Clapton never recorded a romantic song entitled \`Beautiful Tonight' (try \`Wonderful Tonight'). And while Elvis could well be alive and living in Sonchai's Bangkok, in no incarnation did he record a song called \`Nothing But a Hound Dog'. Burdett is wrong even on the silly detail of what types of airplanes were used in the terrorist attacks on 9/11.A good second (or fifteenth) police procedural should make the reader long to devour the first and every other book in the series (think of Henning Mankell's wonderful Kurt Wallander novels). Bangkok Tattoo comes nowhere close. But its predecessor, Bangkok 8, was so good that I am prepared to give John Burdett and Sonchai another chance. Let's hope they get their act together."},{"Title":"Bangkok Tattoo","review":"Sometimes a writer, just like an actor or athlete, reads to many of his own reviews and begins to believe them. Burdett has a talent for the understated satire, that the British do so well. The problem is that sometimes, the wrong person is editing a book and lets satire go over the line to clownishness.Unlike Bangkok 8, where Burdett showed the patients and soft touch of an artist (say a Van Gogh), in Bangkok Tattoo he's more like a housepainter trying to cover up a badly damaged wall. IMHO he doesn't understand that sometimes less is more.The stories here are almost inconsequential and he keeps trying to break through the 'fourth wall' like Groucho Marx winking at the audience. This work so much reminds me of Chevy Chase after he left SNL; in his subsequent movies, he spent way to much time mugging at the camera (like he was saying: Look how funny I am).Burdett spends a lot of time saying look how cynical, but funny and dryly witty I can be. Oh Yeah! For a Brit ex-pat he seems to take a great relish in making fun of the American's. I guess that in the part of Bangkok he hangs out in there aren't any drunken Brits, Aussies or Kiwis...wonder which part that is?John..go back and read the first book before you think of writing a third...and don't."},{"Title":"Bangkok Tattoo","review":"I picked up Burdett's first thriller, Bangkok 8, prior to a trip to Thailand and found it brimming with atmosphere but somewhat disappointing in the plot department and marred by a painfully bad ending. This sequel is similarly atmospheric and similarly disappointing. We are reintroduced to Thai police officer Sonchai Jitpleecheep as he manages his mother's bar/brothel on Bangkok's legendary Soi Cowboy. The establishment -- which caters to aging Westerners and opened in the previous book -- has not been the golden goose his mother hoped for and is barely breaking even. So when the joint's top earner, Chanya, is found covered in blood in a nearby hotel room with a castrated and flayed American, Sonchai and his boss (who is also part owner of the brothel), police Col. Vikorn, move quickly to remedy the situation. Here, the murder \\"mystery\\" framework is an excellent vehicle for conveying just how different the Thai culture is from the West. They know the woman couldn't have committed the murder because the desecration of the corpse just isn't in line with Thai psychology, but their efforts aren't directed at solving the murder so much as deflecting any attention from it.Vikorn quickly decides to sweep the matter under the rug and enlists Sonchai's help in creating a semi-plausible \\"self-defense\\" confession for the girl and a quick and clean disposal of the body. Unfortunately, it turns out the American was a CIA agent working in Thailand's southern provinces, keeping an eye out for extremist Muslims. Soon CIA agents show up looking for their missing man and Sonchai is sent South, ostensibly to get the lay of the land and try and figure out if maybe al-Qaeda is somehow involved. This is all pretty absurd (particularly the notion that the CIA would send a blond musclehead to lurk in provincial Muslim towns), but it does provide the chance to see a different part of Thailand.However this is just the tip of the iceberg, as there are plenty of other subplots revolving around Sonchai. Most dangerous of these is the increasingly lethal feud between Vikorn and his army nemesis, General Zinna, for control of a portion of the heroin trade. Then there is the question of Chanya's past, which includes a year in the United States, and how that might relate to the CIA agent's murder. There is also the question of Sonchai's feelings for Chanya -- are they love or lust? And then there's Sonchai's long-lost father, an American GI whom he's never met and is making plans to come to Thailand for a visit. And lets not forget the mysterious Japanese master tattooist... There's simply far too much going on, and the book lurches around awkwardly from storyline to storyline and major elements (such as Vikorn's feud with Zinna) simply disappear at times.In addition to keeping track of all these threads, one also has to buy into Sonchai's ability to see people's past lives when he first meets them, and his obtaining clues through dreams of his dead partner. These elements end up feeling like more of an unnecessary gimmick than anything else. Another somewhat awkward device is the use of direct address to the reader by Sonchai, which really takes one out of the moment, as well as a pervasive sneering tone toward \\"farangs\\" (ie. foreigners). This gets old fast, and it reads like some kind of overcompensation by farang author Burdett, as Sonchai paints all Westerns as bumbling, soulless idiots.Ultimately, one wishes that Burdett had concentrated on one or two storylines and worked at making them plausible. The rivalry between Vikorn and Zinna, for example, could have made a great plot all on its own. Instead it gets lost in the shuffle and very perfunctorily resolved. Perhaps worst of all was the confirmation of my suspicion that the motive behind the murder of the CIA man was a heavily recycled one. It's actually a plot I've come across THREE TIMES previously: first in Roald Dahl's short story \\"Skin\\", then in a Akimitsu Takagi's Japanese crime novel \\"The Tattoo Murder Case\\", and lastly, in a recent German film called \\"Tattoo.\\"What was fresh in Bangkok 8 has grown stale here. Yes, there's still good Thai atmosphere, but that's about it -- and much of it is the same as the previous book. The plotting is muddled, the pacing is terrible and the overall effect is more yawn-inducing than thrilling. I don't think I'll be back for another visit to Sonchai's Bangkok."},{"Title":"Bangkok Tattoo","review":"I read Burdett's predecessor to this story, Bangkok 8, and thoroughly enjoyed it. In it, Royal Thai Police Detective Sonchai Jitpleecheep investigates the murder of a U.S. marine by method of poisonous snakes. Sonchai's best friend is killed and Sonchai begins a relentless search for the killer. The story provides a fascinating tour of the Bangkok sex industry and the corrupt Bangkok police. The fact that Sonchai is a pious Buddhist makes the story even more enthralling. At one point, when he is whizzing through the crowded Bangkok streets on the back of a kamikaze motorcycle taxi, Sonchai remarks how he almost wishes the motorcycle would crash so that he would be liberated from the decay of human existence and be reunited with his friend. I only rehash the plot to Bangkok 8 because it was so much better than Bangkok Tattoo.Bangkok Tattoo meanders pointlessly through a murder investigation of an American Intelligence Agent. When it appears that the murder was committed by a whore who works for the brothel owned by Sonchai's mother, Sonchai and his boss Colonel Vikorn manufacture a self-defense story. This brings in parties from both the CIA and the Muslim world to investigate. Both want to ensure that the killing wasn't a terrorist act. The plot relies on several coincidences and even worse on amateurish oversight on the part of Sonchai. At one point he simply loses a computer hard drive and at another he finally remembers to read the diary the whore has given him, both of which would have allowed him to solve the mystery hundreds of pages before he does.Absent from this novel are the frenetic pace and sense of urgency that permeated Bangkok 8. With Bangkok 8, the plot required us to examine the depths of human degeneracy. In Bangkok Tattoo, the plot is merely an excuse to examine it. It's pretty clear to me that this novel was written just because the last one was such a success and Burdett wanted to cash in again using the same characters. He really should have waited until he thought of a better plot because for me the characters failed to carry the book. I would be hard pressed to purchase another of his novels."},{"Title":"Bangkok Tattoo","review":"After thoroughly enjoying Bangkok 8 I was excited to ready Bangkok Tattoo. I found Tattoo to be a boring read, not in the \\"action\\" so much as in it's lack of depth or new creativity by the author. I felt that the author wrote this book because he did so darn well on the first one and wanted to cash in on his previous success (I can't blame him for that). Hence, the book lacked originality and I felt that Mr Burdett, like a chef simply repeating a dish over and over again, was dishing up the same gangster, foreign spies, prostitute, drug recipe in bangkok simply as a recipe, not as a new and creative masterwork. I would have liked to have seen a more inspired and creative storyline instead of another familiar romp in seedy bangkok again by the detective who has a great personality."},{"Title":"Bangkok Tattoo","review":"I can distinctly remember picking up Bangkok 8 on a lark back at the Stanford campus bookstore during the 2003 Summer Session. There it sat, enticing me with the promise of exotic mystery in faraway lands. When I devoured it soon after (nothing like a good mystery during a summer day of leisure), I eagerly awaited the next time I'd encounter Sonchai Jitpleecheep, a Royal Thai Policeman operating in the District 8.Sad to say, Sonchai has changed. Our narrator can't resist taking a multitude of jabs at us farang (foreigners) and our materialistic, puritanical, soulless, and hypocritical culture. This could just be Burdett just estimating what attitudes are like over in Thailand at the moment, but one gets the sense that he's putting words in Sonchai's mouth. I'll be the first to admit that this stridency can get to be a little irritating.Other than that, I've few complaints. Like the first novel, Bangkok Tattoo is positively drenched with atmosphere. Seeing as it takes place in District 8, the underbelly of a already slightly seedy place, one has to be prepared for all sorts of shady characters and bizarre events. The graphic parts can be a little off putting, but, hey, this is a murder mystery after all. And another good summer read, to boot."},{"Title":"Bangkok Tattoo","review":"Burdett's series are unique, often funny thrillers and eccentrically violent, with tight plotlines, great characterization--his boss, Captain Vikorm for example, and Ptichai, his side kick who is a katoey-- and totally unexpected twists. He even manages to weave in Buddhism with a light touch because it permeates Thai thinking and therefore actions. Really knows his Bangkok and the erotic/sexual explicitness that is a theme of his books suggests an inside knowledge. I've read them all now and wish there were more. I thought Bangkok Haunts pretty amazing. And how I wish I could go &#34;kitkai&#34; once in a while."},{"Title":"Bangkok Tattoo","review":"Me thinks John Burdett went off the deep end with karma, reincarnation, Buddhism, and the like to weave an unbelievable tale of detective fantasy.

Bierce wrote of how man was not the most dominant species on the planet and one only needed to look at how the Earth was set up for definitive proof. Most of the world is under water, another huge chunk is either frozen tundra or desert wasteland, and the parts that are habitable are the most susceptible to natural disasters, dangerous animals and deadly diseases. I was hooked and it took me 14 long years before I finally got a hold of this book. I must say that I am not dissapointed. I usually have trouble reading 19th Century writers, but Bierce is, surprisingly, very accessible. His is an acerbic wit and his tongue is lined with acid. Bierce has tendency of most writers from the 1800's to get a little long winded and is too easily impressed by his own skills with wordplay. In spite of that, however, his stories still connect and his venomous jabs at his opponents (pretty much anyone and everyone) still sting. His best works are his supernatural and Civil War stories. There's only about 15 in all contained withing the book, but, man are they awesome. Chikamauga resonates most, with its tale of a young boy who gets caught up in a Civil War battle, only to think that it's play-time. As Bierce was actually involved in the Civil War, his stories carry the weight of authenticity and the settings are evoked to perfection. Also included are his collected short pieces, The Devil's Dictionary, best described as a cynic's definition of common words, and Write It Right, Bierce's satirical asides on common improper usages of language (Bierce was a bit of stickler for such things.) One flaw I found in the book was with the editor, Brian St. Pierre, who seems to not take Bierce seriously enough and whose own dull, politically-correct opinions, pepper his prefaces to each chapter. Moving along, Bierce's short essays and articles on everything, from politicians to lawyers to religion to women, are the next best section of the book. Some of it is a little hard to relate to as most of the figures he attacks are long forgotten, but the sentiment is still there and well understood. Appearantly, there's a biography out, entitled Ambrose Bierce: Alone In Bad Company that is probably a great companion piece to this book, except I can't totally recommend it, as I haven't read it yet, but it may be of great interest and easier to find than this book. In a nutshell, there's one nugget of writing that carries more insight into what Bierce is about than I can possibly explain here and it reads like a parable: ''You are a beast of war'', said the Sheep to the Lion ''yet, men go gunning for you. Me, a believer in non-resistance, they do not hunt.'' ''They do not need to,'' replied the son of the desert; ''they can breed you.''"},{"Title":"Dracula Unborn","review":"I have read this book as part of the trilogy, \\"Dracula Lives!\\", which also includes Tremayne's other novels \\"The Revenge of Dracula\\" and \\"Dracula, My Love\\".The basis of this story is, that the author obtained a manuscript at a London street market (of which, this novel is a supposed transcript), that turned out to have been written by no-lesser a personality than Prof. Abraham Van Helsing himself (a prominent character in Bram Stoker's novel, \\"Dracula\\".).That manuscript, in turn, is a translation of a memoir by Mircea, the son of Vlad Dracula, and his encounter with his family in what is present-day Romania.What then follows is basically a retread of Jonathan Harker's journey to Transylvania and other scenes from Bram Stoker's book, but set over four hundred years previous. There is even a Van Helsing substitute, in the form of Brother John; a Cornish monk.Tremayne includes quite a bit of research into the text, which kind of detracts from the story itself, as these bits of information seems a bit forced.Despite the amount of work that has clearly gone into the research, there are a couple of errors I have spotted. Take, for example, the term \\"mesmerise\\" (more commonly known as \\"hypnotise\\" these days) is used. The term was named after Anton Mesmer, renowned for the skill in the EIGHTEENTH century, and, ironically enough, the term \\"vampire\\" itself, which also didn't enter popular usuage until the aforementioned era.On the plus side, the story moved along at a fast pace, and I really liked the scene with Brother John and Mircea (or \\"Michelino\\" as he is known to himself and others) are trapped inside a bedroom in Castle Dracula with a vampire woman on the other side of the door, trying to get in.The origins of Dracula's vampirism is also given an inventive, occultish twist.In the end, though, I'd only really recommend this book for the die-hard vampire fan, or, just for an entertaining, albeit fairly forgettable, read for others."},{"Title":"A Writer's Notebook","review":"This quasi-journal of Maugham's thoughts, travels, philosophies and bits of literature is facinating on several levels.

It took months. It was 600 bloviating pages. It was painful at some points, and thought-provoking at others. The book certainly has its upside. Perlman is a truly talented writer in many aspects. He writes beautiful expository prose. The language he uses is lush and thick and wonderful. The problem is I don't often associate those qualities with hookers. You see, one of the characters in Seven Types of Ambiguity is a hooker who is apparently working her way through a Harvard docotoral program, because she, like all of the characters possesses a voice that his highly intelligent, capable of making and understanding the most obscure literary references, and extremely insightful about herself and the world at large. Think Dawson's Creek for the intellectual set. I hate to say it, but I like my fictional hookers sassy and trashy. Sure, give me the hooker-with-the-heart-of-gold vis-a-vis Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman every so often, but in general I expect my hookers to be... well, hookers. Of course, Angelique is only one example of a character whose character does not match her persona. All of the characters, as many critics have cited, use the same exact voice. The voice, one would assume, of Perlman.

Each character needs to have a distinct voice, and they don't. They all sound pretty much the same.The last section left me somewhat confused.

The characters are believable and complex. My feelings for them changed continuously. The many conversations about psychology, literature and jazz are engaging, and they flow in the story.

Still, I enjoyed this enough to try his other novels."},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"I agree with the review that stated that Perlman seemed to want to impress us with his vast knowledge rather than write a gripping or interesting story that moved along. I did think the ending made it worth the excruciating, plodding prose with the nice little wrap-up twist, which seemed almost mundane given how \\"out there\\" he tried to be with the rest of the structure of the novel. I read constantly, so I'd say it was worth the read to add to my knowledge of what I do and don't like; the concept seemed so promising, and maybe in another's hands, could have been so much more interesting.

I couldn't keep my interest during long stretches."},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"This book made me want to be kinder and more sensitive; not because I want to impress people, but because it will ease the suffering of those already in pain. I'm pleased that I was able to finish it; there is such a powerful reward at the end. Its a reward that has life-changing effects."},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"This is a book about human relationships, love and obsession. It tells the story from the point of view of a number of people, all connected to an event, the kidnapping of a child. It gives a beautiful insight into the characters and their motivations. It raises a number of ethical and moral issues. A very gifted author and, like his earlier book Three Dollars, this is the kind of book that you would love to read in one sitting, as it is almost impossible to put it down once you start reading it."},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"Simon, an unemployed, highly intellectual teacher drops out of life - more or less - only to become more and more unhinged as he stalks his ex-girlfriend. It doesn't sound like a love story, but that's just what Seven Types of Ambiguity is: a dysfunctional love story, which operates on many different levels. The plot, in brief (and there's nothing brief about this 600 page book), is this: Simon, who has never gotten over Anna, his university girlfriend, hatches a plan to kidnap her son, Simon - seemingly to get her attention. Thus begins a series of seven interconnected stories, each told by various narrators. Simon, it turns out, is involved with a prostitute named Angelique; as fate would have it, Angelique is also servicing Anna's successful broker husband, Joe. Anna's marriage is a sham, Joe's experiencing a Bonfire of the Vanities-type meltdown, Angelique is in love with Simon and thrown into the mix is a psychiatrist who seems to have a relationship with most of them. It sounds confusing, but it's worth sticking with. What unfolds in this novel is a compelling story about love, obsession, attraction and the ugly truths that surface in most real-life relationships. It's like reading a thesis in dysfunction, and all its convoluted by-products.Taking note of some of the previous posters, this is not a book without flaws, but that's only because Perlman is a wildly ambitious novelist. His language - beautiful, evocative - tangles the reader up in its sentences, in a good way. There are so many entrancing things about this novel, and it is such a triumph, that you can forgive Perlman the minor missteps. Of course, with a set-up like that, this book is inherently devastating, and it's a strong reader who won't be shaken by its core by the end. It's worth the immersion. This is a wonderful, literary, gripping, authentic book that will stay with the reader long after its conclusion."},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"There aren't many books out there that make you want to set everything else aside, and read, read, read! This is one of those books! It's long -- over 600 pages -- but it definitely doesn't feel like it. I loved the shifting perspective and interesting characters. I also liked how the stories overlapped at critical moments. Perlman is clearly a very gifted and intelligent writer, and I can't give him enough praise. Who would have thought the story of an out-of-work teacher, a stockbroker, a prostitute, and a psychiatrist would be so interesting! This is definitely one that will make you think about \\"obsessive love\\" and \\"obsessive materialism\\" in ways that you may not have before. I loved the \\"ambiguity\\" found in these interpersonal relationships as well as the characters' own motivations and understanding of the world. This is not a black-and-white world, so why should literature be? Subtlety is the name of the game. So good!!!"},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"Intriguing tale has the reader sitting the heads and looking out the eyes of the various characters at the tangled and distraught lives as events layer in. I was captivated by this book."},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"I am confused by the range of ratings for this book. It is odd how some reviewers think the book is wonderful and others, a few at least, find great fault. I found this book very hard to stay interested in because it lacks some of the narrative qualities that I like. There is no physical description in the book, or little to none at best. I don't go in for a lot of gratuitous description, but Perlman gives no clear idea of what any of these characters look like or what their houses look like or their towns. I think one can figure out the setting is various places in Australia, but I feel lack of physical details is a tremendous flaw in the story.In several places Perlman confuses essay with narrative. I personallly found the \\"essay\\" on deconstruction interesting because of my interest in literary criticism, but the purpose of that section of the book eludes me. I suspect other readers would be as confused by this digression into deconstruction as I was about other digressions into health care, card counting, etc.I would go as far as to suggest that Mitch's chapter is completely extraneous. I'm not sure what that whole chapter adds to the story. It does allow for a big sum of money to enter the plot which is needed at the end of the story, but other than that, Mitch is confusing to the story. If someone can offer an opinion to enlighten me, I would sincerely appreciate it.Not a good book. Not one I'd recommend. I did finish it, so it gets a second star, but this book is an unsuccessful experiment."},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"Oh, the relief. I've just, finally, finished this book. I bought it because I read a complimentary review, and the idea seemed an interesting one. Indeed, it was interesting, even if it was not executed with much skill. But what really aggravated me about this book was the endless parade of the author's knowledge. What an insufferable show-off the man must be. The reader is forced to wade through pages and pages of irrelevant arcana whose only purpose is to show how much Perlman knows. The plot is put on hold while we struggle through detailed accounts of how to count cards in blackjack, the exact meaning of hearsay, and countless abstruse literary references. The fact that we are subjected to over 600 pages of this stuff suggests that there is no end to the author's self-regard. Where's a decent editor when you need one?My other principal criticism of the book is the utterly moribund dialogue. Some of Perlman's other writing is fine; some is good. But he cannot write convincing dialogue. Someone has obviously told him otherwise, however, as large parts of this book are entirely dialogue, without so much as a \\"he said\\" for relief. As a result of this contrivance, conversations ended up being repaeated verbatim through someone else's mouth - very messy and not well thought out. And people simply don't talk in the way his characters do. All of the characters had pretty much the same voice, too, which was an opportunity lost and betrays the writer's limitations. Oh yes, endless profanity does not make dialogue convincing or interesting, either.Still, the book was nothing if not ambitious in its scope. For that he gets a second star."},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"The central incident in \\"Seven Types of Ambiguity\\" is a kidnapping by an unemployed and somewhat dissolute man named Simon of a boy named Sam. Sam is the son of a stock dealer named Joe and his wife Anna; the latter was formerly Simon's girlfriend. At the time of the kidnapping, a prostitute named Angela is Simon's current girlfriend and also has Joe as a once a week client.The events leading up the kidnapping, and the criminal trial and other consequence that follow, are brought out in the narratives of seven characters: (1) Alex, Simon's shrink; (2) Joe; (3) Angela; (4) Mitch, a business colleague of Joe's; (5) Simon; (6) Anna; and (7) a daughter of Alex.The seven episodes gradually move the story from start to finish, but with many flashbacks, digressions, and side stories (notably a disastrous business deal that gets Joe and Mitch fired). Some incidents come up three or four times in the course of the book, extending its length considerably.There are numerous literary allusions, including discussion of a book of the same title, by William Empson, that is apparently an esoteric treatise on the subtlety and ambiguity of written language. The assumption that readers will be familiar with Empson's book seems a bit presumptuous, but worse than that Perlman does not do much with the ambiguity theme after introducing it.The individual narratives are generally quite clear, in some cases graphically so. Such differences as emerge between the various narratives are more a matter of emphasis than interpretation. The failure to use a common set of names for the main characters is merely annoying.Perlman's writing is polished and expressive. I loved his description of an executive retreat at Joe and Mitch's company, for instance, at which an overpaid charlatan provides ludicrous team building and self-actualization drills. The descriptions of courtroom action were also well above average.On the other hand, it is not easy to identify with the values that are promoted.* How can it be that Simon emerges as the most admirable character in the book, after sitting around for 10 years drinking and feeling sorry for himself and then committing a serious criminal act without any good reason for doing so?* Why is it that every person who enters into a \\"normal\\" marriage, holds down a real job, etc. is depicted as shallow, selfish and miserably unhappy?* What purpose is served by all the generalized assertions about the evils of managed care (structural rationalization of healthcare to hold down costs), the merits of socialism, etc.?So enjoy the ride, if you are into books that probe human motivations deeply, but do not expect an inspiring conclusion."},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"\\"With the thoughts I'm a thinkin' I could be another Lincoln, if I only had a brain.\\" sang the scarecrow. And that's what it sounded like to me, when each of the characters \\"spoke\\" in eloquent, similar, educated prose about his or her role in the melange of seven sides of a coin that comprise this book. Each character would have said what Perlman writes if only he had the intelligence to do so. Unrequited love? Maybe, but not presumptuous, because by the time I read the first sententence, I was caught in the intrigue of non-linear development of the ambiguity Perlman illustrates by the dysfunctional connections of his characters. Japanese writing--and language--is like this, too, with non-linear thoughts and images. The book was a delight to read, thought-provoking and wise."},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"Lord knows I love to read, but finding the time to do so can be harder than it should. I purchased \`Seven Types of Ambiguity' having no idea what it was about but I had read a short review praising its style and prose and so I decided to give it a try. I have owed it for almost a year and up until this month I had yet to open it to the first page. Looking at its 600+ pages I have to admit I was quite a bit intimidated.When it comes to reading you can find one of two books, the one that is so engrossing you finish it in days (Little Children) or the one that is so daunting and time consuming you spend months (House of Sand and Fog, which I swear I will finish one day, but after struggling for a year I don't know when). I can honestly say that \`Seven Types of Ambiguity' is written so well and is so engrossing that I flew through its 600+ pages and was still waiting for more.I've decided to give you a little rundown of its seven parts so you, the reader, know what you're in for.Part One:In the first part of this novel we have a letter written to a woman named Anna by a man named Alex. Alex is a psychiatrist who has been seeing Anna's ex-boyfriend Simon. In this letter Alex is explaining to Anna Simon's current situation, some of which Anna is already is aware of, which include his obsession with her still, nine years after their relationship ended. Simon has since then lost his teaching job due to a scandal involving child abduction and upon slipping into depression he has fallen out of touch with his overbearing and overcritical parents and falling into an unwanted relationship with a prostitute named Angelique who has been servicing Anna's husband Joe for quite a while now. In a bought of desperation, or a serious lapse in sanity, Simon kidnaps Anna's six-year-old son Sam only to be turned in and arrested. At the end of his letter it becomes apparent that Alex seriously wants Anna to consider lying in order to save the man she once loved.Part Two:In the second part we get a glimpse into the mind of Joe, Anna's husband. He's racked with this pang of distress wondering if his wife has been having an affair with the man that kidnapped his son and this weighs heavy on the way he treats and reacts to her in general. He justifies throughout this section his relationship with Angelique, claiming that it's his wife's fault for neglecting his needs. We get a glimpse of his life, his job, his intellect and his insecurities before the section closes and part three begins.Part Three:Part three is told by Angelique and it picks up right where Joe left off. Throughout this part we get a history of her childhood and her strained relationship with her parents. He hear of the rape that almost pushed her into prostitution and we hear of the illness she battles with that makes it hard for her to truly give into anyone for fear of what they'll think of her. After Simon's arrest Angelique is faced with decisions not only affect her but Simon and Joe as well. Depending on what she admits to in front of the police will determine who gets the blame for this episode. The police officers interrogate and force false testimony on her, and then eventually she gets an offer, one that not disgusts her not only because of its nature but because even she knows it's her only option.Part Four:Here we have a conversation between Dennis, Joes partner and supposed friend, and Alex as Dennis confesses all the facets of his life that make him a complete and utter mess. He goes into his doomed business relationship with Joe and everything about Joe that makes him now despise him. He confesses the train-wreck that was his marriage and how it was over almost before it began. He then goes into his relationship with Angelique and how she's the reason he's now seeing Alex, how he needs Alex in order to help Angelique, the only woman who made him feel wanted and needed and worth something.Part Five:Now we come to Simon's side of the story, imprisoned and awaiting his fate we get a glimpse of his reasoning behind matters and all that he hopes to gain from his supposed mistakes. His reaction to everyone else's reactions is notably amusing and enlightening, and it's here that we really get to see how Simon almost disregards everyone else's feelings and even their loyalty in an attempt to connect with the one who may not even what him, the one who, in the wise words of Simon's psychiatrist Alex, failed him.Part Six:Anna is now our narrator, and by examining her thoughts on the proceeding days that involve the trial and her encounter with Simon, as well as her memories of her time spent with him all those years ago, we can finally understand his love and obsession with her, and we finally come to know whether or not she will in fact return those feelings. We see her feelings on her husband, her child, her life in general and her relationship, past and present, with Simon. It's here where a lot of questions are answered.The final part, part seven, is one that I will not breakdown for it's here that the bulk of the ambiguity's are answered, and it's an experience that the reader should receive full hand and not be slighted by the reviewer with a big mouth. So sit back, set some time aside and read one of the most engrossing and entertaining and enlightening novels to be written in a very long time."},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"I think the last time I was so impressed with a novel was when I read David Mitchell's \\"Ghostwritten\\". This was published at the very end of 2004 and for me it's the best of last year and probably this year as well. Billed as \\"an epic novel about obsessive love in an age of obsessive materialsim\\", the basic thrust of the story is about a man who never having gotten over a woman who left him ten years before, kidnaps her son.The brilliance of the novel is in it's construction. The book is segmented in seven parts, each narrated by a different player in the unfolding drama with sections and scenes overlapping in a 'Rashomon' like narrative. The only criticism I have with the book echos other reviewers, that many of the characters voices are similar. They all seem cut from the same Mensa cloth,being incredibly insightful,bright,and in tune with the human condition regardless of age, sex, or social standing.However as criticisms go, it's a small one, and one that doesn't detract from the awesome magnitude or scope of what I think is a phenomenal piece of literature."},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"Every now and then, a novel comes along that is so masterful, so breathtaking in scope, that everything you read afterwards pales in comparison. This is such a book.The author employs seven narrators, all of whom ultimately impact each others' lives. Each character is fleshed out so that the reader knows him or her through and through...right down to interior thoughts. One can only imagine the research Mr. Perlman had to go through to \\"get it right\\" -- from investment banking to gambling...from prostitution to literary matters...from psychiatry to research analyst. If there is a false note in any of these narratives, I wasn't able to detect it.The novel, seemingly, is about the trial of Simon, an unemployed teacher who, in a fit of obsessive love, kidnaps the son of Anna, the woman he has worshiped for many years. In reality, each character in this novel is going through his or her own trial. Each will end up in a different place than when the narration began. Each will go through the harshest judge of all -- himself or herself; some will make it, some will not.There is, indeed, ambiguity in literature, as there is in relationships and life in general. This novel can be read as a pure page-turner or it can be read for deeper meaning. I closed the book understanding a little more about myself. It is a rare book that allows the reader to do that."},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"This daring and intriguing novel was my favorite of 2004. Australian author Elliot Perlman has chosen to tell his story from seven different points of view-not a new idea, but one that seems completely fresh and surprising in Perlman's hands. The characters he chooses as his narrators and the voices he gives them are what propels \\"Seven Types\\" ahead to an end that comes all too soon for the besotted reader. The publisher's tag line deeming this \\"an epic novel about obsessive love in an age of obsessive materialism\\" does not do it any sort of justice. This novel is about much more than that and should not be missed."},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"I read this book months ago, and I still think about its message every day. It is very difficult to catogorize as evidenced by the other book reviews. It is a love story, social commentary, extremely political novel that requires concentration when reading.Only one person has given this book a bad review, and he has a good point. The different chapters that are different points of view are in the same writing style. However, I don't know if the author of that review really realizes how difficult writing in different styles is (ever try Faulkner? That is fun reading isn't it?) I feel that the author did this deliberately in order to depict his message in unconfusing ways. Yes, the characters do not talk as people do in real life. (That is why I read books, personally; I don't like the way people talk in real life). It is gothic in style and magnificent in its scope. I think it is one of the best books I have ever read."},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"The book is written from the perspective of seven different parties who were all somehow involved in an incident that impacted each of their lives fairly drastically. The unexpected pleasure of this book is that we get to know the characters and their thoughts and actions not only through their own perspective and section in the book, but through each of the other characters and their thoughts. Here is a beautiful female in love with a man she hopes loves her, but when we read from his perspective, she is barely mentioned and we find he is obsessed with one of the other female characters. It's a writing trick that lets us see the whole character and understand the whole story, as powerfully different as seeing something in 3d instead of two 2d, or stereo instead of mono.The book is full of the important and relevant things in life such as the power of young love, relationships with parents, communicating, learning and philsophizing with other students in college, how another student can almost overpower another with intelligence, leadership and sex appeal. We see intelligent people who love someone so much that they are willing to do things that are wrong to help him or her. And we see the pain husbands and wives can cause each other when they aren't able to take time to love and understand.Enjoy each section of the book and understand each personality. There is gold hidden throughout. We're never given information too fast. We discover the information gradually and sometimes not until we understand a character who is revealed three sections further into the book.It all comes together in the seventh section in an extremely subtle and well thought out seventh character. What a great book and great ending.Turow, Grisham, Patterson, you've got new competitor. A fellow barrister. Read his book and get nervous."},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"Perlman's epic is superbly written and once more we are re-introduced to Joe Gergahty from his earlier (and occasionally as good) debut novel, \\"Three Dollars.\\" For fellow Finance professionals any reader will quickly develop an affinity for Joe and Mitch and their time at the Corporate Retreat will bring back fond memories. The time invested in reading is paid back tenfold as I often found myself doubling back on sentences merely to saviour their construction or the clarity in which he'd captured the moment. I have often found books like this off-putting becuase soon as you become absorbed in a character they move on to another but Perlman's writing style pulls you in quickly and ensures the rythmn and pace of the story never let up. This is a beautifully written book which ranks as one of my own personal best ever reads ... I recommend it to everyone I know."},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"The premise of the book seems fairly straightforward- a man living his life in love with a woman who left him a decade ago, so deeply entrenched in her world that one day out of the blue he picks her son up from school to save him from his parents bad marraige. Simon sees his act as benevolent, the world sees it as a felony.What makes it so intriguing is the perspective...7 chapters in 7 voices, all unraveling the puzzle in time. Perhaps the author suceeds most in making Simon both believable and sympathetic. He is incredibly talented in nailing down relationship dynamics, mostly the difficulties, and in describing love at its most desperate and therefore sincere.Be prepared for a lot of discourse on many a topic ranging from managed care to poetry. The ONLY flaw is that the author is possibly TOO pedantic in his lectures(esp. with Simon) but it feels real to the character and is tolerable.In Summary- an incredible book with extremely well developed characters."},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"Like another reviewer, I too had owned Seven Types of Ambiguity for over a year, not knowing anything about it beside some faint positive rumblings that my cultural antannae (they are removable) picked up. What I found when I finally decided to open the covers was an amazement.The story whisks the reader along like a fast ride at a carnival. There is a hint of a crime drama about it, especially during the extremely convincing trial scenes. But the author was able to dissect the lives of his characters with a surgical scalpel right down to the bone. And in doing so, the society in which they lived was also laid open with Austen-esque brilliance. The end result was a chilling, depressing, scathing, riveting view of their world. By the way, their world, Melbourne could easily have been any number of other exurban locations. There was very little reference to place.For me, the separate passages were distinct and each character had their own voice. The novel itself had a somber tone and I felt as though it were being spoken softly from behind a curtain. Also, I do not agree with the \\"Roshomon\\" analogies, for there, each retelling of the story was dramatically different from the previous version, to the extent of disagreeing on essential facts, colors, numbers. Here, I found that the characters were in agreement about what had happened. Instead, it was stated through the lens of their personal choices and priorities. The impact of the key events and the psychological reverberations were different for each character.Also, I found the character of Joe to be one of the most starkly drawn and powerful characters I have experienced in a long time. There were a few scenes from the collapse of his and Anna's marriage that I found myself flinching as I was reading. I could not stop reading, and yet, I felt as though I had put my ear against a wall and was listening to my neighbors fighting. Joe was elaborately nasty with very few redeeming qualities and extremely well drawn.This was easily one of the best novels I have read in the past 12 months or longer. The first section of the novel alone is worthy of inclusion among the \\"great works\\" of fiction. I highly recommend it. Don't be bothered by the number of pages. You will want it to be longer."},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"Perlman masters the art of drawing the reader in, not simply toward a single narrator, but to seven. Each unique, lively, and independent, their common threads extend beyond the story and into unlit corners of our own unexplored morality and unrecognized obsessions.More remarkable than his ability to reveal something innately both universal and personal in Simon, the primary protagonist, without needing to appeal to our sympathy, is the revelation that he is perhaps more hero than anti-hero, having been worthy of our greatest emotions all along.The first story I've encountered in a long time where the thrill is in the shocking revelation of good, this is without contention the best work written in 2003, the best work published in the US in 2005, and the best book you'll read for a long time whenever you do."},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"Mr. Perlman is to be commended on a splendid work of fiction. One of the canned reviews suggested the book has too many plot lines, but the multiplicity of perspectives makes for a wonderful read. This is not a book to be half-read, for if the reader doesn't finish (and there are twenty page or so in the middle that will cause the reader to wonder \\"where are we going?) they will miss a touching end. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"This is literally the best book I've ever read. I was introduced to Elliot Perlman during a stint in Australia, and was still blown away despite very much enjoying his other works."},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"Here is the story of a man obsessed with a woman, so obsessed that he kidnaps her child with disasterous consequences for all. Simon, the obsessive lover, sets many lives into a fult tilt boogie with his act and opens Anna's eyes as to what part he actually played in her life. The author delves heavily into the idea of ambiguity over and over and mainly, he's talking about the ambiguity of relationships and how differently each one of us sees our own relationships. If you like psychology and philosophy mixed into a great story with great characters, you won't be disappointed. The writing is first rate; my only qualm is that all the characters' voices sound very similar but that's really a small quibble."},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"This is one of those rare books that dazzles you with its style and construction, but manages to never be heavy-handed or predictable. On the contrary, it pulls you in and holds you, riveted, until the end. And the conclusion itself will leave you breathless. Perlman touches on many critical human relationships: those between adults and their aging parents, between adults and their young children, between siblings, between lovers, between FORMER lovers, between physician and patient, between attorney and client, . . . The scope of his consideration of the human condition is staggering and remarkably effective. This book is a compelling journey that is at once entertaining and illuminating. Truly, it is the best thing I've read in years."},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"Elliot Perlman's ambitious project describes seven people under stress. They are connected one to another in a variety of circumstances and types of relationship. They bring to that connection the whole of their experience and environment and genetic predispositions. Perhaps then it's no wonder their perceptions of the character of that connectedness differ so widely.A number of reviewers have criticised the homogeneity of voices; some have criticised the intellectualising dialogue; others have said the conversational style of the characters is stilted and unrealistic. I think these aspects of the book are amongst its strengths. For each character, within a couple of pages, I could identify someone I know. I know some corporate sharks, ruthless and brutal. I know self-styled intellectuals, prepared to lose much in the goal to always be right. I know self-doubting psychiatrists and principled women with MS. To my eyes, Perlman has portrayed real people. I even recognise much of the cadence in the dialogue - people really do talk this way when they know what they're going to say. Perhaps that's why we don't encounter it so often these days.I found the book intriguing, both in subject matter and style. It described the flatness of twenty-first century life perfectly. It evoked beautifully the cosmopolitan 'vibe' of Melbourne as the backdrop to this drama. It made me take sides with some of the characters, and sneer with contempt at others. It opened the window briefly on rooms most of us never see into: prostitution, the stockmarket game, the psychiatrist:patient relationship.If you can't make up your mind from reading the reviews, take a chance and read the book anyway. Like it or not, it will stay with you."},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"What we see, how it's viewed, what it means to us, and our deliverance from the weight of raw materials is narrowed down to try and make meanings from seven different events illusionarily presented as a single situation. The 'stew' is reduced and through this reductionist process it becomes rich and sprawling. There is a teasing reductionism to this tale of how 7 people view events surrounding a kidnapping. How these 7 tale-tellers are connected and their multifaceted interactions as ethnographers and viewers makes the story more intriguing. I had a bit of a problem with the 7th 'interpretor'. So what! I'm a reader and I can say anything. Mr. Perlman can write, and can he ever do so!"},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"No question this book has grabbing story lines and intriguing characters. The way it's told, by seven players in the story, each rolls the story forward and often repeats the same scene that has been presented by a different character before, is creative. It can be a powerful tool to cast happenings in different lights and enhance our memory of important events. However I find the same story sometimes is presented similarly by multiple voices and occasionally even by the same person twice in almost the same words. In addition to the over-repetitiveness, the characters speak the ubiquities long and heavily-structured sentences in their monologues, as if they are all influenced by the central character, the well-read, poetry-loving English teacher Simon. In contrary, the dialogues are more successful -- I totally enjoy the courtroom exchange when Angelique frustrates the prosecutor. I like the book enough to finish it. But it would be a great read, if it were only 1/2 or 2/3 as long, by cutting some of the twice or thrice told pieces, and each person spoke his/her own language. Given the book's 600+ page count, it would still be sizable literature piece after the proposed weight loss."},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"I was lucky enough to read this in 2003 as it was published in Australia first. There was a big scandal in Oz when this book was released as it was caned ( aussie for severely criticised) by the reviewer in The Australian ( highly regarded -'high-brow' type etc...)and Perlman was naturally devestated. It do go on to sell quite well however and apparently has been a huge hit in France ! I personally loved it as I love Melbourne, where it is set, and have a background in Executive Recruitment and am married to the son of european migrants ( all relelevant to characters in the story) so could relate at many levels.For those who also loved it also read 'Three Dollars' which has just been released as a movie in Australia, starring the hugely popular David Wenham ( aka Faramir in Lord of the Rings, amongst other characters). I think Perlman is a huge talent and we have some of the best modern authors in the world ( see Tim Winton, Andrew McGahan)...but I'm not biased or anything!"},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"I'm relieved to see some dissent amid the five-star reviews here. I wanted very much to like this book. My brother gave it to me, the first few pages intrigued me, and I was ready for a solid, satisfying, very long read.No such luck. Talk about the Dreaded Expository Lump, which writers are taught and taught and taught to avoid. It isn't that there's no place in fiction for telling rather than showing, but this novel is almost exclusively expository--it is one long DEL. Even the dialogue reads like a series of university lectures, whether the subject is managed health care, literary deconstructionism, jazz, or other topics the author is eager to expound upon.I also agree with those who have noted the desperate need of strenuous editing, the droning similarity of voice and style throughout, and the lack of color in the setting or the physical descriptions of the characters. Even when these people are behaving colorfully, they come across in shades of gray, taupe, ecru.All in all, I was massively disappointed and only finished this so I could tell my brother I had done so.The two stars above are for this novel's ambition and its occasional flashes of real insight.

It's quite lengthy, but NEVER boring."},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"By the time you have finished this massive book, you may no longer be able to list the many different things it seems to be about; criminal justice, abnormal psychology, corporate finance, literary criticism, and high-stakes gambling are only a few of the subjects it takes in its stride. But at heart it is very simple. The first and shortest of its seven parts ends with the commission of a crime. The next five look at this from different points of view as events move slowly through bail and committal hearings to the eventual trial. The final section (the second shortest) gives the results of the trial and moves the story forward. However, the crime is really little more than a framework on which to hang the main intent of the novel, which is to explore the people drawn into its web. Although the book cover and other reviews have cited Akiro Kurosawa's movieRASHOMON, in which the same crime is seen from different points of view, this is not really the comparison here.* We know what happened; what we don't know are the motives, the back-stories, and the effects on everybody involved. By giving each of his seven sections to a different narrator, Perlman builds a truly multi-dimensional picture. But it is difficult to say more without giving things away. Perlman does not ever tell us who is speaking at the start of each section, for example; this is left for us to figure out. Even listing the cast of characters would reveal things that the author wants to save.The book should come with a user's warning: do not start this until you know you have time to read at least 150 pages a day, and so can hold the vast network of interconnections all in your head at once. Perlman could have made the novel more compact by eliminating his detours; it is almost impossible for a character to mention a subject in conversation without immediately triggering a discussion of it in detail. But a highly intelligent discussion; this is a book you read for the journey, not just the destination. Where else would you find a four page discussion between a prostitute and a psychiatrist on the physiology of climax, or detailed information on the mathematics of card-counting in blackjack, or one of the best explanations of Derrida's deconstructionism you might ever read? The latter is relevant because Simon Heywood, the protagonist, is a former literature student, whose hero is William Empson, author of the originalSEVEN TYPES OF AMBIGUITY, a 1930 landmark in critical theory. Not only has Perman borrowed Empson's title and similarly constructed his book in seven parts, he also takes his idea that meanings can change according to context, and expressed it in genuine novelistic terms. This is why Simon so rails against Derrida, who took Empson's concept of ambiguity to the extreme of saying that no permanent meaning is ever possible at all. If that were so, novels would not have endings; but this one does -- not all neatly tied up with a bow, perhaps, but a very worthwhile outcome nonetheless.\\"We were just as [he] had described us, separate people, all of us separate.\\" So remarks one of the characters towards the end. Another writes in his journal: \\"For some time now the culture of every man for himself has so triumphed that any concern for the common good is referred to a psychiatrist.\\" A narrative splintered into seven distinct parts, set in a world where dysfunctional marriages are par for the course and at least one psychiatrist plies his trade, might only have reinforced this theme of separateness. But the miracle is that it doesn't. By showing each character in isolation, Perlman only reinforces his or her humanity. And the ultimate message of the book is not separation, but outreach and understanding.*A better one might be Lawrence Durrell'sALEXANDRIA QUARTET, whose first three volumes explore the same situation from different but more or less simultaneous points of view, while the fourth moves forward in time."},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"A friend purchased this book for me to ensure that it read it. Nonetheless, it remained in a growing stack next to my bed for three years before I started reading it. After 20 pages, I wasn't sure if I was going to continue reading it (I couldn't make heads or tales of the first person/second person writing style). After 50 pages, I couldn't put it down.I think it is extremely clever and nuanced. There is a lot going on in this novel. It is at once, a very readable page turning thriller and a psychological study. I recommend it."},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"The first time I read Elliot Perlman's Seven Types of Ambiguity I was very impressed by the fact that the same story could be recounted by several different narrators without a dull moment, cover to cover. This novel gives new meaning to the concept of \\"repetition with a difference.\\" Perlman was also very effective in the art of subtlety: showing how a relatively insignificant event could assume enormous proportions, affecting the lives of the main characters. Seven Types of Ambiguity is, above all, a psychological thriller. It tells the story of Simon's obsessive love for his former college girlfriend, Anna, who left him ten years earlier. But the novel's strength in creating dramatic tension out of a relatively small psychological event also turned out to be a stumbling block the second time I read it. Because, ultimately, Simon was not a compelling character. In fact, none of the main characters were. This novel is an absolute masterpiece in layering its narration in concentric circles around a main event through radically different points of view with distinct personalities and voices. Yet, in my estimation, Seven Types of Ambiguity wasn't as strong in creating three-dimensional characters. For a novel built upon psychological suspense and the strength of its characterizations, this is a weakness that can't be completely overlooked.Claudia Moscovici, Notablewriters.com"},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"This is a brilliant book and a great read. I carried it everywhere, ultimately necessitating a repair to the cover.The story is the same, told by seven different people, hence seven perspectives, each with common elements but each having subtle differences. The protagonist is passionate about language and all of its inherent ambiguities. There are so many descriptions and phrases that warrant rereading to understand yet another level of what has transpired. As the reader continues on Perlman's journey, he cannot help but develop a keen awareness of all the ambiguities surrounding us.JCS from Cortlandt Manor"},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"The ideas presented in this novel are rather intriguing. The fact that the same basic story is told by seven different narrators who each reveal another aspect to the story is thought provoking and representative of real life. This book made me realize just how we each perceive things differently as determined by our own life experiences.The only problem I had with the book was Perlman's choice for the seventh and final narrator. The choice seemed a little odd to me and left the novel unfinished with too many details hanging in the air. It is possible that that was his intention though just so as to keep in line with the \\"ambiguous\\" theme."},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"The difference in individuals' perception of the 'same' set of facts is a fascinating topic in literature. Most authors use only a couple of characters to show the skews in perception around the same 'elephant.' Lawrence Durrell is one of the most successful of these. Elliot Perlman is another. Perlman's novel suffers, not because he can't draw seven distinct characters, but because the flat, after the fact, featureless landscape in which they are set lacks drama. Most likely he did this with the idea of bringing their internal lives and the ideas they are discussing into sharper relief, but I would have preferred more local color and less literary and psychiatric theory."},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"With remarks like, \\"you would love the way he sees you,\\" Perlman at once writes a compelling story and poetically delivers the near truths that our romantic selves imagine real. Near truths about ourselves and the capacity of those we love.The story itself is a ambitious and boldly intellectual tale told from seven perspectives about kidnapping and lost love. It's a little Jonathan Franzen, a little David Foster Wallace with a little Mary Pipher thrown in.Perhaps I should let Ambiguity speak for itself:\\"Whatever vestiges of middle-class sensibilities have stayed with Simon, and there are many, it is not these that keep him from Angelique. It is you. The myth of you. So please, don't laugh at him or Angelique. You have, perhaps become shy around empathy. It makes you uncomfortable now. You can live without it in the elaborately designed artifice that surrounds the swimming pool Simon and I have sat by. You really do live without it. Perhaps people ought to feel with more imagination.\\""},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"This book literally took my breath away! You can't seem to read it quickly enough, it's so fast paced...you will never be bored. After reading, the text, complex characters and situations stay with you long after...both chilling and exhilarating. Such a novel spoils you in it's ability to grip you from the beginning and carry you completely through, not realizing you've been holding your breath for so long you exhale in frustration once the novel has ended....Utterly superb!"},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"Be warned - this book is over 600 pages long and every character is a talking cadaver. Yes, there are seven narrators, but, as many critics have noted, their voices meld into one - this lack of differentiation undermines the basic intent of the novel. Instead of being in the company of seven different characters, I felt I was in the company of a single person, the author - and he wasn't feeling that great. The book reads as a dreary confession, one that would have any self-respecting psychiatrist reaching for his prescription pad.*There is far less ambiguity here than you might imagine, and in more ways than one. A change in perspective never overturns any basic fact about the plot or, more surprisingly, regarding a character's motivations - rather than being akin to Rashomon, where each view radically conflicts with its neighbour, here the narrators simply take turns telling the same undisputed story. This lack of conflict between their vantages leads to a lack of tension; and in itself deprives the voices of individuality. Yes, one character can see things which another can't, but it's more a case of adding to the overall picture, instead of actually angrily erasing and painting over the space.*The rhythm of the sentences varies little from chapter to chapter. This is not Faulkner. The vocabulary is similarly uniform (as an example, \\"perfunctory\\" and \\"insensate\\" are used by Angela, while for Joe it's \\"obfuscate\\" - these being the two allegedly less educated characters). The characters all achieve a similar level of insight into, and reflection upon, themselves. Perhaps most disappointing is the chapter voiced by Simon, the literary minded precipitant of events. For all his alleged passion for poetry, his writing is bland and his references to literature rather limited - his voice does not breathe life into the bones of his character. The dialogue is poorly written - in most chapters it would be difficult to tell who is speaking without prompts, and the overall tone is awkward and dead; perhaps the Dennis Mitchell chapter escapes this criticism.*The two prime female characters are drawn as stereotypically beautiful. We are carefully informed about the size of their breasts, and the allure of their eyes. In intellectual matters, they respectfully defer to their male superiors, be this the soulful stuff of art, or the technicalities of card-counting in blackjack. Yawn. There's not much evident irony in Perlman's choice of such representations. When Anna reveals that: \\"He played me like a musical instrument\\", I had to check the cover to make I sure I wasn't reading Judith Krantz. If parts of the book read with the flattened affect of an airport novel it could be because his characters, and his handling of them, share many qualities. Then there's is the central issue of Simon's obsession with Anna - the narcissism inherent in this is impressive, but its exploration is limited - it might be raising the standard too high, but Tolstoy's 'Anna Karenina' shows how multi-faceted such an exploration can be.*Perhaps, more than reading the book itself, it's interesting to ask why so many people found it so stimulating. The very flatness of the style does make it easy to read. The attempt to begin a meditation on character by invoking childhood influences, adult relationships, and unpredictable events, is, as everyone says, ambitious. It could be that the analysis proceeds at a depth which is comfortable for most readers - it allows fractions of honesty to become visible, while a veil remains over much. Of course, fractions can add up to a sizeable sum. My overall reaction to the book was negative, and reminded me of the mood created by reading books by Richard Powers - both authors construct plots which shape a superficial interest, and pen characters with surface complexities, but the crucial insight required for true empathy to be established is missing, as is a winning sense of humour. At best this is a novel I might admire, but not one that I could love."},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"I've had two attempts at reading this, some 5 years apart. Couldn't get into it the first time and really pushed through the pain barrier on the second attempt. The author is somewhat impressed by his own erudition but does not give his readers anything satisfying - the language lacks colour and poetry, the characters are narcissistic and unlikeable and the dialogue is woefully wooden and unbelievable. Perhaps Perlman had a shopping list of pet obsessions that he just had to weave into one long turgid thesis and somehow managed to pass it off as fiction. I pushed on to the end, determined to find some redeeming qualities, but overall a thoroughly unenjoyable process."},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"First, do NOT buy the kindle version for $13. The paperback costs $4! Or borrow it from the library, like I did. Now about the book:Too long, too wordy, too preachy. Many long, irrelevant sections that should have been removed by an editor. Every third sentence needs to be recast or removed.Inconsistent and unconvincing voicing of characters.The author uses the novel as a platform to pontificate about all manner of issues that have nothing to do with anything.The plot, the characters and their relationships are mildly interesting.The author needs to swallow a dose of humility, and find a competent editor."},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"I enjoyed the book immensely. I found the pacing to be excellent and just right for a tale such as this, with varying perspectives."},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"I picked this novel up at a local book store that was going out of business about 3 years ago. I finally got around to reading it and I was pleasantly surprised. As a grad student working on a degree in Counseling I found the excerpts and interactions between the therapist and some of his clients very entertaining and interesting. The book is not the longest I have read, but occasionally while reading it I became aware of its heft. Some of the descriptions are a little wordy and did not really add much to the story. This is the only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars.Overall, the story is fantastic and I would recommend this book to just about anyone looking for a good read. I keep marveling at how the author was able to write from essentially 7 different perspectives. These characters become believable and you are able to feel for them and care about them. This is an impressive piece of work."},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"Perlman's novel, written in dense yet fluid prose, is rich with suspense, empathy, and wit. The seven strands of narrative - each chapter written in the voice of separate yet intimately connected characters - propel forward a plot that is at once gripping and grave. Often Perlman's novel takes a narrative detour into the realm of the Socratic, with characters engulfed in 'casual' conversations on topics ranging from healthcare to literary criticism to the obligations of a human being to his or her community. While the book can sometimes get bogged down in excesses of ideology, it is the type of novel that both affects emotionally and intrigues intellectually. Upon putting it down, the reader can't quite decide whether to voraciously read up on the literature and ideas spotlighted in the book or to ponder the emotional echoes of the characters' choices and, ultimately, their fates."},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"Because I spent 2010-2011 in my 12th, 13th and 14th semesters, I read this book one little piece at a time. I finished it last night on the anniversary that one of my favorite professor-turned-friend gave it to me. At times, I found it very difficult to put the book down; from the first three pages, I was totally engaged and locked in. Though I have read several books on the side this past year (including Franzen, Saunders, French, a list of poets, and a few books concerning early sociology), I chose to take this one slowly. This book will be one I choose to give this year to friends who really enjoy both poetry and excellent prose.I was inherently drawn in because I identified with the main character, Simon--a thirty-something year old academic who is obsessed with poetry, Empson (from whom the title is drawn), and, of course, an ex-girlfriend--and his completely inept, albeit creative, decision to solve a problem by kidnapping said ex-girlfriend's son--something which causes the other characters to think that he has either resorted to self-destruction or completely lost his grip on reality, yet causes them at the same time to pour their efforts into saving him from his chosen situation.I hope the slight insight into the plot I have given does not make this book sound trite. It is not. In the end, I found so much more than I was expecting. The viewpoint of narration does change seven times, and since it concerns so much more than Simon, it has the chance to give a fair amount of somewhat ambiguous insight into this situation from several different character's perspectives, something I feel that Perlman was aiming for in his choice to write it.I admit it, I absolutely loved this book. The only criticism I have is mirrored by other reviewers--the characters all seem to bleed together at times in their reminiscence and thoughts; another reviewer said it better when he wrote \\"They all seem cut from the same Mensa cloth, being incredibly insightful, bright, and in tune with the human condition regardless of age, sex, or social standing.\\"There does not take away from the book though, instead it offers Perlman the means to actually get out what he is trying to say. Being a poet, I am normally drawn to things much shorter than 640 pages; but when something is so carefully constructed that you can feel just how tortured over the lines were in order to get them the way they needed to be, you can only respect it enough to read it in its entirety. In this case, it was well worth it. I wish I could say the same for Franzen. I feel like I have pulled something tangible out of the reading of Seven Types of Ambiguity that I can optimistically take into the world with me.I have nothing but high regards: for this book, for William Empson (who obviously inspired Perlman), and for the professor, now friend, who knew me well enough out of a class of thirty-five people to pull me aside and give me her copy, a copy which she had read three times before passing it on."},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"Another five-star review. Inventive, engaging, and brilliant. No plot points mentioned here, just wanted to add my five-star review with the rest. This book really is worth reading. Kept me guessing until the very end how it would all turn out. Wonderful tension between the main characters. Almost as good as Tolstoy. Reminded me just a little of Anna Karenina for some reason, has that same love-hate-guilt-revenge kind of motif throughout the story.I can't imagine that anybody who likes creative, original literature could find anything wrong with this book. So much better than the usual mediocrity."},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"It's a book about love, the lack of love, the excess of attention that passes as love and sacrifices that people make in less than ideal situations. As the title says, it's about ambiguity and it is, indeed, a wondrous inquiry into the ambiguity of human relations in the modern climate.The author is a profound romantic, not only in the conclusions he draws via plot, but in the way he shows that not all things end well.The ones who give most selflessly suffer the most, struck down by disease or, simply, death.It is this strange inversion of normative justice that gives this novel a dark curranty flavour of bitter-bitter sweet.I also was amazed that someone could tuck in so much poetry into a novel and it could be so good.Thank you, Elliot.I haven't read a book so good in a very, very long time. For someone like myself, that's like sleeping well after months of insomnia.Sometimes writing can be so painful and seemingly without progress or trajectory or gratification.But, readers, this one was worth whatever pain it caused the author. It's good-better than good-it's great. It's a bit heartbreaking too but he meant that, I'm sure.I noticed there were complaints about the voices sounding alike. I attribute it to interior monologue. It's not so much the literal things people say aloud, it's the stream of thought and rationalization that flows through each of us during any moment that we are not interrupted by things requiring our immediate attention."},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"This novel speaks to all of us who have loved and lost and wondered whether it is was better to have never loved at all. the story at times uncomfortable, heartbreaking and tragic reaffirms in the end the basic goodness of the human spirit. this is a book that makes us question our personal relationships and strive to love lest it be lost."},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"Seven Types of AmbiguityIn an era of multi plot movies of one event seen through many characters where parts of the plot can sometimes be summarized in one line of a main character, Seven Types focuses on a plot that actually progresses through each chapter of the book and advances the main story forward, that is, trhough the eyes of different characters that ranges from a depressed financial sales executive to his long lost girlfriend to his colleagues among others each of which see the same situation through their personal optic, while advancing the main plot forward.

It's an arresting tale of love and human relationships maimed by contemporary culture's preoccupation with \\"consumption and competition.\\" Told in a byzantine but breathtaking fashion, this book takes one captive until the end. It's impossible to put down, and will occupy your thoughts.It's not perfect, however. Although told by seven different people, they all come out sounding the same. Same intellectuality, same verbal adroitness, same introspective melancholy. Even the boorish character comes off as a professor. Now this could have been Perlman's intention. It is, after all, a book about the failure or inability of people to genuinely connect with one another, and if they all were very much alike it would only further illustrate the dysfunction of the characters. Even if this were true, it still doesn't work for me. I would have liked to have seen greater differentiation.Perlman is also a bit self-indulgent. On numerous occassions his characters engage in all kinds of intellectual explorations: gambling, literary criticism, public policy, and so on. Some times this was interesting, other times not. He seemed like a drunk man walking the line, the line in this case being between engaging intellectualism and self-important pedantry.In the end, it is still a remarkable book, and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"I am, quite simply, obsessed with this book. -- I haven't read anything that has captivated me this much in years.

It is very well written and its author manages to keep up the narrative flow for the best part of its 600+ pages. Having the story unfold through the prism of different characters is not an original find, but a classic narrative device that is very effectively deployed here by Elliot Perlman. Each of the sections really breathes the spirit of the narrator. The spiritual and emotional wasteland of Joe's mind, Mitch's staccato intelligence, the suave, Central-European worldview of Alex, and the immature persona of his daughter are all admirably reflected in the prose.But something in this book leaves me craving for more. As a reader I am always looking for ideas, for some kind of conceptual backbone, also in a novel. I have been wondering what \\"Seven Types of Ambiguity\\", despite its alluring title, has to offer on this account. What is this book really about? At times, I am tempted to think it is not much more than a messy vignette, an almost arbitrary doodle lifted out of a fin-de-si&egrave;cle notebook, revolving around a quite bland and painful mix of purposelessness and boredom. But then I find myself thinking we should perhaps dig deeper into the book's thin varnish of economic and literary critique. Capitalism and deconstructionism indeed seem to share a mentality of \\"anything goes\\", something which the protagonist of this book loathes as poisonous and immoral. Surely this provides us with a clue to unravel this quixotic plot?However, the final chapter seems to belie this hypothesis. True, there is a victim, but apart from Dr. Klima's improbable demise, this is a truly disappointing happy end. Suddenly, the tensions that have been built up subterraneously over hundreds of pages evaporate. Simon's weltschmerz and rebellious attack on post-industrial civilisation acquiesce in return for the spoils of an academic career. Almost everything falls neatly into place. Even Joe seems happy selling cars. But then again one wonders: is Perlman pulling us by the nose by staging this kind of Hollywoodian apotheosis?Is this a game of double layers and \\"fake\\" endings? That's the trouble with this book: once you try to peer under its surface all perspectives start to shift and there's getting no foot on the ground. That's the deconstructionist strategy par excellence. If Perlman intended it as such, he might well be a genius of ambiguity. But if he really intended to write a serious book about \\"all the terrible things that have been happening to our society in the last ten or twenty years\\" (as he seemed to suggest in an interview) I am afraid he has been punching above his weight."},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"This book stunned me because I haven't read anything like it in years. Certainly I can think of no other contemporary writer who has the courage to explore fundamental social, economic and moral issues within the scope of a thrilling narrative. Indeed, the storytelling is so effective that the reader will hardly realize that there is so much provocative insight along the way. In this sense, I am reminded of Hardy, for example, or even Dickens. I was pulled along by a compelling story and vivid characters while occasionally enjoying a foray into matters political, medical, philosophical, legal or literary. Perfect! It all makes for a remarkably rich reading experience. And the truth is that the story is so captivating and the characters so haunting that you can ignore the \\"extra\\" creative explorations if you choose in favor of the bare thread of the plot (which is multi-layered in and of itself).P.S. I was just in France, where this book (in translation) is a huge bestseller. I think it's just a matter of time before America picks up on this gem to the same extent. (Perhaps a film version would help!)"},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"This is an outstanding, contemporary novel with a vast emotional scope and characters that are terribly real, sketched with exquisite detail and masterful talent. You witness a lot of good and bad things happening to people who could easily have been us; a lot seem random at first but evertything is interconnected in a very purposeful way. This work is an emotional roller-coaster, almost a thriller, without big dramatic events, but through many subtle realizations, almost in passing, that change your understanding of everyone and everything. At times, one feels a bit lost in a fog, but somehow it feels soothing to wait for resolution, which only comes with slight rays of light from a distance, barely easing gasps of tension.Perlmann writes wistfully with a sweet, intimate, and melancholic voice, but his sentences are crisp and matter of fact, usually rapid declarations with great impact. On occasion, some passages seem like digressions, but there is nothing gratuitious or contrived in this book, and everything is an integral thread in the emotional and intellectual fabric of his universe. By the end of this book, you feel as though you have gained new friends but suddenly lost touch with them, wishing you could find them and check in on them.'Seven Types of Ambiguity' is a must read for eveyone who has ever loved."},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"I really loved this book and I am still thinking about it a week after I finished it. I found myself looking forward to reading it every night, which is a sign of a good book. It covers some important issues, I particularly liked the stuff about the vagaries of the sharemarket and the legal system (but I am a lawyer so perhaps that stuff won't appeal to everyone) and the increasing lack of care exhibited by corporate moguls (and people in general I guess). The only thing I would say is that some of the characters are downright annoying (eg; Simon) and some of the dialogue is a bit over the top (not quite believable). I have read some of the reviews on this site and also agree with some of them - the book is quite long and could have been shortened a bit to make it more effective (I didn't think the last chapter really worked for instance). It also perhaps tried to cover just too many things (health care, stockmarket; prostitution; privatisation; SIDS; MS - hello!)

The tightly-knit events are intricate and painstaking, but told by a very familiar, comfortable voice, really as if a friend was telling you their story. The events transpire through many subtle bursts, but how different they are indeed when exposed by the seven different perspectives in the book, and also by your own perspective and mood each day.Just like a master perfumier, the author manages to capture the esssence of many universal human themes and random life events, suspend them to create gripping emotional drama, and then blend them into a brilliant, perfect amalgam. Having read the book months ago, one realizes that some of its best aspects enhace over time, just like a good scent or an old wine, when the initial reaction has evolved and one has had time to breathe! Then you realize that everyone is still as real and vivid as before, and all the same tensions and emotions are still lingering, but they have all matured to perfection.This is the perfect book to read for all who are ready for a calm, paradoxically-relaxing emotional and intellectual thrill."},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"I can't express in words what this reading experience was like, so I won't try too hard.

You keep wondering what happens to all the characters and how the rest of their lives evolve.But more than the story itself, the most amazing thing about this book is the way it is written.

Simone is the most interesting, complex and misunderstood of the characters here.

Everyone in this book seems to suffer, even those who appear to \\"have it all\\" from the outside."},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"Employing the ambiguity that the main character gives so much credit to, Perlman has wowed me!

Beautiful writing."},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"This book had been on my \\"Books Wanted\\" list for a looonng time until I finally found it in an airport bookstore in Atlanta. I wasn't intimidated by the size; I love a nice long story you can invest yourself in, but once I got into the text, although enlightening, edgy and imaginative for the most part, it did tend to drag in some areas which prevented the story from being truly great. Perlman's idea of writing each section of the story in a different characters' point of view is EXCELLENT and worked very well for him; it added weight to the connection of the actual story to the title. Also delightful was the inspiring descriptions of Australia which invoke a yearning in me to travel there as soon as possible. All in all, it's worth the 623 pages but it did take me 30 days to read and that included 2 plane trips which always translates as an opportunity to partake in more recreational reading. In other words, once you get past the center section of the book, you're home free."},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"I read a LOT, and am not an easy grader, but I recommend this book without reservation. I've read all of Perlman's books, and this remains my favorite. It is intelligent, interesting, psychologically astute, original, and never falls into banal predictability, even when dealing w/such cliches as the prostitute w/a heart of gold. The author is deeply intelligent, honest, and reflective. I wish he would grace us with more of his work."},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"I was pulled into a world involving some outrageous characters.

In terms of it's intellectual scope, it's compassion, it's insight into human behaviour and it's detailed and withering depiction of contemporary Western society, it is unlike anything else I've ever read. And on top of all this, it is gripping like the very best thrillers. I cannot recommend it highly enough."},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"Elliot Perlman wrote a very interesting novel in his Three Dollars which said a lot about contemporary life. The Australian writer more than fulfills his promise in his second work. What does really happens to us and how do we know if our impressions of life's twists and turns are correct and appropriate?Seven Types of Ambiguity lets us explore what goes on brilliantly. Each witness sees the same accident differently and in this novel there are seven versions. None of which is completely wrong or right. Perlman writes very well and I found some his asides interesting, especially the one on card counting in blackjack. Some say the book is too long. Maybe, but it is more than worth the effort."},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"I simply cannot stop thinking about this book. It is easily one of the most clever and imaginative (and haunting!) works I've read in years. Thematically, it takes you on a transcendent trip through the range of important human experience. The characters you meet are unforgettable: worthy of your affection or not, they will all inspire some degree of sympathy. And then there is the structure of the narrative. -- The interwoven plotlines are delightfully impressive. Contrary to reports of this book being \\"Rashomonian,\\" it is NOT a repeated retelling of the same event! Rather, each new narrative voice advances the action. One last point: Perlman writes in a thoughtful, clear language that often proves perfectly evocative. In short, the book is a tour de force."},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"I went into Seven Types of Ambiguity with high hopes. A reviewer's blurb on the back called it The Alexandria Quartet for grown ups. Since The Alexandria Quartet is a huge favorite of my partner, I was very excited to read something comparable in one novel instead of four.The meat of the story is fairly simple: for ten years Simon is infatuated with and silently stalking his ex-girlfriend Ana until one day he decides to kidnap her son. The problem is Ana is unhappily married to Joe who is regularly seeing a prostitute named Angelique who is living with Simon and is unrequitedly in love with him. This incident sets in motion events, suspicions, and emotions told from the perspective of seven different characters and how it dramatically effects all of them.Sounds promising, right? And initially it is.The first two sections are engrossing. You get to know the cast of characters. You're slowly made privy to what is going on. You're wondering what's going to happen next. Perlman is a good writer and you're pulled along the trajectory of his novel until suddenly you begin to notice that with each and every section the character's \\"voices\\" all sound the same. The uneducated prostitute sounds like the psychiatrist who sounds like the angry stockbroker who sounds like the ex-girlfriend ad infinitum ad nauseum. And, in all seriousness, who talks like these people? It's clear that Perlman is telling the story insteading of letting his characters do that for him.After awhile, Perlman's writing gets so hamfisted, overbloated, and pseudo-intellectually esoteric that I was becoming annoyed. Very, very annoyed, not only with Perlman's writing but also with his characters. I hated every one of them except for Angelique who was the only character that was a victim of her circumstances. The other characters were self-loathing whiners who had every opportunity to better their situation but chose not to.I have no doubt Mr. Perlman is an extremely intelligent individual, he hammers you over the head with verbose paragraph after verbose paragraph until you get it, until you realize that he's soooooooo smart. It was bit like reading Franzen's The Corrections. Just tell the story already!There's 20 pages of a character explaining the inner workings and hierarchy of the stockmarket. There's a few dozen pages of conversational debates regarding Epsom's seven types of ambiguity and various other works of literature. Do I really need to know the entire inner workings of the Australian legal system to understand a basic court scene? Do I really need to read countless pages of characters blathering on about topics that do nothing to further the plot? At least two characters were wholly uneccessary (Mitch, Klima's daughter), and the ending of the novel is farfetched at best. I would have preferred a much more ambiguous conclusion than Perlman's half-hearted attempt to wrap things up neatly. Clearly Perlman's editor was asleep at the wheel. Seven Types of Anbiguity could have been a sleek and taut drama had 300+ pages been trimmed off its bulk and it probably would not have taken me two months to read.I always say if a writer can evoke from me a strong dislike for their protangonists, then they must be a good writer. However, I've never experienced a writer who was able to evoke from me a strong dislike for the writer himself. Now that's ambiguity"},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"This is one of the most beautiful novels that I have ever read---I had great difficulty putting it down---it is beautifully written, interesting and has for me a great deal ofverisimilitude"},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"Before I started this book, I looked up Amazon book description of William Empson's Seven Types of Ambiguity. It stated that ambiguity, according to Empson, includes \\"any verbal nuance, however slight, which gives room for alternative reactions to the same piece of language.\\" So I presumed this book by Elliot Perlman was a fiction about verbal/language/words ambiguity, a fiction about the struggles of interpersonal relationship between the narrators, resulting from the ambiguity of the spoken, or unspoken, words. I also presumed each of the seven parts was to paint a vastly different picture from the other six. As it turned out, I didn't find many inconsistencies in each individual's character or attributes. In fact, I found there were hardly any conflicting perspectives or narratives of events throughout the seven parts. If anything, as the book progressed, it only confirmed more with what was my perceived impression earlier, when each one of them was introduced.Not until I was deeply into part five, did it occur to me, most astonishingly, that the \\"ambiguity\\" in this book was not merely about ambiguity in language, it was not merely about their relationship with each other, instead it was everything about each narrator's position among us - the society, his/her standing in our social structure. In my opinion, Perlman was practicing his own exploration into \\"Social Reflexivity\\", from psychiatry, prostitution, to stock market/brokerage firms, to HMO, to globalization. Through Klima's journal and his daughter's reflections, Perlman's ultimate, profound message was captured, in Klima's words, \\"Fundamentalism, be it religious or of the market variety, is everywhere and everywhere there is a reaction to complexity, an attempt to ignore the contradictions and conundrums of our existence. People crave the simplicity of easily assimilable black-and-white paradigms and any blurring, ANY AMBIGUITY, IS VIEWED WITH HOSTILITY.\\"Perlma showed us that people who developed keen reflexivity (in social relation) were not necessarily the fittest (survival of the fittest). Furthermore, in his extreme examples, they were the ones who consistently had the most moronic engagements and behavior; they were the ones did not know how or when to withdraw. Simon survived only because he received aid from Klima, from Angelique's unrelenting love, and from Gina, his defense attorney who loved Klima. Klima, who had the highest level of social reflexivity and consciousness, the most ambiguous among them, ironically at the same time a \\"licensed buffoon\\" because of it, in the end there was no one had the capacity to rescue him. \\"I reasoned, but it will not rhyme. There are some for whom the pleasure cannot live when the sense has died.\\" I respect Klima the most and love Angelique the best!"},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"Akira Korosawa's filmRashomonis about a crime that is witnessed by several individuals who all have credible but polarized viewpoints of the event. SEVEN TYPES OF AMBIGUITY is an intellectual Rashomonian potboiler, a colossal coil of colliding and deviating entanglements. However, we KNOW how the crime occurred. But do we really know who is guilty, beyond the obvious guilty defendant?It is a world of contrasts and overlaps, of paradoxes and semblances, of poetry and corporate shenanigans, gambling and grumbling, prostitution and restitution, love and lust, betrayal and fidelity, infidelity and incorruptibility, obsession and distraction, and perhaps the kitchen sink.This book is a courtroom thriller, a love story, a social inquiry, and a study of manners. It is structured with seven narrators whose lives intersect in surprising and stunning twists and twisted knots. The opulent story is situated in Australia, in the state of ambiguity. It is bold, with brazen characters and a show-stopping plot.Seven narrators share the story, and each has only one section of narrative. Some narrators have twice as many pages as others, but all have a tremendous impact on the reader. You see it one way, and then the next narrator's perspective shifts the kaleidoscope a notch or two, substantiating the ambiguity evident in the previous viewpoint while cross-examining each character's version of clarity.It opens with a middle-aged psychiatrist, Alex Klima, a transgressive therapist whose lack of boundaries violates every code of therapeutic ethics imaginable, and yet whose naked empathy is as penetrating as his breach is abominable. He is the central protagonist's psychiatrist and friend, (although it is really more of an ensemble, the central protagonist, Simon, is the one on trial) the one who visits Simon daily in jail and remains his closest confidante up and through the trial.Simon has been arrested for kidnapping the son of his ex-girlfriend, a woman he hasn't even spoken to in ten years, but he is in psychic bondage, because his love for her won't stop. He is a schoolteacher who was laid off during the downsizing of mercenary Australia that stemmed from all the economic disasters that ensued after the collapse and entropy of global corruptions and end-stage capitalism. He is a poet and intellectual, whose dog Empson was named for the author of the book that the title of this book is poached from. Simon lives by the ideology of Empson's 1930 literary analysis of language; the principles of Empson are Simon's articles of faith.According to Empson, there is such depth of meaning in words that there are complex and confounding interpretations of poetry/linguistics, that each verbal thrust contains highly interpretive subtleties. This concept wraps itself around the story, also, both generally and specifically, in a myriad of ways that are best left to the reader to discover.The other five characters fuel this marathon of a book with such driven force and depth that I was literally sweating and weeping by the denouement. The final, short section's narrator is a dramatic surprise that does more than weld together the characters and story; it transforms it. Everyone in the book is on trial, and so is the whole human race. We are all guilty of ambiguity. And this book gave me hope--that we all testify to humanity."},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"Rarely have I been as taken (read impressed) with a book, such as I was with 'mbiguity.\\" It is long, but I prefer long books to short ones and this is a complex story of the same circumstances as viewed by seven people affected by the actions of others. Each chapter is told by a different participant. What I particularly liked was that the author did not reveal who was telling his or her version of events, but rather let you figure it out as you went along (i.e. \\"Oh, that's Angel talking\\") It was fascinating to read the same events viewed by different people. It also contained good life lessons, increased my vocabulary and had a believable and fine ending.

How true to the human condition his descriptions of how each individual perceives reality ranging from the prostitute girlfriend conflict to shared infidelity, including a barren marriage, high risk takers, and the convergence of the characters in the end. A very fruitful process with rewards and deep thinking provoked along the way."},{"Title":"Seven Types of Ambiguity","review":"Despite what you may think when staring at this novels 600+ pages, \`Seven Types of Ambiguity' is an easy read. Telling a very intricate story through the eyes of seven different people, the reader is never bored and is never lost for everything and everyone is in perfect symmetry even if their opinions on matters differ drastically. Elliot Perlman's writing style is magnetic, for while it's quite detailed and sophisticated it's never over the readers head. As far as his writing is concerned, it is one of the novels biggest draws as well as one of its only deterrents. The problem lies within Perlman's decision to keep every narrator sounding the same as the one who came before him. Angelique, the kind-hearted prostitute, uses the same language as Simon, the advanced literature teacher, and that just doesn't make much sense.That said, the story itself really stresses the fact that almost every action and or motive attached is in it of itself very ambiguous. You have the same series of events, the same situations, told and retold by seven different people and the ambiguous fragments of these humans lives become clear as day. The story for the most part revolves around four people, Simon, Anna, Angelique and Joe. Simon is a former teacher who at one time fell in love with Anna. They've long since separated and Anna has been married to Joe for a few years. They have a six-year-old son Sam together. Angelique is a young prostitute who falls in love with Simon, and Simon, while not \`in love' with her loves her in his own special way.The novel opens with Simon's therapist Alex speaking with Anna, pleading with her to do all she can to save Simon. You see, Simon, in an attempt to unite himself once again with Anna, kidnapped her son only to be turned in and arrested. He claims Anna gave him permission when clearly she didn't but feels that Anna will save him and they can again be lovers. Caught in the middle of this fiasco though are Angelique and Joe. Joe and Anna's marriage was already on rocky soil (Joe frequently visited Angelique) and now it's even more unstable.Through the eyes of these five, as well as a business partner of Joes and a final narrator of whom I won't broach (the final part of this novel is so important to the brilliance of this story that I fear mentioning it in any way shape or form could potentially ruin the whole experience) we see not only the effect that this event has had on the parties involved but also who these people got in the predicament that lays before them. Each of these characters is vastly different yet similar in so many ways. They all suffer from the same insecurities and they all fail to read each other properly. They take each other for granted, they trust each other too much and they tend to assume the worst in one another when it's obvious they are drawing the wrong conclusion. Each person is willing to create a lie and stick to it in an effort to convince themselves of what they really want to believe.The most interesting of these characters though lie in the suffering spouses so-to-speak. Joe, while not literally suffering since he in it of himself is not the exemplary mate, is torn to pieces by the prospect of his wife having an affair, and when he finds out that the other woman in his life, the woman he confides in and trusts implicitly (Angelique) is also associated in an intimate way with Simon he begins to unravel. His narration is probably the most enthralling and absorbing. Angelique though is probably the most sympathetic and relatable of the seven narrators. She's kind-hearted, compassionate and real and while she battles with her love for Simon and her frustration in his determination to have the one woman he doesn't belong with we, the reader, and drawn to her and in essence fall in love with her ourselves. By the novels end you'll be flabbergasted that Simon ever wanted to sacrifice his relationship with Angelique for that other woman.\`Seven Types of Ambiguity' is fantastically written and engrossing from start to finish. Its 600+ pages fly by. I personally cringed at the thought of starting this novel, for the task at hand seemed almost too daunting, but much to my pure delight it really was an easy read. I really have nothing but admiration for this masterpiece, and if it weren't for the one minor flaw I mentioned earlier I would say this was a perfect novel, but that flaw in itself is no where near enough for me to complain. Don't hesitate to open this book, whether it be for the sheer size or the college vocabulary, for this novel stands alone as one of the most satisfying reads I've had the privilege to experience."},{"Title":"A Heart Possessed (Signet)","review":"I bought this book on a whim, being that I had never bought one of Ms. Sutcliffe's books before.

The translation (1) has a flowing literary style that does justice to the rich feel of reading Plato's own prose, (2) is remarkably precise in its reflecting of the original language, with the result that, when one notices something interesting going on in the language of the translation, one will consistently find it is reproducing what is found in the Greek. In both these ways, this is a very trustworthy text--the reader can confidently presume to be experiencing Plato's writing. The dialogue itself--Plato's _Phaedo_--has few parallels for philosophical, literary and cultural depth and importance. It is the conversation Socrates has on the day of his death with a number of philosophical admirers. It is a rich discussion of the nature of knowledge, the nature of virtue, the ultimate nature of reality and especially the nature of death itself. The introduction by the translators is also uncommonly good for putting the reader in a position to read the text well. This is the only translation of the _Phaedo_ that I will assign to my classes. This translation is a fantastic accomplishment."},{"Title":"Phaedo","review":"Socrates is unique among philosophers, not just for his place among the early Greek philosophers, but also for the fact that he is the most famous philosopher to never write his own books. What we know of Socrates comes from contemporary accounts and students, most particularly Plato.Set in 399 BCE, the Phaedo is a reconstruction of Socrates final conversations with friends on the day he died. We do not know when this dialogue was written, but it was probably before The Republic (Plato's most famous work, also featuring the figure of Socrates). Like The Republic, this dialogue features a well developed theory of Forms -- these are introduced gradually here, slowly filling out the details of each step. This develops the story of the caves idea from Plato's earlier work in epistemological, metaphysical, moral, and semantic terms. Plato also advances the 'imperfection argument' here -- the idea that when we sense something, it is never perfectly the thing we are thinking of, and that idea or standard to which we relate what we see, hear, feel, etc. is tying into a more perfect Form.However, the idea of the soul is rather less developed here than in The Republic. The soul is simply mind, or intellect - all emotions are here placed as bodily aspects. This is rather Pythagorean in a fashion, that only the soul grasps the perfect Forms, and so should consist of nothing but reasoning ability, for emotions distort and cloud the perceptions and judgments.In the end of the Phaedo, we witness Socrates drink the hemlock, without fear or trembling, as a philosopher should know the value of life and welcome death with a firm hope. The story is almost religious in nature here.However, there are other possible readings, and this edition opens these up. This translation is part of a series done by the translators and Focus Publishing of the Plato dialogues. It has an introduction and a glossary of Greek terms, as well as a brief bibliography. The translators avoid a clunky translation by doing some interpretative work, but explain their reasonings in the introduction. They argue in the introduction against many traditional renderings of Phaedo, and as such provide an interesting counterweight to the prevailing editions available."},{"Title":"Phaedo","review":"Socrates is unique among philosophers, not just for his place among the early Greek philosophers, but also for the fact that he is the most famous philosopher to never write his own books.

This is serious stuff, but in a mere 60 pages manages to capture much, and Grube's work makes it all the more relevant."},{"Title":"Phaedo","review":"Socrates, as depicted by his devoted student, Plato, is one of the true spiritual giants of recorded history, standing in such company as Jesus and the Buddha. The Phaedo preserves the moment where Socrates earned his immortality, forced to commit suicide by the Athenian democracy.Oxford's edition is the only accessible volume to give the Phaedo the individual treatment it merits. Gallop's translation is clear, dramatic, naturalistic, and compelling. Included are an extensive introduction, an outline of the arguments of the dialogue, and copious explanatory notes, as well as a bibliography for further reading.To hear Socrates lecturing his students on the nature of the soul and his assurance of the life to come as the moment of his execution approaches is inspiring and uplifting. As great as any Greek tragedy, the Phaedo recreates a moment where one of the greatest of men shuffles off his mortal coil and &quot;puts on immortality.&quot; A powerful, moving, and transforming read; not to be missed!"},{"Title":"Phaedo","review":"The Phaedo is a third-person account of the philosophical discussion between Socrates and his friends on the day of his death. Socrates accepts his fate most amicably, arguing that death is the means by which to achieve the aims of true philosophy, for only by escaping the evil of the body can the soul truly acquire wisdom. Socrates renews his argument that learning is in fact recollection, supposedly proving that the soul exists before birth. He also argues that everything comes from its opposite; if death comes from life, then life must come from death. The proofs he offers for his belief that the soul is eternal do not strike me as very convincing.As the account of Socrates' final hours, the Phaedo is a corollary of sorts to the Apology and Crito, but it addresses certain themes those earlier dialogues did not. In many ways, the Phaedo is a precursor to much of the philosophy of The Republic, in which the concepts of the eternal soul and the invisible Forms addressed here are threshed out much more satisfactorily. Given the importance of these concepts later in The Republic and the formative yet lengthy discussion of them here in the Phaedo, this is a crucial dialogue in terms of understanding the overall philosophical arguments of Plato."},{"Title":"Phaedo","review":"My reading in Plato begun with Parmenides. Which is pity, to think about it, since Parmenides is to this day considered to be one of the most esoteric. Contrast to Parmenides, where young Socrates stands up against this old thinker, Phaedo reveals old Socrates who now discusses things in fully down-to-earth terms. In fact, Socrates at this time is a dying one. And his tragic end is so well presented that it actually reads like a novel. Back to my point, this book is, I think, the most appropriate as a starter. Then you could trace back to Plato's more abstract discussions. Nowhere in Plato's works his conception of the idea is more clearly explained than in Phaedo. This also summarizes Plato's outlining of philosophy. A must-read."},{"Title":"Phaedo","review":"This book is combination of poetry and philosophy. The time before the death of Socrates and his last great teachings. It is a mile-stone in ethics. Socrates teachings can (and have been) compared to and elevated above the teachings of Jesus. Along with its ethical value, the book reads magnificantly. 'Phaedo' gives Plato his rightfull place as an all time great writer in the company of Homer, Shakspeare, and Goethe."},{"Title":"Phaedo","review":"_If it was up to me to preserve just one of the dialogues of Plato for posterity it would be the Phaedo. That is because this is the metaphysical core of the teachings of Socrates (the main character) as told by Plato. As is emphasized in the text, death is the main topic of concern for the true philosopher- and that is what is covered here. However, there is nothing morbid about it. This is a message of hope, for Socrates establishes the divinity and immortality of the soul. The good man, he who has purified himself through the love of wisdom (Philosophy) goes to a higher, purer realm to be with like-minded souls and the gods themselves. The bad man also goes to his just reward with those of like character._If I was to abstract the core truth here it would be that the true philosopher is always trying to free his soul from the body- for only then is the soul free of the distractions and distortions that can corrupt it and keep it from direct perception of the Ideals (Absolute Truth, Good, Beauty, and Justice.)_You easily see where the Church borrowed so much of its basic theological underpinnings. In fact, reading this work abolishes forever in your mind the idea that the pre-Christian pagans were in anyway necessarily savage or barbaric in their deepest spiritual beliefs. This is spirituality more pure than anything preached by the Church- and it is supported by reasoned argument and not appeal to empty faith and authority._The closing of the dialog is probably the finest depiction in Western literature of the death of a great and good man. You truly concur that Socrates was indeed \\"the wisest and justest and best of all men.\\""},{"Title":"Phaedo","review":"The introductory essay of this edition is superb. It emphasises the monster in us that need to be slayed to free ourselves. That monster, ie the Minotour, is originated in the opening passages of Phaedo.Phaedo explains why there is a considerable gap of time between the sentencing and the carrying out of the execution. He refers to the myth of Theseus saving 14 people from the monster Minotour.Socrates is the Theseus, he is saving the 14 people who are with him at that time (see 59B for a list of the 14 companions of Socrates). The Minotour is the fear of death and the fear of argument (logos).The book itself is also divided into 14 sections:I. OpeningII. Separateness and the care of deathIII.Argument from contrariesIV.Argument from recollectionV. Songs for childrenVI. Argument from invisibilityVII. Lyre and the weaverVIII. Hatred of argumentIX.Tuning undoneX. Threat of blindness and the second sailingXI.Enthusiasm of EchecratesXII. Argument from causeXIII.The true earth mythXIV. The End.Beautiful, only Plato can write a book like this."},{"Title":"Phaedo","review":"In his work Phaedo, Plato utilizes the character of Socrates, before his death by poison in prison, as a vehicle for establishing the existence of, and immortality of, the human soul. Though his arguments often make bold jumps that are difficult to reconcile, he does a more than admirable job of molding a logical argument for the existence of the soul, by taking on a number of possible objections to the theory, objections which are both abstract and somewhat scientific in nature. By likening the soul to the Forms, or the basic abstract properties of the universe, he argues that the soul not only must exist, but must also exist indefinitely, due to its very nature. This book is no doubt worth the read, as it provides an exceptional reflection on death and human mortality, and is a great starting point for Plutonian philosophy."},{"Title":"Phaedo","review":"Ms. Evan Brann is one of the finest translators of Greek in the country. Using the system laid out by Jacob Kline, Ms. Brann has perfected the ideal of literal translation. She stays with the Greek and allows the reader to decide just what Plato said without getting in the way. The glossaries are particularly useful to those with even a rudimentary knowlege of the language of the Greeks. Do not allow a translator or editor to stand between you and the text: choose Brann."},{"Title":"Phaedo","review":"very insightful to the mind of the writer about the mortality and human nature of man, useful information i am able to discuss"},{"Title":"Phaedo","review":"This commentary is a wonderful guide for anyone looking to read Plato's \\"Phaedo\\" in the original. It calls for slightly more advanced knowledge of Greek than Geoffrey Steadman's invaluable student commentaries; in other words, you won't find much help recognizing 2nd aorist forms, etc. You will, however, be given extensive help unpacking the philosophical content of Plato's arguments. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Phaedo","review":"Plato's immortal Phaedo is here presented in a beautiful translation, with, surprisingly, a commentary that sheds new light on the meaning of this foundational dialogue. According to the authors of the commentary, it is a dialogue written to steel Socrates' friends, and through them us (the readers),for the final inescapable act in life--our dying--and to show through Socrates--his courage in the face of present death, and his words of encouragement to both companions and friends as he slowly approaches death's doorway--that a life lived well (which is what Socrates himself tried to do) is proof enough, or ought to be, against our fear of entering the unknown world that awaits each of us upon our death.The commentators--professors at St John's College--offer an interpretation of some of Plato's symbolisms in the dialogue that is both surprising and deeply revealing. (But I won't spoil things by announcing what these symbols are and mean; you'll have to read this wonderful book for yourself to discover that--and perhaps grow from it,too, as Plato/Socrates would have desired.)I have read this dialogue, in other translations, more than 20 times, at least, since college--yet surprise after surprise greeted me as I read through this truly insightful introduction. The authors ought to be given the ancient Greek Olympic prize (free food for life) for their brillance and insight. It is indeed an \\"Olympic triumph!\\" In brief, this is a dialogue--cum commentary--which any thoughtful, inquiring soul will desire to possess--and learn from...and remember, as he himself approaches life's final and inescapable boundary."},{"Title":"Phaedo","review":"This book is organized in a very odd way. Most translated pieces like this (Illiad, Odyssey, etc) have the verses numbered in the margin of the page. This particular piece is organized into a number of sections, something like 90 or more. However, this book did not mark any of them. Also, it seems like this piece wasn't edited at all. Many of the passages have random characters like c& just left in the middle of a sentence. Also, whenever there is a translated verse which has caused controversy among the translating community, the book will add parenthetical statements as long as a paragraph to discuss (in a very convoluted way) the different translations which may be substituted.All in all: I'm really not sure what I bought, but I had to do my entire reading assignment by finding Phaedo online for free. This book was a complete waste of money."},{"Title":"Phaedo","review":"This translation manages both to translate the Greek precisely, as well as capture the sense of the dialogue. Although the closest studies of a work always require one to read it in the original language, this translation is as good as you can get without learning ancient Greek. I highly recommend it to readers both beginning to read Plato and those well seasoned. The introduction is informative, and Brann's expertise in classical Greek and philosophy shines through."},{"Title":"Phaedo","review":"\\"Phaedo\\" is one of Plato's best and most important works. Though well worth reading by itself, the fact that it is widely anthologized - e.g., in The Trial and Death of Socrates - makes it very hard to justify a standalone.Though apparently early and not as complex or philosophically influential as later ones, \\"Phaedo\\" is immensely important in portraying Socrates' death. Along with the aforementioned dialogues, it is our clearest picture of the historical Socrates and would be invaluable for this alone. Indeed, I have read hundreds - perhaps thousands - of books, and this is one of my ten or so favorites, mostly because of how moving the depiction of the great man's last days is. The story of Socrates' last moments is part of world literature's very fabric, an immortal part of Western cultural heritage. However, the works have great value even aside from this; a few have indeed questioned their historical veracity. This does not affect their philosophical, literary, and political worth, which is of the highest, making the book doubly essential.\\"Phaedo\\" ostensibly details Socrates' last moments, including his last look at his wife and child, his last dialogue, his last words to friends, and his actual death. A large part of Socrates' image comes from this, and its potential historical value is inconceivable, though its historicity can easily be doubted since the work itself strongly suggests that Plato was not there. Even so, it is likely accurate in regard to the things that really matter and certainly a fine account of how it very well could have been. It is extremely moving; shot through with pathos, it is one of the most affecting things I have ever read. One can surely not read it without being overcome by emotion; I can hardly even think of it without misty eyes. Anyone who respects and admires this central Western civilization figure will be profoundly touched; his famous last words seem comic out of context but are very much otherwise here, telling us much about Socrates and moving us yet further. This would be one of the greatest works of all-time if it had no other aspect, but it is also a fine dialogue appropriately dealing mostly with death. Plato examines perennial questions like the soul's immortality and metempsychosis very thoroughly and thought-provokingly, and the conclusion - unsurprisingly, given the circumstances - has uncharacteristic certainty. It may not convince our cynical, empiricist, science-loving, twentieth century-surviving age, but the argument is certainly well-made and in many ways admirable. The dialogue touches on other important subjects also and is generally seen as the culmination of Plato's early, Socrates-centered thought.The ever-important translation issue must also be kept in mind. It goes without saying that anyone who cares about intellectual issues, especially applied ones, must know Plato, as should anyone who wants to be even basically well-read. However, this is far easier said than done for most; he is so different from what now passes for literature, to say nothing of pop culture, that he is virtually inaccessible to general readers. Yet the importance of persevering cannot be overemphasized; the payoff is well worth the effort. As nearly always in such cases, reading him becomes far easier after the initial difficulty; no attentive reader will ever think Plato easy reading, but he is utterly absorbing once we get used to his style. He has a near-poetic beauty that all agree has never even been remotely approached in philosophy, and such mesmerizing prose is rare in any genre. His dialogues are an incredible form at once intellectually and aesthetically pleasing - an inspired combination that has perhaps never been bettered; many have appropriated it, but none have matched it. All this means that picking the right translation is probably more important with Plato than any other writer. This Benjamin Jowett translation is now quite old but still very accessible; it will work quite well for most, but anyone struggling should try a more recent version. For the average reader, the more recent, the better is generally true. The important thing is to read Plato in some form, and those who happen on a translation that does not work for them should keep trying until their mind opens in a truly new way - and once done, it will never close again."},{"Title":"Phaedo","review":"I have no desire to critique Plato or to give a synopsis of his Phaedo. What drew me to this review is actually the translators' introduction. Brann, Kalkavage and Salem do, what I think, is an excellent job at breaking down the imagery and themes of the piece while adding a tremendous amount of background. If this were my first encounter with Plato or Greek thought in general, I would find the introduction to be infinitely valuable. For example, the translators point out that Socrates' execution is being postponed due to a celebration. As it goes, each year the Athenians, in accordance to their vow to Apollo, send an emissary to Delos. Before they return, the city must keep itself pure and not put anyone to death. This is to commemorate Theseus' recovery of fourteen young Athenians from the Minotaur of Crete. Now in the Phaedo, Socrates is Theseus, the fourteen present are the same from the Minotaur's labyrinth and the Minotaur represents death itself. Personally, I found that little bit of information both charming and useful. The introduction is jam-packed full of such goodies that will help the reader gain a deeper understanding of this piece than if he or she were to just read it alone."},{"Title":"Phaedo","review":"If it was up to me to preserve just one of the dialogues of Plato for posterity it would be the Phaedo. That is because this is the metaphysical core of the teachings of Socrates (the main character) as told by Plato. As is emphasized in the text, death is the main topic of concern for the true philosopher- and that is what is covered here. However, there is nothing morbid about it. This is a message of hope, for Socrates establishes the divinity and immortality of the soul. The good man, he who has purified himself through the love of wisdom (Philosophy) goes to a higher, purer realm to be with like-minded souls and the gods themselves. The bad man also goes to his just reward with those of like character.If I was to abstract the core truth here it would be that the true philosopher is always trying to free his soul from the body- for only then is the soul free of the distractions and distortions that can corrupt it and keep it from direct perception of the Ideals (Absolute Truth, Good, Beauty, and Justice.)You easily see where the Church borrowed so much of its basic theological underpinnings. In fact, reading this work abolishes forever in your mind the idea that the pre-Christian pagans were in anyway necessarily savage or barbaric in their deepest spiritual beliefs. This is spirituality more pure than anything preached by the Church- and it is supported by reasoned argument and not appeal to empty faith and authority.The closing of the dialog is probably the finest depiction in Western literature of the death of a great and good man. You truly concur that Socrates was indeed the wisest and justest and best of all men."},{"Title":"Phaedo","review":"Socrates is unique among philosophers, not just for his place among the early Greek philosophers, but also for the fact that he is the most famous philosopher to never write his own books. What we know of Socrates comes from contemporary accounts and students, most particularly Plato.Set in 399 BCE, the Phaedo is a reconstruction of Socrates final conversations with friends on the day he died. We do not know when this dialogue was written, but it was probably before The Republic (Plato's most famous work, also featuring the figure of Socrates). Like The Republic, this dialogue features a well developed theory of Forms -- these are introduced gradually here, slowly filling out the details of each step. This develops the story of the caves idea from Plato's earlier work in epistemological, metaphysical, moral, and semantic terms. Plato also advances the 'imperfection argument' here -- the idea that when we sense something, it is never perfectly the thing we are thinking of, and that idea or standard to which we relate what we see, hear, feel, etc. is tying into a more perfect Form.However, the idea of the soul is rather less developed here than in The Republic. The soul is simply mind, or intellect - all emotions are here placed as bodily aspects. This is rather Pythagorean in a fashion, that only the soul grasps the perfect Forms, and so should consist of nothing but reasoning ability, for emotions distort and cloud the perceptions and judgments.In the end of the Phaedo, we witness Socrates drink the hemlock, without fear or trembling, as a philosopher should know the value of life and welcome death with a firm hope. The story is almost religious in nature here.David Gallop's translation is good and true to the original (in as much as I can tell from my small Greek learning). It is somewhat tending toward the formal side. This is serious stuff, but in a small number of pages manages to capture much, and this makes it all the more relevant."},{"Title":"Phaedo","review":"Socrates is unique among philosophers, not just for his place among the early Greek philosophers, but also for the fact that he is the most famous philosopher to never write his own books.

Why does the philosopher seek death but avoid suicide? What is so attractive about death to Socrates?This is a masterpiece of a book. While Socrates does not prove the immortality of the soul, his arguments for such, as in the \\"law of opposites,\\" the \\"theory of recollection\\" and the combination of the two, make way for a very interesting and mind enhancing read and is a hell of lot more valid, intelligible and religiously inclusive than any of the biblical literalist's security hold in fallacious illusion, or was Socrates and Plato infallibly inspired? Was Homer infallibly inspired? Of course not. In turn, Socrates is counter-argued with the \\"theory of attunement\\" and subsequently argues back for the immortality of the soul.His thoughts which entail the body as the inhibitor of obtaining true wisdom, that philosophy aids a man to go beyond his body, so that at death he can be released from the body and use his wisdom to achieve a higher realm of true wisdom, as the body acts as a place of desires that prevents men from perceiving the world of ideas apart from the world of appearances. The death of the body is the release of the soul and the condition of the soul, either that controlled by desires or that of philosophy that has brought it to a higher realm, will determine where the soul travels to after death.Socrates further gives us a description of the round, spherical earth. This exposes the fallacy of biblical literalists who attempt to prove biblical divinity by quoting Job 40:22 and Isaiah for the spherical earth, or does that make Socrates inspired? His further description of the earth's hollows by water and the place called Tartarus brings us to the identical words of St. Paul, who certainly was influenced by many non-Christian teachings, which permeated his entire belief system. Also Socrates gets Eastern in the reincarnation of the soul back to the world of desires, including that of animals and insects, which makes this book a fascinating read to say the least. This book is a gem and great masterpiece to contemplate on. I love Plato - and Socrates too."},{"Title":"Phaedo","review":"I guess the main idea here is whether or not the soul is immortal.Does the soul exist outside of this physical, earthly experience ?I've only begun reading Plato after years of reading a lot of other new age type books such as the Edgar Cayce material and Dr. Brian Weiss.Plato is often consistent with those new age ideas but he expresses his thoughts in a more poetic way.Plato and those others believed in reincarnation and even being reborn as an animal.A new age theory about this is that if you go back to 10,500 BC and beyond you had a lot of people running around with for example the body of a human being but the head of a horse, tree branches for arms, etc..Most people had tails back then.This was a result of people projecting themselves into this physical dimension and getting entangled in the animal and plant worlds. As they did this across multiple incarnations they started to develop those animal appendages in their physical bodies.It was in ancient Egypt around 10,500 BC that the priest Ra Ta and other Atlanteans helped these \\"things\\" to rid themselves of these animal characteristics.That \\"mystery of mysteries\\" the sphinx is a creature that is part human and part lion. Don't think this doesn't have some very deep and hidden meaning.Another key point in the book is the death of Socrates. He dies like a true philosopher, not in fear, but calmly.At one point Socrates actually proves that one plus one is not equal to two.

You probably are not contemplating buying The Complete Works being unfamiliar with his thinking whose affect is still felt in Christendom and beyond, so I will comment from here on out on the actual set itself. This set contains all 22 of his major books. In 5 volumes, the books are not overly large so as to be unwieldy to attempt to read. Nevertheless, to put 22 full-length books into 5, you can imagine that the typeface is smaller than I normally like and the books are larger than I normally like.

Schaeffer","review":"Francis Schaeffer stands out as one of the most influential evangelicals of the twentieth century. This collection of his writings is invaluable because it not only contains the philosophical writings that made him a hero to disillusioned youth looking for answers, but also contains the practical spiritual writings of Francis Schaeffer the Presbyterian pastor. Schaeffer's philosophy, well laid out in &quot;The God Who Is There&quot;, focuses on the assumptions and presuppositions of various world views. With a sort of sanctified Socratic method, he argues that when one follows particular world views to their logical conclusions, all will ultimately fall apart, all except Christianity. His theological writings insist that the key to all truth is that God is not only there, but that He has communicated to mankind in human language, hence the Old and New Testaments are not only essential to theology and doctrine, but to all human understanding. His later writings follow his own presuppositions to their logical conclusions as he examines current culture, politics and in particular, the abortion/infanticide/euthanasia issues. This collection is organized by topics, including philosophy, spirituality, Western Culture, the church and his view of the Bible as the source of truth. Schaeffer is tough on modern culture at times, and often tough on the twentieth century church. But he is always reasonable and compassionate. Although at times criticised for generalizing and oversimplifying, he seemed to have a finger on the pulse of the times. Some of his statements from more than a decade ago appear prophetic in retrospect. His writings are still fresh, relevant and deserve a wider audience."},{"Title":"The Complete Works of Francis A.

It is a true fine application of Law/Gospel, while doing it in a way that can only garner the attention of the unbeliever at the least.One will profit from the usefulness of this set which seeks and contributes to taking the Gospel to the world in which we live."},{"Title":"The Complete Works of Francis A.

Coming from a background of Catholocism first, and then Fundamentalism / Evangelicalism, I was blown away by the sound reasoning, grace, and clear Biblical precepts that permeate Scheaffer's work. Several key ideas I gleaned from these books served (and still serve) as strong idealogical foundations for my total life (notice, there is no separation between &quot;Christian&quot; and &quot;Secular&quot; areas of my life).In these texts, Scheaffer confronts the anti-intellectualism of the Church, claiming that Chrisitianity is cerebral and ought to be presented as such to the non-Christian. He encourages Christians to participate in, and understand the larger society, and to be &quot;salt&quot; and &quot;light&quot; within it. Scheaffer's criticism of the Church and of modern man is filled with compassion and humility. His love for felllow man -- both believer and non-believer -- is evident on every page.I believe these books have helped me to be a better Christian and to have a richer life.

Schaeffer","review":"The late Dr. Francis A. Schaeffer certainly ranks with the great Christian writers of the last century (20th), like C. S. Lewis or T. S. Eliot. He is neither the demi-god that his disciples make him out to be - nor the prating fool that detracters berate. Dr. Schaeffer was simply a successful popularizer of the logical approach to Christianity of such scholars as Abraham Kuyper, Cornelius VanTil and such. The theologians are too deep for the mass of today's wishy-washy Evangelicals; the Theonomists are too logically consistent.Whether one agrees with Schaeffer's syntheses or not, he is to be commended for his thurough approach to a unified world view. Many of us, raised as irrational and pietistic mystics, got our first glimpse of a Christian philosophy from this prolific writer. He taught us to make Jesus the Lord of the sciences, fine arts and politics - as Dr. Schaeffer himself often put it, Lord of the Total Culture.It must be said that the 2oth century was a heyday of mystical subjectivism and revivalistic foolishness in the churches. Charismatic pretensions, the &quot;church growth&quot; movement, and many attempts to be culturally relevant only led to embarassing weakness as the Christians became lost in the pagan society. In such a sad era, Schaeffer did not have to do all that much to seem like an intellectual giant. Perhaps his interpretations of history or opinions on science are open to correction. He rarely - if ever - cited references for his sweeping generalizations, and certainly popularizer (sometimes corrupted) the insights of better men.But he is worth a hearing, and hopefully his readers will go on to deeper and purer authors, such as Greg Bahnsen, Dr. Gordon Clark, and the old Covenanter writers. In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king. Those who call Schaeffer an illogical liar are merely jealous of his one good eye."},{"Title":"The Complete Works of Francis A.

Schaeffer","review":"There are few writers with a real vision of the state of human affairs in our time. Schaeffer traces religious and secular history in science, music, arts and literature, and shows us where our path left the one God would have us walk. Schaeffer discusses the most difficult subjects like abortion and infanticide in the past and present.Humanism is the religion of the 21st century. Humanism elevates mankind to godlike status. Humans have no power to save themselves or the earth. I challenge anyone to read Schaeffer and not discover new facts and dynamics about the deathspiral of Christianity's relevance in the world.Frances Schaeffer does not offer pablum to the masses and pulls no punches allowing us to feel better about ourselves apart from Jesus Christ. God is there and makes Himself known. Schaeffer is a great tour guide on a literary pilgrimage of faith.Five volume set. Very readable type and of good quality for paperbacks.

Schaeffer","review":"It arrived on time and well protected. Actually it is the best product I have purchased from the website."},{"Title":"The Complete Works of Francis A. Schaeffer","review":"I began reading Francis Schaeffer's books shortly after becoming interested in Christianity some 30 years ago. There are only a few I haven't read, and so when this title was issued, I was delighted that I could now read Schaeffer's work in its entirety.I started Schaeffer from the beginning with \\"The God Who Is There.\\" What started the whole fascination with his work was the film series \\"Whatever Happened To the Human Race?,\\" which a Christian student's group was sponsoring at the secular college I attended. I wasn't certain what to make of Schaeffer then, with his liederhosen, long hair, and quiet calm tone of speaking. Yet I sensed that there was something profound underlying the content of the film series, and that something could probably be better explored in his writing. So off I went to the local book store to purchase his first book. At the time \\"The God Who Is There\\" had been published some 20 years before, so I realized I had some catching up to do.No Christian author to date has been more helpful towards forming my own Christian worldview (apart from scripture itself) than this man's work. While I became a Christian at the same time, my understanding of the issues at stake in committing my life to Christ is more indebted to Schaeffer than to all the many authors I've read since then.At the time (at least as some have asserted), Schaeffer had been sort of kidnapped by the political right in America, who's agenda appeared simply to end abortion at the cost of the universal appeal of the gospel. Yet I sensed that Schaeffer's views were more deeply formed than a political opinion or agenda. Schaeffer seemed more like a Christian diplomat than a political ideologue.Gradually, I learned that Schaeffer's solution was not political at all, but formed by his scriptural insight into the need for Christianity to transform culture through the gospel, rather than through political means. It seems that most of us have misread Schaeffer, if we are supporting any political agenda - despite the true evils of abortion and other American attrocities. His means to that end was found more in a civil disobedience of a kind, which showed compassion to those suffering from the strong influence and dictates of a materialistic culture.If you haven't read Schaeffer, I'm not going to say \\"you haven't lived,\\" but I will say this - you have missed a focal point for an understanding of the historical and philosophical events, which strongly influenced the direction and shape of Western culture, some favorable and some best forgotten."},{"Title":"The Complete Works of Francis A. Schaeffer","review":"It is amazing how Schaeffer saw the trends of his day, and where they were leading us. \\"The God Who is There\\", \\"He is there and He is Not Silent\\", and \\"Escape From Reason\\" are books all Christians should read. God has used FS powerfully in the Curch, and in the lives of many believers. Take advantage of this great collection!"},{"Title":"The Complete Works of Francis A. Schaeffer","review":"I had read Francis' books some years back and am going through &quot;A Christian Manifesto&quot; again. It is definitely food for thought. Even if you may not agree with all conclusions (as none of us have it ALL right), it should be considered among some of the most thoughtful literature of the 20th century. He writes deeply, but in easy english (try reading any of John Owens books!). I have to agree with the other reviewers about &quot;California&quot;, I used to live out there for awhile, and it is the land of fruits and nuts, and now seemingly ignorant liberals (by the way, I am a LIBERTARIAN). To be open minded and loving is what Francis was about. Search for the truth, but do it in love, and defend the truth when you find it. Peace and love to you all, may your seach bring you home safely."},{"Title":"The Complete Works of Francis A.

Schaeffer","review":"The Complete Works of Schaeffer should be read in its entirety, and then re-read at least two more times. Many shy away from reading Schaeffer because they perceive him to have been an intellectual and an academian. This is true, but his real brillance is his ability to write in language the layman would understand. His ability to systematically bring together the teaching of the Bible and relate it today's culture is unparalleled in today's writers. His book titled, \\"How Should We Then Live?: The Rise and Decline of Western Thought and Culture\\" was written in the early 80's, but is even more relavent today than it was then."},{"Title":"The Complete Works of Francis A.

Schaeffer","review":"Francis Schaeffer (1912-1984) was one of the \\"giants\\" of evangelical theology and apologetics in the 20th century. If you see this set and think, \\"Oh, I don't need to get this set; I already have all of Schaeffer's books, in the old Inter-Varsity editions,\\" then think again: as Schaeffer notes in the Preface, \\"Much reediting has gone into this. They are the same books, yet brought up to date and clarified where time has shown they need clarification.\\"Volume One contains (arguably) his most important works: The God Who is There; Escape From Reason; He is There and He Is Not Silent (as well as his booklet, \\"Back to Freedom and Dignity\\"). All of Schaeffer's core ideas are here, such as the \\"Line of Despair\\" (which \\"arises from the abandonment of the hope of a unified answer for knowledge and life\\"); the \\"mannishness of man\\"; the \\"upper story/lower story\\" in theology (the upper story is \\"not open to contact with verification by the world of facts which constitute the 'lower story'\\"); \\"true truth\\"; not to mention his criticisms of Sartre, Crick, Skinner, and above all, Schaeffer's incisive comments on art and cultural history (remember that Schaeffer was seemingly the only evangelical at the time who had anything to say about Michelangelo, Beethoven, Dali, John Cage, etc.).This volume stresses again and again his primary emphases: e.g., \\"We must have the courage to say that God is there\\"; \\"the infinite-personal, triune God is not silent\\"; there was a \\"moral, historic, space-time Fall\\". His striking comments are also in abundance, such as:\\"Abraham's faith ... was certainly not a 'leap of faith' separated from rationality.\\"\\"Philosophers ... shifted the concept of truth, and modern man was born.\\"\\"The dilemma of modern man is simple: he does not know why man has any meaning. He is lost. Man remains a zero.\\"Volume Two is of less importance (it's interesting to note that Schaeffer is open to an \\"older\\" earth, but only with qualifications), but it does contain fascinating statements such as, \\"the little phrase, 'without error in all that it affirms' was not a part of my own contribution to the Lausanne Covenant. I didn't know that phrase was going to be included ... until I saw it in its final printed form.\\" Volume Three is heartfelt, and contains statements like, \\"We at L'Abri believe that Christianity does have intellectual answers, and that every man deserves an honest answer for an honest question.\\" Volume Four (\\"A Christian View of the Church\\") is more argumentative (e.g., \\"Truth demands confrontation\\"), and sometimes rather blunt (\\"The evangelical church seems to specialize in being behind\\").The final volume contains his final works: How Should We Then Live?; Whatever Happened to the Human Race?; A Christian Manifesto (as well as \\"Pollution and the Death of Man\\"). HSWTL and WHTTHR are the only two works in this set which really suffer from being presented simply in a \\"text\\" version. (Remember that they were both originally FILMS; and even the books had striking photos of Michelangelo's David [uncensored], a lake filled with floating dolls representing aborted babies, etc.)The final volume is also arguably inconsistent with the earlier Schaeffer; if you read his son Franky's bookCrazy for God: How I Grew Up as One of the Elect, Helped Found the Religious Right, and Lived to Take All (or Almost All) of It Back), he suggests that Schaeffer allowed himself to be moved from his \\"comfort zone\\" into the role of a \\"prophet,\\" and wasn't comfortable with the role. (But Franky---who directed the films HSWTL and WHTTHR---has abandoned Christianity altogether, it seems, so he perhaps isn't the best \\"witness.\\")Schaeffer is a challenging intellectual figure of the 20th century, whose imprint remains in current religious discussion. His complete works are an essential component of any theological/apologetical library."},{"Title":"The Complete Works of Francis A.

Schaeffer","review":"The only culture of ignorance and non-thinking that I see is the one pervasive in the above review. The purest definition of ignorance I can imagine is one that detracts from a body of thought by the illegitimate actions of the followers of that thought. To call Christianity a culture of nonthinking and ignorance is the most irrational and arrogant comment imaginable. To say that 2000 years have gone by and billions of people have been fools- &quot;nonthinking and ignorant&quot; fools- is the epitome of unwarranted ignorance. Dr. Schaeffer, while by no means a man to be worshipped, is a terrific writer with logical thoughts. He had his flaws in some of these expositions but he was definitely a thinker, and a very deep one with some very valid and logical arguments. This review is going nowhere fast, but anyone with a head on their shoulders shouldn't even think twice about ignoring that ridiculous review provided by the &quot;reader form California.&quot;"},{"Title":"He Gave Us Stories: The Bible Student's Guide to Interpreting Old Testament Narratives","review":"This was one of the first significant treatments of a literary approach to hermeneutics within evangelical circles at the time the book was first published. And while I personally don't think a literary hermeneutic is the only good way to read the Bible, Pratt does a good job of demonstrating that such an approach has much to commend it.Traditional evangelicals and liberals alike tend to like dissecting the Bible into little pieces (verses or even words within verses) as its primary technique of Scriptural examination and interpretation. While this is certainly not bad at all, Pratt properly believes that such an emphasis carries with it the very real danger of contextual tunnel vision, where we miss the larger picture and end up missing a lot of what the Bible intends to teach us. Pratt's hermeneutic in this book emphasizes the importance of investigating the 'original meaning' of the text - how the text was to be understood by the original historical audience it was being written to. For example, if Moses wrote Genesis during the time of the exodus as the Israelites were either at Mt. Sinai or in the plains of Moab about to enter Canaan, this historical background helps the modern reader gain added insight into not only what Moses said, but why he said it. While there are dangers with this, as I will discuss below, when handled properly, much that we either didn't understand or particularly care about in the Old Testament become extremely fascinating and meaningful. Such an approach requires us to read the Bible as a piece of literature that is telling stories - inerrant stories that are purposeful and contain timeless truths that are in part flushed out better when we understand the particular cultural and historical messages that the Bible contained for the original audience and writer of each canonical book.For readers who want to understand the relationship between the Old Testament and the Christian today in the 21st century, Pratt's approach is most instructive. Epochal, cultural, and personal adjustments are a critical part of his hermeneutic and help explain why we don't sacrifice bulls today or worship at a temple in Jerusalem, while showing how these things are still nonetheless significant and instructive for us today. Consistent with Reformed covenant theology, Pratt also insists that the Old Testament needs to be seen in the light of redemptive history, culminating in Christ. Kingdom and covenant are major organizing principles of Pratt's hermeneutic, and while readers should understand that this is far from the only good Christian model of approaching the Bible, Pratt provides a solid presentation of it here.As with both the systematic and 'biblical' theological approaches, the literary approach is not perfect and contains some weaknesses and dangers. The major danger is that a literary approach, if not sufficiently controlled, can easily spiral into ungrounded speculation that could prove just about any point anybody wanted to make, regardless of whether that's what the Bible actually teaches or not. Pratt's book, while quite good at laying out a literary hermeneutic sprinkled with Biblical theology, could have been better in warning its readers of the danger of this approach when applied unrestrained. Pratt affirms that Scripture is the lone final authority to which we all must submit, but the book is a bit sparse on defining what exactly this means within a literary context in terms of establishing good controls that constantly force our literary musings back to the Bible as the final arbiter of legitimacy and truth.But overall, this is an insightful book that will greatly challenge many of its readers to read the Bible in a fundamentally different way than they have up to this point. For the most part, this is a good thing and worthy of attention."},{"Title":"He Gave Us Stories: The Bible Student's Guide to Interpreting Old Testament Narratives","review":"In He Gave Us Stories, Dr. Pratt introduces Old Testament interpretation in an approachable way. His aim, as stated in the preface, is to provide \\"motivated lay people and beginning theological students\\" with a method for biblical interpretation that is more practical and less technical. Through this approach, He Gave Us Stories appeals to a wider audience than a more scholarly volume would.The principle idea of He Gave Us Stories is that the Old Testament narratives provide not simply a history of the Jewish people, but a revelation of God and the imperatives He has given man. However, because these truths are in story format, they must be interpreted to be of use to God's people today.The backbone of the book is Dr. Pratt's three-fold approach to Biblical interpretation. The first four chapters cover the subject of \\"Preparing for Old Testament Narratives,\\" the middle eight chapters deal with \\"Investigating the Old Testament Narratives,\\" and the final four chapters are on \\"Applying the Old Testament Narratives.\\" Dr. Pratt likens this approach to an archaeologist, who much invest a great deal of time, thought, and effort as he prepares for his project, searches for his treasures, and transports his discoveries home.He Gave Us Stories provides more a simple method of hermeneutics than a formal system of biblical theology. With the exception of Chapter 12: Overview of Old Testament Narratives, the purpose, structure, and content of this book are pointed toward the exposition and application of individual texts.This book is a useful tool for students and teachers of the Bible alike. Dr. Pratt has succeeded in making it accessible to those who are not textual and hermeneutical scholars. In particular, his focus on the stories of the Old Testament make the overall approach to understanding all the more appealing. Surely no person, learned or not, would be uninterested in stories. And certainly not these stories, since they are from God himself and teach us how to live our lives. The thread of stories weaves its way throughout the book.The structure of He Gave Us Stories is also commendable. Dr. Pratt takes the principles of hermeneutics - a very complex subject indeed - organizes them, and states them in an uncomplicated way. And the ability to make the profound appear simple, according to C.S. Lewis, is the mark of true genius."},{"Title":"He Gave Us Stories: The Bible Student's Guide to Interpreting Old Testament Narratives","review":"This book requires mental work, but it is rewarding. Dr. Pratt's hermeneutic is revolutionary in the sense that it allows the reader-student (you must study it to get the meat of it) to unlock OT narratives like never before. His three-prong paradigm for interpreting a OT narrative text (and any narrative text) is simply profound. His hermeneutical adjustments from original meaning (epochal, cultural &amp; personal) are very useful and helpful tools in the quest to rightly interpret any OT text. I heartily recommend this book to any serious student of the Bible. If possible, it would be best to read the text along with Dr. Pratt's audio or video tapes as he teaches through the book, if those are available. Soli Deo gloria, David Sims"},{"Title":"He Gave Us Stories: The Bible Student's Guide to Interpreting Old Testament Narratives","review":"I had this book recommended to me because I was in the course of examining various issues concerning the interpretation of OT texts and, so far, this book has turned out to be the one that was, at the very least, best focused on the actual issue I was studying.Books on hermeneutics tend to be rather vague and formless, offering principles that are often so vague that they are of little help in actually making decisions of interpretation. I find 'He Gave us Stories' to be much more useful than the bulk of these books, besides, as I said, focusing on the actual issue I was studying."},{"Title":"He Gave Us Stories: The Bible Student's Guide to Interpreting Old Testament Narratives","review":"Although I agree with most of Dr. Pratt's ideas and beliefs, I found this book extremely toilsome and, in some points, downright bland.

The 35 men responsible for the injury form a League of Atonement to help support their victim. Eventually the victim discovers he has great literary ability and becomes a lionized author. All his books have as their theme the murder of various characters modeled after various members of the League of Atonement. The victim has become a Literary Avenger. Then one member dies violently at a reunion while in close proximity to the Literary Avenger. The survivors receive an anonymous poem suggesting the Literary Avenger has become a literal avenger. Another dies of poisoning shortly after a meeting with the Avenger. Another group of poems goes out. A third disappears without a trace. Another anonymous poem goes out to the League. They have transmogrified from the League of Atonement to the League of Frightened Men.They consult with Nero Wolfe, and he undertakes to relieve their fears for an obscene fee. Wolfe feels that all he needs is the answers to three questions and he can corkscrew a confession out of the Literary Avenger. Before Wolfe can pull it off, his target gets himself arrested for the murder of a fourth member of the League, and it looks like an open and shut case. Wolfe stands to lose his fee. If the Avenger gets electrocuted for the fourth murder, the League won't owe him a cent.Archie Goodwin, Wolfe's confidential assistant, sees the problem quite simply. All Wolfe has to do is exonerate the Literary Avenger in the fourth murder and get confessions to the first three. The pair of detectives travels a complex path to achieve Archie's simple solution. Archie gets poisoned, Wolfe gets kidnapped, and it all culminates in one of the most Machiavellian maneuvers ever to spring from Wolfe's fertile imagination."},{"Title":"The League of Frightened Men","review":"I really loved this book even before I read \\"Stout Fellow\\" by \\"O.E.McBride.\\" Her insightful analysis of all of Rex Stout's work confirms what I already suspected: Rex Stout's earliest books were his best.This one can be forgiven some narrative excesses (the pink tie and soup, for example) in fair exchange for some of Wolfe's best Wolfeisms. The one about membership in the Hardvard Club is in this book.And finally, Paul Chapin is a much better \\"Moriarty\\" than Arnold Zeck. He's much deeper and more complex, in fact, than virtually any other of Stout's other characters, doubly subtle by the way in which his villainy is propounded.Fetishism, kinky stuff - all here more so that in anything else of Wolfe's that comes to mind.

It ends with a gentle insult that cracked me up. Otherwise, I think I would recommend reading this over listening to this. I think it would go faster, and the conversations would be easier to follow. This particular reader is advertised as having a golden voice; not on my system, he didn't.A man, Paul, was injured in college. Some number of fellow students felt responsible and guilty enough to undertake some degree of lifetime support (more or less) of him. He was not always fond of this. Some 20 or 30 years later, some of those fellow students begin dying, and later evidence indicates to the remaining that Paul has killed them.Straightforward (in as much as any of them are) mystery with the twist that you don't know whether the deaths are, in fact, murders--and some may be, some may not be, there may or may not be more, and Paul himself may or may not have been the murderer. I liked that; it presented complications. Some other events (data) laid forth drew me to really basic conclusions ... which were wrong.

Vengeance is at the heart of the plot. Many years earlier, a hazing incident at Harvard left a young man crippled. That young man, Paul Chapin, goes on to literary fame, making sure to model characters in his novels on one or another of those who had done him the injury. Then, one by one, somebody begins to murder the 35 members of the group that had hazed Paul Chapin. The group (the League of Frightened Men), comes to Nero Wolfe and asks him to save their lives.The plot is complicated and there's a lot of dialogue with many different characters, and a lot of theorizing, too, between Nero and Archie. I liked this story because I love Nero and Archie and the brownstone house and orchids and all that.

Wolfe doesn't use DNA and forensic science to solve the case. He conducts interviews and digs into the past. You, the reader, observe most of the discovery of evidence so you can test your powers of reasoning alongside Wolfe's.Author Rex Stout does not talk down to his readers. He has created a unique group of characters and situations. Through them you will pick up diverse bits of information and know more when you finish the book than when you started. Keep a dictionary handy. Stout will challenge your vocabulary. You will also learn fragments about fine foods, the cultivation of prize winning orchids, world geography and important books of non-fiction.You will also be amused.

Am trying to read all of his books.....enjoy the retro detectives using their brains to solve cases."},{"Title":"The League of Frightened Men","review":"Another great story by Rex Stout! I've read many, many of his books, and this one rates up at the top of the list! Very good book!"},{"Title":"The League of Frightened Men","review":"Rex Stout is one of my favorite authors. This particular book is one of his best. Nero Wolfe is at his best here."},{"Title":"The League of Frightened Men","review":"Nero Wolfe had been approached by Andrew Hibbard who was seeking Wolfe's protection from a man that Hibbard and a group of his friends had inadvertently crippled years before during a college prank. Recently various members of the group had met untimely ends, and their long ago victim was claiming responsibility for their deaths. Hibbard was afraid that he would be next but he put so many restrictions on Wolfe about the case that Wolfe turned it down. A few weeks later though when Hibbard disappeared, presumably at the hands of the man he had approached Wolfe about, and probably fatally Wolfe felt compelled to act.There were many twists and turns to this case, as often happens in Stout's novels. What sets this one apart is that Archie finds himself in need of rescuing and it is Wolfe who sails forth from the confines of the brownstone to provide it! Fans of the series will delight into once again joining Wolfe's little household as Nero and Archie solve the case of THE LEAGUE OF FRIGHTENED MEN."},{"Title":"The League of Frightened Men","review":"I don't understand someone who would think that any of the Nero Wolfe boosk were not good. Of course some are better than others, but frankly, his worst is better than the best of just about anyone (well, Raymond Chandler is an example of someone who you may prefer, but for gods sake, he's a legend).The man deserved the Nobel Prize. Oliver Wendell Holmes considered him the best of all the detective writers. I agree."},{"Title":"The League of Frightened Men","review":"This was my first Wolfe mystery, and I enjoyed it completely. It's a period piece, and the author created a definite sense of time and place, which added texture to the story. The story itself was unusual -- not your typical mystery fare. I agree that Paul Chapin was a fascinating character. His wife made me uncomfortable. Her character was unpleasant and I didn't ever grasp what motivated her to do as she did. Still, this was a lot of fun and I look forward to continuing with the series."},{"Title":"The League of Frightened Men","review":"Even if I did not rate it more than 3 stars it was so good to find and read one I had not read before.

One of the best of the books in a good performance."},{"Title":"The League of Frightened Men","review":"This second adventure of Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin, while not as compelling as the first, is nonetheless an excellent mystery with a rather sly twist at the end. While the the chief suspect, Paul, was the victim of a prank so many years before, he is not a sympathetic character at all and appears to be very bitter through his mask of friendship towards all. Paul's wife also seems to have few good qualities and does, in fact, seem to have quite a bizarre personality. Stout's stories are all well written and contribute to fast paced adventures that usually end with one character very unhappy, in this case Paul appears to be both unamused and unimpressed by Nero Wolfe's solution of the case. I storngly recommend this story to all Nero Wolfe/Archie Goodwin stories."},{"Title":"The League of Frightened Men","review":"This was a disappointment. I'm a Wolfe fanatic and the author of a comprehensive webpage devoted to Wolfe, of as enormous size as Wolfe himself (see www.avenarius.sk/stout ), but compared to the masterpiece published only a year earlier than _The League_, I mean the very first Wolfe novel, _Fer-de-Lance_ (1934) -- compared to that first novel _The League_ is a &quot;wash-out&quot;, to use Archie's term: tedious, overlong, and trite. I agree with the assessment of a previous Amazon reviewer (of August 1999).In _Fer-de-Lance_, it didn't really matter that the characters were all-new, created from scratch. You could feel the excitement of their being created, or having just been created, in Stout's prose; it was more careful and less unnecessarily verbose than in _The League_. Wolfe himself says in _The League_ that the art of writing is to leave out as much as possible without detriment to the substance: well, if _The League_ had only been 100 pages long instead of 200, it might have been entertaining!Wolfe talks too much, and Archie describes and theorizes and worries and rejoices too much in this novel. Inspector Cramer appears for the first time in this book, but he's not really himself yet. He smokes a pipe (!) instead of chewing an unlit cigar to tatters. Neither does he talk or otherwise behave like the later Cramer we love to hate. There's no red leather chair in the office yet, neither are yellow chairs there. No one-way glass panel at the door.As to the mystery angle in this book (a weak point in all of Rex Stout's books): the solution to the murder(s) is disappointing and can be guessed with many pages left to go. Hardly any suspense, certainly not to be compared with the likes of Agatha Christie. But, I've never cared for the mystery angle in Stout; it's the humorous interaction between Wolfe and Archie that makes Stout unique: Wolfe's and Archie's visions of life and the world. Neither Wolfe nor Archie are at their best in _The League_; the supporting cast (victims and suspects) are, equally, not nearly as interestingly portrayed as in _Fer-de-Lance_. _Fer-de-Lance_ is also much funnier to read; _The League_ leads us to smile, at most, every now and then -- but don't expect any Goodwinian belly-laughs.For the best in Wolfe and Archie, therefore, instead of _The League_ turn to masterpieces like _Fer-de-Lance_, _The Silent Speaker_, _In the Best Families_, _Too Many Cooks_, and _Plot It Yourself_."},{"Title":"Lord of the Light","review":"Contents summary: The mythological Sun (43pp). The astrological Sun (32pp). Aspects to the natal Sun delineated (89pp). The natal Sun in the twelve houses delineated (25pp). The natal Sun in the twelve signs delineated (23pp).

Completely free from celebrity chart analyses and other such filler material; concise, solid and intelligent writing throughout. Paul relegates the Sun signs to a small fraction of the total interpretations he covers; yet what he writes about them is accurate and insightful. Essential reading for any committed student of astrology. His aspect interpretations cover every major aspect type separately, unlike those in almost all other 'single planet'-focused textbooks, which tend to just discuss the two bodies concerned in aspect generally."},{"Title":"My Friend Hitler","review":"Imagine the final play in this book coming after a summary of the original tale in which an ancient imperial family has surpassed Freud in arranging family relationships:\\"Sutoku (1119-64)--officially the first son of Retired Emperor Toba (1103-56) but actually a son of Toba's father, Retired Emperor Shirakawa (1053-1129) because Shirakawa made Shoshi pregnant after he married her to his son--was installed as emperor when he was four, but was tricked into retirement by Toba in 1141, before ever having a chance to exercise real imperial power. His actual father, Shirakawa, had started the insei, a political arrangement in which the retired monarch wielded far greater power than the ruling one. . . .\\" (p. 242).There are a few footnotes in the play \`My Friend Hitler' which remind the reader that the translator is trying to capture the style of German political thought that has been staged in Japan. The footnote on page 133 actually begins with \\"Here, apparently with tongue in cheek, Mishima commits an improbable cross-cultural anachronism. What Hitler refers to . . .\\" I find it more ironic when Hitler is perplexed that his secret police are acting like secret police:HITLER: No, you had your own problems. What can you say about the disgusting things the SA did during the last two years? No wonder the Reichswehr was put off. You made hideouts in basements and warehouses; you tortured, kidnapped, demanded ransoms--I've even heard the story that in some districts troopers took their rivals in love affairs into basements, tied them up on the wall, and cut them up.ROEHM: That lasted only a while. It's just that the young men wanted to mimic what secret police do. I've kept them in check and there's been nothing like that since. (pp. 128-129).How likely is it that Hitler ever complained to a government official that \\"your men swagger about so obnoxiously that serious-minded citizens are completely put off, and as soon as they spot one of your men in the distance, they quickly hide their daughters.\\" ? (p. 129).There are only four characters in the play \`My Friend Hitler,' but it helps to have some knowledge of Goering and the rest of the upper echelon of the political hierarchy, including Defense Minister General von Blomberg, one that I do not recall myself, who are rivals of the main characters, half of whom will be liquidated by the final scene at midnight, June 30, 1934. Another thing I didn't know was about Hitler's \\"law I passed last February after you joined my cabinet, which would give storm troopers wounded during political campaigns the same pensions as soldiers wounded during the war\\" (p. 129). Things must have been pretty bad for the army to be begging to get into the fight to restore order, but that is what Hitler called \\"the Prussian National Army's tradition beginning to roar at last.\\" (p. 130).Surely the main point of \\"My Friend Hitler\\" is that being an old friend of young Adolf and a mouse that eats cheese left in a boot is not a perfect defense against imperfect legal proceedings, if you catch my drift.This book contains a Preface by Hiroaki Sato, five plays by Yukio Mishima, short Backstage Essays on the first production of his play \`The Rokumeikan,' including \\"The Psychology of a Walk-On Role on the Stage\\" (pp. 60-62) about playing a carpenter who keeps his back to the audience for three or four minutes, during which the play seems \\"like an invisible monster that moves blindly in a certain direction while sucking them into the maelstrom it has created,\\" (p. 61). There is a transcript of a speech Mishima gave to Kabuki trainees on July 3, 1970 with many footnotes added by Hiroaki Sato on pages 219-239, the explanation of the play on pages 241-245, and finally, \\"A Wonder Tale: The Moonbow, The Original Tale by Kyokutei Bakin\\" on pages 246-307. There is no index. The emphasis is on drama rather than history."},{"Title":"My Friend Hitler","review":"in pretty much each preface to each play and essay, translator sato openly comments on some linguistic flourish in the original he doubts can be reproduced in english. his attitude is mainly one of, \\"well, here goes nothing.\\" you are forced to take this book as a purely academic venture, an historical document, as opposed to any kind of endeavour worthy of the originals. this is bearable until the last two pieces, where the gist that still comes through is so powerful, so sublime, that the limitations of the translation become all the more irritating.they're literal translations, so the aesthetic flavour is diluted, sentances run on forever and sound jilted when spoken aloud. these are not performable plays, however compelling their subjects are. at least theres some vestige of mishima's 60-odd plays in english, and i appreciate that. they are however mostly from the last 3 years of his life. sato also translated the book silk and insight, which i am afraid i have now lost interest in reading.donald keene's trans of five modern noh plays, that's a quality piece. now ive got to head down to robarts library at university of toronto to look at his trans of madame de sade, which is regretably far harder to find, and far more expensive, than this book, having been published once in the late 60s."},{"Title":"Analysis of Human Genetic Linkage (Ott, Analysis Of Human Genetic Linkage)","review":"This book is THE standard textbook for anyone interested in statistical genetics.

Currently, their only plan is to reach a city named Marienburg. As they travel, they will come to realize that they each have special abilities.***** This is part of the Warhammer, Fantasy Roleplay, saga. This looks to be the first of a series by author Sandy Mitchell. If the rest of her novels are as awesome as this first installment, then she can add me to her list of fans. The authors has successfully captured the Warhammer flavor. This novel will grab your attention quickly and lead you on a fabulous adventure. Excellent! *****Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews."},{"Title":"Blood on the Reik: Death's Messenger (Warhammer)","review":"Death's Messenger is a nice opening volume of a unnamed series, at least on the cover of the book. A quick read, Mitchell provides a stirring plot and decent characters in the world of the Warhammer Fantasy setting.The story is a well plotted travel tale of two wayward spirits accused of wrongdoings and heresy. Throughout the story, we're drawn closer to the focal characters, and can't help but feel for their plight. However brief, the story leaves us with the question of what happens next as the story hits a cliffhanger ending. Hopefully, the next volume answers the questions of character raised during the course of the tale."},{"Title":"Blood on the Reik: Death's Messenger (Warhammer)","review":"Being a Warhammer fan I really enjoyed this book. I peticularly liked how the author keeps the reader in the dark about the Warhammer universe, just as if you were some superstitious country folk. As the story goes on you discover more and more about truths in the Empire; this was the most enjoyable part of the book for me."},{"Title":"Blood on the Reik: Death's Messenger (Warhammer)","review":"Sandy Mitchell is one of my favorite Warhammer authors, right up there with Dan Abnett, but this book was a little bit of a let down. The characters seemed to be just a little flat, almost as if Mitchell decided to cram as many people into this story as he could. As a result, he did not go into as much depth with the main characters as I would have liked. Also, the book seems to break off in the middle of the story, like Mitchell was told that he could not write a longer book. Although the plot had moments of suspense, it seemed like nothing really got resolved. Dont get me wrong, this is a good read, but the book could have been so much better."},{"Title":"Blood on the Reik: Death's Messenger (Warhammer)","review":"As the other reviewer has already mentioned,This is a good novel. Not quite up to the Cain novelsbut good nonetheless.This novel was more of a character development novel.Lots of stuff happens to the protagonists but we don'treally see too much change in the main characters, at leastin their mindset.Something else worth mentioning is that this isn't one of thegory style warhammer fantasy novels with action packed intoevery page.The reader will be able to tell from the style of the writingand action that is really is intended to promote thewarhammer fantasy roleplaying that features so prominentlyon the front and back covers of the novel. We don't have anymunchkins in the entire book. Just regular citizens of theempire going about their everyday lives, some of themdying/mutating/changing as the story progresses.The last thing worth mentioning is that this novel is a bitshort for the story. At over 400 pages, you'd figure thatwe could get some kind of solid conclusion to the story,even if there would later be sequels or a trilogy.The novel however leaves off with a MAJOR cliffhanger andends with the feeling that the second half of the novel ismissing. I can only hope that the Black Library andSandy Mitchell won't be taking too long to write and releasethe sequel."},{"Title":"Blood on the Reik: Death's Messenger (Warhammer)","review":"This book has two major and very annoying flaws.The main character suffers from a serious case of obliviousness. he simply doesn't get things which anyone familiar with the Warhammer world can tell will have very bad outcomes. Sure, he is young and naive, but mostly he feels just plain clueless if not stupid. This I could live with but...the book has no ending. It is as if the author met a page quota and stopped. I don't like cliffhangers on TV, I hate them in novels.The village where most of the action happens is nicely detailed. Much of the plot felt highly predictable, mostly because I could see where things were going before the clueless main character has any ideas.The book is clearly a tie-in with the Warhammer FRPG. As such it is a good introduction to the game.I wouldn't read this one unless you have the sequel handy (which I didn't). The lack of anything even approaching a resolution really kills this book.This series (Death's Messenger, Death's City, Death's Legacy) is basically one novel chopped into three books. The various books do NOT stand alone. Treat this series as one novel & have all three on hand before you start."},{"Title":"Blood on the Reik: Death's Messenger (Warhammer)","review":"Death's Messenger was a real page turner - quite a quick and enjoyable read. A coming of age story set against the fantastic world of the Warhammer miniatures game (which is in and of itself a lot of fun), the novel does a great job of taking a young hero-in-training and bringing he and his friends across the captivating campaign world of the game. Well worth the read."},{"Title":"Blood on the Reik: Death's Messenger (Warhammer)","review":"I have never read a Warhammer novel but have been playing the games for about 15 years, if not more, so I am familiar with the world.When I first started reading this book, I did not like it. I thought the writing was poor and the author was a little too casual and wrote in terms that are too often used. Everything about this book is very basic, from the descriptions to the dialogue to the plot. Reading this book made me feel like the author wrote it on a Sunday afternoon sometime after finishing a crossword puzzle. There were moments when I felt as if the story was coming out of its lull, hence the 3rd star for it was not a complete failure. But in the end, when you read the last page, you realize that this is just an obvious set up for the second part, which does not make much sense since the book is only about 400 pages long anyway. Over all, its an OK read if you're not looking for anything too deep."},{"Title":"Blood on the Reik: Death's Messenger (Warhammer)","review":"I like the way the book presents village life in the Warhammer world. An interesting insite into how villagers should be played in the game. The superstition and agenda of the characters are very well represented (or misrepresented in some cases). The characters are not one dimensional and the main characters are people you can care about. The flow of the book is good, exciting enough to keep you reading, but also very descriptive. I am going to buy the next book when it comes out because the cliffhanger was quite good, disappointing because I didn't want the book to end, but I can't think of a better place to end it."},{"Title":"Blood on the Reik: Death's Messenger (Warhammer)","review":"The book offers a good description of how a warhammer village setting should be roleplayed from the point of view of the main character; a hunter if I'm not mistaken. Come into this book with that in mind. We get a full cast of side characters(NPCs) with various careers as well as a main villain in the form of a cold and callous Witch Hunter. Storywise, it reads like an introduction to a Roleplaying game. Nothing wrong with that but a writer of Mitchell's calibre could've made the gaming elements a little more subtle and less obvious in my humble opinion. So 4-stars instead of 5."},{"Title":"Blood on the Reik: Death's Messenger (Warhammer)","review":"This should be a two star review...THE GOOD: The plotline was ok and the writing was fair. If you are familiar with this world then it might be worth it to check out this story. The main character's are moderately interesting, engaging enough so that I kept going until the end.THE BAD: As I said, the writing was fair. This is not a book you will immerse yourself in. It is a fast read and something to get you by until the book you want arrives. At times I felt like the author wrote this between projects. I felt that she did not enjoy the characters and never really gave them a chance to grow as they should. As I said above, they were moderately intersting but could have been so much more.THE UGLY: This is part one of a series (two books I think). The problem is that the lead in is so blatant that when I read the last page I thought maybe some of the LAST pages had been torn out. I don't mind books that set up for a series, but each book in that series should still be its own complete story with a plot, struggle, resolution, etc... This book had little of that and the end wrapped up nothing.Ubermonkey says you should spot this at the store, then proceed to the \\"M\\" section and pick up Martin's \\"Game of Thrones\\" instead."},{"Title":"Doctor at Sea","review":"I first read this book at age 12 - loved it then, loved it just much the second time. Very funny even though we Americans probably miss some of the English jokes. This book is one of Gordon's &#34;Doctor&#34; series, all of which are hilarious and well worth purchasing.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Ramage at Trafalgar","review":"After a good deal of interesting matters on shore, Ramage and his faithful crew (already rich with prize money but faultlessly loyal to their captain) race off to join Admiral Lord Nelson before Cadiz in Spain, and the great naval battle of Trafalgar in 1805. More than any other nautical novel I've read, this one makes clear just how revolutionary were Nelson's killer tactics. It is worth reading just for the views of Nelson at home and at war. The reasons why Nelson is Britain's greatest hero are made clear. The story is constructed with a long narrative line building to a thrilling climax, and a wonderfully sad ending as Ramage appears headed for another court-martial due to his valiant actions taken without orders.Book notes: poorly proof-read for a McBooks book. The only title in the Ramage series with a genuinely old painting on the cover (but has nothing to do with the story). While it can certainly stand on its own better than most in the series because it more closely concerns real historical figures than usual, as the 16th of 18 this volume is probably not the place to start."},{"Title":"Ramage at Trafalgar","review":"Not only entertaining reading but much detail of how living ws in that century.Also really detailed info on how ships and their cews lived and died.The description of the gunpwder room is particularly detailed, something missing from other eloquent writers of this genre."},{"Title":"Ramage at Trafalgar","review":"After the disaster of the previous book (Ramage's Challenge), this one is a welcome relief. It starts off a little slowly--getting the ship ready in England and sailing out to join the fleet off Cadiz. And Pope, in usual fashion, can't move things along quickly enough. Well, Ramage joins the fleet and is sent onshore as a a spy to get information from an informant. This episode is not particularly helpful to the story, though. Things really get good when the Franco-Spanish fleet sets sail. From here on, the book reads like a thriller and the battle is very good. Pope really rises to the challenge and gives the reader a treat. too bad he didn't get right to the good stuff right away. This could have been a great book.I do have some problems with weaving fictional characters into historical events. Yes, sooner or later, all our fictional heroes must be at the big battles. But Ramage seems to play too big a part. He's not just some guy on a ship shooting a gun, but a relatively major, or at least noticeable, player in the battle. I'm a bit uncomfortable with that."},{"Title":"Ramage at Trafalgar","review":"Yes, a wonderful read or storytelling book to the young. Kids love the characters and journey at sea. The Ramage stories always have a good sense of seamanship and the tasks at hand on those old ships."},{"Title":"Ramage at Trafalgar","review":"Dudley Pope might be thorough on the nautical detail, but when it comes to general historical detail of the period, this book is seriously flawed. Ramage apparently has one servant who does everything around the house (butler, groom, coachman - and poacher and smuggler); his wife, the daughter of a marquis, travels without a maid; and don't even get me started on the scene where Ramage gives his own wife a sponge bath in the London town house of Ramage's parents' . . . These people are wealthy aristocrats, for pete's sake! And they never act like it! Pope needed a serious dose of Georgette Heyer to do the on-shore scenes better.The rest of the tale? A yawn-fest about the Battle of Trafalgar, as Ramage and his familiar crew race to the scene in the Calypso, carry out an all-too-easy espionage mission, wreck one ship and then capture another during the battle itself. This story should have been flowing and exciting; instead, it is as top-heavy with incidental detail as the Santissima Trinidad. Ramage disobeys orders and gets away with it yet again, naturally.I appreciate the difficulty of grafting a fictional character into historical events. But &quot;Ramage at Trafalgar&quot; is seriously unbalanced, the large chunk of the book taken up by Ramage's family having nothing to do with later events and introducing a feel that does not match the second half of the book. Why not just limit it to a nautical tale focused solely on the battle? There's more than enough material there, after all. And why have Ramage and Nelson apparently forgotten the events in &quot;Ramage and the Guillotine&quot;? Other Ramage books are much better. This one is perfunctory and boring in its execution."},{"Title":"Sicily (Eyewitness Travel Guides)","review":"We have been to Sicily three times and find the Rough Guide to be unerringly on target. Its assessments of the priority of things to see and do, its reviews of sights, hotels, restaurants have been the most helpful of the many guides we used.

My wife and I were not only impressed with the maps of each city, but the tips on how to get to and from the airport or train stations was right on the money.We managed to secure lodging in each city very close to the train stations. This made our day as we traveled to 5 cities over the course of two weeks. I wish I would have consulted this book when the train operators were on strike. The rough guide even had the location and phone number for the bus line running from Palermo to Agrigento.Each of the lodging blurbs was accurate and we were able to stay in places we wanted for the price we wanted to pay. Times were accurate for sites such as the Valley of the Temples, or various Duomos.I really could go on and on. But if you are going to Sicily (or any other foreign place) and need a guide book, purchase the Rough Guide."},{"Title":"Sicily (Eyewitness Travel Guides)","review":"We have never traveled to Sicily before, so we found this book useful in planning our trip and useful once we got there. The book is organized well according to region and then by city, with more space given to larger cities. It was very helpful for us since we went to 4 cities in 9 days. However we went off season, so we found that sometimes the times and days open listed in the book were not true once we showed up at a site.The colorful pictures really help when you need to find buildings and other sites, but the maps are not detailed enough for navigating Sicilian streets. Stop in at any tourist office for a free map of each city once you get there. I agree that the historical descriptions for certain sites could have been better. But I found the brief descriptions helpful at times when making quick decisions. Do we really want to walk to this site or skip it for another one?

I also bought the Michelin green guide to Italy, the information about sicily is less detailed but I found more usefull for planning the trip.Though the information is correct and more or less updated I still found the book to be full with unusefull information.

A lot of practical things."},{"Title":"Sicily (Eyewitness Travel Guides)","review":"How things change. Until now, I had only good things to say about Eyewitness Guides. They used to be top of the heap. True, there have been decidedly average jobs (Japan was one, beaten by unlikely contender, Rough Guide, hands down), but Sicily is a major disappointment.The first and the main thing that is wrong with this book - not enough content, not enough informed text, and tired cliched writing at that, too. The appearance is still there: nice pictures, helpful layout, but there's nothing to read. Description of major attractions is superficial at best. History section (&quot;through the ages&quot;) is a bit better, but this is about the only strong point.There isn't even a decent map of Palermo (tourist office gives you a better one for free), and the maps which are included cannot even be bothered to show a railway station. Information on airport transfers? Forget about it. Talk about sleeping on their laurels.For comparison: a few years ago, a guide to much less visited (a far more difficult) Sardinia was sharp, well-researched and informative. It seems that they work so hard to enter the league of major guide producers to every popular destination, alongside with Lonely Planet, Fodor's, Frommers and Rough Guide, that they lost their sense of purpose and, most importantly, their pride of superbly produced, all-stops-pulled, product.I used to commend DK on their cheerful style of writing, so different from a grumpy and grumbling world of Lonely Planet and Rough Guide. Now, it seems, they had taken another extreme: research is so superficial it appears not to exist at all, and practical advice so general they can apply to almost country.Alternative? I had Frommer's as my second guide on my Sicilian trip, and I found it very good (actually, much better researched and deeper than their latest full-Italy guide). There are drawbacks, but overall it was extremely useful. More than can be said about this Eyewitness Guide."},{"Title":"Sicily (Eyewitness Travel Guides)","review":"We havent traveled to Sicily yet to put the book to its big test, but in planning for the trip it has been very helpful...telling us what to absolutely not miss, good places to stay and eat, and insider things off the beaten path."},{"Title":"Bride of Fu Manchu","review":"This novel, volume 6 of Sax Rohmer's 14 Fu Manchu books, is perhaps the best of the lot so far for the simple reason that we see more of the good Dr. in this tale than in any of the others. The best parts of any Fu Manchu novel are always when Fu himself is present, talking and scheming and gloating and explaining, and in this book we see a LOT of him. This book marks another departure in the series, in that we have a new narrator (the third so far in the series): Alan Sterling, a botanist buddy of our old friend Dr. Petrie. The setting of the book is unique, too--the French Riviera. As the reader below has astutely observed, the plot of this book--spreading biological plague throughout the world--does seem to have influenced Ian Fleming in his later Bond novel, O.H.M.S.S. But there are other parallels as well. Fu Manchu's garden of deadly plants could be seen as a precursor to Blofeld's suicide gardens in \\"You Only Live Twice,\\" and the character of Fu Manchu himself, as has been pointed out elsewhere, would seem to be an inspiration for the later Dr. No. Does anybody out there know whether or not Fleming was a Rohmer fan? Anyway, this is a terrific and fast-moving tale. The high point of the book occurs when Fu Manchu takes Sterling on a tour of his laboratory, showing him all the plant and animal monstrosities that he has created. This section takes up fully 1/4 of the novel, and is a real showstopper. We are also treated to the usual array of Burmese thugs, knockout drugs, opium use, hypnotism, \\"the Blessing of the Celestial Vision,\\" a sea chase, and even (finally!) the arrest of Fu Manchu himself. Does Fu Manchu get convicted and serve a kajillion years in the slammer, as he deserves? With eight more books in the series to go, what do you think?!?!?!? Anyway, this is an exceptional entry in the Fu Manchu series."},{"Title":"Bride of Fu Manchu","review":"THE BRIDE OF FU MANCHU (1933) is Sax Rohmer's finest Fu Manchu novel. Dashing, heroic narrator Alan Sterling is a worthy successor to Dr. Petrie (who appears older and wiser than the Petrie who narrated the first three books). It is to Rohmer's credit that he allowed his characters to age in real-time. Veterans were relegated to supporting roles or phased out entirely while younger, more vital characters carried on the work. The task in question is to prevent the dastardly Fu Manchu from unleashing bacterial warfare--years before Ian Fleming wrote ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE. The titular bride is Dr. Petrie and Karamaneh's daughter, Fleurette. Thought dead since infancy, she was spirited away by Fu Manchu to replace her mother in his service. Nayland Smith remains a patriotic defender of the Crown. Rohmer allowed the middle-aged Smith to take a back seat to his younger heroes, but the character remains an inspirational leader. THE BRIDE OF FU MANCHU is non-stop fun that more clearly demonstrates Rohmer's literary talents than any other book. The energy and exotic locales keep the story fresh and fast-paced all the way to the breathless conclusion."},{"Title":"Bride of Fu Manchu","review":"Egypt and then London, the early 1900's -- the era of Sherlock Holmes, Dracula, and the mysteries of Egypt -- a time of shadows, secret societies, discoveries of hidden knowledge, and even a dead man who lives again. Into this setting comes a classic femme fatale, an oriental beauty with a sirenesque quality, who possesses not only beauty, but a high intellect: the daughter of Fu Manchu. The \\"Daughter of Fu Manchu\\" is, I beleive, the fourth in the Fu Manchu series by Sax Rohmer, a prolific English novelist, who is best remembered for his series of novels featuring the master Oriental criminal mastermind Dr. Fu Manchu.In this fourth novel, we have a change of narrator: Shan Greville. If you have read the first books, never fear, Dr. Petrie is still there to help; in fact, in just the first few pages, Greville seeks Petrie's help for his dead chief, Sir Lionel Barton. As the mystery builds in Egypt, Nayland Smith appears just as things at their \\"dig\\" of the Tomb of the Black Ape are getting strange and sinister, including the disappearance of Sir Barton's dead body! Sir Denis Nayland Smith and his associates learn of a deadly organization that stalks the shadows. The sinister organization's goal is to undermine the balance of global power; it reminds them of Fu Manchu, but he is dead. At the head of this sinister, secret society is the daughter of Fu Manchu, an evil beauty with incredible hypnotic powers. She has convened \\"Si Fan,\\" the ancient and powerful Council of Seven, who has power than none can withstand. Now it is up to Smith and his associates to save the peace and sanity of the world. Nayland Smith pursues his quarry across Europe, and the battle rages through the streets of London where the plot builds to a clever, quick finale.The old-fashioned writing style in \\"Daughter of Fu Manchu\\" (as is true in all the Fu Manchu novels) can be a bit distracting until you get used to it, and for some people, the racial stereotyping can be upsetting to many modern readers. However, the book, its style, and even the stereotyping is a product of the time and place in which it was written. Rohmer is most famous for creating the infamous evil genius of Fu Manchu who became even more famous in those marvelous black and white movies of the 30's. Fu Manchu was portrayed in various films by Boris Karloff in these movies. Several of the first Fu Manchu novels are also available for free on the Kindle or search out the actual books in used bookstores - they are worth the time to discover the great, intellectual (and stereotypical) evil genius who is Fu Manchu."},{"Title":"Navigating the Night Sky: How to Identify the Stars and Constellations (Patrick Moore's Practical Astronomy Series)","review":"Not only is this book interesting to read, but each night I go outside I'm able to identify something new in the night sky. The text is very interesting and accessible, and the diagrams and figures in this book are really clear and explanatory.What made me choose this book over others is one figure that shows some of the stars in the night sky, (white stars on black background), the same figure only black dots (stars) on white background, and the third figure the same black stars with constellation groupings drawn in. (What I've just described can be seen in the \\"look inside this book\\" section on Amazon.)There is another figure of a patch of night sky with different viewing conditions: in a brightly lit city (only a few stars visible), on the outskirts of a city (more stars visible), and in a dark area (lots of stars visible). This kind of image is invaluable to me as a novice living in a city - it is now easy to recognize the different constellations in my night sky because I'm not lost in a star map with too many dots.This same map technique is carried over into celestial maps of different areas of the sky, only instead of showing different viewing conditions, there is a star map (black dots/constellations/stars shown on white background with corresponding names & labels) and then the same view, with just the white stars on the black background, just as one will be seeing it in the night sky.There are lots of other drawings,diagrams and tables that illustrate things like the ecliptic, the celestial equator, the position of the sun in relation to the constellations of the zodiac, methods for approximate measurement of angular distances, etc.As if that weren't benefit enough, the author's explanations and writing style are clear AND interesting, and the reader gets a good foundation in \\"the anatomy\\" of the night sky, as it were.I am thrilled to have found this book, and I am very grateful to Guilherme de Almeida for writing it. He says in his introduction, \\"If one clear night the reader feels some sense of contentment and satisfaction when looking at the starlit sky, this book was worth writing.\\" Well, Mission Accomplished!"},{"Title":"An Embarrassment of Mangoes: A Caribbean Interlude","review":"Read this book in just days.

HIGHLY recommend"},{"Title":"An Embarrassment of Mangoes: A Caribbean Interlude","review":"I was drawn to this book by the beautiful photo on the cover and the reviews on the back of the book which made it sound like a dreamy read. And indeed I was not disappointed. For anyone who loves to travel, this is an extra vacation you can take right now, right in your own lounge chair in your own backyard. In the story, a young, successful couple decide they've had too much of the business world. After logically making a plan which takes them 7 years to pull off, they rent their house, buy a sailboat (despite not knowing all that much about sailing) and head off to the Carribbean for two years. The book tells of their often humorous and always entertaining adventures along the way.

Need to get my wife to read it so I can get her as enthused as I am about going."},{"Title":"An Embarrassment of Mangoes: A Caribbean Interlude","review":"I give most books away after reading. I'm keeping this one. Inspirational, great recipes, etc. Actually, that's not entirely accurate. A friend wanted to borrow it so I decided to perma-loan the dog eared copy and buy a new one for my shelf.I've had a dream of heading off to spend a few years on my boat. Things always get in the way. sighThis book details some of the hardships and pleasures of living aboard a sailboat in the Caribbean. It indirectly answered lots of questions while raising more. The big questions got answered though. Things like \\"What about hurricanes?\\"Some people complain that this book is too much of a cook book. Maybe, but the meals are so lovingly described that when the recipes appear at the end of the chapter I would read them and savor the sensations of cooking and dining that had been invoked.That and I've been using more plantains, sweet potatoes, and (of course) mangoes in my cooking."},{"Title":"An Embarrassment of Mangoes: A Caribbean Interlude","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Let me start with the negative though; there are parts where the sailing jargon gets heavy and you might have a hard time following exactly what happened for a brief passage. The general idea comes across, but the word picture sometimes assumes a little more knowledge of sailing that some might possess.That said, the book was wonderful and a great laugh. The annecdotes were alternatingly funny, exciting and dreamy. The prose is good, even great at points. The cooking is outstanding, and I love how she includes recipes of some of the key dishes and ingredients that she describes and discusses.It's a good read, and comes very highly recomended."},{"Title":"An Embarrassment of Mangoes: A Caribbean Interlude","review":"I received the book quickly and in perfect condition.

Ann writes in such a way to make you feel like you are right beside her in the cockpit of the Receta. I paused for two days before reading the last 50 pages because I did not want it to end.

This married couple gave me the gift of realizing that there is beauty all around us if only we take the initiative to go out there and find it for ourselves. \\"Do or do not there is no try\\"."},{"Title":"An Embarrassment of Mangoes: A Caribbean Interlude","review":"I love the Caribbean, even going to the semi-extreme of buying a home on a small island 10 years ago. For me it changed my life.Since then, I read any and all books about changing one's life by sticking their neck out such as A Trip to the Beach by Melinda Blanchard.My latest read as I prepared to travel with friends on their motor yacht in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, as well as Grenada, was \\"An Embarrassment of Mangoes\\" by Ann Vanderhoof. The hostess told me it was \\"required\\" onboard reading.Ann Vanderhoof and her husband Steve Manley shed their jobs and their busy lives in winter gray Toronto to live a two year dream of sailing from Toronto to the Caribbean and back. They plan for over five years financially and practically to do this life changing journey.They make their first ocean crossings alone in a 42 foot sailboat, \\"Receta\\". Along the way, Ann, an accomplished cook in her own right, found new and entertaining foods to work with in her four foot square galley. She shares not only the story behind the food but the recipes she derived from them. When local women teach her a dish and their technique to prepare it, she memorializes it forever for all of us.We forget in our busy world with alphabet electronics that many people still cook on a flame built with fire, have never had their picture taken, do not have a computer or even have electricity or running water. There are no recipe books and no \\"celebrity chefs\\" to emulate. They cook as they were taught growing up. But they can surely cook; all the while using ingredients we eschew or do not look twice at because they are not common to our culture.Ann shares her failures and her successes in the galley as well as herself and Steve.I started the book on my Kindle, read parts on the boat's copy (autographed by Ann) and thoroughly enjoyed reading their adventure as we anchored in the Tobago Cays, Carriacou and then moved on to Grenada. Sandi and John, our hosts, met Ann and Steve earlier in their adventure as they brought their boat, \\"Hanco\\", down the islands.For our adventure, Sandi wanted to anchor at Hog Island where Ann and Steve spent the hurricane season in the book before their own boat went into Clarke's Court Bay Marina for the coming hurricane season.As we attempted to anchor in the mud off Hog Island, the sail boat next to us radioed we were \\"slipping\\" our anchor. We went about resetting our anchor, which for reasons too long, turned into an embarrassment of anchoring, when Sandi waved at the next boat shouting \\"Ann! Steve!\\" The sailboat next to us was Receta, occupied by Ann and Steve, with their visitor being Dwight, first introduced in this book.Meeting Ann and Steve, who now spend much of their time in the Caribbean, was the first time I had the opportunity to close the circle that never closes when you read someone's personal story. The reader, as Ann allows here, becomes intimately acquainted with the author and their life but the reader never gets to reveal themself in return. A one-sided friendship it seems.Ann reveals both herself and her engaging husband, Steve as they learn and work their way to Grenada. She shares the people she so engagingly happens upon with her readers and you wish you could not only be there, but meeting them all as well.In this rare chance to close that circle of knowledge with an author, I found Ann and Steve to be the people I read about and enjoyed. As a happy reader it is not easy to restrain yourself from wanting to let Ann know everything you want her to know about yourself over cocktails and hamburgers.Having read my book on my Kindle I had no paper book for her to sign. But, I suggested to Ann she autograph the stainless steel back of the Kindle in Sharpie ink, a first for her. She may well be doing Kindle signings for Spice Necklace as she was leaving for a book tour.I am now home, enjoying my memories of two weeks in the Spice Islands, and now enjoying \\"Spice Necklace\\".I highly recommend \\"An Embarrassment of Mangoes\\", whether or not you are going to Grenada or contemplating a life changing adventure. The story is genuine, well written and thoroughly entertaining. If you never leave your easy chair except to grab some food, you will go somewhere else warm and wonderful that I can confirm is a reality.As someone who changed their life by going \\"island time\\" I truly appreciated this story.Enjoy a genuine adventure with a genuine tour guide and read this book."},{"Title":"An Embarrassment of Mangoes: A Caribbean Interlude","review":"Many dream of sailing off to points south, escaping the demands of urban life. In an Embarassment of Mangoes, Vanderhoof shows us it can be done as she chronicles her two year cruise from Toronto to Trinidad and back. Along the way she reminds us that cruising isn't a vacation it's a lifestyle, and as Vanderhoof describes it, a rich lifestyle.Throughout the book Vanderhoof presents a balanced account of the joys, frustrations, fears, and tedium of life aboard a 40 foot sailboat. Along the way she provides glimpses of island culture and characters while examining her life as it slows down to island time, \\"jus' now.\\" An added bonus are the regional recipes at the end of each chapter, be sure to try the Lobster Curry!Engaging and easily read, Mangoes is a book about the why, not the how to go cruising.

However, it was a lifesaver for me in many respects. I had copied some of the recipes out of it before I left as I wanted to try them while cruising. Not only did we use the recipes (which were very good), it really gave me a feel for what to take (and not to take) as well as the things I would need to watch for on a cruise. The best example was when we caught a conch. Amazingly, I had the instructions for cleaning it on the page with a recipe. It worked perfectly and saved us incredible amounts of work.The only downside to this book is that I am now longing to do exactly what they did, take a two year cruise!"},{"Title":"An Embarrassment of Mangoes: A Caribbean Interlude","review":"I have just completed a very similar trip on a 49 ft sailboat to Trinidad from Lake Ontario.

The book tells of their challenges and joys in living and traveling on their sailboat, of their discovery of the cultures, peoples, and foods of the Caribbean, and how the journey changed them forever.

His dream was taking time off to sail to and around the Caribbean. If she had a dream; long, scary sailing trips were not part of it. Still, shaking in her flip-flops, she helped him pursue this dream and did pretty darn well. They spent several years saving and preparing. Anne was the founder and editor of Cottage Life Magazine. Her husband, Steve, worked for her magazine.When they finally leave I can feel Anne's fear. Maybe because my husband would like to do the same thing and I haven't ever been on a (moving) sailboat. They were very well prepared and organized, but there were still very scary times.I liked that they were sincerely interested in getting to know the native people and the islands. They didn't treat the people as though they were there only for their convenience--they wanted to learn from them and build friendships. That is really the heart of the book.Sprinkled throughout the book are tested recipes that are as authentic as Anne could make them. Quite a bonus.I heartily recommend this book to anyone whether they dream of sailing or not.I learned recently that Anne and her husband sailed down to the Caribbean again on their boat.

I'm not a sailor, but I do crave adventure. Not knowing all the boating terminology didn't stop me from vicariously getting on board and loving every minute of her trip! Ann's writing made me feel the balmy breezes' kiss, taste the sweet mangoes enough so I nearly wiped juice off my chin, and even get tipsy from the tropical rums. I loved her foodie angle showcasing all the local produce in recipes she cooked and printed for readers. Even more, I loved the bits of history thrown in educating me on a world that is in our hemisphere yet mysterious. Needless to say, I have a yen now to chuck my world and stow away on a ship heading for Grenada.

But who cares about those kinds of closed-minded people anyway?

The love that these two feel for the areas they live in becomes infectious. The recipes are interesting but where would this Michigan resident find the ingredients? When the author is writing about the people she meets, Mr. Butter, the Minister of Rum, Dingis and family, those are the most WONDERFUL passages in the book.

He said it has been influential for him and has given him lots to think about."},{"Title":"An Embarrassment of Mangoes: A Caribbean Interlude","review":"Well written, nice recipes, but the sailing part is pretty boring. The writer definitely doesn't like sailing. The usual story; the husband would like to go cruising; the wife follows him and hates the sailing part. If sailing is not in your blood... don't go, catch a plane! She wants us to believe that it is all very brave what they do, but with the house paid off, a whole package of insurances and without hardly any night passage, it sounds more like a Club Med adventure. If a cruiser is fussy in finding a hair salon in port and bug-busting bleaches everything that is on board (mooring lines, fruit,..!), I can only suggest to stick to cooking!"},{"Title":"An Embarrassment of Mangoes: A Caribbean Interlude","review":"Ok, so I am deeply regretting that I merely borrowed this book instead of buying it. So much so that its getting bought fairly quickly. It was a pretty good book and I was sorry when it ended.A nonfiction, it covers the two years that author Ann and her husband Steve go cruising in the Caribbean. They travel many places, weather many storms, and meet a lot of other cruisers and islanders. Some of the places they visit are the Dominican Republic, several towns along the Atlantic coast of the USA, and their favorite, Granada. All in all, they travel from Canada to the Caribbean and back again for quite a long journey. While Ann is not as thrilled about being on a boat at first, she soon takes to it, and she and Steve become pretty accomplished sailors and used to life on a cramped boat. Ann also does a lot of cooking with local ingredients.I love the way Ann describes the people in this. She is always so positive about her experiences and you can tell she truly is a people person and enjoys interacting with everyone. I especially like the deep friendship she has with a woman on Granada and how they exchange food and advice and even go back to visit her after the trip is over. They also meet several other unique cruisers with personalities that range all around. Most notable is the guy who is the expert on Rum. I also like how she explained about being closer to her husband with living on the boat because it is pretty tight quarters to be in with someone. Even so, with as cramped as it was for them, I can't imagine how it was for my mom when she was little and she, my grandparents, and her two brothers lived on a sailboat for a couple of years. I'm not sure I could handle it myself.Ann kind of bounces around in time with her travels and devotes more book time to some places than others. As said before, they really enjoyed Granada and this is where a good portion of the book takes place. Not that that's a bad thing, there was certainly enough to write about there. I have to say the only downfall to the writing was the amount of technical boat stuff that she wrote in. For those who like sailing or understand it this might have been ok, but I found it kind of boring. Luckily there wasn't too much of it in there. She more than makes up for it with her descriptions of food and cooking though. It made me want to quit my job and go to the Caribbean. Fresh conch, lobster, mangoes, etc. my mouth was definitely watering. And she included recipes too! The ultimate way to make me love a book (and want to buy it).Great travel narrative, foodie book, and more. I highly recommend it.An Embarrassment of MangoesCopyright 2004300 pagesReview by M. Reynard 2011"},{"Title":"An Embarrassment of Mangoes: A Caribbean Interlude","review":"This is the best Caribbean Sailing Book I have ever read. If you want a great story of a couple that give up their life to sail the Caribbean this is it. Ann does a great job detailing her adventure and gives an great look at the wonderful residents of the islands. All too often all we associate with the islands are the tourist traps set up by the cruise/hotel industry. Ann tells us that there is so much more and that the islands are full of good careing people. Weather you plan a sailing trip of your own or you just want to learn more about the islands and their people this is the book. Great job Ann."},{"Title":"An Embarrassment of Mangoes: A Caribbean Interlude","review":"This is a relaxing, fun read. The stories about the sailboat, the culinary adventures, island life, traditions, culture and people are funny, warm and moving. You can't help but fall in love and you will want to plan your own life's adventure (at least in your head). :)"},{"Title":"An Embarrassment of Mangoes: A Caribbean Interlude","review":"This was the best book I have read in a long time! Vanderhoof transports the reader to the cockpit of her sailboat and beyond, and takes you along with her on all her island adventures. She beautifully captures the essence of all the different islands she visits and even includes recipes that highlight the cultures she encounters along the way! I am on my third reading already and I continue to be entertained by her humor and love of the islands and cruising life. Have even begun to wonder about giving it a try myself! Thanks to Ann Vanderhoof for this first hand look at what it's like to chase your dream."},{"Title":"An Embarrassment of Mangoes: A Caribbean Interlude","review":"This was a good summer beach read. We've all wanted to pick up and sail off into the sunset, but the author actually did it. The idea of mixing in recipes through the book was interesting, but what really caught me was the characters. I felt like I was traveling with them and, when they returned to the cold waters of their home port, after 2 years in the Caribbean, I felt as sad as they were that the journey was over."},{"Title":"An Embarrassment of Mangoes: A Caribbean Interlude","review":"If you love to travel you will love this book. If you have never left your home I still suggest you read this book. This came up on my kindle recommend reading list after I had downloaded The Sex Lives of Cannibals and Getting Stoned with Savages (also good travel books but for another review). I'm really glad I decided to add this one to my summer reading list. As someone who loves to cook I also really appreciated that she added some recipes after telling you about some amazing meals. I'm looking forward to trying some of them. The book never really gets dull and carries you the whole way through. It's not a difficult read. It's lighthearted but still has plenty of depth. I hope she writes another one."},{"Title":"An Embarrassment of Mangoes: A Caribbean Interlude","review":"What a fun and well written romp through the Caribbean. Seeing through the author's eyes the differences between many of the island nations was fascinating, and there is just enough introspection and connection to people living on the different islands. Yes, there is a bit of food talk, and no I'm not an avid cook and have yet to try anything in the book, but it is the adventure that permeates your soul and makes you feel you've traveled there....certainly before I take my next multi-island Caribbean trip I will reread this book. I first read it years ago and it is one of those books that stays with you, becoming part of your world view. Love it! Read it to replace a vacation or while on vacation....just read it!"},{"Title":"An Embarrassment of Mangoes: A Caribbean Interlude","review":"Originally bought for my father, a lifelong sailor, when he was recovering from open-heart surgery, this book quickly became a favorite for both my mother (a dedicated nonsailor) and me (an ocean-loving, vicarious sailor.) The author recounts the story of her and her mate's journey from two perspectives: the sailor's and the workaholic-turned-cruisaholic. For anyone who has dreamed of tossing the plan, the daily grind, the in-the-rut job, this book will be enough impetus to consider a life less ordered. The recipes alone are worth the price of the book; my mother's and my favorites are the crab cakes and the rum punch. Just typing those words makes me want to stop and cook. Buy this book, dream a little dream of your own, and spice up your cooking island-style. As for me, I'm going sailboat shopping..."},{"Title":"An Embarrassment of Mangoes: A Caribbean Interlude","review":"I bought this book for my boyfriend as he is an avid sailor. We are planning to follow much of the same route that the author took to sail the Caribbean islands for about 2 years and it was a great iinsight into places to visit and what to expect. She is a great story teller and makes me ready to take the same adventure and live life to the fullest."},{"Title":"An Embarrassment of Mangoes: A Caribbean Interlude","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I was doing research on a taking up sailing for retirement, but this was just fun. And as previously mentioned, it's worth it just for the recipes. It was very well written, and I finished it within 24 hours."},{"Title":"An Embarrassment of Mangoes: A Caribbean Interlude","review":"\`embarassment of mangoes' is much less a sailing book than a \`wife's view' of a two-year vacation through the carribean. like plenty of sailing couples, ann vanderhoof does not really have the bug, and instead follows gamely along with partner on a toronto-carribean loop. she was the founder of \`cottages', a modern magazine incarnation of the \`house and garden' ilk, and the book is reads like a 200 page version of one of those chatty recipe article from \`cruising world' or \`coastal living': \`we pulled into unknown Bay x after a horrid/delightful/tumultuous passage, and the next morning while drinking/walking/looking for parts, we fortuitously ran into authentic local fisherman/housewife/fellow sailing couple/non-profit organizer, who fed us amazing/delicious/tasty local x, and here is the recipe.' the peril of a dragging anchor is in this book is equal parts damage to the boat and the threat of upsetting the dinner guests; ms. vanderhoof's sense of adventure is heightened by the profound psychological growth of giving up her toronto hairdresser for two years. and on and on. for a girly-girl sailing adventure, there is precious little about their relationship, hubbie steve instead plays a background role as a sort of invisible lovable oaf. Ann is certainly a capable writer and the book flows along on an even if somewhat predictable and superficial keel, like a seamless dinner conversation with someone intent on subtly pushing their vacuous politically correct message points: we were authentic - we developed real friendships with the locals! we do care about the environment - we felt bad about tossing that old fishing net garbage back into the sea! it did seem like a shame to develop the old man's veggie patch into a resort! we did meet all the icons of the carribean: herb the weatherman & the minister of rum. we gave alms to the poor islanders! we went back to visit! we were sad when it was over, really! So if you're a serious armchair sailor, this book may not be so compelling, the author's progress over two years from ICW to \`not being scared of an overnight passage' is child's play. For very light vacation reading of the carribean, or if you're a domestic, tag-along spouse, perhaps sitting on a cruiseboat wondering what life on a sailboat is like, \`EoM' may be just the ticket. It is certainly pleasant, light reading -- and the recipes at the end of each chapter do look fantastic."},{"Title":"An Embarrassment of Mangoes: A Caribbean Interlude","review":"It's a good read for these winter days, a nice, long, leisurely tour of the Caribbean islands over a couple of years, taken by sailboat. The food and drink recipes at the end of most chapters make it easy to travel along with the crew of the Receta-Ann and her husband Steve-by preparing for yourself the same cuisine they enjoyed. And, it's heartwarming to see them get along for the entire two years-there's no crisis, no threats of divorce, just a happy couple taking a long break and learning to see some of the nicer things in life."},{"Title":"An Embarrassment of Mangoes: A Caribbean Interlude","review":"What a great book! Ann Vanderhoof gives a rich portrayal of the Caribbean that most of us never see, but surely want to.An Embarrassment of Mangoes is infused with warmth, color, and flavor. As if the vivid descriptions of local markets (you can smell the fruit), ancient rum distilleries, and exploration via the local buses aren't enough, the variety of characters she meets bring the islands to life.Best, Vanderhoof and her husband are easy to identify with. They took their midlife break on a sailboat. She relates challenges and experiences with a humor that non-sailors will enjoy, and a level of detail that I'm sure sailors will appreciate. But her trip is no near-death escapade. These are real people on an achievable adventure, doing something all of us could do. Vanderhoof steers us off the beaten path to sample real life, deftly capturing the local food, music, language and, most of all, the Caribbean spirit.&quot;Ann of a Thousand Deadlines&quot; (as she calls her former self) never admits bravery, but her will to leave a good job and the comfort of everyday life for two years shows real courage. The book and its premise are compelling. The recipes at the end of each chapter are a bonus (my wife has already baked the Spicy Island Gingerbread).I want to go. Now that I have read An Embarrassment of Mangoes, I feel I have gone.As the review on the book cover says, &quot;what travel writing is all about.&quot; Give this one an unarguable five stars."},{"Title":"An Embarrassment of Mangoes: A Caribbean Interlude","review":"I don't write a lot of reviews, but thought this book deserved more attention. Since reading it, after American Airlines thought enough of it to include excerpts in their magazine, I was intrigued by the stories of the islands, the people, the culture, the food and sailing the Caribbean (good weather and bad). First off, I love to travel to off-the-beaten path countries and I love to cook (and eat!) different cuisines. This book is perfect if you have these interests. It doesn't hurt that the author is a travel writer, but this is much more than a travelogue or cookbook. I don't like fiction so much, thus this is perfect non-fiction. Ann could not have possibly made up more interesting stories about the people and conducting life on the islands and the boat. I now have a yearning to visit Grenada, Trinidad and some of the other colorful islands. The author must have been concerned she was going to make Grenada more popular, but it probably was well on its way before her book. Good luck Ann! Thanks for sharing your adventure. Your storytelling and descriptive style paints a warm picture of wonderful people and places."},{"Title":"An Embarrassment of Mangoes: A Caribbean Interlude","review":"First, this is not Mr. Junger's, &quot;Perfect Storm&quot; the epic of battling one of the worst storms in history or even similar to the &quot;Dove&quot; in which Robin L Graham sails singlehanded around the world. This is simply a book recounting the events of a couple who have done what many of us dream about...leaving the fast paced world behind for awhile and adapting to the world they enter.I appreciate that it was Ann that wrote it as she shows her fears of overnight passages and weather reports. She not only talks about great food but gives so many receipes that it will take us all awhile to try them.Overall, I appreciate this book mostly because Ann and her husband Steve didn't try to change those they came in contact with to what they were used to but rather adapted or more likely adopted the lifestyle of those around them. So many times when people travel to get away they bring everything with them they are trying to rid themselves of. Ann and Steve tried the local food, socialized with the local people and were ultimately courteous and thoughtful.Thank you!"},{"Title":"An Embarrassment of Mangoes: A Caribbean Interlude","review":"Thank you Ann Vanderhoof for taking me out of my winter slump with&quot;An Embarrassment of Mangoes&quot;. Ann and her partner Steve made a life decision to kiss their clock-driven lives in Toronto good-bye so they sailed south for two years on their 42 foot boat, Receta. The good news for us is that &quot;An Embarrassment of Mangoes&quot; makes it possible for us to share in their journey: the sun, the food, the humor, the food, the water, the food, the good times, the food (complete with recipes). The scary parts happen when the weather steps in. &quot;An Embarrassment of Mangoes&quot; exudes the warmth of the Caribbean. We meet extraordinary people: the Minister of Rum, Dingis and her family and Mr. Butters in his garden of Eden. All of this is why you'll cry your eyes out at the end of the book as Ann and Steve head back north, leaving behind their new friends and a part of their hearts. And a part of mine."},{"Title":"An Embarrassment of Mangoes: A Caribbean Interlude","review":"Having just returned from the Caribbean, this book was like a return visit. Sitting up here in upstate New York, where snow is measured in feet rather than inches, I savoured every page of this book. Ms. Vanderhood has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you are there among those wonderful island people. She really brought them and all of quirky differences between islands to life. Sometimes I actually felt I was right there on the sailboat with them and could feel the waves rocking us back and forth. For anyone who loves the Caribbean, or for that matter, anyone whose ever wanted to chuck it all and sail away --this book is for you!"},{"Title":"An Embarrassment of Mangoes: A Caribbean Interlude","review":"I definitely enjoyed Vanderhoof's narrative voice. And what a delightful surprise to find recipes scattered throughout. I must say that reading this book made me very hungry (even if it's not making me want to sail around the world...I'm all for world travel, but I'm not very comfortable on sailboats)This was such a wonderful adventure. Vanderhoof's writing is pleasant, evocative, unexpected, comforting...it was just the right feel for this story. And, seriously, these people did this trip up right. Woot!! Let's here it for having REAL vacation experiences and meeting real people...not hiding in a steralized resort in some disneyfied island. It was great getting to take this trip (without having to take this trip). I've photocopied almost every recipe from the book (Except the conch recipes...I don't feel familiar enough with this seafood in order to attempt cooking it). I made the chicken with fresh cheese and avacado last night and it was DIVINE. Yum. We're making the Coo-coo polenta dish tonight and plan to try the Bahamian Mac & Cheese next week. Also, the rum punch recipe will make an appearance at saturday's party.Not only is this a great read, but it's full of great food too."},{"Title":"An Embarrassment of Mangoes: A Caribbean Interlude","review":"This is a book in which I got so caught up, I had to make an effort to not pick it up to read when I was supposed to be doing something else. Another bonus, in my opinion, is that there are recipes at the end of each chapter.With a title like \\"An Embarrassment of Mangoes\\", the book, by AnnVanderhoof was enough to catch my attention since mangoes are my most favorite fruit of all. Even though the story was not particularly about mangoes, but about the sailing adventures of a couple of forty-something publishing professionals from Toronto who had decided to temporarily leave their deadline-dominated lives and follow a plan spanning several years and sail off into the sunset for a couple of years.Their adventures in a sailing boat they called \\"Receta\\" which is Spanish for recipe, took them all the way down to the Lower Antilles. The recipes throughout are the result of Ann's love of cooking and her natural curiosity about the sometimes strange and exotic foods she encountered on the way.Though this particular book is more of a travel journal rather than fiction, there are many other authors who combine novels and recipes......a delightful combination and one that is irresistible to me."},{"Title":"An Embarrassment of Mangoes: A Caribbean Interlude","review":"For the stressed out and winter-weary comes this transporting memoir that will appeal directly to escapist fantasies about leaving the work world behind and taking up residence in the nearest tropical locale. In AN EMBARRASSMENT OF MANGOES, the author and her husband do just that, and this enchanting, sun-drenched book intimately chronicles their life-changing two-year odyssey around the Caribbean aboard their sailboat Receta.Prior to the trip, Ann and Steve Vanderhoof were driven, forty-something professionals whose lives were dominated by demanding careers and a seemingly endless string of deadlines. This, coupled with their increasing weariness of harsh Toronto winters, made them long for a different way of life --- one that was far removed from overstuffed day timers and driveways that needed shoveling. Their escape fantasy began to form into a full-fledged action plan of penny pinching and preparation that eventually enabled them to live out their dream.After setting sail, the cruising life quickly seduces them as they discover the pleasures of living one day at a time and basking in simple delights such as fiery sunsets, freshly caught seafood and ice cold Presidente beers. But life onboard the boat isn't always smooth sailing as new challenges quickly take the place of old workaday worries: Tropical storms, perilous ocean crossings, the frequent threat of hurricanes and the daily struggle of living in tiny quarters with another human being for months on end are just a few of the trip's hazards. Nonetheless, the trade-off in exchange for a whole new way of life proves to be more than worth it.During their two-year voyage of discovery, the Vanderhoofs cover 7,000 nautical miles and explore forty-seven Caribbean islands, stretching from the Bahamas to as far south as Grenada. More than just tourists, they immerse themselves in the hypnotic rhythms of Caribbean life and culture, befriending the locals and soaking up the distinct music, flavors and essence of each port of call.Vanderhoof's particular passion for cooking infuses the text with a cacophony of delicious tastes and smells from the savory island dishes that she and her husband encounter, many of which she recreates in the ship's tiny galley using a variety of indigenous local ingredients discovered along the way. Peppered throughout the book are the results of her culinary explorations in the form of authentic, mouth-watering recipes for local specialties such as Bahamian cracked conch and West Indian rum punch. In addition to the gastronomic pleasures offered up, the profusion of sights, sounds and colors that leap from the page provide a veritable feast for the senses as well.Indeed, the book's biggest strength lies in Vanderhoof's extraordinary powers of description and her ability to make us feel as though we, too, are there. Under the spell of her ripe, evocative prose we can easily call to mind the heady perfume of mangoes in a marketplace, the sweet taste of fresh coconut milk on a hot day, and the dazzling colors of a Caribbean sunset streaked against a turquoise horizon. Interwoven with the sensuous depictions of lush scenery are the author's richly textured portraits of the colorful island inhabitants and fascinating snippets of local lore. Each of the islands has a distinct and varied personality, which Vanderhoof captures with beautiful lucidity.She uses this same keen blend of awareness and insight to chronicle the transformations that she and her husband undergo during the journey. As they overcome challenges, gain new skills and face their fears, their nervousness gives way to confidence and they grow in ways that they never could have imagined back home. In fully giving themselves over to a new way of life, their voyage becomes as much one of personal discovery as one of cultural and culinary adventure. This winning combination is what makes this island-by-island, meal-by-meal guide to the Caribbean so delicious to savor.--- Reviewed by Joni Rendon"},{"Title":"An Embarrassment of Mangoes: A Caribbean Interlude","review":"This is a wonderful book for those who love the Caribbean and sailing.

The story is simple but enjoyable, the introspection and self-awareness of the author are mildly enlightening, and the people of the islands are painted with warmth and care, but the book lacks a certain something that left me feeling less than satisfied. The writing, I believe, is the culprit. Given that the subject matter is tropical islands and a very challenging sailing adventure, there is very little actual description in this book. I wanted more visuals, more of a sensory connection to the journey and in that realm the writing simply did not deliver.The author's personal transformation from workaholic to grateful traveler is notable, the cultural notes are great, and the characters are likable.I was tempted to give it three stars, but I went with four to err on the generous side.

Among other things, it is the first book on a cruising trip that I have seen with recipes using local ingredients.More than that though, Ms. Vanderhoof discusses her initial fears and concerns and her later comfort with sailing. All of us have initial fears to some degree, maybe especially if we start sailing as adults.Also, there are funny and poignant stories. For example, her doctor noticed a lot of bruises on her body and asked her if her husband was beating her. The answer: No, we're just sailing.

Unfortunately, some of the most intriguing things the author described are no longer there, but the potential for similar adventures is.

So, why did we endorse a sailing book in an RV newsletter? And specifically in a newsletter about RV kitchens?We were hooked by the opening sentence: \\"Perhaps the hardest thing, we realized in hindsight, was making the decision to go.\\" This is really far more than just another sailing story. It is the story of Ann Vanderhoof and her husband Steve - driven forty- something professionals desperate for a break from their type-A, deadline-dominated, career-defined lives. We find that they do as many RVers have done: they quit their jobs, shake off the restraints that have bound them to their desks, and take off on a journey of self-discovery.This is a light hearted book which straddles two genre: travel writing and cooking (their 42 foot sailboat is named Receta - \\"recipe\\" in Spanish). Ann often takes the measure of a place through her stomach - a style of evaluation we can relate to. This book is far more than another travel book - it is a culinary adventure. Working in an impossibly small kitchen, the author explores island food and shares recipes with the reader. (It was the Vanderhoof's adventure on the Intracoastal Waterway which moved us to experiment with shrimp and grits . . . and to develop the recipe we shared in our November Newsletter.)Join Ann and Steve on their 16-nation, 47-island, 7,000-nautical mile journey. Along the way we doubt you'll be able to resist her Cream of Callaloo Soup, Sauted Dorado with Creole Tomato Sauce, and Spicy Island Gingerbread!Ann Vanderhoof's immersion into local cultures and cuisines serves as a model for food loving travelers everywhere - both on and off of the water.

I read it during the summer, however, I think it would have been better to read in the winter...a nice escape from reality. Although the recipes are a little much (I doubt I could find 3/4 of the ingredients in the states, at least, not where I live), Mrs. Vanderhoof does a great jobs with her characters...I especially enjoyed reading about the rum guy!A great light read!"},{"Title":"An Embarrassment of Mangoes: A Caribbean Interlude","review":"This book is a fun, easy read. Their journey sounded so dreamy, even when complications arose. The variation of topics - nautical-speak, weather, food, travel, interesting characters, fun - held my interest throughout the book.I wish I could give four and a half stars. My complaints are superficial and did not take away from my enjoyment in reading this book. I thought it was a novel idea to include recipes, but most of the time, even with the author's descriptions, I didn't have much of an idea as to what the ingredients actually were, or, if I did, I have no idea where I would procure them in Boston, Mass. I mostly skipped over these pages (I am a *bit* of a cook). Also, I wish the book was longer! Gone for two years, I'm sure that Ann, an editor nonetheless, could have blessed us with another hundered or so pages. Lastly, I was dissappointed there was no epilogue - I wanted to know how Ann and Steve settled back into *normal* life, what they do now, and if they are going to take another cruising journey."},{"Title":"An Embarrassment of Mangoes: A Caribbean Interlude","review":"I must admit, I am a bit of a dreamer... Who hasn't dreamt of doing what Ann and Steve did? I lived vicariously through them with this book. It is a touching story of the people living in the islands they visited. Really grabbed me. Having lived in the Caribbean, her stories of the places they visited brought back fond memories of fantastic cultures. And how touching that they got to know the locals and step into their life. This is a wonderful book which I highly recommend to anyone dreaming of sailing to the caribbean, or someone actually doing it. It is a helpful guide and a wonderful story inviting the reader into their lives.

This time he has a nuisance to deal with, a sexy Manara girl with designs on becoming an invisible super-criminal.The story is slightly more sophisticated than in the original Butterscotch, but not so much so that it hinders one's enjoyment of the artwork.This work relies heavily on visual elements, especially the female form. Manara uses invisibility as a device to enable us to look at the female form in new and different (and highly erotic) ways.If you buy this book, expect beautiful, sensual, high quality illustrations, not deep wordy dialogue or overly complicated plots and characters. END"},{"Title":"Butterscotch 2","review":"For those of you not too terribly squeamish about erotica, this book,this artist, and this title is one that is not really so embarrasing to be seen sitting on your shelf. It is entirely possible to present 'sexual situations\\" in a novel, amusing, and entertaining manner. Milo Manara has set the bar fairly high. Yes there are some sexual encounters, and you might not want the pastor, over for afternoon tea, to accidentally pick this one up (he might say...\\"Can we talk...ahem!\\"). On the other hand, Manara seems to delight in coitus interruptus; and holding the reader just short of fulfillment. He manages to accomplish this marathon by placing his (fantasy girl) objet d' (ahem!) in situations of almost, but not quite being fulfilled or finished, or \\"completed\\" herself, via way of numerous chance, impromptu sexual encounters, and then hurrying on with the , always, intriguing storyline. You will perceive her , in a word, as \\"such a tease\\". Even if you think you are above such things, you might find yourself wanting to (ahem!...never mind) her yourself!"},{"Title":"Butterscotch 2","review":"Many of Manaras books are outstanding, not only because of his great art, but because the story is smart and funny! Ahhh...but i am afraid this one is no masterpiece. Is the art good? Yes, but even here it's not top notch. The story in this one is just not very smart...if this is the first book you purchased by Manara (and of this nature), you might like it...but comparing it to the first Butterscotch, it falls very short. Sometimes youre just going to say, 'this is stupid' and these situations hurt the book. If your looking for something nice and funny by Milo Manara, I would recomend: &quot;Butterscotch&quot;, &quot;Gullivera&quot;, another hot title is &quot;Click 1-3&quot;, and &quot;To see the stars&quot;."},{"Title":"My Life with the Chimpanzees","review":"I liked the book because it was an adventure story. In one part, the plane crashed. Jane Goodall, Grub (her son), and Derreck (the pilot) didn't get hurt, but they had to cross a river full of crocodiles! I also like the book because it is about Africa, a continent I only know a little about. Besides the amazing animals, I learned that there are important fossil beds in Africa.Chimps are a central part of the story. The author does a good job of describing the chimps' habits and behavior. The chimps challenge each other for the alpha position (highest ranked position in the group).I found Jane Goodall likeable because she has interest in saving an endangered species. She reported that chimps can make tools and use them as well as we can. No one knew that before Jane discovered it. Dr. Goodall is also the leader of a special club dedicated to saving chimpanzess.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes the fascinating behavior of animals."},{"Title":"My Life with the Chimpanzees","review":"This is a beautiful book, grasping your atention and holding your hand thru a fantastic journey into Africa, and into the chimpanzes of the Gombe.

Kids: get your parents to buy it for you! Inspiring! I am now 22, but I must have been 10 when I first read this book (not this edition of course!).

She wanted to read about Abraham Lincoln... until she found out she had to dress up as the book's subject! Regrouping with a week to go and a driving vacation looming, I rushed to find a children's biography available in audio download... and stumbled upon this gem. We all listened to the (abridged) audio version on the trip, and I do think that hearing it read by the author added a great deal. My daughter read the unabridged book with fascination when we got home, though I suspect she might have had more difficulty relating to the book had she not heard Jane Goodall speak her own words first. At any rate, the report (outfitted with khakis, a notebook, and a velcro-handed stuffed chimp) was a great success, and my daughter has met a role model of determination, compassion, and wisdom."},{"Title":"My Life with the Chimpanzees","review":"An excellent book! Reading about the extraordinary life Jane Goodall has led is fascinating in itself. Add to it the personalities of the chimps you get to know as you read the book and the adventures Jane Goodall has experienced, and you have a fascinating read.

I bought this book for her as a birthday present. I would guess that it is written at at least a 3rd to 4th grade reading level. I read it aloud to my 8- and 6-year old girls. It is a short autobiography. We all liked the fact that it started with Jane's life as a young girl and then detailed how she ended up working with chimps. It also discussed her life with the chimps in detail, how she set up camp (her mother stayed with her at first, which I think is a charming detail) and various adventures that she had. The only part of the book that I did not care for so much was the final chapter which gets a little preachy about taking care of animals and the world. But even that doesn't bother me so much because she's RIGHT -- and my girls did listen and take what Jane Goodall wrote to heart.This is a lovely book for anyone interested in Jane Goodall's work, anyone who needs a good autobiography project, who's interested in the life of a self-made woman, or who just loves nature. I felt that Jane Goodall had a good writing voice directed towards her intended audience -- children -- but that it was not childish. She treats the children reading the book as though they can make a difference and she does not dumb down or overly simplify her experience."},{"Title":"My Life with the Chimpanzees","review":"I work at the zoo with the Apes.

Though I admire her championing of chimpanzees, I found her to be a rather self-absorbed egoiste who *liked* to emphasize how out of touch she was with mundane stuff (being so much more esoteric with her own chosen lifestyle). SHe was also a poor listener (other than to chimps) who never quite answered questions she was asked since she was on her own little self-absorbed bandwagon. Some of her comments were actually rather crackpot worthy as well. Just consider the title of this book--all about me and how austere and individual I am blah blah blah.

The line quality is much spikier, the characters' facial expressions are more cartoony, and details have been changed, such as the removal of the little toy car at the bottom center which used to be part of the image. The changes are easy to see if you compare to the picture of the 1980's reprint posted by William G. Elliott.If publishers are going to change illustrations, they should call the book a \\"reinterpretation\\" or \\"revised version\\", rather than a \\"reprint\\", which implies that there have been no changes.

That is the only story from this book that I remember vividly, these ten years later, since it went from inspiring to hilarious and back to inspiring from one paragraph to the next. I'll never forget being shocked, horrified, yet intrigued with the part about how Twain accidentally started a forest fire at the edge of the lake while making dinner, and how he and his friend were driven off the land by the flames. From their little boat they watched fascinated for four hours at the spectacle reflected in the lake while the fire consumed the undergrowth and the trees and raged over the ridges and away through the mountains.A few years ago, on a steamboat called the Delta Queen that takes tourists out on Lake Tahoe, I met a Mark Twain impersonator who has managed to get permission to have the cove where Twain and his friend watched the blaze dedicated to Twain.

It is a reminder of how vigilant we must be if there is any chance of preserving these wonders for future generations.The book was a gift that sat on my shelf for over 10 years before I came across it just before a trip to the Sierra Nevada this summer. During this trip my wife and I took a day trip to Desolation Wilderness and were awed by the beauty of it - and with record snowfalls this past year, the Sierra is buzzing with life. We were also stunned to find empty cigarette packs and other litter along the trails. It reminded me that the final chapter of Reid's book is yet to be written.The book is a fabulous read, and as other reviewers have pointed out, the relatively short pieces make it an easy book to work into one's day. Reid's introductions to each writing provide excellent context and help weave a cohesive story out of what is a very complex history.For me, it helped to reinvigorate my interest in the outdoors and prompted me to plan more time with my family enjoying nature.Shawn"},{"Title":"A Treasury Of The Sierra Nevada","review":"I already had a copy of the book when I purchased this copy for a friend.

Medina's primary focus in this undertaking was to justify Orellana's behavior in disjoining from Pizarro. This particular publication is further edited in 1934 by Dr. H. C. Heaton who adds additional insights to Medina's version.The actual journal itself by Carvajal is an historical masterpiece depicting extreme hardships, misfortunes and skirmishes with Amazonian natives. For fifty men who were in uncharted territory and really had no idea where they were going, this is a work of human fortitude.Medina's edition also includes Orellana's second expedition back to the Amazon for conquest of these lands.

The story includes Poirot's friend the mystery author Ariadne Oliver ( who bears a close resemblance to Agatha Christie).The book is narrated in the third person. It is always delicious fun when Poirot and Oliver join wits to defeat crime!Plot: Ariadne Oliver the famous crime novelist is attending a literary party. She meets the obesely odious Mrs Burton-Cox. This grand dame informs Ariadne that her stepson Desmond is planning to wed Cecilia Ravenscroft. Desmond is the son of Kathleen Fee who was the mistress of Mrs. Burton-Cox's first husband. Fee was a wealthy actress who has died leaving a large fortune to DesmondBurton-Cox wants Ariadne to investigate Celia' background. It is believed that Miss Ravencroft's parents committed suicide. Another theory is that Celia's father Sir Alistair Ravenscroft killed his much younger wife Molly or she murdered him. The murderer was then believed to have killed him/herself The unsolved case occurred some fifteen years prior to the novel's action.Ariadne refers to persons who worked or were otherwise acquainted with the deceased Ravenscroft couple as old elephants. This is because Oliver hopes those she interviews have good memories like elephants! Ariadne and her friend Hercule Poirot visit these characters hoping to learn more details about the murder/suicide. We learn of the romantic triangle involving Sir Ravenscroft and the twin sisters Molly and Dolly. Dolly has spent time in a mental institution. She was living with her sister and Sir Alistair at the time of the tragic deaths. Dolly is thought to have murdered a child in India as well as her son. Four wigs and a dog bite will clarify the crime.Though a very late Hercule Poirot novel I thought this entry in the Christie canon provides a good read. It is not one of her greatest mysteries but is a good solid read. Well done Dame Agatha!"},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"I am a die hard fan of Agatha Christie, especially Poirot. Even to me this novel was boring and dragging. There is very little story. The plot doesn't have the juice enough to sustain a novel. It could have done well as a short story.With the dog biting the mistress, I was able to guess the ending. I have never correctly guessed ever before when it came to Christie novels.At some point, the book felt more like a psychology book, only the contents may not be correct psychologically. I wish I hadn't started this book in the first place. There are a lot of repetitive events in the books which is really tiresome. Anyway, I wish a better experience to anyone who wants to read this book."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"This novel is very slow moving, repetitve and it is totally lacking in charm or suspense. There was not enough material for a novel in this story. Poor Poirot! Poor reader. Skip this one."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"Detective novelist (and Christie alter ego) Ariadne Oliver has been coaxed into attending a literary party, something she, like Christie, did not enjoy and avoided whenever possible. Mrs. Oliver's experience at this one would ensure that it would be a long time before she attended another. An overbearing woman, Mrs. Burton-Cox manages to corner the author cross examine her about her goddaughter, one of many Mrs. Oliver has managed to acquire through the years. And now that the young woman, Celia, is quite grown up, one with which Mrs. Oliver has quite lost touch. It seems that Celia and Mrs. Burton-Cox's son are engaged, or will soon be, and Mrs. Burton-Cox wants to know if Celia's mother killed her father or did her father kill her mother. Mrs. Oliver was quite shocked by the rudeness of the encounter and troubled about what to do about it so she contacted her friend, Hercule Poirot, for guidance in the matter. Soon the pair, each in their own unique way, begin to tackle the problems, re-establishing contact with Celia, investigating the old tragedy and finding out just why Mrs. Burton-Cox is so insistance on knowing the answer.For fans of Ariadne Oliver this is a particular treat, giving the reader more information into her (and perhaps Christie's) personal life, than any previous stories. It is interesting to see Oliver's and Poirot's different approaches to investigation, even to the point of different interpretations of what the actual problem is.This is not the cleverest mystery that Christie ever wrote, nor even the best written but it is a very enjoyable one none the less and is a definite must read for any Poirot or Oliver fan."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"Christie books never disappoint. I haven't read one of her books in years, but I am reminded again why she is the gold standard against which all others are measured.

I enjoyed reading this and would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"This book was one of the worst Agatha Christie books I've ever read.

First, there is a marked lack of action of any kind. Elephants Can Remember is concerned with an investigation into deaths that happened entirely in the past. Therefore, the whole book consists of conversations. There is never any danger or threat to anyone living, so there is no element of \\"excitement\\" as in most of Christie's other books.The second weakness that I would point out is that the solution of the mystery, as it were, becomes fairly apparent to the reader about mid-way through; the rest of the time is spent waiting for Hercule Poirot's amazing gray cells to figure it out and catch up to what the reader/listener already knows. The third weakness is that the solution to the mystery involved actions that I found entirely unbelievable. I won't expand any further than that so as to not spoil the story for anyone who hasn't yet read it, but Christie had a couple of characters behave in ways that were quite reprehensible, but that is never called into question. Her explanation for it, as it were, doesn't hold water.The only really excellent thing about this book is the narration."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"Not her best work but an enjoyable read-I'm not an Ariadne Oliver fan so maybe thats why I didn't love it"},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"I enjoyed this book very much.

But I had no idea this was her final book, or that her mind was so far gone by the time she wrote it. I feel bad for her. She is truly a classic, and one of my favorite writers of all time.

I love horror and mystery books and I'm so glad I found Agatha Christie. I cant wait to read even more Agatha Christie books."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"I found this late Agatha Christie novel disappointing compared to most of her earlier works. The plot line involves a murder mystery that happened in the past. Much of the novel is devoted to unraveling what happened through conversations with various people who knew the people involved. There is so much repetitiveness as the chatty Ms Oliver talks to all those people, hashes things out in her mind, then tells Poirot what she was told, then he hashes things in his own mind, then he tells others, ... Uh! The same \\"fact\\" or \\"theory\\" is repeated in many places, to the point of insulting the reader's intelligence. This is so unlike Christie where every word had its purpose. Perhaps one better think of this novel as a study of human memory. Overall I give it 2.5 stars."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"Elephants Can Remember is Dame Christie's last Poiret full-length story according to most sources and written when the author was clearly playing the back nine. This is one of the few detective novels that even I could figure out who had done it and most of the methods long before the Belgian detective assembled the remaining characters at the scene of the crime.Some will say this is Christie's weakest product. I have not read them all so I will not make that judgement but it clearly suffers from a worn out plot and formulaic proceedings. We all know that elephants are claimed in nursery rhymes to never forget but this seems to be a revelation to Poiret and the aging writer Miss Oliver. As Christie's alter-ego, Miss Oliver is suffering the foibles of age, including total inability to recall anything or anyone, and stress over shortcomings in one's career, such as writer's block, and fear of crowds and public speaking.In a clever construct, both Poiret and Miss Oliver set out simultaneously to determine the relevant facts in a decade-old case of murder, suicide, or accidental death. Poiret warns all at the on-set that nothing good will come from this painstaking re-enactment but it seems there are always some things that daughters and odious in-laws need to know. Unfortunately for Miss Christie's reputation, she relies on a tired method of including twins in the mix so we all can see where this is going, especially when it becomes clear that the late husband had been in love with both twins."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"Hugh Fraser is the perfect narrator for Agatha Christie books. Hercule Poirot and Ariadne Oliver banter back and forth and it is a delight to listen to this story. It kept me riveted from start to finish."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"It was with a certain sense of sadness that I read \\"Elephants Can Remember\\", knowing that it was the last book Agatha Christie ever wrote that featured the beloved characters of Hercule Poirot and Ariadne Oliver. Of course, there isCurtain, which stars Poirot and takes us to the end of his career as a detective, but this had been written several years prior in order to give Poirot a proper send-off and published after Christie's death.So this, for all intents and purposes, is one of the last Poirot mysteries, and certainly the last appearance of Ariadne Oliver, the mystery novelist that Christie often used as a self-insert to convey her own experiences and frustrations as an author. These would range from Ariadne's irritation with her literary protagonist (as Christie similarly held toward Poirot), to her habit of eating apples while she worked, to her bemusement at certain readers who would write to her in order to point out her mistakes. Here, she expresses her awkwardness concerning fans that gush excessively over her work.At a literary lunch Ariadne is approached by a compete stranger and asked a question about a godchild she hasn't seen in years. The woman who introduces herself as Mrs Burton-Cox asked Ariadne an incredibly personal question concerning her god-daughter Celia Ravenscroft's deceased parents: was it Celia's mother who killed her father, or Celia's father who killed her mother? It takes a while for Ariadne to remember the circumstances that she's referring to, but finally recalls that Alistair and Margaret Ravenscroft were found shot dead near their house, in such a way that made it impossible for the police to tell whether it was a double suicide or a murder/suicide.Ariadne discovers that Mrs Burton-Cox's son is engaged to be married to Celia Ravenscroft, and suspects that his mother is trying to form a wedge between the two of them by insinuating that Celia may have inherited murderous impulses from one of her parents. But Ariadne seeks out her god-daughter's permission to investigate the deaths further, and wanting to know more about her parents' demise, Celia agrees. Naturally, it is to Hercule Poirot that Ariadne turns, and together the two of them go on the hunt for \\"elephants.\\"The witnesses are all elderly now, and it all happened so long ago, but Ariadne has faith in the \\"elephants\\" of the old saying; and Poirot agrees, believing that even little details and false assumptions may prove valuable. Together the two of them try to piece together the mystery of the past, in a book that relies heavily on oral testimony and the memories of those present.As a book written near the end of Christie's life, it's clear that she's slowing down. \\"Elephants Can Remember\\" has a few recycled concepts, several flat characters, and is one of only two of her books (thus far) in which I've been able to guess the conclusion far in advance. And trust me, if I can guess it, anyone can! There are lots of meandering speeches, some inconsistencies regarding the time-line, and many obvious details are held back simply because they would telegraph the ending too soon. Finally, solving the case has less to do with deduction than it does with finding the person who knew what happened all along.Yet there's a lingering presence of melancholy present that makes the story more important for its context than its content. Christie knew that she was nearing the end of her life when she wrote it, and so there's an emphasis on lost love, putting the past to rest, and young couples looking forward to the future with hope. Likewise, the fact that Christie may have been in the first stages of Alzheimer's disease brings certain bittersweetness to the fact that the novel relies so heavily on the importance of memory.It's rather sad to read, but impossible to dismiss if you are lasting fan of the author, especially since it's clear that Christie was getting ready to say goodbye."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"It is quite obvious, early on in this book, that the author was advanced in years. The math is off, so badly, and so often, whenever the subject of years comes up: how many years ago did it happen? How old is so-and-so now? etc. Also, the only character who remains essentially himself is Poirot, pretty much; Ariadne Oliver, though only supposedly middle-aged here, is more muddled than most eighty-year-olds I know. Even the victims' ages: 60 and 35? Pretty unusual, that. If the wife/victim were only 35, why was she so worried about her advancing age?So, if the reader can get past all the muddle, it is still an entertaining read, IF, as I say, the reader is a die-hard fan. I am, so it was worth it to me.PARTIAL SPOILER ALERT: Christie's denouement of the crime is about as unrealistic as it can get. She really hearkens back to very early Christie, in her inability to understand, much less handle, romantic love in any sort of realistic manner."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"I re-read this one recently, as it was one of the first Christie novels I read as a teen. Something about it had always stuck in my mind. It is interesting re-reading all her novels now and especially interesting to see the reviews of this one.Funnily enough I agree that it has several weaknesses and the fact that this is a \\"later Christie\\" shows. There are some points (a couple of children mentioned that I thought would at least be interviewed are only mentioned, no present-day action etc) that make this book compare unfavourably to her better ones. Also, Poirot doesn't quite sound like himself in this one and if Ariadne Oliver irritates you, you may want to pass anyway!Having said that, there is something quite melancholy and haunting about the ultimate resolution. If you take this more as a romantic mystery/tragedy, I think you will appreciate it better."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"I am on an Agatha Christie run right now. This book is a Hercule Poirot mystery. This is a story of a woman,Mrs. Ariadne Oliver, that is approached while at a literary luncheon by some one unknown to her, Mrs. Burton-Cox, about Mrs. Oliver's goddaughter's parents deaths fifteen years earlier. Mrs. Burton-Cox is curious to learn the truth about the murder/suicide of Celia Ravenscroft's parents.This was a different type of mystery that was interesting to follow. You already know who the victims are you are just trying to learn who was killed first. Who was the actual person to murder and then commit suicide. Mrs. Burton-Cox is concerned because her son and Celia are planning to get married. She doesn't want her son marrying some one who may decide to kill her son. As the story progresses you start to feel that there is an underlying reason for Mrs. Burton-Cox's true concerns."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"Elephants Can Remember (Hercule Poirot)As most people know, this was the last Hercule Poirot novel Dame Agatha Christie was to write. (CURTAIN, the last in the series had been written some years before with the intention of the author that it be published after her death). Again, as in FIVE LITTLE PIGSFive Little Pigs (Hercule Poirot), and HALLOWEEN PARTYHallowe'en Party (Hercule Poirot)Hercule Poirot will have to delve into the distant past in order to solve the mystery. (Miss Marple was also quite capable of doing this as inSleeping Murder (Miss Marple Mysteries).This novel satisfies any true Christie fan on several levels. A baffling mystery, the return of old friends like Ariadne Oliver, the mystery writer who was a kind of self-portrait of the author, and Mr. Goby, the mysterious character who seems to have the ability to find out anything about anyone.Altogether, as with almost ALL of the author's works---a good read for a cold winter's night! (also available as a kindle download:Elephants Can RememberOne note, Charles Osbourne, the self-professed Christie expert (who has even taken a stab at trying to write in her style with little success) posed a question in his essay on this book: \\"Why should a hand be covered in blood when all it has done is push someone over a cliff?\\"He should have read Dame Agatha's novel a little closer---that wasn't all it did.But don't worry---I won't tell you any more. GET the BOOK!!!"},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"Celia Ravenscroft is but a little girl when both her parents commit suicide. Never did she worry about the real reasons for that dramatic event, until today when she stands on the verge of getting married to Desmond Burton-Cox. Only one question suddenly seems of importance: Who killed whom, Celia's father or mother? Reason enough for Ariadne Oliver, Celia's godmother, to pay a visit to her old friend Hercule Poirot. The famous sleuth persuades Mrs. Oliver to delve -with his guidance, of course- into the past, to find the persons who are like elephants, the persons who will still remember the important details about this all-but-forgotten tragedy.Elephants Can Remember is Agatha Christie's next to last work of detection and the author shows clearly signs of age, which is understandable since she was eighty-two years old and in failing health.Elephants Can Remember is a \\"murder in retrospect\\" mystery. Although Christie has proven to fully master this format -see Sparkling Cyanide and Five Little Pigs- she now quickly looses touch with the story. She is forced to sow the narrative together with vague memories of a series of old spinsters and suddenly even events that should easily be remembered are covered by the veil of forgetfulness. No surprise that the plot is total confusion. It is less a mystery than a scrapbook of memories. Action is less important than atmosphere, which makes the story quite tedious and difficult to hang on to. Nevertheless, the experienced reader will figure out the solution to this not too mysterious mystery halfway through the book."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"This must be the worst Agatha Christie book ever. It's her very last Hercule Poirot novel, and one can see that the writer is very old by now (82). There is no freshness left in her prose; it is stale, predictable, corny, and generally trashy. As other reviewers have said, the material contained here would barely be enough to sustain a short story. To make a full-length novel out of this really is ridiculous. The book fails at what normally is Agatha Christie's greatest strength: the plot and the denouement. With dozens of pages left to go, the reader *knows* the solution! Unheard of in the world of Christie; if for nothing else, then for this the novel cannot be rated higher than 1 star. However, the characters and dialogs are boring and cliche-ridden as well, so the book has no redeeming qualities either. Nothing ever happens on the 200 pages of this book; no crime, no mystery, no real conflict among characters; it's all just endlessly boring talk, talk, and nothing but talk about the past. The only interesting thing, perhaps, is to contemplate the autobiographical hints Christie gives us in describing one of the novel's detectives, Ariadne Oliver -- a mystery writer. But these hints are only interesting because they throw light on our favourite writer, Agatha Christie -- they are not interesting in themselves and therefore do not improve the book's literary quality. It was excruciating to have to wade through the turgid prose of this book; this title cannot be recommended to anyone except extreme Christie enthusiasts."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"\\"Elephants Can Remember\\" does not read like a typical Hercule Poirot mystery. Agatha Christie's famed detective is drawn into an old case by his friend, the amateur sleuth and mystery writer Ariadne Oliver. The case involves what was apparently the double suicide of a loving husband and wife, and the concern that these past actions might have left a horrible impact upon their children.The story switches between the findings of Ariadne Oliver and Hercule Poirot as they each go in search of 'elephants' who might remember what happened around the time of the accident, because after all, an elephant never forgets. While there is no definite evidence as to what happened, there are those who have never accepted the double suicide theory because they couldn't answer the question why. But with Poirot and Mrs. Oliver working together, a long-unspoken truth is certain to be uncovered.\\"Elephants Can Remember\\" is classic Agatha Christie, in terms of mystery. It's central mystery has a unique, if perhaps a little predictable, twist, the denouement of which is quite evenly paced and satisfactory. However, this might be one novel where the time period of the plot is more glaring than others. The prose is heavy-handed at times and one does get a little sick of all the mentions of 'elephants'. The characters are borderline two-dimensional and, therefore, the reader does not care about them, even if they are still interested in the mystery at hand."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"I know Christie was pretty old when she wrote this book, so it pains me to be so negative, but her age really does show. The story isn't interesting, the mystery isn't mysterious and the characters are paper-thin -- even Poirot seems like a shadow of his usual self. The exception is Ariadne Oliver, who gets a remarkable amount of development for someone who ostensibly is just a side character. This is her final appearance in a Poirot mystery, and she gets an excellent send-off. The same cannot be said for Poirot. This is the final Poirot novel that Christie wrote, though not the final one that was published, since she wrote his real finale years earlier and set it aside to be published after her death. I haven't read it yet because I cannot bear to, so I'm saving it to be the last new Christie book I ever read. I just hope it's superior to this one!In this one, Poirot and Mrs. Oliver are trying to figure out what happened to the parents of one of Mrs. Oliver's god children. They were found shot to death in the woods, but what happened? Did the father shoot the mother or vice versa? Was it a suicide pact? Mrs. Oliver is asked to investigate by a woman she meets at a luncheon, then proceeds to go about interviewing a lot of people she hasn't seen in many years, to ask questions about what was happening in the family, to try and put the pieces together with Poirot, who is busy talking to the police. It's quite similar toFive Little Pigs (Also published as Murder In Retrospect), another Poirot murder in retrospect. The difference is that you'll be able to spot the solution to this one miles off, as I was. I can now say that about only three of her books (Peril at End House: A Hercule Poirot Mystery (Agatha Christie Collection)andThe Mirror Crack'd (Miss Marple Mysteries)being the other two) and sadly, it doesn't make for a very interesting read. More annoying still is that in this book, a character writes to Poirot and tells him that in order to solve the mystery, he should find and interview person X, because she might be able to help them with the truth. And so after pages and pages of wasted time, Poirot finds and interviews X, and she KNOWS THE ENTIRE EXPLANATION TO THE MYSTERY. She is flown to England, she tells her story and then the mystery is solved. So tell me again why Poirot and Mrs. Oliver were even needed?! That guy could've talked to this character himself anytime he liked! Christie also employs a method I've seen her resort to in just one other book -- she has Poirot, the master detective . . . hire a detective! In lieu of actually writing plot development, she settles for pages of exposition as a man shows up and tells Poirot all the details he needs to know about a specific character. And she later turns out to have no bearing on the mystery whatsoever, so the entire interlude was a colossal waste of time. Normally I'd decry this as a lazy author's way to get out of writing an additional chapter of action, but in Christie's case I'm charitable enough to substitute the word \\"lazy\\" with the word \\"elderly,\\" which makes the choice understandable if not forgivable.On the whole, I have to admit that I wouldn't even recommend this book to a die-hard Christie fan. But if you're dead set and determined to read everything she ever wrote, then go for it. I am too, so I can sympathize. Just be prepared to be bored and let down big time by this one. It's just not up to Christie's usual standards. Luckily, she wrote enough phenomenal, classic stories to be sure that her legacy would remain in tact regardless of what she published, and all Christie newbies can rest assured: it gets a heck of a lot better than this."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"I am a huge fan of Agatha Christie, but this mystery was lacking. I figured out whodunnit about halfway through the novel, but thought to myself, &quot;No...it can't be so-and-so! That would be too obvious.&quot; Well, guess what. It was. It was still a good read because I enjoy Ms. Christie's writing style and interactions between characters. If the mystery itself is not the only important part, then it's a worthwhile book."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"Inspite of a good character analysis and settings, this book falls much much below the usual standard of A.C. The plot especially is a BIG let-down and the climax falls flat. That even A.C should resort to such predictable wool-over-the-eye is amazing. The structure is very little different from Five Little Pigs - if Elephants Can Remember then Pigs can recall much better!"},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"It could have been solved in half the time. But it is not, and to appreciate or understand this novel, readers must place it in the proper context.The problem was at first vague; Ariadne Oliver was asked by a stranger if the mother of Ariadne's goddaughter killed the father, or was it vice-versa. The deaths were actually some twenty years or more before. As the stranger was the mother to a man who was contemplating marriage to Ariadne's goddaughter, she could be partially forgiven for her apparent concern. Of course one of the things Ariadne did was to call on Hercule Poirot, and together they embarked on elephant-chase to pry for secrets from the past.&quot;Elephants can remember&quot; was published in 1972, that is 52 years after the first Poirot novel &quot;The Mysterious Affairs at Styles&quot;. Many people did not even live that long. Agatha Christie aged her characters along with the years, and therefore there were cases that were different from bodies being found all over the place.Other similar novels before this whereby Christie's detectives investigate deaths long in the past included Dumb Witness, Five Little Pigs, Mrs McGinty's Dead, Ordeal By Innocence, and Nemesis. The common theme among them was that the investigator(s) had to depend on memories of various people who might not even be present; but from their recollections, clues were found to provide either the definitive picture of the culprits or the definitive picture of the crime. What a lot of impatient readers would find irritating was having to sift through the useful information from the useless. Elephants is such another tale.Mystery veterans would probably have been able to jump to the solution before Poirot's grand finale, but would they have been able to unravel the threads in the manner necessary? Proofs have to be gathered, and evidence, motivation, etc were all the necessary persuasions for Elephants before they would give up their secrets.The meat and drink of this novel is more than solving the mystery of who killed who, but to recapture the atmosphere, the mood, the aura of that time in the past, and to be able to put events in their proper perspectives. Also no less important was Poirot's being able to relate the past (in its correct perspective) and its impact on the present in order for persuade the elephants to give up their secrets."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"This novel written in the twilight of Dame Agatha's long and illustrious career (1972) would have been better left on the cutting room floor. It was especially painful for me to read because I not long ago re-read her vibrant, lively and completely mystifying \\"Murder at the Vicarage\\" which was written in 1927. The comparison was depressing.Hercule Poirot is teamed with Mrs. Oliver, a crime novelist, to find the truth of a 15-20 year old murder/suicide. Mrs. Oliver's goddaughter, Celia is the daughter of the couple who supposedly entered this pact. For the first one-half of the book, we are not advanced an inch in any direction. Many people are interviewed (the \\"elephants\\" of the title) and most have vague memories of the couple, as does Mrs. Oliver herself. Mrs. O's dithering is not artlessly charming, for we are as confused as she. Saddest cut of all, the red herrings are not \\"herrings\\" at all. They are giant signposts. Rather than Poirot gracefully unraveling the mystery on the last page, the reader has left him in the dust 50 pages ago. The prose has a distinctly purplish hue.According to the publisher, \\"Elephants Can Remember\\" was originally published as \\"Five Little Pigs.\\" I do not recommend this book, because it does not do Dame Agatha justice. There are 75 titles to choose that will far better reflect her abilities and why she earned the title \\"Queen of Crime.\\""},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"Whose work are we actually reading at this point? There were major differences in punctuation, word choices, and scene breaks between the original Collins and Dodd Mead editions of this novel. There were further differences between the Dodd Mead editions republished by Random House/Avenel and the Dodd Mead editions republished by Simon & Shuster/Pocket. There are further additions still in the recent Signet, Berkley, and Leventhal and Black editions. For every publishing house putting out her works, there seem to be a new batch of editors altering Agatha Christie's words and the sound of her voice. Here the publishers at Collins, dissatisfied with their own earlier efforts, put still more distance between author and public with a \\"New Ed\\" edition. What's the matter with these publishers? Whose voice do they think we want to hear when we sit down to a novel by Agatha Christie? And what will she sound like twenty years from now?

Personally, I enjoyed this book. Christies narrative is top notch and the solution to the mystery is neatly tied up and intuitive. I tought Christie did an excellent job of taking the reader from point A to point B and all the way to the end. Little clues were dropped along the way, as well as a few blind turns.

More relaxed and less upthight books. This book falls into the latter category. That doesn't mean it' a bad book, no-no! It's good, but different from earlier works.

The software vendor and a key partner were bundling the book themselves for a period of time. The writing is clear and to the point.

There were still mentally ill people shouting at the sky and young adults done up so as to show they are disenchanted, although maybe not disenfranchised.\\"Dictionary for the Disenchanted\\" is Bernard Rosenberg's 1972 collection of definitions based on his years as editor of \\"Dissent\\" magazine and his other books on popular culture.In this century, with dissent largely limited to suburbanites refusing to pay their exhorbitant property taxes, this kind of book has limited relevance. I'll give you an idea of what I mean. Here is one of Rosenberg's gems:\\"War\\": Recourse to arms for the settlement of international disputes. Reprehensivel in south Asia when initiated by the world's most populous democracy, but admirable in southeast Asia when perpetrated by the world's oldest democracy.Have any idea what he's talking about? Well, that first part has to be about American involvement in the Vietnam war. The second part? Your guess is as good as mine since I never recall Greece invading southeast Asia.Some elements of this tome transcend time more easily. Check out his definition of \\"Chic\\": Fashionable in either radical or conservative terms, therefore \\"hip\\" or \\"in\\" and thus passe.Or \\"Artist\\": A man easily indentified (I spelled that correctly) by his bizarre closthes, righteous habits, long hair, insouciant manners, and other visible stigmata that render him indistinguishable from everyone else.We'd probably call this preppy or grunge today, maybe upscale. We may even extend this courtesy to women.When Rosenberg tried to be funny he'd bring out something like \\"Radical\\": A person whose left hand does not know what his left hand is doing.I know all this because I bought this book in 1973 for $1, which is still pasted inside my first edition copy. I can't say why I've kept it all these years, since it hardly reminds me of my college days which I don't particularly want to remember, anyway.If you are middle aged there may be a laugh or two inside this trip down memory lane for you. If you are less than 40 years of age, this will seem like the Dark Ages to you, if you can figure it out at all.

The cross-fertilisation of his inscribed and distressed vellum pieces in his series The Word and Byron's poems about the slaughtering of farm animals in The Fat-Hen Field Hospital (1993) has led to the creation of new work on both vellum and glass, as well as on the printed page.Catherine Byron grew up in Belfast, raised daughters and goats in the west of Scotland, and now lives in the English Midlands. This is her sixth poetry collection. She is also the author of Out of Step: Pursuing Seamus Heaney to Purgatory (1992). She teaches writing and medieval Literature at The Nottingham Trent University."},{"Title":"Healing with the Herbs of Life","review":"Lesley Tierra's book is a refreshing look at the old system of energetic herbology. While many herbals focus on healing the ailments, this book introduces the concept of healing the energy imbalance. As such, it is not a reference book for a quick fix. It teaches a different philosophy for using herbs.Western medicine once used such a concept as the equilibrium between humors. In \\"Healing with the Herbs of Life\\", the author uses the Chinese energetic system. She explains why an energetic approach to healing with herbs is more efficient than the ones dealing with symptoms.This is a very useful book for curious amateur or professional herbalists and energy healing students:Part 1 deals with herbal fundamentals such as herb chemistry, energy and a materia medica (dictionary of herbs) of 148 herbs from all over the world.Part 2 discusses the energetic causes of illness, its energy, the process of healing according to the chinese five elements system and a compendium of specific conditions to treat with herbs, always in an energetic perspective and with general guidelines that may apply (keeping in mind that every ill person is different).Part 3 deals with the energy of food, living with the seasons, herbal preparations.There is also a complete appendice of resources, bibliography and glossary. An index to identify the names of herbs in their common names, latin names, chinese name and sanskrit name is included at the end.Completely worth its price since it is so well done and complete."},{"Title":"Healing with the Herbs of Life","review":"This is a vastly revised 2nd edition. Anyone perusing the numbers of herbs books available on the market should notice at least two shortcomings: 1. They are not written by practicing clinical herbalists and so they often just pass on 2nd and 3rd hand information 2. They are not wholistic in the sense that they do not integrate diet, lifestyle and the many other factors necessary for a successful therapeutic result. Then there is the current wave of herb books written by inexperienced medical authorities with little or not practical experience in the clinical herbal medicine. Most of these are practically useless.None of this is true of the latest of edition of this Lesley Tierra's Healing with The Herbs of Life. This book offers the rare opportunity to participate in the herbal healing strategies of one of the world's foremost practicing herbalists with over 20 years clinical experience. Integrating Western and Chinese energetics, it is an excellent source for self healing useful for both the lay person and the professional practitioner.When the qualities and energetics of diet and lifestyle are appropriately adjusted, herbs offer the most time-honored and effective way for treating the underlying causes of disease rather than merely the outer symptoms. With chapters on &quot;Causes of disease,&quot; The Energy of Illness,&quot; &quot;The process of Healing,&quot; Treatment of Specific conditions&quot; along with other chapters on the &quot;Energy of Food,&quot; &quot;Living with the Seasons.&quot; The reader is fully empowered in the process of herbal medicine.This is not simply another herb book with a catalogue of herbs and common indications but allows for a much needed personalized approach to herbal healing.Another thing the reader will appreciate is that the book is well organized and well written making it all the more enjoyable and useful.You will not regret owning a copy of this book.The reader might check out the author's other unique book for kid's, appropriately called The Kid's Herbal."},{"Title":"Healing with the Herbs of Life","review":"This book had alot of good information but it would have been nice if they could have included a glossry of terms of a dictionary for some of the words. I couldn't even find half of the words in a regular dictionary."},{"Title":"Healing with the Herbs of Life","review":"I feel incredible gratitude to author for the dedication it took for her to write this book. I used this book while I was a student, and continue to use now that I am a practicing Acupuncturist. More than theory and practical information, Leslie shares her valuable experiences at just the right times to make complex ideas understandable.This is one of the only herbal books on Chinese Medicine and Chinese Herbology that both makes sense to the western mind and stays true to holistic principles of Chinese Medicine.Chinese medical diagnostics and pattern identification are explained clearly. Excellent tables of pattern diagnosis and indicated herbal treatments are given. Clear explanations of common western herbs in the context of Chinese medicine are listed in her excellent Materia Medica.For the serious student of herbology, this book is invaluable."},{"Title":"Healing with the Herbs of Life","review":"I love this book and use it all the time. It provides a well-rounded materia medica, a basic tutorial on TCM, differentiation of various conditions, and the best part is that Leslie provides a nice, well-rounded list of herbs to use for each condition--many available in your local health food store. It's a great book for the beginning herbalist as well as a practitioner. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Healing with the Herbs of Life","review":"I think its a good book but its difficult to follow and recommends herbs foreign to the average person's experience.

First of all, she only writes about few herbs, means you may NOT find a specific herb in there. She give the indication BUT NOT the contra-indication of the herbs. I would recommend it for beginners ONLY!"},{"Title":"Healing with the Herbs of Life","review":"Overall it's an ok book. It covers herb energy which is important in the practice of eastern herbal medicine. The formulas may be alright for people who aren't practitioners. For me, as a clinical herbalist, they are different from the way I would mix herbs for a specific need.One thing that annoys me immensely in the book is that Pancreas is referred to as Spleen in the entire book. With such a huge mistake the book automatically loses more than half of its credibility. While in old times the organ responsible for certain actions may have been considered to be the Spleen, we now know what each of these two organs do. Spleen is not a digestive organ, Pancreas is. An example of this mistake can be seen on pages 170-171 where deficiency and excess patterns of Spleen are listed. They are mostly digestive patterns.In summary it is a decent book to provide an overview of certain herbs, but don't rely on the accuracy of physiological statements. Do your own research.For a structured review of herbs I highly recommendThe Complete Herbal Tutor: A Structured Course to Achieve Professional Expertise"},{"Title":"Healing with the Herbs of Life","review":"Good book, detailed and easy to follow.

It is written in a clear, enjoyable manner, with terrific (if not very large) photographs.Jamie Cairns truly knows, loves, and understands Goldens, and it shows in her comprehensive and occasionally humorous coverage of &quot;Living with a Golden Retriever&quot;. She provides good information on health and maintenance issues, and more time than usual discussing field, obedience, agility, and other topics. The section on &quot;Caring for the Older Golden Retriever&quot; is both interesting and uncommon. The author leans toward field-bred Goldens rather than conformational, and this is reflected both in the text and especially the photography. It's not typical, and I loved it.All-in-all, a beautiful and well-done book that would be a great addition to every Golden-lover's bookshelf."},{"Title":"The Golden Retriever: All That Glitters (Howell's Best of Breed Library)","review":"If you love Goldens, this is the book for you. Ms. Cairns covers the spectrum from family pets to hunting and field dogs to outstanding show dogs.

The only guide released should have been Nona Kilgore Baur's thick manual on this particular Retriever. This delicacy breed has manuals written about it that required so little time by a less insightful company over the years. Cairns did not need to bother writing this material, as it has been duplicated already in superior guides. Our household contains two juvenile Golden Retrievers in the process of house and outdoor training. This guide did not prove to be any help since we had already purchased Baur's guide. The reason so many books have been written over the years was to trivalize the popularity of variable books on this very special pet. Do not buy this if you already own &quot;Golden Retrievers for Dummies&quot; by Nona K.

What makes it great though is the fact that the nearly mythical Bob Jones befriended this young writer so the book is filled with many first hand views. If you love golf and you want to know more about the origins of the modern game this is the book for you."},{"Title":"A Golf Story: Bobby Jones, Augusta National, and the Masters Tournament","review":"This book is a gem, the best ever written on Bobby, Roberts, and Augusta National. Price's account of Bobby is \\"priceless\\", if you've ever wanted to know about this amazing man and the origins of Augusta National/the Masters, buy this book."},{"Title":"A Golf Story: Bobby Jones, Augusta National, and the Masters Tournament","review":"When my father was a teenager growing up in Winnipeg in the 1920's, Bobby Jones was his hero. He took up golf and would play until late in the evening on long summer days. On cold winter nights, his sisters would lay awake listening to the swoosh of the broom he would practice swing with in the kitchen. When Bobby Jones won the Grand Slam, people in the English speaking world went crazy. I decided to review this book---which I read long ago---on the eve of the U.S. Open and Father's Day, in memory of what would have been my Father's 100th Birthday this year, and to remember that Bobby Jones won four U.S. Open titles as an amateur.Most of this great little book by Charles Price is about how Jones went on to create the Master's Tournament and the Augusta National Golf Course on which it's played. Price notes that at the time, it was anticipated that Bobby Jones would dominate the tournament. But he never won it even once. It was also a disappointment for Bobby Jones that amateur golf faded out in the 1930's because of the Depression. But, the Master's Tournament grew into one of the major events of the U.S. golf tour and an international event. The name \\"Masters,\\" by which the tournament came to be known, was not what Jones chose. Other than that, Jones, through his protege Clifford Roberts, kept tight rein on the event.Charles Price(1926-1994) was one of my favorite golf writers. He wrote with depth and passion. One of my favorite articles he wrote was his Golf Digest tribute to Jimmy Demaret upon his death in 1984. Demaret was a colorful character who won the Master's Tournament three times.Price writes with compassionate detail about the tragic side of Bobby Jones. Bobby Jones had suffered from childhood illnesses and overcame them on the golf course. But after the Grand Slam, his ability to compete at the highest level began to fade. Gradually, his general health deteriorated until he was diagnosed with syringomyelia in the late 1940's. The degree of his suffering in the end was kept private.Bobby Jones deserves a lot of credit for the gift of golf to the World War II vets who came home mangled and broken and found in golf a way to heal themselves and walk again."},{"Title":"A Golf Story: Bobby Jones, Augusta National, and the Masters Tournament","review":"I have most every book every written about Bob Jones, Augusta, The Masters including several by Mr. Price. I believe the author was trying to show the flowing and the \\"behind the brain scenes\\" of events. It rambles. There is no doubt that Mr. Price loved, respected, admired Bob Jones--remember he really played tournament golf from 1924-1930 and won 13 majors including The Grand Slam in 1930 AS AN AMATEUR where any sort of payment clubs, balls, transportation, clothes, etc. was strickly against the USGA rules for Amateur Golfers so in 1930 when he retired, he was flat broke: with a degree in Engineering from Georgia Tech, Literature Degree from Harvard and a Law degree from Emory (but never finished because he passed the bar 2 years before graduating.I did especially enjoy his last chapter: tender, sad, filled with loss and yet, to quote Bob's caddie on his last round of golf at St Andrews in 1936, when nobody knew he was coming yet the town shutdown when they knew \\"our Bobby\\"is back; the caddie said the only time they spoke to each other: You are a wonder Sir; Aye a true wonder! And so he was. The book is good to have but not the best and I would expect more from Price."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Overrated overrated overrated.Thats the perfect way to describe this \\"novel\\"."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"God, I don't know why I bothered to buy this book. It's horrible! I'm amazed one can write for so many pages and have absolutely nothing to say! God, it was torture getting through this mess. Good for Ms. Weisberger that she was able to get it published, but good grief - did anyone notice the bad writing?The movie? One of those rare instances when the movie was an improvement on the novel (and I'm talking a MAJOR improvement). I wasn't crazy about Anne Hathaway, but Meryl Streep makes the movie. It's not a great movie by any means, but it's light, entertaining and a whole lot better than that dreadful book. (And yes, I read the book first before I saw the movie.)"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Considering the hype surrounding this book (even before the movie came out), I was expecting a lot more when I bought it. Boy, was I ever disappointed.The plot (highly unoriginal, by the way) was shoddily constructed. It almost seemed as if Weisberger had simply come up with a bunch of scenes and then slapped them together with no particular regard for continuity and flow.It was hard to feel any kind of sympathy for her character. I found myself wondering why Andrea Sachs was stupid enough to stick with a job she hated for so long, and the anti-climatic \\"climax\\" didn't help to ease my contempt for her. She whines and moans her way through the book, acting as if it's everyone else's fault that she's stuck in a horrible job with a monster of a boss.The writing style was annoyingly pedestrian. I knew going into the book that it's part of a genre known as \\"chick lit\\", but I had expected at least some witty dialogue, sparkling humor, etc. Instead, it felt like I was reading a 5th grader's essay on How I Spent My Summer. By the time I was 3/4 of the way through the book, I was sick of Weisberger's writing and found myself skipping the pointless paragraphs (there certainly were plenty of them) just to get to the end as quickly as possible. I shouldn't have bothered, because the end was so predictable I pretty much saw coming before I even opened the book.So what's all the hype about, you ask? I guess it's the \\"fashion\\" aspect of the novel...and even that was a big let-down. It pretty much consisted of Weisberger throwing in a bunch of names and brands from the fashion industry. No offense to her, but anyone who watches Sex and the City and owns a computer with Microsoft Word installed on it can do the same thing.All in all, it was a pretty big disappointment. If you're looking to read this book, I'd recommend typing \\"fashion + NYC\\" into Google and clicking the Search button instead--you'll get the same outcome. The only reason I gave this book one extra star is because it's a fairly easy read for when you've got nothing better to do on the airplane or at the dentist's office."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Remembering the light-hearted enjoyment I got out of watching the film version, I thought I'd indulge in a little mindless summer reading and pick up the book. I found, not unlike some other reviewers, that the likeable, smart and believable character of the film often bears little resemblance to the spoiled and uninteresting character of the book. I didn't care what happened to her, I wanted to smack her pretty often, and there were even moments when I hated her and found her repulsive, such as when she described her new flatmates as investment bankers, Indian, and basically undistinguishable. In my books, this is unexcusable racist flap trap, and it gets two hearty thumbs down from me."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"we all knew Anna Wintour is a b*itch, but what a funny way to tell us about it! my book club thoroughly enjoyed this ride, and know we never want to work for her! insightful, first-hand experience of being a servant to a devil."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Ms. Weisberger's use of the term \\"Jappie\\" does not refer to Japanese women.

The writer is not clever, witty, and there are tons of typos in the book. Do yourself a favor and borrow this from a friend or the library. I'm going to give my copy away when I'm done.

It says something when I can finish an entire book in a weekend, because while I read a lot, I'm not a fast reader.This was a modern tail of \\"the boss from hell.\\" I'm not sure how the main character Andrea could have handled such a working situation for so long, but it was an entertaining ride.This book follows the vein of modern NYC comedies such as \\"Sex and the City\\" and \\"The Nanny Diaries.\\" While this book didn't clinch the horridness one self-involved person can be like \\"The Nanny Diaries,\\" it was the look of Andrea's (non-existent) life outside of work that made this book keep going.Seriously, it's a fun read if you're looking for something lighter."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book is so bad that it was a complete waste of time. The author discuses such juvenille issues. It seems like she used this book to showcase her knowledge of designer names. It talks about the woeful life of Andrea and her horrible materialistic boss. She devotes all her time to her work while she neglects her boyfriend and friend who is turning into a partying alcoholic. Her friend ends up getting in a car accident while driving drunk and it changes her view on her job and life. I can't put a book down once I start it, but this is the one book I wish I would never have picked up. It was so incredibly horrible. I truely feel shallow and insignificant after reading this book. I abhorred it and it is a genuinly heinous book. This author is TERRIBLE.

I run out and buy American and British Vogue, Harpers Bazaar, Allure, and watch fashion programs incessantly.I love designer clothes and have been slowly starting to get some of my own. Via outlet stores and the like-not actually paying full price.So, when I found out about this book, I was naturally curious. What a horrible disappointment.The girl in the book, which for the good of the world I hope is not based on the author her self is insufferable. She moves into an apartment in NY-\\"I have a shack behind my house in Avon that is bigger then this room.\\" So go live there and spare us your whinning.It also galled me when she made herself out to be so fashion ignorant for like 3 pages, because that way she is above those who value those things, then she is rattling off names of designers like they are her friends? Please. Those people, the Michael Korses and Karl Lagerfelds of the world have talent and are lucky enough to be able to be creative and make a living from it and they are not useless spoiled dilletantes, like the author of this book.And she is always whinning. Get over yourself-everyone has the boss from ... at least once in their lives. So, you have to run errands. Enjoy it, be the best you can be at these errands, and guess what, they might even let your entitled ... do something more meaningful.Oh and this nonsense about her working at the New Yorker. \\"I just have to work her for a year before I get my recommendation for the New Yorker.\\" Have you done gone and lost your mind? Do you have anything to say about the world, or have any writing talent at all, what so ever? Here is a tip-if you want to be a writer, get a job directly related to editorial and learn the craft of writing. Oh wait, that would involve work and not just waiting to have it all handed to you. Illegal.About Miranda Priestly/Anna Wintour-although Anna Wintour might have a reputation as an ice queen, when you see her in interviews, she is very dignified and speaks extremely well. People who are close to her have said that it is her shyness that leads people to believe she is icy. Her father was a famous newspaper man in England, and she's said he was a warm and caring man who was contantly being portrayed the same way she is in the media. She would not have gotten to where she is acting that way toward people. I've also recently read Andre Leon Talley's book about his life. He does not seem to be the sort of the man to put up with the sort of behavior Anna Wintour is supposed to have displayed. Besides, this Andrea character so irked me, I was cheering for Miranda while reading this book.For those people who really want their fashion fix, steer clear of this steaming mount of ...... and read hintmag on the net.

While I was reading this book Andrea made me laugh a lot on the things she would say and do."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"If it was possible to give a book negative stars, I would give this one -2,000 of them. This novel was the biggest waste of my time, money and brain power that I have experienced in 10 years. I don't understand how this was on the best-sellers list for so long. Does the American public have no taste in good literature whatsoever? Lauren Weisberger has created a masterpiece of hateful characters (yes, ALL of them), contrived situations, dead dialogue and a plot that is so weak it barely exists. Don't read this book. You will regret it for the rest of your life."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I can't imagine any southern belle worth her baton and tiara reading more than 50 pages of this book. I finished only because I was supposed to review it, but egads and little fishes, it is bad.No southern belle would put up with 11 minutes, much less 11 months of not being able to (1) leave her desk (2) speak unless spoken to or (3) eat lunch ... just so she could be at the beck and call of her self-important, puffed up, manaical boss, even if HERself was the 'most important woman in fashion.'The author completely lost me when Andrea had to go get more coffee because what she had broken her neck to bring to the office was cold and when her boss screamed at her to hurry it up with her $92 lunch, only to order her to toss it because she had already eaten with someone else. Having a pilot fly across the Atlantic just so the boss' twin daughters could each have their own Harry Potter books three days before the release date was a bit over the top.The final scene (no spoiler here, because you KNOW the girl has GOT to develop a backbone at SOME point before the tale is over) is no big whoop, either. A southern belle woulda caused such a fuss...it woulda been the talk of the town for years to come when \\"the boss\\" finally got what was coming to her.I guess that's why America's fashion elite gather in the Big Apple and not Atlanta. We wouldn't stand for such nonsense down here.If like is really like this in the fashion industry, there's something seriously wrong....seriously."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I was almost swayed by the countless snivelling reviews that this book seems to have generated. Perhaps because it is a thinly veiled account of the author's actual (bitter, needless to say) experiences at Vogue magazine.I am not sure I agree. It is quite an alright novel really, it makes no claim to be anything but pulp &quot;fiction&quot; and does a decent job of it.The title is misleading, perhaps a direct jab at the author's former boss? The story veers around a fashion magazine, things happen, women bicker, a galore of betrayals, bitterness and a lot of shallow vengeance. What's new? This is &quot;chick-lit&quot; and quite akin to what a million men and women read in pop mags like Vogue, Cosmo, Maxim, GQ etc everyday.It's a fast and mildly-fun read for days at home when television is dry, or in the train if you commute, at least the title will turn a few heads for sure. Expect collegiate humor and you should do fine."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"While the most prominent character is the always unreasonable, offensive & bitchy female boss, it's actually a story about the tension between family/friend commitmt & personal life vs career. I don't find the story attractive nor convincing, perhaps in Asia (& particularly HK), ppl have already got used to long working hrs, tight deadlines & demanding business reqts.What really interested me was the privileges enjoyed by the bitchy boss - if she was so unreasonable, why ppl around have to put up with it in the first place? I mean, they could have found another job if they couldn't stand her - so actually it's they have DECIDED to accommodate her. But why? The story said she was really brilliant & talented - so I guess after all, the motto is: one has to excel in his/her field to be a leader."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I bought this book after seeing Lauren on the \\"Today Show.\\" I happen to like this genre that so many are maligning (Nanny Diaries, Bridget Jones) You know what you are getting, if you don't like it for God's sake, spend your money on Tolstoy, non-fiction. I read the Wall Street Journal so I deserve a light, escapist read and this is precisely that. I read it during an airplane flight and sitting by the pool. It is not the best book I ever read but it was enjoyable, funny, sad and pathetic. Andrea is just a kid, she does childlike things as she aches to grow up. Sounds like me at 23. Read it and enjoy it for what it is... campy fun. I hate people who turn a pair of leather pants into something important. This is a literary pair of leather pants. Looks good, feels good, not a necessity."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I'd probably give this 3 1/2 stars, not just 3 - If you enjoyed the NANNY DIARIES last year, you'll probably enjoy this book - there's just not a whole lot there - It could have been so much better - Way over the top, boss Miranda drives everyone crazy, especially her assistant, AANN-DREEE-AAHH - her demands are way over the top and her accusations will drive you crazy (\\"there's just no excuse\\") - I know there are those out there who say this is based on the author's own experiences as an assistant to the editor of Vogue - Let's hope it's an exaggeration - It would be very sad to believe that there are women bosses like this in our world today - and that their assistants will put up with that behavior!!! If you don't take it seriously, it's a fund read and if you enjoy fashion (like me) you will the best part will be the never-ending references to Chanel, Prada, Jimmy Choo and Minola Blanik - If employees of the magazines get all the perks described here - then I'm in the wrong field of work!!! Please, someone, point me in the right direction for a career at one of the top fashion mags!!! I would have liked to know a little more about Miranda - Why does she behave the way she does? What are her children like and how and when did she meet her current husband and just what is it about Miranda that makes \\"B-Dad\\" stick around? Perhaps an event to make her a little more human would have done it - but there's nothing in this book that will make any reader even remotely like her (and if you do, how sad!!) I'd also like to know more about Andrea - besides the promise of a great reference for a job at the New Yorker (why she thinks time spent in a FASHION magazine will impress the editors at THE NEW YORKER is still beyond me!!!) Halfway through the book, most readers will get the jest that most other NY editors despise Miranda - so why Andrea would think a referral from her to the NEW YORKER would be impressive doesn't make much sense - I've read some of the reviews where the readers felt that Andrea was almost as shallow and spoiled as Miranda but I don't think that's the case - I think she's a confused young woman who knows what she ultimately wants to do, but has no idea how to achieve it - She's anxious and eager which is why she takes this job in the first place - She believes one year of service for Miranda is worth more than 4 years of college and a degree and lesser experience will ever be!!! I mean don't forget, we are talking about a 23 year old New Yorker - The fact that she spends company money on coffee for the homeless says something - and I think her flirtation with Christian is harmless fun and exploration on her part (let's not forget, she's been with her boyfriend all through HS - she has no idea what else is out there - When was the last time, you turned down some harmless flirting???) - The ultimate catchall though is when Miranda tells Andrea that she reminds her of herself when she was that age - That's the ultimate spooker - Andrea is never the same after that line - and that's when all hell breaks loose - Overall, a fun, fast read - easy comparisons to the NANNY DIARIES can be made (Nasty mother/Nasty editor)(Nave Nanny/Clueless Assistant) (Sinful, Cheating Father's Mistress/Faithful, Supportive Sr. Asst to Miranda)(Loving Supportive Family/Loving, Supportive Family)(Devilishly Handsome Young Neighbor/Devilishly Handsome Young Writer) -Should be a light, fun read - Not to be taken too seriously!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"From the start of the book I knew what was going to happen. The book kept my interest, but the ending was disappointing and dull."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Ever wanted to work in major magazines? Yeah, me too. Instead I'm a bartender in Alabama. But through this book I got to pretend to be a cool, sophisticated NYC magazine editor. Loved the gossip and the fantasty aspect.Also read: Johanna Edward's \\"The Next Big Thing\\" and Sophie Kinsella's \\"Can You Keep a Secret.\\""},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I loved this book! Once I picked it up, I was rooting for Andrea and empathizing with her plight. Many of us have worked for bosses who's requests are ridiculous and unreasonable and for those of you who haven't - you are lucky!I lauged out loud many times while reading this book. My co-worker and I looked forward to discussing Andrea's troubles over the cubicle wall every morning."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"The Devi Wears Prada connected with me on a more emotional level. Haven't we all had those jobs, with the boss whose so irritating you want to claw their eyes out. As for grammatical errors, if you reading a book and doing a spellcheck, grammar check...Please do us a favor and write your own novel. Than you can comment on punctuation! Sometimes it's the flow of the story, other times it's done on purpose for effect. Now back to the Devil it shows us the boss we all hate, how controlling an manipulative they can be. How they make us sacrifice our own life for their own selfish cause. Lauren has created in Andrea a protagnist we can all empathize with, and learn from. One of my favorite books, hands down, it's gets four for being a good read and another book for not stooping to the sex and city level."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Yeah, yeah, it's not Tolstoy. It's not deathless prose or \\"great literature.\\" Oreos are not healthy veggies, either, but we enjoy them all the same. The book is obviously a light read about the trials and tribulations of working for the Boss From Utter Hell, and as such, is an enormous amount of fun. If you've ever worked for someone who was arrogant, rude, inconsiderate, and just plain wacko, you will probably love reading this book. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I had fun reading this book. I couldn't put it down. I love Lauren Weisberger's writing: witty, sarcastic, funny."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Being a recent college graduate, I can say that this book was absolutely hilarious. Laying on the beach in my non-working spare time, I laughed out loud to the sarcasm Weisberger uses. Why do some of the reviewers criticize it like it is expected to be the next 'Catcher in the Rye'? It is a light, easy, fun read for any girl who has ever feared working in the \\"real world.\\"Andrea Sachs is a recent college graduate who gets the job 'a million girls would die for' at 'Runway,' the nation's top fashion magazine. However, most of the time she'd rather die than work for her boss, the editor-in-chief of the magazine, Miranda Priestly. The book follows her pathetic, tortured, belittled life for almost one year as Miranda's junior assistant. Miranda, who does not even care to know Andrea's name, just refers to her most of the time as Emily, who is her senior assistant. \\"'Emily, I'll be there in ten minutes and I'd like my breakfast to be ready.' She had taken to calling both Emily and me 'Emily,' suggesting we were indistinguishable from each other and completely interchangeable. Somewhere in the back of my mind I was offended, but I'd grown accustomed to it at this point. And besides, I was too tired to really care about something as incidental as my name.\\"However, even the burning rings Miranda makes Andrea jump through, she never loses her dream to work at The New Yorker, her long-time goal, and continues to be frantically ordered around. But at the same time Andrea is losing all sight of her out-of-the-office life."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Everyone was talking about this book so I just had to read it. Well I should have just borrowed it from the library so that when I was bored half way through I wouldn't have to feel guilty about not finishing it. But as it were I bought it so I finished it. It was entertaining enough. But I can't highly recommend a book that I had a hard time getting through. I didn't dislike the main character, I felt bad for her, and could see myself doing as she did, if I were in those situations. But that wasn't enough. If it is true and this book was based upon Lauren Weisberger's experience at Vogue then I feel really bad for her, and can almost forgive her for not being a great writer."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"loved reading about Andrea Sach's first job experience working for Runway magazine. While the book was fictional, I found some real life parallels. In contrast to the other reviews, I really liked this book and found it an entertaining read. The author has a great writing style and I look forward to reading her future novels."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"The main things going for this book are that1) it's a crash course in the superficialities of the fashion magazine world (filled with lists of designer names and products), and2) it's a exercise in vindictive voyeurism (because we may infer that Anna Wintour shares characteristics of the devil boss).Beyond that, it is skimpy on plot, skimpy on characterization, and skimpy on good -- even fun -- writing. It's not terrible, as some reviewers have said. It's just not very good. Even the devil boss is not compellingly pictured. Although the boss is indeed unpleasant, I've known worse and more interesting bad bosses. I kept reading and reading (finally skipping whole paragraphs of repetitive and dull descriptions), looking for whatever made a publisher decide this was good enough for public consumption. Unfortunately, the author is not yet an accomplished novel writer. This tale would have been fine and just the right length as a Vanity Fair magazine article. But if you really must read the whole book, look for it in a thrift store. That's where my copy is going. FOOTNOTE: After learning that Meryl Streep took the part of the devil boss in the movie, I went to see the movie and enjoyed it. Sometimes the much-maligned Hollywood machine improves on a novel (e.g., Mash, Forrest Gump, The Firm)."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I knew from the title and the cover of the book that this was not going to be the most mind stimulating book I've read. However, having just graduated college I wanted to start my summer reading with something light and fun. Perfect book to start the summer with. It's witty and funny and probably hits close home to so many readers.Andrea a recent college grad finds herself working for the most succesful woman in the fashion industry who is a total B****. Andreas dream is to write for the New Yorker so she puts up with hes bosses outrageous demands.I definetelly recommend this book for the summer, easy funny read."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I've read a fair number of the other reviews here and have noticed that plenty of readers find Weisberger to be an ungrateful, immature, spoiled brat because of her apparent attitude toward her job at Vogue and her former boss, Anna Wintour. While it's difficult to imagine Weisberger distancing herself very much from her actual experiences as an assistant, as a writer myself I must concede her the benefit of the doubt; that perhaps Andrea Sachs doesn't necessarily possess the same personality and manner as Weisberger. It is a novel, after all.That being said, no one can defend the stilted prose style of this book, or the wooden, robotic dialogue, or the complete absence of storytelling skills. Weisberger has woven into this narrative a few interesting and well-told anecdotes, but the novel as a whole fails on almost every level. One of the most sacred rules of writing, &quot;Show, don't tell,&quot; seems to have been intentionally ignored; I can remember no novel in recent history that so flagrantly attempted to tell a story by the narrator recalling for the reader what happened yesterday or two weeks ago. The Devil herself, Miranda Priestly, is frighteningly offstage for much of this novel, as are many of the &quot;scenes&quot; with Andrea's boyfriend. And while many readers have complained about the editing, or lack thereof, I place this burden squarely back on the shoulders of Weisberger. Acquiring editors and copy editors can and do make suggestions--many of them, in fact--but ultimately Weisberger can reject anything she wants. To suggest Doubleday purchased this book for so much money and voluntarily allowed it to go to press in this condition strains credibility.I wish I knew if Weisberger intended for her protagonist to be so unlikable, because that's certainly the way she wrote her. The elitist attitude regarding everything from the fashion world to the city where a minor character lived (Houston) was unfortunate. There is nothing inherently wrong with this if Weisberger intended for us to interpret Andrea as stuck up. What surprised me, however, was how unhip the character was for someone who considered herself so well-bred. This girl thinks culture exists only north of the Mason-Dixon line, and yet she isn't familiar with Bed Head? She's trying to hide panty lines when even girls in Oklahoma wear thongs? There are plenty of snobby, aloof characters in fiction, but to write a girl who is both stuck up and ignorant is not the way to endear her to most readers.A sunny place in all this muck is that Weisberger shows promise as a writer. Even with my disappointment in the book overall, she hooked me enough to stagger to the end, and the pages leading up to the confrontation with Miranda moved quickly. With a lot of hard work and dedication to the craft, Weisberger could sharpen her talent into something more rewarding. All writers have to start somewhere. Even the best in the business possess horribly-crafted fiction projects stashed away where they may never again see the light of day, but the difference here is that this early-career project was actually published. It would be satisfying to complain about the publisher's role in all this, but it would also be naive, because no longer can the publishing industry distance itself from Hollywood, where poor storytelling and shoddy character development has become an art form. Books with killer titles and the promise of real &quot;insider&quot; gossip are a virtual lock to earn a big profit. But I wonder, with Weisberger's new seven-figure contract and critically-panned first novel, if perhaps the well will run dry before the second book is released. I suppose only time will tell.Any completed novel is a success in the eyes of a writer. Many are begun, and a relative few are ever finished. I really hope Ms. Weisberger will work hard to fashion a better novel next time out, because with her name and sales success, she could serve as a role model for other young women who hope to write for a living."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I found the book to be a nice, quick, easy read. There weren't many surprises though. It was almost as if nothing happened until the end. I did enjoy the outcome however."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I was interested in this book with all of the hype surrounding it's publication. Then I read it. I finished it, but it was only because I was stuck on a cross-country plane ride with nothing better to do. It is very poorly written with tons of grammatical errors and oodles of redundancy. I didn't care about the main character and the secondary characters were also poorly written. Blech. What an awful book. I wish I had my money back."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book is poorly edited and NOT worth the hype. I enjoy chick lit, and there's a lot better stuff out there. This one is bad like The Nanny Diaries - just boring and whiny. I got halfway through and couldn't stomach anymore. There's much better chick lit out there - try The Parker Grey Show or Anna Maxted."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Like many others I cannot believe I wasted my time on this book - somehow I thought that MAYBE something interesting would finally happen at the end.

I look forward to reading Lauren's next book."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"People, HELLO, this author was about 22 when she wrote this book.

Total guts."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"There was something about this book that just kept me coming back for more. It is by far not a &quot;good&quot; book, but it made me want to read it. Maybe it was the unbelievable antics that took place.

It was a fun read with a great ending."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"While not a maven of literature, I do find it annoying when mispellings and grammatical trainwrecks occur -- especially when a book is hyped so much, you expect that they spent something on the editing, no? Maybe not; there were plenty of both in this book.Having said that, and perhaps agreeing with those who would know better than I that her style is immature and needs a little time to ripen, I have to say that Weisberger DID succeed in drawing me into the book, thoroughly pissing me off, and driving me to turn page after page until 2:30 in the morning.I admit; I've been sheltered (working with great, kind people, working for myself, etc.) -- and the antics of this hellish boss were just absolutely unbelievable. I was disgusted, and couldn't wait to see what she'd say next. Moreso, the fact that anyone with two brain cells would put up with it was hard to stomach, but seeing how an otherwise level headed person gets sucked into this warped reality of the fashion world was interesting and provocative. It happens, whether in New York or Podunk. Immerse yourself in an environment and you will eventually find yourself reeking of it.I felt somewhat unfulfilled with the ending -- but I'd certainly give her next work a read."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Andrea Sachs has been out of college for about five months and is desperate for a job. Her real dream is to write for The New Yorker. She finds herself faced with the opportunity to work at Runway magazine, being told that if she sticks it out there for a year, she can pretty much land any magazine job she wants after that. The only problem is that her job is to be the junior assistant to Runway's editor-in-chief super-b***h, Miranda Priestly.Predictably, the job ends up taking over Andrea's life. Her cell phone makes her reachable 24/7, and she finds her personal life melting away. Her job is interfering with her life so much, she is helpless to do anything when her best friend develops a major drinking problem. And her boyfriend, Alex, becomes more and more unhappy as Andrea becomes more and more distant.Weisberger delights in coming up with many different ways to portray Miranda as the ultimate evil boss. But sometimes, it just seems a bit over-the-top. Miranda is so non-human that often her character is unbelievable. She is the epitome of every awful thing every boss has ever done, and has no human side to her at all.As for the criticism that Andrea's character (who is presumed to be modeled after a straight-out-of-college Weisberger) is snobby and self-centered and complains too much, I say \\"who can blame her?\\" I'd probably be the same way if I had to suffer such abuse at work. I felt like that part was pretty realistic, actually."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Wow. This was a first for me. My wife wanted me to read this as I am a teacher of English and History. Chick Lit is becoming a respected genre of its own. So I set out to read this along with a few others. I thought this was very good. And was a new way of telling the age old slave and master relationship story. Would the working girl be corrupted by her evil boss? I think it will make a better film than a book. Meryl Streep and Ann Hathway are playing the leads. I ultimately found Nanny Diaries the jewel in the crown of this genre."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book was fun to read - it was great to look inside the world of a fashion magazine. You think your boss is bad? Ha! Miranda is the definition of spoiled Diva. By the end of the book I was convinced that the author must have been \\"Andrea\\" at some point in her life. The details and personalities are perfect for the story."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"It's a fun escape--certainly fun to read delicious nastiness about someone so rich and successful, but the writing is quite weak.

I cannot say too much without giving away everything, but I wanted there to be a pay off at the end of the book and there isn't. It kind of felt like a waste of time for me as much as it was a waste of time for Andrea as well. This is set to be a movie in the future staring Anne Hathaway (famous for her role as Mia in the Princess Diaries). It should be interesting to see if the movie gets better reviews than the book did. All-in-all the book wasn't bad, it just didn't really go anywhere. Even at the end of the book it seemed that the author herself couldn't decide if she still wanted to be a part of that life (since this is supposed to be sem-autobiographical) or if she too truly believed it was a waste of her time too."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book delivers exactly what it promises. It's like a wicked, the-pen-is-mightier-than-the-sword type of slap in the face to all the bad bosses out there. I do think that for the story it was telling that it could've been a shorter novel but at least Lauren Weisberger keeps you anticipating what new degradation and insanity Andrea will have to suffer through next. And if you're a woman all the brand names being thrown around in the story will make you salivate.The story gets a little old after a while, I think, though. That's why I said it could've been shorter. And you really end up questioning the wisdom of Andrea (who's Brown-educated), especially when her romantic relationship starts to fall apart. But even so you can't help but like her and laugh at some of her thoughts. And I think the Miranda Priestly character is perfect! She's a villain all the way and more than anything else it's her that keeps you reading because you just can't wait to see how it ends.On the whole, Prada was definitely funny but not a book you take seriously. But still worth escaping with."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This is the worst book I have read. It just dragged on and on--about the 2nd to last chapter is when it was getting interesting.
