The author covers pretty much all VB topics as related to coding standards.I've been programming in VB for many years, so much of this was not new to me, but it did have some helpful tips. His chapter on comments is very good and had some helpful insight for writing better comments.The last chapter covers how to set up Visual Source Safe, a topic that I was interested to see included here. It is somewhat unrelated, but it is in fact a very useful step-by-step guide to setting up this tool for source code control. This alone makes this book worthwhile if you're not using VSS now and would like to."},{"Title":"Practical Standards for Microsoft Visual Basic","review":"A very well written book about what you should have learned in college (or your first programming class in high school). If you program for a living you should be applying these concepts already, but if you slept through your software design classes then definatly read this!I don't like the authors frequent use of the goto statement, and I'm not a big fan of Hungarian notation but those are the only two negitives I find (and hence the reason for 4 stars). He does an exceptional job of showing both the wrong way and the right way to accomplish the topic he is covering (for instance having only 1 exit in a sub)..Well worth the read.. matter of fact I'm going to be suggesting this to the project managers at work as a &quot;must read&quot; for new hires and veterans alike."},{"Title":"Practical Standards for Microsoft Visual Basic","review":"I have read countless VB articles, and books, and have often longed for a one-stop resource about structured VB programming. When working with different teams over different periods of time, I have often found that little or no standards are in place. Consequently, the time to get a feel for someone else's code can sometimes be more than the time to fix it.Foxall's book isn't an end all to programming in VB. And some may feel that he is telling you how to code, and stifiling what many programmers fear-their individuality. This simply isn't the case. Foxall breaks down all the aspects of a VB project, and how to best document, declare, write, and design your code.This is the most practical book I have ever read. Thanks for a wonderful book. And more thanks for something that's equally as practical."},{"Title":"Practical Standards for Microsoft Visual Basic","review":"Foxall's work is valuable not only for what it encourages and discourages with clear, persuasive examples of good versus poor VB programming practices, but also for the compelling way in which he unifies the underlying principles of his thinking into an elegant advocacy of extensible, maintainable code.This book belongs in every VB team leader's right-hand desk drawer.richard_stout@hotmail.com"},{"Title":"Practical Standards for Microsoft Visual Basic","review":"Many VB developers are used to writing the code anyway they please, however, when you or anyone else needs to debug your applications couple of weeks later, it's harder to understand what is going on in the code unless you follow some standards. This book tells you what standards you should follow, offers examples, explanations, and reasons.Get it, because you will learn something, regardless of the version of VB you are currently using."},{"Title":"Practical Standards for Microsoft Visual Basic","review":"There are some books you wish every VB programmer would read, this is one of them. I used this book as a helpful reference to develop programming standards for two developer groups. I did not agree with all the standards in the book. I felt that some of them were not actually the standards followed in the industry, but most were well laid out and if followed would improve the VB programming industry.Some areas were covered more indepth than others and those that were not covered so well probably should have just been left out. (Source Safe, Error Handling [get an error handling book])All-in-all a very good book and I don't believe there is a better VB standards book on the market today."},{"Title":"Practical Standards for Microsoft Visual Basic","review":"Although I progam in VBA, primarily in Access, I wanted a book to help me with using standards in my work. I was not disappointed in buying this book. The use of Directives to synthesize the descriptive information into succinct programming rules was very good; the Directives should be included in a separate tear-out card on heavy stock so that it can be handy at all times.I found particularly helpful the portions on Naming Conventions, Select Case...End Case, Create Thoughtful and functional Message Boxes, and Central Error Handlers. I can now create intelligent and useful Message Boxes and am looking forward to writing Central Error Handlers based on the books suggestions. One of the most useful and well organized books I have ever bought."},{"Title":"Practical Standards for Microsoft Visual Basic","review":"Use programming standards, make code more reliable by eliminating questionable variables, and provide flexible error controls with the aid of this survey of common programming pitfalls and their solutions.

It seems that every vb developer I've known writes code in whatevr way they think is best. This makes it very difficult when it comes to someone else maintaining their code.This book offers clear examples of best practices for writing code. I particularly like the way Microsoft uses 2 colors when displaying code. Other than the interface chapters (which are very handy), there aren't many figures. I would really like to see some standards on writing database applications (since that's what so many of us do), but perhaps that's for another edition. A tear-out card of the standards would also have been nice, but the cd version makes up for this mostly.I'm surprised by the person who gave the book 2 stars. Yeah, I tend to disagree with a few things in the book, but the author points out early on that that is going to happen. But then again, I wasn't expecting to learn any advanced programming techniques, just how to better my code - which I have thanks to this book."},{"Title":"Practical Standards for Microsoft Visual Basic","review":"I've read a lot of programming books, and I have to say that this one was definately the easiest to read, and it provided a lot of valuable information.In addition to providing useful information about coding standards for Visual Basic, this book also has a chapter on source code control and implementing Microsoft Visual SourceSafe. I can honestly say that this single chapter was instrumental in the successful implementation of SourceSafe for my company."},{"Title":"Practical Standards for Microsoft Visual Basic","review":"Recently I need to draft a VB code standard for my colleagues and this book comes in handy. Most advise in the book is nothing new, every good developer should have already heard of it (whether they adopt it is a different issue).As another reviewer has mentioned, the suggestion that ByRef is only used for parameters you physically modified is the worst of all his advise. The aim of all these practice is to avoid un-maintainable and sloppy codes, this &quot;advise&quot; unfortunately just promotes it. I recommend explicitly declare ByRef/ByVal for all parameters.Another advise I don't agree is the one exit point per procedure. Perhaps my experience in C/C++ and Object Pascal is always okay with exiting in the middle of a procedure. I find the multiple labels too busy and non-intuitive. For invalid parameters, I would rather raise an exception and let the caller due with the problem (s/he deserves it for passing junk to the procedure.)The use '* to begin a comment is also too busy, I would rather just use ' and a space.If you are a beginner to intermediate VB developer, I encourage you to read it. However don't treat the book as a bible, use your own judgement as you progress. The best book I found for writing good solid code is still Steve McConnell's Code Complete."},{"Title":"Practical Standards for Microsoft Visual Basic","review":"An individual with a CS degree would probably find this material simplistic. However, for the rest of us this book is invaluable. Like many in this field today, I came from a business background. I found that this book in combination with Code Complete helped to solidify my basic programming foundation.While Code Complete is a general software design book, this book is very focused on VB. It starts off with simple suggestions (project templates and forms) to improve productivity and standardization. Sections follow this on procedure scope, naming conventions, formatting and commenting. The section on error handling was especially helpful. The book covered all the VB IDE settings for error debugging and made suggestions on error handler specifications. I even learned a few things on something as simple as looping structures. The final chapters on GUI design, user data entry, and version control were the strongest part of the book. Although GUI design was limited to one chapter, I gained more from it than many entire books.If I hadn't read Code Complete first, I might have been tempted to give this book five stars. This book doesn't quit match the literary excellence of Code Complete, but it does come close. I would give this book 4.5 stars, if Amazon had the setting for it."},{"Title":"Practical Standards for Microsoft Visual Basic","review":"If you have come here looking for a book on how to code VB, look elsewhere. If instead, you are looking to develop maintainable code amongst all the developers in your organization, you have come to the right place.In the present development world we often code for performance at the expense of all other aspects of development (maintainability, scalability, etc.). A good set of standards will take you far down the path to maintainable code and poor maintainability is often more expensive to an organization (at least in the long run) than poor performance.We have taken many of the standards here and altered them to the style of the majority of our programmers. By using internally developed VB templates, we have decreased development time without sacrificing quality. This is not fully attributable to this book alone, but the new focus on standards has certainly played a role.If you are serious about developing in a team environment, you will want to develop organizational standards for your team. It will save your company time and money and make it easier for your development team to communicate."},{"Title":"Practical Standards for Microsoft Visual Basic","review":"This is an excellent book for VB development teams. It contains very useful, practical standards suggestions, and it's very easy to read. About 95% of it could just be followed without change, with the rest subject to local embellishments. I haven't come across another VB book that is this useful, and would be a fabulous headstart for anyone starting out on the VB road."},{"Title":"Practical Standards for Microsoft Visual Basic","review":"I just finished reading this book. I am currently learning VB and neither the teachers nor the books I previously read explained anything about how to write decent code, and in many cases gave examples of bad code. I was amazed to discover from this book that every procedure should have an error handler, but it really makes sense. This book has really opened my eyes."},{"Title":"Practical Standards for Microsoft Visual Basic","review":"and no one can teach you anything new, because you already know everything, I still think this book is defintely worthwhile. So if you are new to programming and/or Visual Basic this book is an absolute must-buy. Do yourself a favor and learn a clear, concise methodology from the get-go, before you fall in love with your own personal style."},{"Title":"Practical Standards for Microsoft Visual Basic","review":"This book is definitely a welcomed one. For all of you VB Leads that needs to maintain standards documentation, this book could replace that documentation or at least, give you a pretty good head start.For all of the non-experienced (or not trained) VB programmers out there, following the guidelines of this book will make you much better, efficient, and 'marketable' since everybody will now be able to read your code and actually understand it.Now we all know that documentation &amp; good coding is a must but developers just don't it. Obviously, this book can't help that but it will at least give Lead developers something to stand on and work it out from there."},{"Title":"Practical Standards for Microsoft Visual Basic","review":"There is obviously a need for such a book. However, Microsoft Press suggests this book for intermediate to advanced users. I would target this at beginning to (perhaps) intermediate users. Others will be disappointed as I was.Lots to disagree with here as well. A recomendation is made to only place ByRef in parameter definitions if the user INTENDS to change the parameter while in the routine. ByRef parameters which the user does not intend to change receive no prefix. Not the best advice. Another section suggests branching to a graceful exit point if input data is invalid. Since invalid input data generally suggests a problem elsewhere in the code, a better suggestion is assertion (a subject not discussed and perhaps out of scope) and/or raising an error. Some of the treatments seem pretty shallow - for example, the section on error handling is more a tutorial on the basic error object."},{"Title":"Practical Standards for Microsoft Visual Basic","review":"This is a very good book on Visual Basic 6.0 standards. Every Visual Basic shop should use this book as a guideline for setting their standards. The author constantly writes books that are 4 or 5 stars. His book \\"MCSD in a Nutshell\\" is one of the best study guides for the 2 Visual Basic 6.0 exams. This book was provided free by a former employer, but I practice these standards on daily basis. Following these standards, will reduce your maintenance time and will make your source code much easier to read."},{"Title":"Mending Cracks in the Soul: The Role of the Holy Spirit in Healing Wounds of the Past","review":"I am very much a Bible-believing Christian. If you want to introduce me to a new concept, then be prepared to give me the Word of God to back up what you're saying. I have read many books on deliverance and inner healing (emotional healing) ministry, but this one immediately became one of my favorites. What is presented in this book is absolutely amazing! EVERY minister who desires to operate in the area of inner healing and deliverance NEEDS to read this book! It will help them get to the root of the problem, and allow the Holy Spirit to minister to the emotional wounds. God's Word speaks very clearly about the ministry of emotional healing...Luke 4:18, \\"The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised.\\"But unfortunately, many Christians today have little or no clue as to how to receive inner healing. This book does a phenomenal job at explaining how the Holy Spirit wants to take us back to the wound, and then bring us into tremendous healing from that wound. It is backed with scripture, and the author does a fine job at breaking down the process.When doing deliverance ministry, it is important to be prepared to minister in four areas:- Break up legal grounds (repentance, renouncing curses, etc.)- Tear down strongholds (through studying and meditating on the Word of God)- Minister to inner wounds (emotional healing play a vital role in a person's freedom)- Cast out the demonsWhen a minister casts out demons, but fails to clean up the things which are giving the demons access the person, then there are going to be cases where the demons come back and their newfound freedom is quickly lost. But when the things which are letting the demons in are dealt with, true and lasting freedom can be established. That should be the goal of every minister operating in the area of deliverance and spiritual warfare.If you are in the ministry, or somebody who has been wounded or suffers from dysfunctional emotions, then this book is for you. I HIGHLY recommend it!I honestly cannot give this book a higher recommendation!"},{"Title":"Mending Cracks in the Soul: The Role of the Holy Spirit in Healing Wounds of the Past","review":"The outstanding fact I enjoyed about this book is the well applied scripture in context and cross referenced. This is not a &quot;feel good&quot; book, it is a book directing you to grasp the power and wisdom found in THE BOOK.Dale, well done!"},{"Title":"Mending Cracks in the Soul: The Role of the Holy Spirit in Healing Wounds of the Past","review":"If you are seeking more freedom, or are interested in ministering healing to other people, this book is for you. I believe it is scripturally sound and leads you to the Lord Jesus, who is the only one that can provide true healing."},{"Title":"The Master of Mary of Burgundy: A Book of Hours for Engelbert of Nassau ( Bodleian Library, Oxford)","review":"This is a lovely facimile of a book hours in the bodleian library in oxford. This book of hours was made by &quot;the master of Mary of Burgundy&quot; in the early 16th century. In additon to the 'carpet pages' of this manuscript, various text pages are also reproduced. Many of the illustrated pages have gold leaf on them and an gold ink is used to reproduce this effect. My only complaint with this book is that this ink has in some places obscured details of the manuscript and made pages look heavier than I think they probably do in the orginal work.If you have read any books on illuminated manuscripts in the past, you might be suprised by the number of pages you will recognise in this book. In size the book is quite small. Quite litrely the size of your palm, and this is a reflection on the actual size of the manuscript in Oxford. The publishers have tried to reproduce the facilmile as close as possible to the orginal where they could.If you are interested in illumanated manuscipts this book is worth having."},{"Title":"The Master of Mary of Burgundy: A Book of Hours for Engelbert of Nassau ( Bodleian Library, Oxford)","review":"This title is a reproduction of a late medieval/Northern Renaissance Book of Hours or prayer book. There is just enough explaination of the artistic conventions, the revisions made as one nobleman's coat of arms replaced another, artistic conventions and medieval/early modern symbolism to let the modern reader understand the book, without going into abtruse art history discourse.The physical book is suprisingly small--palm sized. I can look at this volume for hours to marvel not only at the calligraphy but also the details of paintings of the borders.I am no art historian, just a book lover, and I love this little book."},{"Title":"String figures of the Tuamotus (String figure monographs No. 2)","review":"Ce livre de 150 pages m'a enchant&eacute;e.

Il y a aussi des cycles et des tours de ficelle."},{"Title":"Debugging ASP: Troubleshooting for Programmers","review":"If you just look through the topics this book covers, it might interest you--which is why I decide to buy the book, especially after seeing a 5 star review here. However, the more you read on, the more disappointing you will be. Yeah, it did cover quite some points, but most of them are very shallow, the explanation does not go deep. You will find it begins with problems you met, explains things you normally know already, and then stop right there, leaving you as puzzled as before.Just contrary to some previous reviews, to me, the 2 COM chapters are almost totally useless. My suggestion is, read those 2 chapters in the book store first, if you think it's valuable, then it probably is a book for you. But even if you do think those 2 chapters are great, you probably still want to check the title: professional ASP 3.0 by Wrox. That title worths 10 times the time and money you will put in &quot;debugging asp&quot;. I was not so appreciative about professional asp 3.0 before, but after I read &quot;debuggin asp&quot;, that Wrox book looks like an ASP bible to me.At last, to be fair, I have not read chapter 9~12, so the above comment only applies to the other chapters."},{"Title":"Debugging ASP: Troubleshooting for Programmers","review":"Of all the books I've read about ASP development, this has got to be the absolute best! The 3 chapters on COM alone would more than justify the price of the book.Having developed with Active Server Pages for a little over 3 years now (ever since they first came out), I really thought I knew it all. This book proved me wrong!"},{"Title":"Debugging ASP: Troubleshooting for Programmers","review":"If you are debugging someone else's code, or writing your own, this has got to be the most helpful resource. Worth every penny, it is based on the premise that 80% of errors in ASP code arise from the same 10 or so problems: a huge time-saver.Time and again it has proven a very handy desk reference. I have used ASP for 2 years now, but I wish I had read this book from day one. Deals with real-world programming problems - excellent info on COMs, connecting to SQL server."},{"Title":"Debugging ASP: Troubleshooting for Programmers","review":"I've only been doing ASP for about 6 months, and I found this book extremely helpful. There are a few things that I have always had questions about and others that I didn't understand at all. This hit just about all of them, and I feel as if I understand ASP much better now.The only problem was that I was hoping for a little more coverage of .Net than this book contained -- only one Appendix. On the other hand, I haven't been able to find much else at the bookstore yet. So, this is probably about as good as you're going to do."},{"Title":"Debugging ASP: Troubleshooting for Programmers","review":"Since I have been using ASP for a year+ this book was easy reading for me. It contained anyway a set of extremely helpful hints and explanations on the 'world surrounding ASP' like IIS, mantainig state with sessions,file system problems, security,performance and of course debugging issues. If you already know the basics of ASP this is a great one to get."},{"Title":"Debugging ASP: Troubleshooting for Programmers","review":"I received this as a gift for my birthday. In general, I think a computer book is a fairly lousy birthday gift -- but this one almost made it worthwhile.I don't think you could ask for a better book about Active Server Page development.

Bartender, gimme another\\" she remarks about one fund-raising event. \\"Cancer made me feel special in a weird way... I didn't feel bad for myself and I didn't want other people to either.\\" The woman's insouciance is breathtaking (and could well be offputting to those who, unlike Erin, are losing their battle against the disease); love her or deplore her, it's hard to dispute that her brazen disregard for tactfulness reveals a most distinctive voice. Barbs fly in all directions -- including zingers at her adored mom, dad, and 2 sisters -- and she holds nothing back about her own motivations, e.g. \\"I hadn't really done much volunteer work since high school and even then it was fueled by my desire to look well-rounded on my college applications -- and because all the cool kids did Key Club.\\" It may not be the prettiest picture, but it comes across as very real."},{"Title":"My So-Called Normal Life","review":"I read all of Erin Zammett's columns in Glamour magazine, so when I came across this book I hesitated to read it - I didn't want to re-read everything that was in the columns. Plus, I thought, how interesting could reading about someone's cancer treatments be? Turns out, very interesting.That's because this book is about much more than just Erin's cancer treatments. It's about her life as a whole, while going through some unusual and hard cirumstances. Ms. Zammett has a great writing style and manages to keep things interesting and fast-moving while instilling humor into the book and telling it like it is. It's obvious that she's very honest and makes no attempt to stay \\"PC.\\" (She openly states that she lost weight while undergoing treatment, and still loves how she looks in pictures from that time period.)This book is an easy, interesting read, and after finishing it you can't help but admire Erin and her family for what they've been through and feel a little bit grateful for your life as it is."},{"Title":"My So-Called Normal Life","review":"I'm actualy Steve's wife, Jodi who's writing this review. I had been following Erin Zammett's story in Glamour magazine since her diagnosis. Every three months I would look forward with anticipation and hope about her latest entry. Her writing style was so real, and she wore her emotions and feelings on her sleeve. She had nothing to hide from her readers. Cut to this summer, I was vacationing in Maui with my husband, right there, at our hotel was the girl from the pictures that I had read about for all these years. We spoke and she told me that she was on her honeymoon and that she was doing and feeling great. I told her that I loved her articles in Glamour. She then told me she had written a book.

I strongly recommend reading this book, and I hope to see a lot more books from this talented young author!"},{"Title":"My So-Called Normal Life","review":"An amazing account of reality in a young woman's life; told as it is. The author offers readers the upside and downside of life with cancer. An inspiring book to those who suffer similarly and shows them that life must go on and may still have much to offer. Instead of letting cancer ruin and run her life, the author demonstrates that even a dreaded disease can have positive effects. Any reader of this book should walk away with a better appreciation of family, friends and the knowledge that life is what you make of it."},{"Title":"My So-Called Normal Life","review":"I first fell in love with Erin's writing style when I read her column in Glamour magazine. She's very witty and funny. I remember thinking I had to tell my best friend that she had to read it. I always looked forward to her next one. When I found out she had written a book, I quickly looked for it and purchased it. At first I thought I might just be reviewing what I had already read in the magazine, but obviously the book goes into much more depth and I really enjoyed learning about and \\"getting to know\\" her family. I really feel like I know them and it made me want to be one of the many houseguests at her parents' home!

She turns her tragedy into good work and action by starting to fund raise for the cancer society and with the help of glamour magazine raises 25,000+ dollars. There is another twist in the story. Completely unrelated her sister gets cancer as well, Hodgkin's lymphoma. Unlike leukemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma is curable.

But just like the author, I was diagnosed at a young age. Even though we did not share the same cancer, I could relate to the way she described how she felt throughout her journey/recovery and how people in her life (boyfriend/family/coworkers) were affected by it. It was great to finally read how a young person dealt with cancer and had the same issues as I. I recommend this book to any young cancer patient. We may have different cancers but the feelings/hardships are the same."},{"Title":"My So-Called Normal Life","review":"I was laughing & crying hysterical at the same time.

It takes a lot of courage to go public with such an intimate story, and Erin tells her tale with such grace that it was really hard for me to put the book down -- I literally finished reading it within 48 hours (which made my husband laugh because I read an entire book before he even finished a chapter of his). BUY THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"My So-Called Normal Life","review":"It was written with warmth and honesty...I would highly recommend it for people who were diagnosed with leukemia or for the ones who weren't but still don't know how precious their lives are...After I read this book, I really decided to make some severe changes in my life, and I started with being so grateful for every good things I have.It should be handed out to the patients at every psycologists' offices to make the depressed ones feel better."},{"Title":"My So-Called Normal Life","review":"Erin has the rare ability to simultaneously be candid, funny, endearing and intelligent while recounting the amazing story of facing her worst nightmare.

There were a few, but I kind of lost interest when I felt she kept going on and on about everything she did for the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society.

In my mind I had to erase everything I thought I knew because THIS YEAR in particular was economically challenging. After reading the book and samples of letters, I got the big picture. I realized the power of story telling and followed even the rules about the proper font to use. The letter I wrote was engaging and nothing like I'd ever written before. It's only been a lttle over a week since our appeal was mailed, and donation envelopes are received in our mailbox already.

This is a science that is changing so fast that in order to keep up it is necessary to go to this approach rather than a single author writing a book as will happen when it settles down.This edition contains 18 articles written by a who's who of the field. They come from virtually every major research institution in the country and there are several entries from other countries.I particularly enjoyed the look back over sixty years of medical genetics written by Alfred Knudson. In medical school during World War II, he was in at the beginning of the modern era of genetics research and specialized in cancer research.The other articles are all of high caliber. Some of course, more interesting than others.

The charming ways of his writing will stay with the reader forever.

He also throws in just enough humor to keep the information entertaining and fun but never strays from the serious intent of helping you become a true working actor."},{"Title":"Book the Job: 143 Things Actors Need to Know to Make It Happen","review":"This is a must-have for every actor in Hollywood. BOOK THE JOB answers pretty much every question you have on auditioning and being on the set. I liked the format alot, as it was easy to read (fun to read,also!). Educational but entertaining. A very practical guide to being an actor. This book discusses all sorts of scenarios that actors have to confront, with intelligent recommendations on how deal with them. It is a manual on the craft of acting AND the business of acting."},{"Title":"Book the Job: 143 Things Actors Need to Know to Make It Happen","review":"I've taken classes with Doug (and he's incredible as a scene study coach btw), and this book has much of his experience and wisdom distilled into easy to grasp snippets.The words are simple... the concepts are simple... and simply powerful.This is a great book from a great acting coach."},{"Title":"Book the Job: 143 Things Actors Need to Know to Make It Happen","review":"For those who don't live in Los Angeles and have the opportunity to study with Doug Warhit in person, this book offers a chance to benefit from the tremendous amount of useful, helpful and extremely accurate information that he has to offer. Filled with great advice on wide range of topics, and infused with a wonderful sense of compassion and humor, this book is a quick and fun read that will lead to immediate improvements in your acting work.

It is very easy to read, and gives the actor an excellent roadmap for the entire audition process. He helps decode what they casting directors say, vs. what they really mean. He empowers the actor by reminding them that this is their career and they make their own choices.The best book on acting there is."},{"Title":"Book the Job: 143 Things Actors Need to Know to Make It Happen","review":"This is the ultimate must for any actor! Contemporary and up to date! For anyone just starting out in Los Angeles it is truly invaluable. Warhit takes his years of experience with actors and the business and turns them into a fabulous \\"how to\\" for the novice as well as the seasoned actor. This book covers it all. It takes you through the audition process: before, during and after; the business; acting technique, (a must have checklist for any scene or monologue); working on the set; and maybe most beneficial, \\"Breaking Free of Barriers\\"...the actors own \\"drama\\" that holds them back.Any actor in L.A or thinking of moving to L.A should read this book! Any actor who wants to deepen their understanding of how to create unique and real characters should read this book. Any actor who wants to break free of their insecurities should read this book.The greatest plus to reading this book is knowing that if you are in Los Angeles, you can actually STUDY with this master teacher, Doug Warhit. But even if you are not in LA you can rest assured that you have the next best thing! Every drama class in America should have this book on it's curriculum."},{"Title":"Oplontis: The Villa Poppea","review":"I read this book in its German language edition, but frankly almost anyone will enjoy this book in any language, as it is 90% comprised of simply gorgeous color plates and some charts.The book is an examination of one particular villa in Oplontis, a community along the main road slightly west of Pompeii and Herculaneum, buried in the volcanic eruption like the rest in 79 AD. The villa's ownership is attributed to Poppea, Nero's second wife, based on an inscription on an amphora found in the bathroom of the excavated villa; however, it is known that the property was not inhabited at the time of the explosion, undergoing either expansion or renovation, perhaps work still required as a result of the earthquake of 63 AD.In any evemt, the villa's layout, luxury, fantastic frescoes and decor, are all lovingly reproduced in this short book in stunning color. It lends real insight into the levels of luxury and sophistication attained by the wealthy at this time of the Empire."},{"Title":"Raincoast Chronicles First Five Collector's Edition","review":"I finally finished Raincoast Chronicles First Five.

This approach not only helps people with health issues, but will help to clean up the planet as well. If we could all resist the fast food/processed food diet propaganda, our children will have a much healthier future. This is the best book I have read on lifestyle/health changes. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Revolution and the Millennium: China, Mexico, and Iran","review":"This book is brimming with enlightening and interesting information, but the thesis could perhaps be more strongly made.

Thats about all that needs to be said. I'll elaborate however. As a professional perl programmer, it is my business to know what modules are out there, and thus I know many of them from CPAN. The last place I am going to look is in a big old printed book when I could do this instead: $ perl -MCPAN -e 'i /irc/' if i were looking, for, say, and IRC module (which the book of course doesnt cover). The copy of postgres included with the book is quite old and full of bugs. Newer versions are faster and more stable. There is a chapter provided on creating your own modules, but it is literally less than 2 pages long, and quite laughable on its face. If you want a book on Object Oriented Programming, get Damian Conway's _Object Oriented Programming with Perl_. It's far better. I gave this book 2 stars instead of one because the CD is useful if I am stuck somewhere on dialup and need a CPAN mirror (incomplete that it is)."},{"Title":"Instant Perl Modules","review":"This book was a real disapointment. Like many programmers, I learn best by example. So I was hoping the code discussed in the book (and on the cd rom) would contain examples of working perl modules. However, it contains exactly three! And even those are so short, they hardly showcase the various aspects of coding a perl module. The rest of the scripts on the cdrom (the non-modules) are incredibly simple little jobs showcasing the abilities of &gt;other&lt; perl modules! Bummer."},{"Title":"Instant Perl Modules","review":"I found this book to be very enlightening to expand the world of Perl modules to me. I was somewhat disappointed , however in the lack of detail in the GD graphics library area. The DBI documentation is right on and very useful.Part of the beauty of the book is to describe processes you would have to wade thru many readmes. The GD Library part is deceptive as the GD library install has a lot of prerequitites, not listed in the book. The book shows some cool examples on the GD library ...a little more content in this area around the mysterious subject(maybe if they simplified this too) of how to create the shared library libgd. This appears to be a mystery on the web in general. I am not a novice PERL programmer and it was sad to see how convoluted it was to get the GD library to work vs, as described in the book. Bottom Line in this review....this is a book worth buying, however, be careful not to assume that getting thr GD module...one of the more glamourous modules discussed, is as easy as stated.Doug and Frank...keep up the good work.your book helps to start fill a gap in the Perl module area....well written, easy to follow."},{"Title":"Instant Perl Modules","review":"Minutes after opening this book I was installing the Perl/Tk module in a private directory (explained on page 6).

Furey details exactly how a person with this condition thinks, feels, and deals with life. It is obvious that through his experience as a therapist he has gleaned an intimate knowledge of how painful, yet prevalent, shame is in affecting people and relationships. He provides many insightful real-life examples throughout. Best of all, Dr.Furey outlines easy to follow steps toward healing and recovery. This book can provide empathy, acknowledgement, and encouragement to anyone who might be dealing with the &quot;monster&quot; of shame. I found in it the hope that with small changes in thinking &quot; I can become good enough.&quot;"},{"Title":"1794: America, Its Army, and the Birth of the Nation","review":"This little gem of a book is one of the most interesting I have ever read. It covers the disbanding of the Continental Army, the fear of a standing army by some of the Founding Fathers, the anti-military stance of the anti-Federalists, the Constitutional Convention and how Washington was 'elected' as the first President, and how the US quelled both the Indian problems in the Old Northwest and the Whiskey Rebellion.The narrative is crisp, accurate, and the tale told is fascinating. The cast of characters, from Washington and Frankling, through Hamilton and Gerry, and finally to Anthony Wayne is impressive, spellbinding, and completely fascinating.It is a great read and gives insight into the troubles, nearly fatal troubles, that the young United States faced in its irst decade and a half as an independent nation.This book also answers many questions: Why some of the Founders objected to a strong military establishment (Patrick Henry and Thomas Jefferson were two that did-neither listened to Washington and settled on the dubious security of the militia which Washington considered 'a broken reed.'); why the Indians had to be fought in the Old Northwest; why the Constitution came into being, and finally how the United States finally survived and evolved.This is a character study of a young nation trying to come to grips with its own nationhood, and how it would fulfill the promise of the Declaration of Independence. It is a fascinating tale told with wit, verve, and accuracy."},{"Title":"1794: America, Its Army, and the Birth of the Nation","review":"In these days of frustration with the Iraq War, these days of seeing the Military become unfortunate casualties in the political war on Capitol Hill, it is quite remarkable to find a book that deals with the \`Why\\" of a strong military. Importantly, the author, David R. Palmer is a retired US Army Lieutenant General, former Commandant of West Point.Mr. Palmer does not argue for or against a military in this book. Rather, he takes the reader back to the political and economic cross currents, the crisis really, of 1794, the year both the US Army and Navy were formally established. He brings us back to the time when America's Western Frontier included the Appalachian Mountains, when savage warfare was being waged between American settlers and Native Americans in present day Ohio. It is a time of foreign intrigue and intervention which would ultimately lead to another war with Britain in 1812 and eject both France and Spain from present day America.He dissects this period with a historian's eye to detail and does so in a very even handed, thoughtful and professional way. The result of his analysis comes to the same conclusion today as the Founding Fathers reached in 1794. The United States needs, requires, a strong military in order to be taken seriously in the field of diplomacy. For men like Mr. Palmer, love of country, devotion to the Constitution and civilian control of the military is a many generational set of rules, law and traditions as honored today as it was in 1794. Absolutely breathtaking."},{"Title":"1794: America, Its Army, and the Birth of the Nation","review":"Dave Palmer makes clear that the Second Amendment was aboutmilitary organization.

It covers everything from what basic tools you need to the functions of the component parts of every common steering and suspension design. I've learned a lot from it. The book is well written, layed out and edited.If you are looking for a book on building race car suspensions, raising or lowering your vehicle - you might want to look somewhere else. If you are studying for an automotive certification this is the best book I've found. It has quizzes at the end of each chapter. It's full of tips, real world examples and diagnostic tricks. There are lots of pictures and illustrations. Included with the book is a coupon for an online ASE practice certification exam.

I thought this was a book about pro-choice options and it was completely misleading. I threw this hateful stuff in the garbage lest anyone else read it! And it was not hardcover when it was sent to me from the used book source I bought it from, it was softcover. Very dissapointing!"},{"Title":"Handbook on abortion,","review":"This book helped start the pro-life movement, written by the long-time (and now former) president of National Right to Life. It is chock full of statistics, explanation and descriptions of the methods used to abort, and is full of reasoned analysis and a strong defense of the unborn. If you can find it, snatch it up. Some of the facts may be dated, but the clear reasoned analysis is timeless. More up to date books are available but this one belongs in the library of anyone who is at all remotely interested in the abortion issue."},{"Title":"The Art of Rhetoric (Institutiones Oratoriae, 1711-1741).

Sure, it sounds far-fetched! But that possibility is already here today, and that's what Dr. Jeff Conklin's book is about.This book is NOT about how to \\"herd cats\\", nor is it about learning to \\"control people better\\". In fact, it's just the opposite... it's about encouraging each person's creativity through a process where each and every point of view, no matter how difficult or \\"contrarian\\", ends up adding value to the larger \\"map\\" of the conversation that is being created.Based on my experience with Dialogue Mapping, I recommend this book highly as an exciting breakthrough for anyone wanting to develop highly-functioning work teams, group synergy, and collective intelligence. Since this process is specifically designed to help groups address \\"wicked problems\\", it is particularly relevant for those of us who are tackling the complex social issues that are at the heart of public participation and deliberative democracy projects.While the principles described in the book can be applied with chart paper and markers, the value of this approach is greatly enhanced by the powerful and easy-to-use software that Dr. Conklin and his colleagues have developed. Compendium allows the facilitator to track, manage, organize, and display all of the various perspectives and considerations that emerge in a group during the Dialogue Mapping process. This high-powered program has been designed as open-source shareware, and is available freely through a link on Dr. Conklin's website to the Compendium Institute.We need only to look at the wide array of technologies that are available in our world today to realize that, as a species, we are amazingly creative and capable. It's high time that we applied our capacities to enhancing our human interactions with one another! Dialogue Mapping is a highly effective way to help groups enter a state of \\"flow\\", analogous to a sports team entering the \\"zone\\" of outstanding performance. As such, it is a real cause for celebration."},{"Title":"Dialogue Mapping: Building Shared Understanding of Wicked Problems","review":"At last Dr. Conklin has done it: Given those of us who have been using Dialogue Mapping in our consulting practices a definitive, well-written manual on how to develop and extend our expertise. The tool itself is not only indispensable: It reflects a way of thinking about problems that engenders shared inquiry.Shared inquiry is all about the power of inclusion, and inclusion is a key component of corporate internal communication. Companies that practice inclusive problem solving consistently not only outperform other companies in the same industry, but tend to be the most enjoyable places to work!Recent studies by Watson Wyatt and others point to the quality of internal communication as a leading indicator of corporate financial performance. In my experience, Dialogue Mapping is a technique that has helped focus my clients on identifying and eliminating the roadblocks to real business success.If you are struggling with wicked problems and attempting to work through difficult obstacles with limited success, you need to learn Dialogue Mapping. Stop what you're doing right now and buy this book. It is absolutely indispensable."},{"Title":"Dialogue Mapping: Building Shared Understanding of Wicked Problems","review":"I read this book recently and my facilitation and project management efforts have improved as a result.Some of the key subjects/topic areas that jumped out of this book for me are:-- Practicing the listening cycle, especially the sub-section of the book that discusses validating information.-- Learning to ask the 7 questions and in particular using these questions as a lens to assess the health of a collaborative effort-- Helping me better understand the meaning of shared understanding"},{"Title":"Dialogue Mapping: Building Shared Understanding of Wicked Problems","review":"Full disclosure, I read this book while it was still a manuscript in preparation. I liked how it was taking form then, and I am most pleased with how it has turned out. I have used the methods described in this book in classroom settings, both with teachers, and with students. In the student case, we used dialog mapping to layout a course in Java programming; students offering their ideas and dreams, realizing the outcome in a course outline. With teachers, the task was to facilitate teachers coming to grips with so-called \\"constructivist\\" methods in the classroom. Dialog mapping, it turns out, is about as \\"constructivist\\" as you can get. Jeff does a great job outlining these methods, complete with enough background theory, lightly stated.

Mr. Krause's book neatly solves the applicant's problems of not knowing what the most-frequently asked questions are for each technical area. Granted, some of the technology may seem antique, but I can't think of a major company that doesn't have a pressing need for as many mainframe programmers as it can lay its hands on. The other feature of this book is the reverse view. Simply stated, it gives managers sets of questions (as well as the correct answers) to ask their candidates. This provides structure to the hiring manager's interview and, because the same questions will be asked of each candidate, it provides a level playing field when she or he has to evaluate multiple candidates. Yes, of course there is the chance that a manager will ask questions that the candidate has just read in this book, but there's nothing to be done about that.

Anyone involved in a service firm should read it carefully and follow Lauren's lead."},{"Title":"Ending the Gauntlet: Removing Barriers to Women's Success in the Law","review":"Ending the Gauntlet focuses on removing barriers to women's success in the legal field, but its message is applicable across a broad range of professions and industries, and to a broad range of people who are not white males. The truth is that the playing field has yet to be leveled, and this book shows how that can be done."},{"Title":"Ending the Gauntlet: Removing Barriers to Women's Success in the Law","review":"I just returned from an event at which the author was a presenter and immediately dove into this wonderful book. Ending the Gauntlet offers an insightful and comprehensive analysis of the struggles women endure to achieve both work-life balance and professional success. The book transcends the legal professional and offers a blueprint for change that will benefit men and women alike. A must-read for management in any professional workplace."},{"Title":"Ending the Gauntlet: Removing Barriers to Women's Success in the Law","review":"A good, hard look at today's law firms, Ending the Gauntlet: Removing the Barriers to Women's Success in the Law tackles tough issues comprehensively and fairly. Lots to recommend about this book, but particularly helpful for those who care about law firm profitability are the practical recommendations Lauren Stiller Rikleen makes in the second part of the book.My work is with women, however, and I found the discussion of gender stereotypes and how they impact women to be consistent with my research and observations. Rikleen is right -- most of the time, behaviors that hold women back aren't motivated by bad intentions, merely cluelessness. Yet these behaviors hurt women and, consequently, the legal profession. Rikleen offers a blueprint for law firms who want to get better; the smart ones will follow it."},{"Title":"Ending the Gauntlet: Removing Barriers to Women's Success in the Law","review":"Ms. Rikleen's book is an insightful and well reasoned review of issues affecting the legal profession today and how those forces often work against the advancement of women attorneys. Ending the Gauntlet provides a comprehensive review of the issues facing women today, extensive research about these concerns and recommendations for change. The book's approach is a refreshing one noting that while women face day to day challenges to succeed given our culture, the real problem is the one faced by the legal profession overall. Ms. Rikleen rightly appreciates that it is time to redefine what it means to be successful in the legal profession. She offers hope that the legal profession can allow the opportunity for all lawyers to succeed and in achieving that success, there is a place for serving clients, raising healthy children, caring for elderly parents and participating in our communities."},{"Title":"Ending the Gauntlet: Removing Barriers to Women's Success in the Law","review":"I saw an advance copy of this book and was blown away. The interviews are incredibly compelling and candid, the author's voice very unique. I at times found myself nodding along in recognition of issues that I have faced myself and, at other times shocked by the choices some women have been forced to make.Finally, someone has put forth a book about these important issues, not only in law, but in so many other professions. This is an absolute must-read for everyone involved in practicing law and for all women balancing work and family."},{"Title":"Ending the Gauntlet: Removing Barriers to Women's Success in the Law","review":"Having survived three years in a law firm (and survive was the key word), I could definitly relate to the stories in this book. The only shocking part is that I was in a law firm over 10 years ago, and nothing seems to have changed. Ending the Gauntlet, however, is more than a compendium of stories of women being mommy-tracked. It looks at the structure of a law firm itself and how that contributes to the workplace issues for everyone, not just women. I particularly loved the Prologue (worth the price of the book itself, especially if you have my warped sense of humor), because it describes how a bizarre sort of company is run where performance for all employees is based solely on money they personally earn for the company; the managing director/CEO is only \\"part-time\\" because he too has to earn money to keep his title; turnover is high; management is minimal or nonexistent; and people are given management positions because they are \\"least objectionable\\" to others; part-time is extended but discouraged as it cuts into billable hours ... and you finally start to realize that while the rest of the world has moved foward, law firms are relics of days gone by"},{"Title":"Ending the Gauntlet: Removing Barriers to Women's Success in the Law","review":"Ending the Gauntlet was a powerful read -- it provides a very practical and realistic view of law firm culture for women and what needs to change.

That was absolutely not the case. Ms. Rikleen discusses the challenges that women lawyers face and the challenges that the profession as a whole faces in a thoughtful, honest and fair voice that is truly compelling to the reader. I've recommended this book to every lawyer I know (male and female)."},{"Title":"Ending the Gauntlet: Removing Barriers to Women's Success in the Law","review":"Finally someone honestly addresses many of the major problems facing the legal profession today. As a former attorney, I can relate to many of the issues raised by Ms. Rikleen in her book. I entered the legal profession as a second career and was dismayed by the attitudes I encountered toward female attorneys and toward the concept of creating a healthier work environment. While on the average, female attorneys suffer the most from antiquated and sexist ideas regarding what it means to practice law, the entire legal profession suffers as well. It is time for ALL attorneys to stop the craziness. All attorneys, firm managers and human development people should read this book."},{"Title":"Ending the Gauntlet: Removing Barriers to Women's Success in the Law","review":"\\"Ending the Gauntlet: Removing Barriers to Women's Success in the Law\\" is an outstanding book! The author uses interviews of female lawyers throughout this book to illustrate how the existing demands of private law practice do not serve the best interests of the women, the clients, and the firms, themselves. Lauren then challenges the legal profession to reexamine its centuries old basis of firm demands and organization to create a new, different and better environment for clients, firms and the lawyers themselves which is not only more humane, but will also serve the interests of all three groups much better. I highly recommend this well-written book to law firm managers, lawyers and law students."},{"Title":"Ending the Gauntlet: Removing Barriers to Women's Success in the Law","review":"In her thoroughly researched and heavily footnoted book, Lauren Stiller Rikleen examines this troublesome issue: why many female lawyers still have not achieved the same professional success as their male counterparts. Rikleen delves into the challenging topics including part-time work, and what happens to the careers of women who opt for that route. She also explains other factors that contribute to the success of male lawyers' careers (being mentored, and becoming rainmakers) and discuses why many women don't enjoy the benefit of those.Rikleen, who is well versed in the advancement of women lawyers, concludes her book with a call to action. She argues that law firms need to make a dramatic culture shift from the top down; firms should choose management which understands and values the contributions of women attorneys (not just those who fit the traditional, full-time mold). Rikleen also hopes that law firm compensation will change to reward cooperative client development efforts, among other things.Towards the end of the book Rikleen notes that it's not just childbearing female lawyers who seek a more manageable work/life balance; Generation X and Y lawyers of both sexes are also seeking the same. She encourages law firm leaders to redefine their firms' cultures (as happened at her firm) in order to keep their talented lawyers, both male and female."},{"Title":"Ending the Gauntlet: Removing Barriers to Women's Success in the Law","review":"A female co-worker of mine has been bothering me to read this book. Upon a recommendation from a friend, she picked it up and hasn't stopped talking about it. After enough pestering, I finally gave in and gave it a read. I'll admit, I went in kicking and screaming, but came out with a new perspective and respect for my fellow female co-workers. This book was a real eye opener and I strongly recommend it for anyone, male or female!

But if you find yourself contemplating divorce or even filing for one, you might wish you had read Jonathan J. Fogel's book, Preparing for Divorce While Happily Married: Tips From a Divorce Lawyer.Fogel warns that divorce can be costly both emotionally and financially, but suggests that by following his advice, the costs can be minimized and you can control the process.Fogel discusses the advantage of being the one who leaves versus the one who is left. He details a plan to get the best lawyer possible and prevent your spouse from getting the best, or even second, third, fourth or fifth best. His practical advice is extremely valuable and will help you protect yourself financially through good record keeping and by not co-mingling funds. And he lays out the child custody process and provides practical information to better your chances of receiving physical and legal custody of your children.Some of Fogel's advice is logical but not what people who are happily married usually think about. If you're in the throws of a highly charged divorce, his book is a handy reference. Fogel readily admits some of his advice is sneaky, but if you're fighting for your financial and emotional life, having an edge could keep you solvent and sane.Having worked in Family Court as a Custody and Access Evaluator, I found Fogel's advice about children and custody to be sound and practical. It is based on Minnesota law, but much of the information can be transferred to other states.If I was considering a divorce, Fogel's book would be my first choice to read. But even if you're happily married, his advice makes sense, just in case.Armchair Interviews says: No one wants to think their marriage will fail but Fogel's book is a good one to have handy.

Is there something going on that she doesn't know about? She might not want to find out the truth about her feelings for Kaoru. Some of the humor is tempered when we found out that Tina is going home to America in a year, so of course she is sad but she doesn't want to tell anyone. She just wants to have good times until then. And Ai has some doubts himself when he receives chocolate from all the girls on Valentine's Day, EXCEPT from Ai! There are some really funny scenes in this volume as the gang goes to play tennis and then later on to a water park and spa, with all the accompanying fan service.While Ai Yori Aoshi has suffered a lot since it evolved into a harem comedy, it does have flashes of emotion at times. Tina is shown in a bit of deeper light here especially. And besides, the book is funny and romantic! Even though the romance is basically juvenile, isn't that what love is? Something that makes you act like a snot-nosed kid no matter how old you are? Don't expect character development here....ever.

Some little boys might react with low-culture body-part laughter (the same way they might laugh at the word \\"butt\\") and in innocent others, the undergarment might inspire a curiosity that was otherwise dormant. For me as a parent, neither response is to be encouraged in a book about a windy day."},{"Title":"Seeing Emily","review":"\\"Seeing Emily\\" is a real find, engaging and poignant. Formally simple yet poetically and thematically rich, Joyce Lee Wong's writing possesses the depth, delicacy and force of authenticity. Very highly recommended.The novel weaves together a series of poems through which unfold the story and portrait of a Chinese-American teenager as she discovers and crafts her own identity. As Emily's childhood memories are collaged with more fragmented experiences from her fledgling present, the imagery is at times stark, lyrical, blunt and startlingly beautiful. At its best the poetry combines striking images with an unusual gentleness and warmth which subtly convey the author's profound feeling for her own roots.Emily's close relationship with her parents, movingly depicted, is at the core of her strength even as it is her own examination of this closeness which propels her to break from the confines of her family background. Here, the refinement of Chinese culture -- skillfully communicated through a haunting accuracy of images rather than through philosophy -- and the dynamism of American youth form a tender mix.Lee Wong also explores both thematically and stylistically the link between the transformative natures of love and art, as she pairs Emily's growing confidence as a young adult with her development as a painter.The directness and beauty of the author's style give an elegance to the book's complex layering of meanings, while affecting the reader's heart in a disarmingly straightforward way.The transformation of Emily's perspectives on herself, her parents, and her friends in shifting contexts will speak to any young person who has experienced a sense of being outside the mainstream, and to any reader who relishes fine and hopeful writing."},{"Title":"Seeing Emily","review":"This is beautiful coming of age story. The poetic style is well written and striking in its imagery. I loved the cat themes. This was a great quick read and I think it will resonate well with teenage girls, who can relate to Emily's quest to see her true self, regardless of the racial elements of this book, which are also well done. This great pick."},{"Title":"Seeing Emily","review":"Sixteen year old Emily has always done what is expected of her. She works hard, stays out of trouble, and gets along well with her parents. After meeting a new guy at school, Emily decides that like her drawings and paintings, she would like to be a blank canvas, ready to be designed differently. However, when Nick tries to get her to become someone she isn't, Emily becomes confused as to who she really is. A trip to her parents' homeland of Taiwan, Emily finds out who she really is.The beauty of this novel is the metaphors. Emily's poetry often compares her feelings to that of animals in a poignant way. \\"I imagined I was a cat, her eyes shining as she watches a goldfish/ that shimmers on the floor\\" (Wong 12). The imagery is detailed and moving. During the course of the story, Emily is working on a mural for her school. The mascot is a tiger, so many references are made to the tiger and its prey, paralleling Nick and Emily's relationship and her own struggle to find herself. While the comparisons are clear, a teen reader would not feel overwhelmed with \\"lecturing\\" by the morale of the story. \\"Taking Flight\\" and the following poem \\"The Dance\\" cut to the heart of the matter: a tiger chasing a monkey and Nick forcing Emily to be someone she is not. These two poems could be a pair reading for high school students, comparing the poem about the animals to the one about a relationship that doesn't feel right. Many students struggle with writing metaphors or similes without using clich&eacute;s, and these two poems balance each other perfectly.A part of \\"Taking Flight\\"With a rustle of leavesand a graceful leapto another tree,the monkey swings herself away,disappearing into the green.Even after she's goneher screams echo backso raucous and wildthey startlea flock of birds. (178)A part of \\"The Dance\\"Even the blessedly hotwater shooting outfrom the shower head,beating down loudagainst the glass walls,couldn't drown outthe words,my geisha,Emily,My geisha (181).In addition to discussing the rich language, the topic of fitting in is always timely with teens. They struggle to find their place, and this book examines a Chinese American girl's road to self-discovery.I reviewed this book for my poetry class at Texas Woman's University for my master of library science degree."},{"Title":"Seeing Emily","review":"Sixteen year old Emily is trying to make her place in the world, but first she has to figure out who she is as a person. She has wonderful skills as an artist, which have been nurtured by her mother who is also an artist. On weekends, she works in her family's Chinese restaurant and at school she seems quite respected by her teachers and she has two close friends. Emily is the only Chinese student in her school until Alex Huang appears and they're assigned to work on a school mural together because they are both so talented. After having been the only Chinese student in her school, Emily is unsure how to accept Alex into her world. Besides that, there's Nick, a hot White guy that she's attracted to and who happens to like her as well. Emily doesn't realize his attraction is based solely upon his quest for the exotic until she has a very awkward dinner with his parents. Wong provides realistic insights into Emily's life as an ABC (American Born Chinese) who doesn't feel that she fits in in the US or in Taiwan. Emily pushes limits to question and shape her identity and when her parents sense her flailing, they send her to Taiwan under the guise of learning Chinese.Seeing Emily is told in free verse. I typically have issues with this format, however in this scene in the National Palace Museum in Taipei, you can actually feel Emily shrinking as she becomes aware of the errors of her ways.Hearing the sincerity in his voice,I thought of the resentment,even anger I'd been feelingtoward my parentsbefore I left for Taipeiand I felt a twingeof regret, perhapsor even guilt.Through Emily and Alex, Wong relates the heavy expectations placed on immigrant children, not only for cultural reasons but to fulfill the dreams of parents who left their homeland so that their children could have a better life. Emily grew up speaking Chinese in her home and she learned English herself when she began school. I had never really considered the skills it would take for a child to be able to make the connections to be able to maneuver between two different languages. Wong didn't point this out, it was just an \`aha moment'.Impulsively, I say, \\"Tell me in Chinese.\\"Alex looked surprised.\\"I didn't know you knew Chinese.\\"\\"I don't know it very well,\\" I said.\\"But I'm trying to improve.\\"\\"Mei ban fa. Wang ze cheng long.\\" he said.\\"Did you understand that?\\"\\"Your mother said, \`There's no help for it.'But what does \`wang zi cheng long' mean?\\"\\"That's the part I was trying to translate.It's a saying that expresses the hopeof Chinese parentsthat their sons will one daybecome dragons,and that their daughters will becomephoenixes. This meansthey want their children to grow upto achieve their fullest potential.\\"As I considered this,I understood Alex's mother was sayingthat she accepted the inevitable yet wished for the best,every imaginable blessingfor her son.To Alex, I said, smiling\\"Your mother hopesyou'll become a dragon.\\"In Seeing Emily, we find a talented author who takes us inside Taiwanese culture, who paints events with vivid accuracy and creates a character for whom we can't help but like. Seeing Emily was an International Reading Association Notable Book and was widely reviewed. At this time, it is Wong's only book"},{"Title":"Seeing Emily","review":"\\"SEEING EMILY\\" by Joyce Lee Wong is a delightful and refreshing read.Joyce Lee Wong's poetic writing style was like sweet music to my ears.I saw myself in her descriptions. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Seeing Emily","review":"Seeing Emily is a novel told in free verse poetry. While this allows the author to weave in beautiful symbolism and meaning, it also can be slow in places. Emily is Chinese-American, the only child of a couple that runs a Chinese restaurant in Virginia. She is struggling with issues of identity, wearing lipstick, dating white boys, and finds expression through her art. What I really liked about how her struggles were depicted was that she always had respect towards her parents, there were never screaming fights or things like that. They didn't always understand her, but they loved her, and she acknowledged and appreciated that. Too many young adult novels portray the struggles of growing up and differentiating from your parents as this epic battle, but not all teenagers go through that. Details of the Chinese culture were woven throughout, and quite interesting, and I liked how Chinese words were occasionally used.The plot wasn't hugely original, and I did have to question its relevance. I grew up in a big city where Chinese-Americans were commonplace, so the way she is teased for being 'different,' etc, seems a bit out-dated to me. While the poetry is gorgeous I have to question whether or not a teenager would be willing to stick with it, and would only recommend this book to dedicated readers. Even still, most adults would enjoy it."},{"Title":"AutoCAD 2000 3D Modeling - Skills Assessment","review":"Every time I need a manual for my training classes I use these guys and I am never disappointed.

I have to say that the book was a page turner, despite the typos here and there. Shonda deserved her butt kicked...point blank. She is a prime example of the selfish trifling women out there that will go to no means to ruin someone else's situation, despite the circumstances. Let's not forget about Malik in this scenario...he is even more so to blame for being so weak, and letting temptation get the best of him. He was selfish, and playing both sides of the fence. Poor Kim didn't know what hit her....but oh well, at least Shonda did her a big favor....because who wants to be with a man like that anyway. I hope Ms. Poole writes a sequel to this showing Shonda's downfall, letting her know, what goes around comes around! Keep writing Daaimah!!"},{"Title":"Got a Man","review":"This book is basically about 2 stupid hoes. One is educated and the other is a ghetto hoodrat. Why oh why are these chickenheads fighting ober this no good dog? What is the moral of this story? I could understand if Malik ended up with Kim or if they BOTH kicked him to the curb. But noooo, after Kim spends all this money on this wedding, Shonda comes in and ruins it and feels she's got herself some sort of prize or something! And then they never show Malik interacting with Shonda's daugther Bree. Instead of Malik breaking up with Kim and finding his own place, he moves in with Shonda. A man making good money like he is should be able to find his own place. Is this what Ms Poole defines as healthy relationships? A man going from woman to woman? Women letting him lay up with them and they both got kids of their own? I think the people in this book are triflin' just to say they GOT A MAN!"},{"Title":"Got a Man","review":"Just like in MJ Hodge's True Lies the trifling women always come out on top. But when you think about it, what did Shonda really win? If anything she did Kim a favor. I guess Shonda never heard the phrase if 'he steps out on her, he'll step out on you.' I wanted to slap both Kim and Shonda upside the head for tangling over Malik. You see Kim's situation (coming home from college pregnant) all the time but I give her props for trying to better herself. But she made a mistake alot of young women make these days: When you and your man's relationship is on the blink, having a baby doesn't remedy the situation; 9 out of 10 it makes it worse and it's selfish to bring an innocent child into an unstable and foolish relationship. I would've given the book five stars if not for that b.s. ending. Shonda should've gotten what was coming to her. Ms. Poole makes it seem as if it's okay to wreck a relationship, and everything will be peaches and cream for the homewrecker. REALITY CHECK. What goes around most certainly comes around in life. Hmm, paying for wedding arrangements only to have the ceremony crashed and the Groom walk is grounds for shooting a nucca and his *****! And that's for REAL!"},{"Title":"Got a Man","review":"I'm so dissapointed in this book I don't know where to begin. First of all how could the author (Daaimah) write a book glorifying the stupidity of desperate lonely women who would do anything at any cost to keep a triveling man who was more trouble than he was worth. The way Kim and Shonda, supposedly educated women went back and forth bickering like little children over this sorry man was absolutely sickening. I could've sworn we were past portraying &quot;us&quot; African American women negatively. Where are the stories that portray us as strong, educated, loving individuals with self respect. We need to see more stories with the women kicking the man to the curb if they don't act right instead of getting down on our hands and knees begging for the man to stay such as what happened in &quot;GOT A MAN&quot;. Let's face it, Daaimah's target audience are young black females, esspecially teens. Now What are her young impressionable black female readers to learn from a story like this. That it's alright for a man to cheat on you, talk down to you, disrespect you.In addition to the poor story line came the boring, unstructured, repetitive sentences, which lacked creativity, detail and imagination. The editor must've fell asleep on the job because throughout the book I stumbled upon multiple grammatical errors. The standard of African American literature has definately been loweredI tried to get my money back on this book, but the stores return policy did not allow me to do so. I offer the author an open invitation to contact me via e-mail for a personal apology."},{"Title":"Got a Man","review":"Daaimah S. Poole's latest novel, GOT A MAN, deals with the long-standing question, can one person love two people at the same time? Shonda Robinson has had many problematic relationships, but when she meets Malik Moore at her new job, she feels he is the one for her. Malik and Shonda start an intense relationship, but Malik has a pregnant fianc&eacute;e at home. Kimberly Brown has been with Malik for years and senses that something is not right with their relationship, although he has proposed. She soon finds herself in a tug-of-war with Shonda for Malik's heart.Told from the point of view of the two ladies, the story uniquely shows the affects that infidelity can have on relationships. Poignant and entertaining, GOT A MAN, takes the reader into the psyche of women who engage in and put up with cheating in relationships.Daaimah S. Poole's sophomore novel aims to please. It is dramatic, quick read that shows the emotions and the real consequences of what happens when one man loves two women. It is a must read for any one looking for an entertaining, relationship-based read, or anyone who has dealt with infidelity in a relationship. I hope that the author considers writing a sequel to this novel. It would be interesting to see the impact of the choices that were made in the conclusion of GOT A MAN.Reviewed by Latoya Carter-QawiyyOf The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"Got a Man","review":"I bought this book because I enjoyed Yo Yo Love but it seems this one was written just because she knew people were waiting for a second novel. I didn't like the way if you read something Kim thought about Shonda in one paragraph, Shonda repeated it nearly word for word in the next. And as short as the book was (244 pages), did the author really think it was necessary to use the opening chapter again in the last as if we'd forgotten it? For those of you who felt the female characters were &quot;trifling&quot; in their tug of war over a man, remember that although this was fiction, stories like this do happen in real life and to constantly read about strong, independent women would truly be boring. Better to read about a bad woman than to be one!"},{"Title":"Got a Man","review":"I purchased this book after I bought \\"Ex Girl to the Next Girl\\" and realized that it was a sequel so I had to get \\"Got a Man\\". First off the writer's style is a little too junior high for my taste. I have to agree with the reviewer that said if you are over 30 then DON'T BUY this book. Ms. Poole uses elementary school vocabulary, short sentences and tends to repeat herself (Ex: I hate Malik, he's so stupid I wish he would die, I hate Malik he's stupid\\". Now if that doesn't sound junior high I don't know what does. If your looking to read something shallow then by all means buy this book. However, if you are looking for a juicy story with a more sophisticated style of writing then try reading books by Mary Morrison or Lolita Files."},{"Title":"Got a Man","review":"Kim and Shonda had to be some of the most stupid women ever known to mankind. First of all why would you choose to have a baby by someone who doesn't want to marry you. That right there should prove how responsible Malik would be and were his mind was at. Second why would you continue to let a man live with you who does not want to get married and basically support him financially. Third why would you pay for your own ring when he final asks you to marry him.Then there's Shonda, the most selfish uncaring person in the book. The fact that she herself had a child didn't play any part in her decisions obviously. Why would she want a man who already has a woman who is pregnant, and is engaged to be married. I'm sure if she was in that situation she wouldn't want it to happen to her. She was basically accepting left overs that were spoiled. Then when she ruined the wedding that just took the cake. How selfish can you be.Remember what goes around comes around. Malik is a big liar and he will definitely cheat on Shonda. And did you notice he bought both women the same Christmas gift? Probably from the flea market. This book was outrageous. It's definitely the young woman's guide to stupidity."},{"Title":"Got a Man","review":"This book was a fast and very good read, it kept my attention it had the right kinda of flava with a different twist."},{"Title":"Got a Man","review":"I was patiently awaiting Daaimah's second book ever since yo-yo love. I must say that the book was a little disappointing if you compare it with her first work, she repeated herself constantly, and most of the characters were predictable.. I would to give this book 2 stars because it has potential but could have been better..."},{"Title":"Got a Man","review":"I couldn't put the book down. I just really wanted to know what was going to happen next. I really wanted to kill Malik, he was getting on my last nerve. I felt sorry for Kim &amp; Shonda - I think they both should've left his sorry behind in the end. The end could've been written better - not leave the girl at the alter."},{"Title":"Got a Man","review":"it was ok.. i dont remember it verbatim, but i do remember it was not as good as YO YO LOVE better luck next time"},{"Title":"Got a Man","review":"I LOVED THE WAY KIM AND SHONDA KEPT GOING BACK IN FORTH IN EACH CHAPTER. SOME REVIEWERS DIDN'T LIKE SHONDA, BUT SHE WAS COOL WITH ME."},{"Title":"Got a Man","review":"Kudos to Ms. Pooel this book is a fast and interesting read. I honestly picked up the book on monday and was done by tuesday afternoon at lunch. I read it on the bus and at work."},{"Title":"Got a Man","review":"This book was really good...from the stalker boyfriend to the stopping of Maliks wedding.In our lives we all know someone who is going through the same situation if not ourselves.I did think that some of the scenes were unrealistic, but overall this is a book that I will reccomend to everyone."},{"Title":"Got a Man","review":"I recently borrowed this book from a family member and I couldn't put it down. I read it in about 2 days...either the book was that good or I have too much time on my hands :) read it for yourself and see."},{"Title":"Got a Man","review":"After hearing all the hype about this book, according to readers of Ms. Poole's previous book, it wasn't all that. I have read better, much better. It read so much like a children's book."},{"Title":"Got a Man","review":"When a book is good it may take me like 4 days to read, but I must say that this book keep me reading and reading. I was reading the book at work. It took me alittle over a day to read. I was a little disappointed at the way book ended. I was hoping for a story-book ending like Kim and Malik getting married and that's that!!I was also mad at Shonda for stopping the wedding. That's how it goes in real life there may not be a perfect story book ending all the time. It was kool to have anAuthor around my age and is writing about things that I know or have heard about around my way. When I had like 40 pages left in the book, I went back to thebookstore and brought her 1st book, Yo Yo Love. I have just finished that book tonight. I could resist not giving Daaimah her props. Both books were great. Ibrought Got a Man on Tuesday and Yo Yo Love on Wednesday, here it is Thursday night and I have finished both of her books. Good Luck to you Daaimah."},{"Title":"Got a Man","review":"\`YO YO LOVE' by Daaimah S. Poole was a great read. It was the perfect example of African American chick-lit. Filled with comedy, romance, and great friends, it was a novel I truly enjoyed. So when I discovered that Ms. Poole released a sophomore project, I just knew I was going to enjoy it as much as I did her first. That's what I get for jumping the gun. \`GOT A MAN' was not only lukewarm, but the editing was bad, and it was extremely repetitious throughout. Whatever happened to keeping the reader on their toes?Meet Shonda & Kim. Two women in love with the same man. Kim has been in a steady relationship with her fianc&eacute; Malik for about 4 years, but that relationship is tested when Shonda temps as a receptionist at Malik's law firm. The two begin to hit it off, and Malik strays away from Kim, pursuing a relationship with Shonda, even though he and Kim have a baby on the way. From then it becomes a back and forth thing. Malik strings the two women along, but the two women insist on berating each other instead of putting the cheating loser in his place.There was a whole lot of \\"Pick me\\", \\"you don't know what a mistake you are making\\", \\"that is my man\\", and yadda yadda yadda. Same story different title.It was very predicatable, and poorly written. A big disappointment in my opinion."},{"Title":"Got a Man","review":"this book was a real page turner and it kept you wanting more.I could relate to malik kim and shonda.it was ashame that he left kim only because of her kids but I was sorta glad that he was with shonda they seem like a good couple an really in love. i hope there's a sequel to this book keep them coming daamiah s. poole I also really liked yo yo love."},{"Title":"Got a Man","review":"For those of you who don't know, you'd better ask somebody. And I would be that person. Got A Man is her second literary baby and she just gets better with time. I finished this book in less than 2 days. It grabs you in from the beginning and you just don't want to put it away. Her characters Shonda, Malik, Kim are so real, you feel like you know them personally. Shonda and Kim are so alike but yet so different and Malik is just the man in the middle. The problems and situations they go thru are so everyday, if you can't relate (you are in DENIAL!, and De Nile is a river in Egypt!) Malik is a guy we all know or have known at one point in our lives, whether he is our brother, an uncle or an old friend who we've lost touch with. Run out and get this book, you won't be disappointed. And if you haven't read Yo Yo Love, go out and get that too!! Keep up the great work Daaimah! Your a Star!!"},{"Title":"Got a Man","review":"I think the book was good. I think so because I couldn't put the book down. Any author that makes me that into a book should defintely be applauded by and not \\"boo\\"ed by like I seen the others. I made a review because I seen some people putting Poole down. When if they think about it Poole had them reading that book like it wasn't nuthin! and Yeah I agree....... I hated the ending! but what i mostly liked about it was the suspense!!"},{"Title":"Got a Man","review":"This book is tight. I loved it from page one on it was that Hot ISH. I never read a book that kept it so real in my life. I read her first book Yo Yo Love that was good this is GOOOOOOOOD."},{"Title":"Got a Man","review":"I have been a Daaimah Poole fan since I read \\"Yo Yo Love\\". I couldnt wait until her second work came out. I was so happy to receive \\"Got A Man\\" but I was a little disappointed. Some of the paragraphs were repetitive. For instance, Shonda and Kim would repeat the same things they had already said in the previous pages (i.e. Me and Malik had sex five times a day, no lie...then a few pages over, it would say the same thing).At first I liked Shonda (sympathized with her when that crazy fool Mike went loco on her), but then when she got with Malik, I didnt like her actions. Ive heard that sometimes you fall for/want something you cant have, but she set her own self up for the drama she went through with Malik. Her attitude towards the baby and Kim at times were very ignorant and selfish.I felt so bad for Kim. I really didnt see anything she did wrong. To be raped and have a baby, not trust men, then to fall for one and he messes up, that is just a low blow.Im glad she showed him she didnt need Malik. She had her stuff together. Nice car, job, future goals, and a home without him. Kim's character can teach all of us ladies who've been hurt a lesson. No matter how bad we hurt, or what went down, LIFE MUST go on. We will be ok. Just keep your head up.Shonda deserved the knock upside the head that Kim's sister gave here in the end.I'll give the book a 3 out of 5."},{"Title":"Got a Man","review":"I read this book in two days. It wasn't that bad. If you are in the age category of 20 to 30, I do believe you can relate more to the characters in the book, because they are young and trying to find their way. If you are over 40, this book may not be quite as appealing to you. But it was an easy read."},{"Title":"Got a Man","review":"This book was good.I thought Yo Yo Love was better.This book is about these 3 characters Shonda,Kim,and Malik.Now Kim and Malik have been together for quite sometime.She has a son by someone else and Malik takes care of him like he's his own child.Kim wants Malik to marry her and at first I can tell he doesn't want to.It seems like he is comfortable with the way things are going and feels he's being pressured.Kim tell him she is pregnant and the next thing you know they are out shopping for a ring.The part that I thought was crazy was that even though the ring cost too much Kim offered to help Malik pay for it.So the next thing you know Kim and Malik's relationship were going through changes.Shonda ends up meeting Malik on the job at a law firm where they work.Shonda and Malik flirt a little and she knew he was engaged but that didn't stop her or Malik.The next thing you know Malik was staying out late and starting arguments with Kim.They ended up breaking up and he stayed with Shonda.I felt bad for Kim.She was hurt but she remained strong.I gotta give it to Kim because she was trying to get herself together.Shonda was just straight up trifling and selfish.Everytime you read her story she was always always always shipping her daughter Bree off with Brian just to go out or be under Malik.At first Shonda didn't know if Bree was Brian's and it turned out he was the father.When they went to court I wish that it could have turned out that Brian had custody of her and Shonda was getting her a few days a week.I think Shonda's character was irresponsible.It's like her world centered around Malik.All Kim really wanted was to be married and have a family.Malik played both of these women.I kinda figured that he was gonna go crawling back to Kim but that was when Shonda put him out.He started telling Kim he missed his family and wanted to be with them and they planned to get married on Valentine's Day.Everything was set up perfect as Kim would say.I think the ending could have been better though.Im glad Kim's sister Karen knocked Shonda upside the head and pushed her into a potato chip rack at the store.Kim derserved better and even though it hurt Kim she was better off without Malik.I hope there is a sequel to this book and if there were I hope Malik would really want Kim back and she tells him no and her and her boyfriend raise her kids together.Malik would then see how Kim felt.This book was good but I like Yo Yo Love better.Got A Man deals with everyday situations..."},{"Title":"Got a Man","review":"I was taking a vacation and needed a book to get me through a 4+ hour plane ride.

I am the other woman and everything she went through I have been there and done that.I have been with my man for two years.I enjoyed the read. However, I would like to have heard from Malik.

I didn't like the ending though."},{"Title":"Got a Man","review":"&quot;GOT A MAN&quot; is a very different read.

This book is a wake up call to all the women that think they &quot;Got A Man.&quot; Ladies somebody will try to take your man.

I am a supporter of Daaimah, but it seems as though \\"Got A Man\\" was her first book because it had a few typos and repetitive sentences than \\"Yo Yo\\".For instance, through out the book both characters \\"Shonda\\" and \\"Kim\\" repeated phrases such as \\"Me and Malik had sex 4-5 times a day no lie\\", etc...On a good note, I felt Kim more than I did Shonda. At first I was feeling Shonda when she met up with that fool Mike while she was in ATL. However, when she moved to Philly and got with Malik thats a whole different story.I felt that as the book progressed she was a little ignorant when it came to things she said about Kim and the new baby. She knew what she was up against when she got with Mr. Malik.She knew he had a woman and a baby upfront, but then she told him to make a decision. I felt she got herself in that situation.I felt bad that Malik did Kim so wrong and she had to have the baby by herself. Im glad that she was able to be strong and make it without him. She got her own house, good job, and a good head on her shoulders.This book shows that no matter how wrong a man does us ladies, its still life after them and we can be strong and MOVE ON without them!!!Im glad Kim sisters knocked her upside her head @ the end. She deserved that.Id recommend this book. Out of 5 stars Id give it 3. Support Daaimah and add it to your collection."},{"Title":"Got a Man","review":"This is by one of my favorite authors!

Would definitely purchase another book from this author! :-)"},{"Title":"Got a Man","review":"I am not normally a fan of books that give you the perspective of more than one main character.

It ended too abuptly. The book would have been better for me if Daaimah would have let us see it from Malik's point of view also. This book could have been developed a little better and it DOES need a sequel but overall it was good."},{"Title":"Got a Man","review":"I wasn't sure about this book when I first started to read it but it turned out not to be too bad at all. What Daaimah Poole did was open our eyes to the world of infedelity using the &quot;other womans&quot; point of view. Throughout this book, Poole shows how, when put into a situation, you can and will do anything to keep &quot;your man&quot;, even when he belongs to someone else.Shonda was a woman who had her share of bad relationships but when she meets Malik and he was the cure for all, but, unfortunately, he was someone elses. She does some crazy things in this book making her seem like the desperate little female when in fact she just found something she wanted and went after it. I may not agree with the way she went about doing it but until you're in those shoes, who knows what you'll do.As far as Malik goes, I feel he was stuck between a rock and a hard place searching for a way out. He was dealing with mixed emotions he didn't know how to handle leading him to do some foul stuff. Again I don't agree, but hey, it happens.Kim, she was faced the rude reality of her fiance's deceitfulness. But I applaud her for doing what she had to do to get herself through this storm.I didn't like the way it ended, as a matter of fact I was pretty heated.

This book, based, by Catherine Bowen on some of the letters between Tchaikovsky and his benefactor, who he never met, Madame Nadejda von Meck, is a great help in the right direction towards a clearer account of this genius' life. I love this man's music, like most everyone else. I lived in Russia for six years. No doubt Tchaikovsky was a genius. His life was a complex burden to him, with problems he never resolved. He gave us so much and what he left us makes him immortal. What counts is what a man does, what he leaves us. This arm's-length relationship was as sweet, and loyal, as it was very unique. It all comes about in this book based on many letters in the possession of Barbara von Meck, the daughter-in-law of Nadejda.Frederick R.

Excellent examples of young Swiss typography abound in this handsome volume.The truly beautiful work is loosely grouped by style, which works surprisingly well and makes for enjoyable browsing.The only thing vaguely disappointing about the book is the 20-page essay lead-in, which, for me, falls into the &quot;Impenetrably Lofty Writing on Design&quot; category. Blah blah blah. It looks very nice on the page, but it's painful, joyless reading. Turn to the informative writing in Intro's first &quot;Sampler&quot; volume and Ginko's &quot;Visible Music&quot; to see it done right. (Mind you, this is all personal bias. I may just be too dense to comprehend this particular piece.)Who cares, anyway? It's a design book. No one reads design books. They're all about the pretty work.

However, while this book contains a high level of creative work and page after page of bright pictures, I found much of the content rather shocking and explicit.

It covers understanding the population, the development of the behavior, and evaluation and treatment. If you're in the field, occassionally work with juvenile sexual abusers, or have an interest in learning more, the book is a great resource."},{"Title":"Understanding, Assessing, and Rehabilitating Juvenile Sexual Offenders","review":"This is a very thorough and useful book. I will admit I have yet to read the entire book cover to cover but I cannot even begin to estimate how many times I have referred to chapters, sections, concepts, etc. located within the book. I am impressed with how each chapter in the book is independent from the others. For instance, if you need to know about assessment you could easily read just that chapter and arm yourself with all the knowledge you need without even glancing at the other chapters. Of course this depends on your level of prior knowledge, experience, and expertise. If you know little about adolescent sex offenders or are just beginning your career in this field, reading the first few chapters will provide you with a wealth of knowledge. But if you are a veteran then each chapter will make sense in and of itself.This book is well written, easy to understand, and comprehensive. I would strongly recommend it to anyone working in this field or even to someone who is considering this field but still has questions about the breadth of what this field encompasses. It will inform the reader!"},{"Title":"Understanding, Assessing, and Rehabilitating Juvenile Sexual Offenders","review":"I have read most of the work available on the subject of juvenile sexual offending and sexual aggression in youths.

A land of heroes, warriors and poets.It is the story of a young boy, an outlander, whose birth is shrouded in mystery who grows up to be the greatest warrior of them all.As he grows to manhood his deeds become the stuff of legend, but as armies gather against him, he must face his greatest challenge of all.This is the tale of Cuchullain, the Hound of Ulster."},{"Title":"Your People, My People: Finding Acceptance and Fulfillment As a Jew by Choice","review":"The pages simply turned by themselves, this book is so compelling. For those converting to Judaism and hungry for the personal stories of other converts, this book is for you. Romanoff begins with her own conversion story, and weaves Jewish philosophy, custom and law through the hundred or so narratives she relates; producing a tapestry of Jewish converts of every flavor while educating the reader. You will find yourself in her book, no doubt. She gently prods her reader to think of possible ramifications of conversion. To her credit, Romanoff doesn't just include the success stories, she sadly relates when conversion didn't work out for one reason or another. One salient undercurrent is her plea for Jews by birth and the Jewish community as a whole to embrace Ruth's legacy, support those who stand with them, set apart only by an accident of birth. The good, the bad and the beautiful of being Jewish by choice is laid out in exquisite detail. The end section contains real resources for anyone converting, or involved with a convert; reading recommendations, helping organizations and a brief Jewish glossary. This book is an open armed welcome and Shalom! to Jews by Choice."},{"Title":"Your People, My People: Finding Acceptance and Fulfillment As a Jew by Choice","review":"I wish I had found this book a few years earlier!

My professional expertise was in breads and pastry, so it is easier for me to appreciate the example recipes in this book. The book is by no means exhaustive. It is an excellent resource with some fantastic pastry ideas and good ingredient combinations. It is also easier to find most of the ingredients in this volume than the savory book.The photography is superb, but don't expect to be able to reproduce the look of the photographs without some professional baking or pastry experience. The recipes lack explanations and expect you to know foundation techniques."},{"Title":"Grand Livre De Cuisine: Alain Ducasses's Desserts and Pastries","review":"My wife and myself are both professional chefs with an extensive cookbook collection.

[...]"},{"Title":"Grand Livre De Cuisine: Alain Ducasses's Desserts and Pastries","review":"Some say that this Desserts and Pastries volume of Grand Livre de Cuisine is more for professional chefs, but I found it accessible.Ducasse's savory recipes in his Livre de Grand Cuisine did not match my tastes, but the sweets book is divine. So much information efficiently presented. In one page, Ducasse gives a recipe for Tropical fruit sorbet with variation ideas, gives instructions for how to roast tropical fruits and also how to dry and candy the fruit, and then gives instructions for assembling it all with a pretty puff pastry presentation. On the facing page, there is a full page luscious photo of the dish.Ducasse's sweet book also has little side recipes which come in handy, like his Kirsch milkshake. I am sure that any liqueur can be substituted. Just the idea alone is useful, even if one wanted to substitute ingredients.I bought the book after reading a critical review which showed a photo of one of the dishes, which featured what I call an origami approach to pastry. Ducasse used semolina pastry to sculpt what looks like a Japanese fan or a book with pages fluffing/fanning (It is supposed to be a book, so called Livre). He gives precise instructions on folding and flouring. He also shows how to make Riviera Fougasse, which looks like Monstera leaf, cut with a cleaver where a leaf would have a central stem and side ribs, then decorated with vegetables and herbs like colored peppers, basil, (purple) artichokes, scallions, garlic, olives, confit tomato petals (slow-roasted peeled tomato slices), anchovy, etc. Definitely one of the prettiest breads I have ever seen. (I looked at Jeff Blumenkrantz's blog for the Martha Stewart recipe and his comments on tomato petals.)Another one of the many breads which Ducasse covers is Rustic Sourdough bread made from an apple mash starter which takes 5 days to ferment (and is strained before adding to the flour). The Rustic Sourdough bread recipe is quite large (humongous!), but after going thru the trouble of making the apple mash I could see myself freezing that dough for future use and gifting it as starter to family and friends.I was interested to see that Ducasse also uses unpeeled fruit pulp to make sourdough for his Panettone! Because the sourdough is being started from scratch, there is a 48 hour proofing period, then a refreshing of several times. Not a simple throw it in the bread machine in one go type of recipe. However, Ducasse does give precise temperature guidelines to optimize success, and tells you what to do if you do not succeed, along with other tips. I will probably try Ducasse's recipe at least once, but I am pretty happy with my Carol Fields Panettone recipe. Still, for those who like to make Sourdough breads, Ducasse offers a good deal of sourdough instruction.

It has exhaustive information covering everything. Pick a topic it's in there. Why not 5 stars? Well this book is definitely based on the DASHEW way. Big boats, lots of equipment, big money. If I had the budget it would be great but honestly how many can afford to cruise around in a 80 foot custom built boat? Now I didn't say I wouldn't like to, it's just for my budget it sometimes is lacking in the simple cheap way to do it. Also I find the book a little preachy some times. As in this is the only way to do it because that's how we do it and we know everything. But this comment applies to a lot of cruising books so I can't single out the DASHEWS. But for the simple life look elswhere- like the Pardeys, Casey and Payson. Gee- I didn't mean to be so negative. This book is expensive, but has tons of information, a superb index and broad and thourough coverage of just about everything. I definitely use this book as a reference for new projects. Like need a new dingy- 11 pages of information. Or a dodger-15 pages. Or cruising with kids- 15 pages. The book is organized I.M.O. on the premise of building a boat from the ground up. What are the best designs, construction materials, techniques, systems etc. Although pricey, this book is a good addition to my library. I agonized over making this purchase for some time- what if the book just didn't suit me? But even for the price it is worth it. Would I buy it again? Yes! There is information hear you will not find anywhere else and it is well organized."},{"Title":"Offshore Cruising Encyclopedia","review":"A behemoth of a book about cruising yachts from dreamland. If you can actually afford the type of yachts they concentrate on then you can probably afford the crew and engineers to sail &amp; fix it for you.Still, there's a tonne (1.1 tons) of information in here &amp; it is worth reading - once. Try borrowing it from a library if you anticipate a more down-to-earth cruising budget. If you're still dreaming - buy it &amp; read the bits about how much all this costs, behold the gradual realisation that this is how Bill Gates would cruise.from page 1092...&quot;I have only one major regret: That we waited so long. While it's always hard to look back and say one should have done this or that, I firmly believe that selling my car and few possessions and buying a Folkboat, or some such machine, and heading off into the South Pacific, would have been more rewarding in the long run, than banging our heads against the walls of our economic system in order to accumulate the wealth I thought was necessary to go cruising in the 'proper' style. ...

There is simply no other book that comes close to it in terms of covering sailboat systems and design issues. The Dashews guide you through all the options that confront cruisers and their boats discussing how things work and why. Nor are they bashful about naming names and making recommendations where appropriate.There is much to be said for their KISS philosophy where minimal, reliable systems are always preferred to those that are just the latest gadget. I especially liked the in-depth discussions on electrical, hydraulic, and mechanical systems which are some of the best I have ever seen and all integrated into the context of the total cruising boat.I would like to have seen the authors opt for color photography rather than the so-so black and white reproductions used throughout the book. This is one of the few flaws in an otherwise fine effort. This is the most expensive nautical book in my growing library, but well worth the price. It is a must have item for all cruisers."},{"Title":"Offshore Cruising Encyclopedia","review":"The author of this book has tried pretty much every piece of equipment known to man, and some he and his business associates cooked up themselves. In his book, he shares this information with us.Now, clearly if you are like him, and can afford a completely new, custom boat every few years, it's not impossible to say that your finances might be a shade stronger than the average boat owner. There are people out there who are running cruising boats that cost less than his radar set. And as they keep on going out there and getting use out of their boats, a year or two from now, Steve and Linda will be purchasing a new boat, and with it a new radar set that cost just as much.So many people protest that here is a rich guy who really doesn't relate to the common man at all, who really has no clue about the poor sap who has to face the reality of owning some 40 foot dump of a wood boat that's fallingOh, wait.Some people cruise on 28' boats.Sorry. Ahem. Some dump of a 28' wooden boat that's falling apart at the seams and doesn't even have a decent GPS, let alone radar.And they are probably right. Steve and Linda, on their custom aluminum boat, can befriend these people, can be very nice people as I'm sure they are, but they can't really relate to taking their last dime and putting it in a boat.That being said, who do you want to talk about complex systems, the guy who can't even afford one, or the fellow who's bought and tried them all, and now gives you a basis for comparison? The guy who has his creaky radar because it came with his boat, or the fellow who has, no doubt, tried every radar in the known universe?The answer to that is is obvious, and that's why this book has a lot of value. You certainly find out from it what worked for the author and what didn't. You probably don't want to delay your cruise so long that you can afford all this stuff, but it's definitely a fascinating look at the world of boating from the perspective of someone who's seen -- and can afford -- it all."},{"Title":"Offshore Cruising Encyclopedia","review":"This massive compendium of knowledge gleaned from decades of offshore cruising is a must for the neophite or expert.Extensive discussions cover all aspects of the offshore vessel - from mast to keel - along with the many practical aspects of life aboard (and abroad).

Each playlet contains at least one \\"gooseflesh\\" moment and a powerful message that stays with you and is remembered long after --even years after-- you saw the performance.

Perhaps its time to replace the resistor color code tables with summaries of the IEEE and ITU standards, certainly something more needed in the 2001 world of PCs.

And it doesn't yet contain a power supply wire color code, which would be far more useful than resistor codes. There is info on Win98 but not on Win2K or ME (or even NT). The processor and socket list is hopelessly out of date. Fixed disk drive lists are way behind the times with only the most minimal information to help keep the confusing IDE/SCSI/EIDE PIO 1/2/3/4/5 ATA33/66/100/133 drive, BIOS, MB chipset and cable standards straight.This is a good book for troubleshooting, repairing and maintaining the older PC, but it is not even treading water well in a world of P4 or Thunderbird processors, multi-gigabyte drives or 400Mhz RIMM memory.

She writes about people who are decidedly human, not super-heroes, and her characters always have difficult choices, no easy paths. But my favorite thing about her books is that she always includes these small moments of magic that lift my spirits and tug at my heart.HALFWAY TO HEAVEN is no exception. From the first page, I totally identified with the heroine. (She has a physical reason for her lack of grace; I'm just &quot;blessed&quot; with it.) The point is, it's easy to crawl into her skin, to understand what she's feeling and why she's feeling that way. This, and Ms. Wiggs talent for lavish descriptions that aren't intrusive but are transporting, are two reasons I never miss one of her books.HALFWAY TO HEAVEN was a pleasure to read with an ample supply of those small moments of magic I love so much. On finishing it, I wished only for one thing: that Ms. Wiggs would write faster!"},{"Title":"Halfway To Heaven","review":"On the surface, this book is a light romantic comedy set in Gilded Age Georgetown. The dialogue snaps back and forth between these characters so I found myself reading some of it aloud just to entertain myself.Yet there are layers to this book. Beneath the light, darkness: an unmothered young woman desperate to find her footing in the world (so the deformed foot itself had dual meanings), a guilt-ridden man trying to right a great wrong, a sister who is both more and less than she seems. These are all shadows that make HALFWAY TO HEAVEN all the more fascinating.The setting comes to life until you're just &quot;there&quot; in the White House East room with that dazzling silver Tiffany ceiling, or on a remote spot of Chesapeake Bay just as the fog clears...the time period and setting are meticulously researched but the author's use of them is not &quot;teacher-ish&quot; which is nice.So read for the fun and comedy, but know that this romance will stay with you because of those subtle dark themes."},{"Title":"Halfway To Heaven","review":"Susan Wiggs is a good author.

Looking forward to more hours lost in her world where love dosent always conqure all."},{"Title":"Halfway To Heaven","review":"This book disappointed me. I'm coming to really enjoy books by Susan Wiggs, but I feel this one fell short. Both the hero and the heroine were likeable enough. The story started interestingly, but then it started to drag and drag some more. The majority of the book (and I mean about 7/8 of the story) the hero was worked to get the heroine with another man, i.e. for most of the book we hear how much she is in love with another man. They were separated. More dragging. Then all of a sudden it seemed that the author remembered that the hero and the heroine are supposed to be together at the end of a romance novel and she quickly wrapped it up in about 2 pages; it was very anti-climatic. Maybe an epilogue would have left a better taste in my mouth. I just hope that her sister gets a better ending in her own story. I avoided giving this book 2 stars out of loyalty to Wiggs, but by no means do I think it deserves 5 stars."},{"Title":"Halfway To Heaven","review":"This Susan Wiggs's book is definitely romance at its best! The reader will be cheering on the blossoming romance of the plain, but witty and intelligent, Abigal with the cynical and handsome Jamie Calhoun.

Couldn't put it down. Now, I look for any and all of her books. Reading her earlier book \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" was not a disappointment either. This provided an escape into another era with interesting young ladies in swishing silk skirts waltzing around a dance floor with elegant gentlemen, forbidden liaisons, and an independent thinking young woman struggling with a personal sadness and functioning in an era before her time. Susan did not disappoint by providing endless intrigue with a \\"feel good\\" ending. Susan just gets better with every publication."},{"Title":"Halfway To Heaven","review":"Susan's novels are amazingly different. I love the fact that she researches for her stories, and gives each character great personalities! And, I really enjoy the way she webs characters from other books together. It is delightful to be able to follow these characters. And, the diversity of the stories she comes up with is just wonderful! I do appreciate the fact that her books are not based on illicit sex so if that's what you are looking for, don't look here. She incorporates just enough passion to fullfil most people's fantaises, and it is not very explicit. Well done, Susan!I LOVED that Susan gave Abigail the traits that she did. Abigail is smart and pretty. However, beauty is in the eye of the beholder and she becomes a goddess to the amazing James! He takes her under his wings and teaches her how to be a lady of passion, who can get what she wants. Of, course the two fall in love and don't want to be the first to say so. James loves Abigail even before he turns her into the goddess she becomes. Who doesn't want to be considered a goddess to the man they love!? This 'Ugly Duckling' mode is a trait for most of her characters. The difference here is Abigail's intelligence. She is truly smart. And so is James. He has a true appreciation for knowledge and it shows. Their mutual desire to teach and learn passion leads to some very romantic scenes and eventually to their very passionate union.This was a fun, blundering, and lovely read, and leads into another one of her great stories with Helena as her heroine! I am in love with all the Calhouns and you will be too. I do appreciate the fact that Susan uses passionate scenes in her books but is not too graphic or too much.The only reason I don't give it a 5 star rating is because it is repetitous in describing her doubts and sceneries and past situations. There is a lot that could have been left out that would not have affected the book at all. There are a few times in all her books that I am screaming quietly to \\"just get on with the story!\\" But overall, I do recommend the book.Enjoy!!"},{"Title":"Halfway To Heaven","review":"I like the way Susan Wiggs writes; simple, to the point with words I can understand.

She writes about people who are decidedly human, not super-heroes, and her characters always have difficult choices, no easy paths. But my favorite thing about her books is that she always includes these small moments of magic that lift my spirits and tug at my heart.HALFWAY TO HEAVEN is no exception. From the first page, I totally identified with the heroine. (She has a physical reason for her lack of grace; I'm just &quot;blessed&quot; with it.) The point is, it's easy to crawl into her skin, to understand what she's feeling and why she's feeling that way. This, and Ms. Wiggs talent for lavish descriptions that aren't intrusive but are transporting, are two reasons I never miss one of her books.HALFWAY TO HEAVEN was a pleasure to read with an ample supply of those small moments of magic I love so much. On finishing it, I wished only for one thing: that Ms. Wiggs would write faster!"},{"Title":"Halfway To Heaven","review":"Just when I pick a favorite by this author, she does it again--writes a story that surpasses all the other wondrous tales that came before. I adored THE CHARM SCHOOL, and the others by this author, and now this one is equal to or even fresher and funner than that one. Abigail is so warm and human and flawed--a girl who has brains and a big heart and is totally unappreciated by Society. Along comes the perfect man who has no idea how perfect he is for her until he finds himself falling for her no matter how hard he fights his feelings. What a beautiful story, an affirmation of all that is good in the world. And I can't wait to see how the sister turns out. Get this one--it's a great read."},{"Title":"Halfway To Heaven","review":"Fabulous book, fabulous author. I don't think Susan Wiggs is capable of disappointing a reader. Tender, funny, poignant. This book has it all. Thank you, Susan Wiggs, for lifting me out of my reading doldrums."},{"Title":"Halfway To Heaven","review":"This was an somewhat enjoyable read, but not 5 stars. The characters were stock characters, the history minimal, and the plot predictable. The world of late 19th c. Washington and the Chesapeake were not illuminated. And a minor point, chesnut horses never have black manes.The main character's issues (her scholarship and her foot) were so quickly solved by some new dresses. And, of course, the sister's love affair and marriage are just fodder for the next novel, when her husband dies or is murdered and her professor comes back on the scene.... See what I mean... so predictable!"},{"Title":"Halfway To Heaven","review":"Author Susan Wiggs departs from the Great Chicago Fire setting of her recent novels and takes the reader on a journey to late nineteenth century Washington. There, the reader is treated to a heart-warming romance and a bird's -eye view of the politics of the times.Miss Abigail Cabot, daughter of Senator Franklin Cabot, seems to be an utter social failure, always causing some disastrous event at important gatherings. At a recent wedding, her deformed foot nearly gave way just as the scoundrel, Virginia Congressman, Jamie Calhoun, rescued her.Charmer Jamie notices Abby's adoring gaze falling on Lieutenant Boyd Butler, son of the vice-president. But Boyd has eyes only for the beauteous Helena, Abby's sister. As Abby agrees to pen Helena's letters to Boyd, she discloses her heart's innermost feelings, and Boyd falls in love with the letter-writer. Jamie decides to aid Abby in transforming herself into someone desirable by Boyd, even as Jamie shows interest in her studies of astronomy. Jamie's friendship with Abby blossoms, even as he needs to convince himself that he is only acting in his self-interest -to attain the support of Senator Cabot for anti-railroad legislation.Rounding out this intelligent romance are supporting characters such as Professor Rowan, neighborly nutty professor and object of Helena's desire as well as Princess Layla, the woman who had chipped away at Jamie's heart.Ms. Wiggs has set her romance apart from the rest as she alludes to the secrets in Jamie and Abby's hearts that they must unravel as the surface tension between the two leads to a deeper emotion. In a genre where beauty is often paramount, Abby and Jamie's view into each other's souls is augmented only by their support of each other's most passionate causes. For a lovely lyrical read, Ms. Wiggs' latest creation is not to be missed."},{"Title":"Halfway To Heaven","review":"Halfway to Heaven is the first book by Susan Wiggs I've read. What a treat! Her distinct style hooked me quickly, transported me back to the world of 19th century Washington, D.C. politics, and kept me turning the pages.The main characters, Abigail Cabot and Jamie Calhoun, immediately captured my heart because they were portrayed as two very human individuals whose imperfections make their story all the more believable. Lively dialogue snaps back and forth as Jamie attempts to teach the very intelligent, unconventional Abigail the social graces. All the while, they fight the growing awareness of their love for each other.With a distinct style, Ms Wiggs paints wonderful and evocative word pictures of her well-researched historical period. The detailed personalities of her engaging secondary characters add yet another level of depth. Senator Franklin Cabot, the aloft father; Helena, the shallow, but not so shallow sister; Professor Rowan, the neighborly nutty professor and object of Helena's desire; Lt. Boyd Butler, the vice president's son and Abigail's unrequited love interest; and Princess Layla, the woman who destroyed Jamie's heart.The captivating plot moves smoothly with humor. Her believable characters and their interaction draw you into the scenes with their hints of the plot twists and turns that lay ahead. The conclusion draws Jamie and Abigail's story together with a satisfying resolution and the author even promises a follow-up of Helena's story.Halfway to Heaven is an enchanting love story that will stay with you long after the final page."},{"Title":"Halfway To Heaven","review":"I have read a few novels now by Susan Wiggs - Miranda, The Firebrand, Horsemaster's Daughter & A Summer Affair. All extremely good - especially the last two (which are a series). I have taken to this author as she is a master with the written word. I so enjoy authors that are able to draw out human emotions from simple descriptions and a few well placed words and thoughts. Her writing draws you into another world - just as a good book should. Her books are really simple love tales but, the journey is the best part of her stories and characters. Just like life...it's the fun of getting there that is the sweetest treat.In Halfway to Heaven she does it again. The magic of an unexpected love. This story was extra fun because we can all empathize and feel for a leading lady who is less than beautiful, less than graceful, less than perfect - just like most of us - we can relate to Abby in this story. She was more brains than beauty, more deep thought than wisdom and more science than mystery. But...she was charming all around. It just took a very discerning eye to see the real woman beneath the surface. Her father missed it. Her sister even missed it. The world around her certainly missed it.But...our leading hero, James - or Jamie as he began to be called - didn't miss it. He saw it clearly.Jamie saw her as a boring, brown wren at first - much as the rest of the world did. But...upon deeper viewing he saw a lovely bird ready to spread its wings and soar with the right guidance. His guidance. Mind you...Jamie had his own needs to be met - getting in with the right politicians to get his agenda fulfilled in Congress but, he didn't mind playing fixer upper with Abby along the way since her father was an important connection locally. His assistance in polishing Abby into a social butterfly with the right clothes, social graces and dancing charm was much needed. Jamie was helping Abby capture the man of her dreams and in turn, Jamie would get political clout. Everyone would win.Along the journey of evolvement to a real woman Abby made him laugh, think, and explore the world in ways he had forgotten. He was hurt from the past, reserved from previous hurts and closed to the idea of giving away his heart but...Abby managed to break past his polished and handsome exterior to find the real man beneath the surface. Jamie's friends missed the true man beneath. His family missed it. The world around him missed it.But, our leading lady Abby saw it. She saw Jamie for the wonderful man he was. Complete with dark memories, deep loss, lost first love, scars and all. Still she saw through him. To the real man. Her ability to see deep changed him as well.Nothing is more soul stirring than hearing a man tell a woman she made him better than he could ever hope to be. Abby did that for Jamie. And in turn, Jamie made Abby a complete woman. I loved how Abby developed into a confident and courageous woman by the books end - she took what she wanted instead of waiting for the world to give it to her. I loved how Jamie realized the past must be just that and he can only have a future by looking forward. Being apart, they realized they were stranded on earth - and alone. By being together, they were already halfway to heaven.I liked that SW did not make Abby and Helena's father into a bad guy. He was busy with work and alone since his wife died and making the best of being a widowed father. I liked that he loved his daughters and simply wanted the best for them even if he seemed distant and distracted at times. I also liked some of the other secondary characters in this story too - interesting people - sister Helena, scientist Michael Rowan, the princess etc. I plan to read Enchanted Afternoon next so, I'll get to hear Helena and Michael's story next.SW rarely goes into a lot of details in her love stories in terms of physical intimacy or relations. Instead, she uses the gift of the written word to make you dream and visualize and fantasize about \\"the what if?\\". She makes you feel the longing, the hurt, the confusion and all the love that is between the main characters and because she is so good at this, I rarely miss the love scenes. If anything, the emotional tugging she does to your head and heart are more powerful than any \\"quickie\\" could be.If you have not found this author yet, I would recommend you do so. She always writes a great story - realistic and easy to follow and creates moving and memorable characters. She is on her game and it's a pleasure to buy her books. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Halfway To Heaven","review":"This story was good, though definately not one of the best. I enjoyed reading a little about the politics of the 1800's, and some of the social issues, but mostly I liked watching the heroine, Abagail Cabot, grow. It was kind of an \\"ugly duckling\\" story, though not exactly, since the heroine changes the way she sees herself more than she changes her appearance, though she changes that too. I though the hero (Jamie Calhoun) was a bit of an ..., but I suppose he turned out to be a basically good duy, although I'd say that he was rather willfully blind when it comes to some things, and the stunt he pulled with the letter made me want to beat him with a large stick. He interferes repeatedly in Abagail's life trying to \\"help\\" in order to win her father, the most powerful senator at the time's support of his stand on the Southern railroad building. He is rather high handed in his handling of our good heroine, but he really does genuinely want to see her happy as it turns out, and so he sets out to remake her so that she may win the heart of the vice president's son, Lt. Boyde Butler, who by the way, took one look at the beautiful Helena (Abagail's sister) and just about fell on his face. I also liked that Abagail's sister (Helena) turned out to really love and care about her Abagail and their family in her own way, more than just society and their opinions unlike some other books. I thought it was really cute that she had a thing for the good professor, though I didn't like the professor half so much by the end of the story. He started out as the sexy absentminded academic type, and ended up being an ... But still, it was really nice to watch Abagail grow, and go from being totally clumsy and having absolutely no self esteem, to being so sure of herself, and so much more certain. All in all, I'd say that, though not one of my favorites, it was a nice story- a decent rainy day read- and recomended as such, expecially if you follow the series. (The Charm School, The Horsemaster's Daughter, Halfway To Heaven, and Enchanted Afternoon&lt;-- that's Helena's story)"},{"Title":"Halfway To Heaven","review":"Susan Wiggs is one of the few authors I read without consulting reviews, without worrying if her latest effort will simply follow the hackneyed plotlines of traditional romance, becoming predictable and two-dimensional. I was excited to find her newest creation in the bookstore yesterday afternoon, started it on the train ride home, and finished it before midnight that night - I just couldn't put it down. I was so completely drawn into the evolution of her characters that I managed to forget reality, if only for a few hours.What's more, I really fell in love with both the hero and the heroine, so much that I really cared about what befell them as the storyline progressed. It was wonderful to mark the progress the heroine makes as she grows, as she learns more about herself, and I fell in love with the hero over and over again with each evidence of his enduring faith in this girl, despite her lack of self esteem, despite her lack of obvious beauty, despite his own lost faith in himself and in love. Instead of painting him as the perfect hero, Wiggs instead makes him human, and through his actions and his faithfulness to others, we see him as heroic and redeemed.Morever, this book illustrates an important lesson: how important it is to believe in yourself, and how that elusive self-confidence is really what distinguishes the popular from the wallflowers, more than simple aesthetics. We see the evolution of the heroine from shrinking, bedraggled violet to the confident, unfurled rose.On a side note, Wiggs deftly inserts a subplot, involving the heroine's sister, without detracting from the overall plot (a worthy feat in itself). I gleefully expected a setdown for the sister, for her self-absorption and lack of support for the heroine, only to completely reverse my sympathies, as the author revealed more. The sister was not the only character for which I experienced this fluctuation of emotions; with the heroine's first love interest (the only plotline which Wiggs seems to recycle frequently, but with great skill so that it doesn't grow too old), I was prepared to hate him, then admired him for his ability to fall in love with heroine through words and not just appearances, and then fell OUT of love with him, but with no hard feelings, as they both realize the superficiality of their feelings. All in all, these transitory relationships were very well drawn, with a sense of flow, yet not diverting the reader's attention from the main protagonists. Meanwhile, I eagerly anticipate the next book, as I want to know what will befall the sister.This book reminded me of how much I enjoy this genre, for its belief in second chances, in life, in love. A truly fresh perspective on the well-trodden but rocky path of falling in love, one that was thoroughly absorbing and well-written. Read it, if only for the opportunity to travel to another dimension, away from the harshness of reality and current events, where people believe in each other, in love, and in a better world."},{"Title":"Halfway To Heaven","review":"In the late nineteenth century, everyone in the highest circles of DC social life knows that Abigail Cabot, though a senator&#65533;s daughter, is a weirdo. Unlike debutantes her age including her sister, Abigail prefers astronomy to balls. However, her feelings change when she meets Lieutenant Boyd Butler III. She wants him with all her heart, but he has no interest in her.DC&#65533;s most eligible bachelor, Senator Jamie Calhoun, needing her father&#65533;s help, promises to assist Abigail in getting her man. Something weird happens to Abigail and Jamie. They fall in love, but he refuses to believe in such a wasted emotion and she is confused over her former infatuation for the lieutenant and her sudden desire to only be with Jamie.Readers will think they journeyed to nineteenth century upper class Washington society with the depth inside Susan Wiggs&#65533; strong historical romance. The story line is fascinating mostly because the cast brings alive an engaging period of America&#65533;s past. The lead couple is a charming duet who struggle with his and her respective growing awareness of love for one another. HALFWAY TO HEAVEN takes the audience all the way to readers heaven with another winning novel from Ms. Wiggs.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Halfway To Heaven","review":"I was thoroughly delighted and enchanted by this romance. Susan Wiggs raises the art of the historical romance through her excellent characterizations, and weaves her tale with a perfect blend of history, humor, and heart. The main characters are intriguing, wise, obstinate, and very real. I adored Abigail as the heroine - she was intelligent, inquisitive, unique. I loved the way Jamie's story unfolds, bit by bit, rather than in a clumsy exposition like lesser writers would have succumbed to. The secondary characters are also richly drawn and add color and depth to the story. This was my first Susan Wiggs novel I've read, but it certainly won't be the last!!"},{"Title":"Halfway To Heaven","review":"While I have always enjoyed Susan Wigg's book, especially her Chicago Fire Trilogy, Halfway to Heaven was somewhat laborious for me to read. In fact, it took me six weeks to get through it. Unlike some of her others that were real page turners where I could not wait to sit down and read, this was a book that I put down for a few days and then maybe only read a half a chapter at a time. I kept looking to the end pages to see how much was left.The characters of Jamie and Abbie are very endearing and they are not the problem here. It just seemed that we knew the point of the story right in the beginning. The road to the conclusion seemed contrived if not predictable and it took way to long for me to get there.It's not that it is a bad book, but it was a disappointing one considering some of her other wonderful works."},{"Title":"Halfway To Heaven","review":"Tender, funny, poignant.

Abigale is not a \\"perfect\\" physical specimen which is a departure from the norm, but makes up for it with her wit and inteligence. Jamie's Pygmalion style role to bring Abigale to her full potential is romantic in it's poignancy and full of humor. This book was brought to my attention by a customer of mine. She has never led me wrong and this time is no exception. I am currently looking for Susan Wiggs sequal story of Abigal's sister Helena and other offerings by this new found (for me) author.

No one single studying source will get you through it. There are some errors in this book, and believe me, you will never get a question on the real exam testing your knowledge of the SQL syntax for simply creating a table.

I took Practice Test 1: Almost 1 in 4 (13 out of 55) questions either have typos that would make the &quot;correct&quot; answer syntactically invalid, outright wrong &quot;correct&quot; answers, or very questionable &quot;correct&quot; answers. Q3. Typo: &quot;VALUE&quot; instead of &quot;VALUES&quot; Q7. Question is &quot;What is relationship between Actors or Directors and Title.&quot; Answer incorrectly says &quot;Many to Many&quot;. This would be true if question was &quot;What is relationship between Actors and Directors.&quot; (One Actor can be directed by many Directors and one Director can direct many Actors). The title table is the resolution table for the many-to-many relationship between Actors and Directors. But per the question, one Actor can act in many titles; one Director can Direct many Titles. Q11. What is meant by the words &quot;main&quot; or &quot;independent&quot; entities? Where do these words come from? PaintScheme and OptionalEquipment should indeed be entities, but main? or independent? Also, recommends Customer table be keyed on Social Security numbers. These are not really unique (as they are supposed to be). Most pros would say this is a bad idea for a primary key. Q14. Since when is &quot;Many to One&quot; not a valid relationship cardinality? By convention, most people look at relationships like this as One to Many. It depends on which entity is your point of reference. Many to One is simply the inverse of One to Many; both are equally real and valid. Q16: Question refers to data type &quot;text&quot; generically in the question, but in the DDL mixes type text with type varchar. Q17: Question about relationship optionality. &quot;Self-Recursive&quot; is a word? Isn't that a tautology? What does recursive have to do with optionality? Q20: &quot;&gt;&quot; sign is wrong for all answers according to the wording of the question. Should be &quot;&lt;&quot; or &quot;&lt;=&quot;. Q22: Typo: &quot;ANDprice&quot; instead of &quot;AND price&quot; Q26: Adding memory to remote clients is not a hardware solution for poor performance? In a client/server environment? What about large, locally cached cursors? Q27. Question presupposes that we know and remember the exact schema of the (I assume) pubs database. Option &quot;b&quot; won't work because of ambiquous column names. This is true only because the particular data model chosen for pubs. It has nothing to do with SQL Server. This data model view is not given to us in the question. Also, the query has no join or where clause so we get nonsensical results (every author's name with every city/state we have &amp; vice-versa). Q32. We are asked to insert 001001001 into an INT column. This is a bogus thing to do, but it works anyway. the value 1001001 is inserted (see Q34). Q34. This question is *exactly* the same as Q32, however this time, we are told the answer is &quot;String or binary data would be truncated...&quot; (see Q32). Which is right? Q40. Two of the answers given are 32,734 (this is the &quot;correct&quot; answer), and 32,768. According to SQL Server Books Online, neither is correct. BOL says: &quot;A maximum of 32,767 databases can be created on a server.&quot; Q43. Asks a question about the 401K_Amt column of the Benefits table. All answers incorrectly transpose this to read 401K_Amt.Benefits instead of Benefits.401K_Amt. Q44. Maximum number of files used by a single database. I could not find answer anywhere, BOL, etc. Maybe this book is right. Correct answer given is 32,768. One option was 32,767, which, would agree with BOL's max number of DATABASES (Also incorrectly given in this book). What is a file? I hope they mean physical file, as in mydb.mdf. Q49.

The Horn of Valere has been stolen from Moraine, and the Two Rivers gang. Not to mention the dagger that Mat's life depends on. At the core of this theft lies Fain and these events set the book in motion. Rand, Mat, and Perrin go after the Horn because it summons the Hero's of the past and ironically can be used for good as well as evil. Another reason for Mat to go is that he can sense the dagger when it is close, not to mention his life depends on it. In the search for the Horn, Rand starts to learn how to use the One Power. However, his lack of control may destroy him yet. All the adventure leads to a thrilling climax at Toman Head, where Rand eventually becomes branded twice the Heron.

I have read this book several times and it still sucks me in to this magnificently detailed world that Robert Jordan has created. How does the man do it? He has developed not one, not two, but three main characters up to this book, and a whole battalion of supporting secondary characters who have the depth of most authors main characters. I highly suggest not only this book but the entire series, to anyone who likes to read. Though it is set in the Fantasy/Sci-Fi genre, the Wheel of Time saga has no boundaries as to who can read it. be on the look out for book 8: The Path of Daggers"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"***3.5 stars***Whereas the first book was a lot of pages setting up the action, book 2 plunges the reader into it. And that, ultimately, is what makes this a better book. Jordan is limited as a writer: he's not a wordsmith like Tolkien or Donaldson, nor is he a good developer of larger themes like those giants were. He also doesn't have a knack for creating characters that jump off of the page (Eddings), either, although he certainly is not at a loss to keeping adding more of them to the stew. Jordan's success, then, is in the plot, and this book has several good ones going on.Also, thankfully, the Tolkien borrowings aren't nearly as prominent as the first book, although Aragorn (I mean Lan) and Gandalf (I mean Thom Merrelin) are back for more. Now that we know more about Aes Sedai, they and their purposes do seem to be highly reminiscient of Frank Herbert's Bene Gesserit, but at least Jordan is borrowing across genres now.This is just a very good, very tight (uncharacteristically so, I'm finding out, as I'm now on the fifth book and there are long stretches where nothing seems to happen later on) novel that makes Jordan's world come alive much more so than the first book did. Of particular interest was the invasion of the Seanchan, a race of warlike people from \\"across the sea\\" who deal with their female channelers in a way much differently than rasing them to be Aes Sedai. Rand is becoming a little less interesting now that the novelty of treating him as a fish out of water has passed, but more is done with the other characters to pick up the slack.Points deducted for Jordan's cornball, tiresome \\"battle of the sexes\\" theme and for the smash-you-over-the-head obviousness of his lupine depictions of Perrin (who is frequently sitting on his \\"haunches\\" or \\"sniffing the air\\"), but most of the time the story is good enough for one to ignore such things.If the rest of series is as good as the Great Hunt, this will be a better than average series."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"The second book in _The Wheel of Time_ series gets off to an interesting start as Rand and his friends relax in Shienar. But trouble ensues, of course, as the Horn of Valere is stolen and the Shienarans, Perrin, Rand, and Mat must find it. _The Great Hunt_ starts several important plot threads, but at times it seems that these threads are really its only purpose. Rand, wanting to keep his friends from getting hurt on his account, is virtuously irritating almost to the point of tears, while Perrin's steadfast denial of his ability to commune with wolves is almost painful. At the same time, the main male characters keep their naivete, and manage to have some fairly interesting adventures, especially upon reaching Cairhien. The girls, on the other hand, develop immensely in this book. Entering the Tower, they meet Elayne and Min, who join the rapidly-growing ranks of main characters, and Nynaeve is finally given a decent amount of depth through her Accepted's test. The ending of the book is wonderful, considerably better than the ending of _The Eye of the World_, which was, while fantastical, rather anti-climactic. The end of _The Great Hunt_ has plenty of excitement and tension. And, as usual, the book is steeped in history of the _Wheel of Time_ universe and stuffed with hints of events to come."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"We have now followed our heroes to near maturity?Rand has beaten back an invasion of people from the other side of the worldwith strange customs and beliefs who ride three eyed giant frogsout of nightmares or a parallel world?He has been courted by an unearthly beautiful goddessand an evil devil like figure.The Horn of Valere has been blown and the Dragon's banner flown, butRand Al'Thor hasn't yet got a clue about who he is or whathe will have to endure in future episodes of this series.I think he would do better to be a quaker like tinker,than the king who dies in the last battle against evil inthe northern wasteland?"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"In my continuing reread before the next release of book 12, I have new thoughts and opinions about The Great Hunt. Still this series remains something that if I have to take one thing with me to that dessert island, then this would be the series. But now I can see where in the earlier material, Jordan has switched from what we have in the later material.It has always been clear, since I have been with the series from its first publication, that Jordan was amazed by his success with it and began to record more and more to keep the coffers filled. Anything anyone else says is just wrong, and as Jordan would say RAFO. That is probably one of the biggest disservices he did to those who read him, Read and Find Out.Because it is clear that he wrote and as all writers tackling something that grows after you wrote the earlier work, he didn't have it all mapped out. The Great Hunt is clearly the second book of the trilogy.Previously I said that The Eye of the World could have stood on its own, with just another few pages added to it. Clearly a book that could have wrapped up the battle between good and evil in one novel.So in trilogy format we have book 1, our hero finds out that he is the hero and of course does not want to be it. Here in the second book, he finally gets training to confront evil and stands forth to say he will. His buddies have grown strong enough and the dead heroes of legend stand ready to help out in book three.We even have found an entire world changing army, or two, that can be the enemy. But as they are defeated here at the end of book 2, then we just need to concentrate on the evil we discussed in book 1, Trollocs and Fades and Forsaken.Somewhere after this is published the 'Phenomena' factor kicks in big time and there will be more then 3 books. Money to be made. No longer publish the books in trade paperback, after all we are giving up real dollars by doing that. No the Mercenary of Robert Jordan emerges and has possibly always been there.But the book and story are good. Aside from a few quibbles, that dealing mostly with Jordan allowing the story to grow bigger that he could not keep track of everything he did, such as Portal Stones. We have the Ways to travel, but we decide to add another type of travel that we will soon forget about and never use again. Or Aiel at a Steadding but lets just move right through that, or how stupid the Children of the Light are because while the whole world hears about Seachan, they want to think of them as darkfriends, and even let that color the next book.So there is minor suspension of disbelief as Jordan starts transforming to a much bigger work. But for all that we get one of the meatist series we have ever had. I have reread the series now more than half a dozen times and expect will do so as many again once it is complete. Characters continue to grow, and more are added, but unlike George RR Martin where there are so many cross purposes making it more complex then the real world of 2009, Jordan is able to focus on Good vs. Evil with some shading around the edges. Well worth any fantasy fans time but not as a stand alone book, only really as part of the series."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"A couple of threads to this book. The party involved in going after the magical Horn of Valere, which the bad guys have nicked.The females have to go and deal with the serpentine and savage politics of the sorceress types of the Aes Sedai, at their base, win the argument there, and stay alive.Rand, by the end, is definitely not your rural village kid anymore."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"Great characters and fast paced.

I understand that Macmillan wants to charge a higher fee for new releases but this book is several dollars cheaper at your local bookstore and that price takes into account the printing of the book, transportation to the store, profit for the publisher and for the book seller. The electronic version shares almost none of those expenses yet they have decided to charge the consumer an extra $2.00? Shame on you Macmillan. Much like the music industry that failed to accept the future before it was too late, Macmillan seems focused on scalping the consumer for a few extra bucks now at the expense of a long term relationship with the buying public. Looks like I will just pull out my old paperback and save myself $10."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"As a lifelong fantasy reader and occasional fiction writer, I have to say that this book is abysmal. It is so badly written that I feel compelled to defend the art of writing against such fodder by, what else, posting a review on Amazon.Now, admittedly, the first book must have had some redeeming qualities or else I wouldn't have made it through the second one. Or it could just be part of the brilliant marketing trap of book series. Right now, I can't say if I will finish out the series, but since book three is sitting on my shelf, I just might have to read it.The series is conceptualized quite well. Jordan has set up a vast, complex, and interesting world in which to let is characters roam, though I can't seem to keep all the ancient wars straight. The problems are his characters and his sense of narrative action. The characters are flat and dull; they are as psychologically complex as a group of lab rats. They behave predictably. For instance, Rand makes a big point of thinking \\"I will not be used!\\" or something to that effect, just to create tension I suppose, and yet he takes the dragon banner with him. Hello? Is it a shock when he pulls it out and uses it in the end? Yeah, couldn't see that one happening. The big bad guy, Ba'alzamon is a poor cousin to Darth Vadar. \\"Serve me, and live.\\" What's next, \\"Rand, I am your father\\"? And don't get me started on the female characters. They are all predictably and blandly beautiful. Lame things come out of their mouths, like when Elayne says \\"Is this what an adventure is like?\\" Such sophisticated dialogue.I can't shake the feeling that this is the kind of story I might have construed as a young teenager. Jordan's writing is about on that level. The action skips along without any logical progression; in fact, most of the character's actions are illogical. When Rand, Loial and Hurin are transported to that other dimension, it makes perfect sense to them that there is a damsel in distress (Selene) waiting for them and they are in no way suspicious of her. We as readers of course are much smarter, but that's not saying much. That's only one example among many.If a story is going to be drawn out over twelve books, you had better have characters that are complex and compelling. Jordan hasn't delivered that for me. These cardboard characters could pop up in any kind of literature. There better be considerable payoff in those last pages. If I ever make it that far. Jordan certainly is not compelled to meet our expectations because he is already laughing all the way to the bank.So, overall, I am largely disappointed. Jordan has done the genre of fantasy a great disservice by weighing down our shelves with this series."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"I have to admit that Robert Jordan has become an icon for the entire fantasy genre. His intimately detailed images ranging from the various settings and landscapes, to the actions and ranges of emotions portrayed in the enormous character list. He currently has ten books in the series (eleven if you count the prequel novel) and I have enjoyed every one of them. That being said, I would be remiss if I didn't address some things that I have read in other reviews of this series.1. \\"RJ's books are too dry and repetitive from book 7 on.\\" The day you actually create a story this in-depth and have your characters go through so much, is the day you can complain about the story getting dry. So there wasn't a battle or someone dying every four pages. Wah, Wah, Wah. As people like our heroes grow and have more experience, the enemy has to continuously think or more complex and in-depth ways of coercion/ killing or what have you. I'll leave it at that.2. \\"The books are too long\\" Ahhhhhhhhh do we actually have to read something longer than a maxim? Are we mad that there are no pictures? Tough. If you don't like it, put this book down and pick up a Maxim, or go back to your religious following of 30 minute sitcom watching acolytes.3. As for the reviewer J .T. (name withheld to avoid public embarrassment and ridicule)...Are you out of your F***ing mind!? I guarantee I've read more fantasy than you could hope to achieve in your lifetime and almost all of them (as you stated) starts to devolve into the verbal tripe. Where this series differs, is the author's active role to keep the verbal tripe to a minimum, where as Terry Goodkind's Sword of Truth series repeats at least four paragraphs worth of useless drivel from the first book throughout the rest of the series. Goodkind, Brooks, Weiss, Hackmann, Gregory Niles, Salvatore, Greenwood, Cunningham: you name it...any author out there that has written a series is going to repeat what they believe to be \\"need to know\\" information throughout their books because they know that some morons out there for SOME reason like to start in at the middle of the series and then wonder why they are lost the entire book. Finally, if you had read and PAID ATTENTION in the fourth book, there was one of the biggest series shockers of the entire genre with what Rand found out about the whole civilization. In fact I'm just going to stop here and say that you don't know what you are talking about.Believe me folks when I say that I at least, know what I'm talking about. You could pretty much name every fantasy author over the past 25 years and I've read their work. Jordan is one of the top ten. If you actually like to READ (instead of thumbing through the pages looking at the pretty pictures), then give this series a chance. Don't remain there with the rest of the window licker generation; content to stay in the comfortable 250 page section of young adult novels. Put down the Harry Potter books and join the big boys. I guarantee if you remain open minded then you will join the ever-growing population of Jordan addicts.And now I believe I've spoken my peace and I'll exit stage left (taking my soap box/ coffee table {don't judge, it's not like you haven't had a bachelor pad before and if you haven't, please move out of you parent's house already!}with me). Thank you for spending 3-5 minutes (depending on how fast you read) out of your day and let me pollute your mind with this opinionated drivel. Good-bye and happy reading."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"One of the most boring books I've ever read(or half-read anyway).

Thank you Mr. Jordan.:^)"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"The most important question I can pose to Mr. Jordan is; \`What about the \`Wheel of Time' is so relevant to the human condition and literature, that almost 10,000 pages of text is necessary to convey the background of these fictional characters in an imaginary world?'Absolutely nothing.Make no mistake; Mr. Jordan is not an excellent writer by any means. His series has no signs of intricate plot construction. He seems more interested in expressing his exact idea of what the reader should imagine in each scene, then allowing the reader to use their own creativity to imagine certain scenes. Honestly, I cannot see any reason to spend over half a chapter describing characters that may only appear four times in minor roles throughout the entire series. There is absolutely nothing wrong, in my opinion, with crafting a description for a major or minor character that is less than one paragraph that conveys all important information. It almost seems as if Robert Jordan wanted to publish a list of physical statistics for each character covering blood type, height in centimeters, weight, shade of eyes, history of their wardrobe, a summary of their genetic lineage and perhaps a list of personality quirks. Nothing wrong with that either, as long as the overall story benefits from this information.After reading the entire series and going back to read the first books, Mr. Jordan's flaws become more and more apparent. I find myself wishing that Tor had used an editor that could give the writing in this book enough direction so that the major events themselves don't become the only reasons for reading."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"the book is drugged out, kinda like (from what i have herd)7-10 in the series. in the beginning, it is really good, and up til about page 400 it is a good novel, but there is a lot of filler, hell i skipped nearly everything with egwene and the aes adi. i read the test for nyvagene, and then egwene with the novices, but i found myself really more into rand and his co. i personally think the aes adi didn't need to be in there. correct me if i'm wrong.

Lastly, i seems that Book 2 is the only book that Perrin actually seems to get mad. He has turned into such a pushover and is just getting annoying. All these men have to take charge.

It certainly isn't anything of the sort.The word that best describes the Great Hunt (and the series as well) is hogwash (in polite terms). Anything good is slurred over in a gravy of useless descriptions and foolish side plots. If you want to read 6000+ pages of descriptive minutae with foolish and immature (they're supposed to be over 20?) characters running around getting chased, chasing, wandering, roaming, etc, then this series is worth it. A whole two chapters are spent on describing 3 Aes Sedai flirting with Mat as if they were 13 years old. The book concludes with a second, and 'final'(really!)duel after their 'final' duel in Book One. Dark, deep hints are given about Rand's past and future; perhaps we'll get to know a little more in book 7, 4000 pages later? No one knows.The book continues the standard tedium of book One with the horribly drawn characters and 'frightening' monsters (yeah, Trollocs really give me nightmares). If you want some good fantasy to read, try His Drak Materials by Pullman. or go back to Tolkien (Jordan, the next Tolkien? haha. He isn't half the writer).

It is certainly an exciting, quality epic, which becomes more apparrent in this second novel as Jordan expands on his original storyline. In this novel, the plot becomes far more complex than could be guessed from &quot;The Eye of the World&quot;, which is a necessity as far as I'm concerned.

I aslo like that he also focus on the women of Two Rivers and what happens to them while they try to learn to be Aes Sedai. I'm currently reading book 3 and I'm almost done with it.

I'm really looking forward to reading the next book. My favorite part of the book is reading about how Rand handles his ability to channel. It is full of conflict and I love how the writer makes you empathize with him. I also like the prophecy and how is branded with the heron twice &quot;twice to live and twice to die&quot;."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"Plot Summary: Rand al'Thor has faced the Dark One and lived, and although he accepts his ability to channel the One Power, he denies that he is the Dragon Reborn. When the Horn of Valere is stolen, Rand is desperate to escape the Aes Sedai, so he joins the soldiers who vow to bring it back, along with Mat and Perrin. Meanwhile, Egwene and Nynaeve travel to Tar Valon to begin their training to becoming Aes Sedai. Their divergent paths converge at the end in another climactic finale.The scope of this series is already melting my brain, and I'm only two books in so far. It's not the best fantasy I've ever read, but it's certainly entertaining, and the sheer size of it lends it strength. The Great Hunt is just over 700 pages, and a lot of action takes place therein. Action is definitely where Robert Jordan excels. He crafts wonderfully evil bad guys who are always huffing down the necks of Rand and his friends. The tension hums constantly, and this is the second book to end with a big clash and bang. I would have a hard time finishing these books in a timely manner if I wasn't propelled by the relentless plot. Once I immerse myself into this world, I become hooked.The character development is okay, although it's a bit spotty in places. For instance, Perrin and Mat are in the thick of things, but I don't feel like they've progressed in any way. They just go with the flow without growing personally. Rand gets the most face time, obviously, but he spends much of this book in denial, which is isn't my favorite way to spend time with someone. I think Egwene and Nynaeve had the best story arc this time, while Moiraine and Lan were barely present.I think the title of book three says it all,The Dragon Reborn: Book Three of 'The Wheel of Time'. I'll be glad when Rand isn't trying to run from his destiny because it's always more interesting when characters are proactive rather than passive."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"My teenage son has become addicted to the Wheel of Time series and wants to be sure to have the next installment ready and waiting.

The ending of this book blew me away. We all know we are reading epic fantasy here, but Robert Jordan is truly the king of wrapping up a book. Yes, as reading it, you get some hints about what will happen -- but the finale is so brilliantly executed, and so very personal. I felt like I was there, witnessing it, reading of the accounts of the locals that witnessed it too. If Jordan were describing me reading it, I'm sure I'd be described as wide-eyed, shaking as if I were an Ogier with ears to twitch. It is hard to describe how awesome the finale is without spoilers, so I will just leave it at that.Like The Eye of the World (the first in this series), this book is long, and over-long at places. But it was better about that than the first book. Some things become more clear in this, and others significantly more gray; and I think I can safely say that both these descriptions apply to every main character as well as the entire Aes Sedai. This adds an extra level of depth to the story, and an extra level of engagement.I read in my spare time, which isn't a lot, and it took me about 16 days to read this book. And I read it immediately after finishing Eye of the World, which I did in 8 days. As I was in the middle of it, I was saying to myself that I really have to stop reading this series for awhile before I get burnt out.

Now I have to buy a few more in the series. My favorite part of this book is the part near the end, featuring Egwene and her friends. You'll see what I mean when you get to it.

Very entertaining and not trash."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"This is book two in a series of books by Robert Jordan called \\"The Wheel of Time.\\" It is a well-written sprawling science fiction fantasy saga about a young man who is born to end up battling with the evil force in the world. He and his friends travel all over the world trying to get everyone on his side, getting ready for the big battle which will decide whether the end of the world will go to the evil one or the good people. But not everyone will believe in him. There is magic, and unseen forces, monsters, strange peoples from far away, all kinds of different unexplainable things happening that can only happen when magic is used. It's a fun read, there are many small plots and twists to follow along the way. I love the story line, and the writer is wonderful. It's very colorful, and it is easy to visualize in your head, based on his descriptions, what is going on. The characters are very real and their personalities are very distinct and some are quite unusual. I have looked forward to each book as I have gone along through the series."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"The story wasn't as good as book 1 or 2 of \\"The Wheel of Time\\" but the recording or narration was just as good.

There are so many outstanding moments in this book: raid at Fal Dara, Rand encountering a Forsaken (and being trapped in an alternate world temporarily). There are several great emotionally-charged scenes: Thom's scenes in Cairhien, the alternate realities with the portal stones, Egwene with the Seanchan, Mat realizing his destiny...and my favorite-the redemption of Ingtar. What a tremendous book this was, how this wasn't my favorite before is beyond me!"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"He blew it. He could have written something principally mind-blowing in this second book, but took most of his chances to develop the world. That in itself is not bad, just that other than Tel'aran'rhiod, there is no more depth to be dwelved into his Wheel of Time idea. However, Aes Sedai are fleshed out with better depth to their overall system of management and given more personality to their belief systems. It serves to almost put them in another culture.Now I read The Great Hunt after reading The Dragon Reborn, so obviously my opinion is somewhat skewed since very little suspense could have been afforded in this scenario. Nonetheless, having read The Dragon Reborn, the characters in this installment seem to be suspiciously acting like sitcom characters, that is they never develop more and only react the same way until you get tired of their lack of emotional depth. Speaking of that, where is it? In the first book, Jordan expressed human concern, sacrifice, despa! ir, discovery and hope, in this it seems the characters are quite removed in their feelings toward their actions. And their actions never tell more about their personality.The dialogue is rich and entertaining, characters like Loial and Elayne are extremely charming and even though I knew something of it from The Dragon Reborn, one plot twist took me completely by surprise and snatched me into an inevitably exciting climax which must rank as one of the most satisfying ever. Whew! It took my breath away, much like the anti-climax of The Lord of the Rings wherein Tolkien quietly ended the most exciting part of the saga with mellow reserve. Bravo! However, there is one revelation which seems contrived and made only to wrench sorrow from the reader, with no great effect.New characters like Selene and the imminent arrival of Jordan's greatest fantastic creation, the Seanchan, keep this book readable and good, but I still can't forgive his lack of &quot;show, not tell&quot; wr! iting and obsession with detail when simply a well-written ! paragraph could serve to impact a chapter just as well. In addition, there are hints of the later books' deplorable sexism coming to light here. Nevertheless, this average tale has a much more creative start than the first, even if it does seem like an after school special between junior high students stuck in a fantasy world.I give it a 7 out of 10 stars, while the original garnered an 8."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"OK, Mr Jordan is improving from the not-so-bad-either beginnings of 'Eye of the World', the scale is suitably epic, the cast varied ('though seriously flawed..) and the detail offered absolutely stunning in its richness and scale. Great fun to read, every single page (although those reader used to 45 minutes 'Xena' episodes and 'soundbites' will be a bit overloaded by the setting and its nuances )- I just have two major flaws to comment upon : First and foremost, Jordan steals, borows and relabels concepts, plots, names and figures without appearant shame or respect from any major epic, pantheon or 'real-world' myth - which on one hand makes the world created by him eerily familliar and convincing sounding, but is everything but original, and rather cheap. Some people aropund this list have complained about other authors 'stealing' from Mr.Jordan - well, folks read around a bit. mke up your minds and shut up ! Few people have copied, pasted in and reworded scenes from other stories like Mr. Jordan !! The second quarrel I have is, that some of the characters go through unexplained major changes (due to their proximity to the ultimate plot device, the ta'veren characters..)in attitude, abilities and goals for reasons of convenience (say Mat Caulthon after this book....) or simply stay one-dimensional sketches forever( How about the 'wisdom' who's major ability is to bully anthing that dares too breathe into submission through simple stubbornness - if that is female wisdom and intellect applied, one can just hope it stays confined to Jordan's creation... Its just ironic that this character is foaming mad at another female character doing just the same...). And the whole cast is at times (when it is required by the plot..) stupid beyond belief (said 'Wisdom' is one of those, I'll just say 'nightly excursions fromm Tar Valon.....) and a sucker for anything...... Besides this, the plot is full of major logical holes and unexplainable occurences (Ok,ok, its the pattern woven by the Wheel in Ages before, what a lucky coincidence !!!), and the villains, besides being labeled 'evil' are almost as harmless as bad weather, especially given the opportunities they miss to wreck _real_ evil. AFter all, these 'forsaken' where among the most powerful, corrupt and clever people of their respective ages - they just are not allowed to show it... The good thing is, one only starts to notice the bad parts on the second reading (and only if one starts thinking about plot coherency..)- until then 'The Great Hunt' (and most of the remaining series ) is fun to read, the showdown is spectacular and touching at the same time, the plots intricately woven ...... even if the whole epic obviously is going nowhere in particular. Recommended reading,but do not call it literature or great art. It IS superior craftmanship - but in no way original, thought provoking or ground breaking. 'nough said !!!"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"Believe what most people say-the first book &quot;borrows&quot; heavily from Tolkien with both plot and characterisation. This one is better, it's beginning to tell it's own story and most of the characters are starting to grow in their own direction.It's not a stand-alone story, it helps if you read it with that in mind and just go with it. The adventures seemed to draw me in more this time around and Jordan has expanded on some of the better ideas he introduced in Book 1.It's been said before- his weakness lies with his characters. The world is split in male and female sides, and their seems to be a gulf between them. Unfortunately, most women are nasty towards men and roll their eyes a lot, while the men shrug stupidly and mutter under their breath how they don't understand women.In summary, the world and plot are developing well-but I'm damned if I can figure out how anyone procreates in Jordan's world!"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"The Great Hunt (TGH) is the second book in the Wheel of Time (WOT) saga and it is in this book that the series begins to roll. The Eye of the World, (Book 1) was frequently annoying because of the author's need to build up the story line and characters, particularly since he is obdurate about not providing a decent introduction or prologue for the world he has created. But now, the launch pad is ready. The Two Rivers group has slowly but surely lost its innocence and are beginning to realize that there is no way back; the bridges have been burned behind them. They must finish what they started or a worse fate will befall them. Rand, Mat and Perrin are launched none too subtly after the fabled Horn of Valere, an endeavor that will not only lead ultimately to the finding of the Horn but equally importantly harden each of them to his destiny. And at long last, the gender promise held out in the first book is lived up to as the girls, Egwene, Elayne and Nynaeve begin to take a hand. In many ways, TGH can claim to be the best of the series. Jordan has clearly hit his stride after the first book proved successful and his writing is more lively and attractive. The descriptions of the Seanchan, the humor and gallantry as the Horn is sounded towards the end are all a treat to read. The alternative futures of the Portal Stones journey and Nynaeve being tested for Acceptance with her own fears and hopes are spellbinding. But the structural annoyances remain from the first book; even here where terrain and geography are so critical, the single map of the world (that too, partial) that Jordan grudgingly gives is pathetic. Worse, with the Seanchan playing so important a role, Jordan provides no indication of where across the Aryth Ocean the Seanchan lands lie or their geography. Hence, only 4 stars."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"Love the series. I am anxiously awaiting the last volume.

Beginning in Fal Dara, a keep close to the Blighted Lands, the story splits into two main parts. And reader, be thankful that it is not yet more. We follow Rand, Perrin, Mat, Loial, Hurin, a sniffer, and Lord Ingtar as they follow the Horn south. And all appears to be going well until one night Rand, Loial, and Hurin disappear and find themselves in a Mirror World where they encounter Selene, a beautiful woman who guides them but who has her own secrets. Eventually, they find themselves out of the Mirror World and back in our own world where they continue to hunt for the Horn. It is a hunt that will lead them to the palaces of Cairhien, to the steddings of the Ogier, and eventually to the city of Falme where five will go forth and only four will return in their quest to find the Horn of Valere.The second part follows Egwene and Nynaeve as they journey to Tar Valon to begin their studies as Aes Sedai. It is here that they meet Min again and where they encounter Elayne, daughter-heir of Andor. Togther, somehow, they must muddle through their studies while all around them darkness threatens. Threatens so much that one night they are taken along the ways to Falme by Liandrin Sedai where they encounter the Seanchan - the descendants of Artur Hawking's armies who conquered the lands across the sea and now have returned to claim their lands here in Randland.The book itself is relatively short - under 700 pages.

Starting almost on the heels of The Eye of the World, the action begins almost immediately for Rand Al'Thor as he wants to leave his friends for there own safty because of his ability to channel, only for events to change his plans. Throughout the book Rand is in a continual struggle to define himself while trying to save the same friends he wants to leave behind. While Rand continues to be the primary protagonist/point-of-view character, others come more into shape such as Perrin, Egwene, a commander of the Whitecloaks, Min, and the evil Padan Fain that help better bring Jordan's world into shape.As the second book of The Wheel of Time series, The Great Hunt not only is an excellent book by itself but also adds to the story arc that makes you want to read the next book in the series right away."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"This book and the entire Wheel of Time series are simply great!

Jordan just writes a good story. It took this one a little bit to get going, but once the Hunt was in full effect, I couldn't put the book down. I was glad for the breaks into the other plot lines once in awhile to give myself a breather from the main plot of the Hunt for the Horn of Valere. I loved to hate a few of the characters, and the Seanchan were excellent villains! Can't wait to read the next one!"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"The Great Hunt is the second chapter in the Wheel of Time series and it not only builds on the events and characters from the first book, it expands the world and introduces some new characters and races in the book that make the world feel that much larger and consequently, more interesting. The introduction of the Seanchan, for example, make a fascinating race to add to the mix I don't think we've heard the last from them despite how the book ended. We also get a bit more understanding of who the Aes Sedai are and what goes on in the tower which made for some pretty compelling chapters and gave me a better sense of who they are. Jordan also explores several other cultures, some new, some we already knew about, throughout the book all of which made the world seem more real and fleshed out to me.Much of what made the first book so good was present in this story but we've definitely left behind many of the similarities with Tolkien that were a bit distracting in the first book. Jordan seems to have really found his own voice in this book and the narrative seems to flow fairly effortlessly between plot threads until they all meet up towards the end. I spent a lot less time trying to keep track of who's who and now that I'm familiar with the players, I found myself just being able to settle into the groove and enjoy the story as it unfolded. There were, of course, the requisite twists in the story and a couple of characters were revealed to be Darkfriends - 1 who was blindingly obvious and the other definitely not. There was plenty of action throughout and I felt like the book was pretty well balanced between world building, action, humor, suspense and various other elements.Finally, the events in the last few chapters really set up the much larger story that will play out over the next 12 books and given how it ends, it makes you immediately want to start the next book as it really kind of ends on a giant cliff-hanger, though there's little doubt about how it will be resolved. While I wouldn't say the book was without flaws, it was a very strong addition to the series and I'd definitely recommend it to any fan of Fantasy."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"I Promise: I'm going to be spoiler free.This is the second book in the Wheel of Time (WOT) series (after Eye of the World). It is BETTER than the first one. Jordan is really finding his legs with the series. All of the tenants of excellent fantasy are here. Jordan is a great writer who builds an incredible world with a compelling history. His characters are also incredible.Great Hunt is a great book, but be warned: as of this writing Jordan hasn't finished WOT. The Great Hunt does not stand alone, the ending is something of a cliffhanger. My guess is the end of this series isn't going to happen until 2006 (I believe there are going to be 12 books, but I don't think there's an official word).Is it going to be worth it? I don't think so. WOT has gotten very complicated and is becoming turgid. Sometime around Book 6, the action began to crawl. Book 8 (the last one I read) was almost 700 pages and took place over three days, AND was practically missing some important characters!I've read the first five books twice now beacuse it is too difficult to wait a year between reading books. (And he's coming out with them once every other year at this point).My advice: Wait until Jordan's finished them all. It's best to read them one after another. By then we'll know if it was worth the wait.You've been warned!My grade for the series:1. Wheel of Time: A-2. Great Hunt: A3. Dragon Reborn: A+4. Shadow Rising: A+5. Fires of Heaven: A6. Lord of Chaos: B7. Crown of Swords: C+8. Path of Daggars: C9. Winter's Heart (haven't read, waiting for Jordon to finish)"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"The second book in Robert Jordan's epic &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; saga is another fantastic book in this series. Set in the most vivid fantasy world ever created, Jordan takes readers further into this world, weaving new plotlines, introducing new characters and growing the roles of characters first met in &quot;The Eye of the World&quot;. This series continues to work on multiple levels, containing nuances which have clearly been missed by the few critics of this series. (Critics of this series often focus on its length, reminding one of the emporer in &quot;Amadeus&quot;, who complained that Mozart's concert had &quot;too many notes.&quot;)In the first book, Rand, Perrin and Mat, 3 young men from the village of Emond's Field were forced to flee from minions of the Dark One, accompanied by Egwene, a village girl who wanted adventure, and Thom Merrilin, a gleeman who had come to the village to entertain at the village's spring festival. Guided by Moiraine, a member of the mysterious order of Aes Sedai, women who can channel &quot;saidar&quot;, the female half of the One Power, and Lan, Moiraine's Warder, the group was soon joined by Nynaeve, the village's Wisdom, who had followed them to protect the young people from her village who had been had been swept up in an Aes Sedai &quot;scheme&quot;. The group, minus Thom, would eventually be joined by Loial, an young member of the long-lived race of Ogier, a gentle giant of a bookworm who had left home to see the world.One of the joys of the first book was the maturing of the characters, all of whom would change in significant ways: Perrin discovered he could talk with wolves, and now has the yellow eyes of wolf, and has also run afoul of the Whitecloaks, an intolerant military order of zealots; Mat had been uttering the Old Tongue in moments of battle &amp; stress and was then tainted by a cursed dagger from the foul city of Shadar Logoth; Egwene discovered she had the ability to channel and now desires to become an Aes Sedai; Nynaeve learned that she could already channel, having survived what only one in four women do, channeling on her own without Aes Sedai training; Nynaeve has also fallen in love with Lan, a love he also feels, but does not believe he should return; and Rand has discovered that he is a man who can channel. Men who channel inevitably go insane, and have ever since the breaking of the world some 3,000 years ago.&quot;The Great Hunt&quot; picks up shortly after the end of &quot;The Eye of the World&quot;, with everyone in the borderland town of Fal Dara. The Amyrlin Seat, Siuan Sanche, head of the female order of Aes Sedai, arrives, purportedly to meet with the three young men from Emond's Field, all of whom are &quot;ta'veren&quot;. A person who is &quot;ta'veren&quot; has a certain ability to manipulate events and chance, e.g. a leader who intends to reject a treaty might end up signing it. But the Amyrlin has arrived for reasons of her own, with plans she means to make with Moiraine.But before any of these plans can be implemented, a sudden raid by Trollocs and Myrddraal, minions of the Dark One, results in the freeing of the peddler Padan Fain, a Darkfriend who had been altered to hunt for Rand, Perrin and Mat, and who had been further changed by following them into cursed Shadar Logoth. The raid resulted in Fain stealing Mat's tainted dagger, and the Horn of Valere, which is locked in its own box. Whoever sounds the Horn of Valere will bring forth heroes of legend who will fight for the Light against the Dark One. Or so it is believed. In truth, these heroes will fight for whoever sounds it.Rand, Mat and Perrin, accompanied by Loial, set out to recover the Horn and Mat's cursed dagger. Mat is still linked to the dagger and it is needed for him to be fully Healed by Aes Sedai. They will be joined by Verin, an Aes Sedai who has motivations of her own. On this journey, Rand will meet a beautiful woman, Selene, who has also has motivations of her own.Egwene and Nynaeve head to the White Tower in Tar Valon, to begin training to be Aes Sedai. They will also meet an Aes Sedai with private motivations, Liandrin. They become friends with Elayne, Daughter-Heir of Andor, and Min, a young woman capable of seeing auras around people, both of whom we briefly met in Book One.But people who are &quot;ta'veren&quot; have a way of drawing to them people of whom they have need and our characters may well meet before this book is over.In this book, readers learn the fate of Thom Merrilin, the missing gleeman; learn about the mysterious invaders called Seanchan; meet up with ship captain Bayle Doman again; learn more about the mysterious Aes Sedai; get involved with &quot;The Game of Houses&quot; in Cairhein; witness the plots of Darkfriends and Ba'alzamon; and meet an Aiel for the first time.Jordan has created the most fully realized fantasy world to date, and it is a pleasure to visit again. With stong, complex characters, including numerous strong female characters, vital cultures, and skillful, intelligent word crafting, this series cannot be recommended enough."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"After the skill, fun, and sheer size of the first book in the Wheel of Time series, I eagerly looked forward to the second book. I won't say I was disappointed - many authors slip a little in a second book in the series - the book is nowhere near the fun, the pace, or the interest of the first book. The story: the Horn of Valere is stolen by Darkfriends, as is Mat's soul-stealing dagger. Lord Ingtar takes charge of a group of Shienar's finest in an effort to find and retreive the artifacts. Our three male heroes - Rand, Perrin, and Mat - go along with the Lancers. Meanwhile, our two female heroes - Nynaeve and Egwene - accompany the Aes Sedai witch to Tar Valon, the stronghold of the Aes Sedai, to start their training.So, what is the problem with the book? Firstly, Jordan felt the need to \\"regress\\" his characters somewhat. One would think that the boys and girls who had crossed the world, defended the Eye of the World from the evil one, and had survived numerous battles, would have gained in maturity. And they do so throughout the first book, but their characters are back in their mid-EotW form at the beginning of the second book. Mat is childishly selfish, Egwene is wide-eyed innocent, Nynaeve is a petulant bully, etc. In fact, they stay at this stunted level of development through most of this book. The character of Nynaeve is especially hard to take - she consistently holds to ideas she has seen proven false, she tries to bully everyone into agreeing with her and vows awful revenge when they don't, etc. And yet all the characters seem to think she's wonderful, including the ageless Warder king-heir who must have better offers from scullery maids than the histrionics Nynaeve consistently offers. Yet he is supposed to be in love with her? Did I miss something?Part of the problem is that, in an attempt to keep his splintered cast alive, he feels the need to touch base with each of the characters too often. While the meat of this book is clearly Rand's pursuit of the Horn of Valere, Jordan will jump back for a chapter here and there following the girls training in Tar Valon. Unfortunately, he doesn't seem to have much reason for any of these interludes except to try and keep the characters in the story. The book would have been better served if he had followed the Tolkien route of sticking with one group of people for the long haul, then taking the other characters through the same time all at once in later chapters. It would have cut down on the annoying repetitiveness surrounding the Tar Valon chapters.Basically, there's too much filler. When the action is humming along, and the characters are doing something, Jordan's prose shines. We are in a foreign land but we never feel like outsiders (at least, only as much as the characters) because he does so well in describing events. Each new ethnic group we meet is fully developed and unique. Carhein is a wonderfully decadent society, the Seanchan slavers are logical and terrible in the way they've developed their society, and the Whitecloaks are finally given something interesting to do (and are presented not as a spiteful nemesis force but a trans-national entity with their own goals that are simply at odds with Rand's quest). The last 150 pages are barn-burning (better than anything in Book 1) and leave the reader anxious to lay his hands on the next sequel. If the book was 200 pages shorter, it would have been a great story. As it is, it's weighed down and the filler detracts from the rest of the book, but still recommended and it was certainly good enough to convince me to stick with the series into Book 3."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"The Wheel of Time is probably the best-known and most widely read fantasy series other than The Lord of the Rings. There are many reasons for that:(1) Books 1-5 of the series are non-stop action, adventure, intrigue, politics, magic, war, history and mystery wrapped together.(2) Jordan creates believeable and often multifaceted characters.(3) Attention to detail: from the various cultural traits of the 13 &quot;nations&quot; on the map (dubbed &quot;Randland&quot; by fans), to the commercial, political and economic interaction of the various peoples in the books to the characters and objects throughout &quot;Randland&quot;.(4) End-games. Jordan's at his best in the last chapters of books 1-6 and 9 when he writes of the climactic occurrences of each of those installments.The Great Hunt, like The Eye of the World, again exhibits the best of Jordan's writing style and pacing. That is true also for books 3-5.The Great Hunt picks up where Eye of the World left off and adds new facets to the complex plot: schisms and scheming among the sorceresses (Aes Sedai), an invasion by descendants of a long-lost conquistador exploration of lands across the ocean, introduction of the hero's jilted love interest, and exploration of more of Randland. The roles of Rand's various allies and friends are also revealed to a greater degree.Once again, the writing is smooth, the various characters and their motivations work well, and there's action aplenty. The sense of innocence and mystery that corresponded to the heroes' relative lack of knowledge of their surroundings and the world at large in book 1 diminishes appropriately as the heroes are exposed to more of their world and the chaos therein.The series is at 10 books (the tenth will be published late 2002 or so) and growing (13 total possible -- it's a common numerical theme in the books). The quality drops off sharply in books 6-8 before increasing slightly in book 9. You will likely enjoy the first 5 immensely, but know what you're getting into."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"The Wheel of Time books were introduced to me by a friend, and once I started, it was wildfire. I admit that Jordan likes to rant, he likes to put 50+ main characters in his books, he likes to stray. But unlike many of the other authors who do this, you don't really notice and most of all, you actually ENJOY it! I was enthralled by the fact you were enlighted on the training procedures of the Aes Sedai, the military strategy and downfall of the Seanchan, the prejudicial workings of the Children of the Light. I love this stuff. It makes the characters real, it gives them more structures and basis for being where they are, thinking how they do, and reacting to situations differently than the rest of them. Each page fills you with more insight than the first. I cannot wait to finish The Dragon Reborn (the next book), and will eagerly await and read anything that Jordon publishes in the future. If there is an end, I don't see it in sight any time soon. Long live these books!"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"I eagerly anticipated getting to this book, especially after having spent so long trying to wrap up the first in the series. It is really more the first book than &quot;Eye....&quot;, which seemed more of a introduction into the world of Jordan. You don't even necessairily have to read the first book: the characters and their back-stories are all explained, not too great length, but enough to get a good idea. I'd suggest reading EOTW anyhow, it's a good piece of literature.This is the continuation of th WOT series, and is basically the platform on which to set up Rand al'Thor and his future. In fact, a more appropriate title would be &quot;The Book of Rand&quot;, since the other characters generally sit around, watching and waiting for the next move. Perrin, my favorite character, doesn't really make the kind of advancements that I would have liked, and Mat is still basically as he was at first, not quite realized, just a stock character of sorts, although he is one of the main reasons for the story to go on, and he has a good role in the ending. Nynaeve becomes a bit more likable, a bit more tolerable, and Egwene is more fully realized. Moiraine and Lan don't have much of a role here, although you do find out more about them. Also, a character comes back from the dead....As with the first book, I have a serious bone to pick with Rand. His stubborness and his refusal to accept the truth are very irritating and somewhat nerve-wrecking. I found myself wanting to slap him on numerous occasions. He does somewhat become more enjoyable towards the end, and he has noble enough reasons for doing a lot of the things he does. A main element of the series so far seems to be the beauty of friendship, loyalty, love. Another is the conflict between good and evil.This novel doesn't seem quite as long as the first, and I was able to complete it in a few weeks. Keep in mind, I have a LOT of free time. If you had 6-8 hours of steady reading time every day, you too could finish it in about that much time, but otherwise it could be a matter of months. The finale alone is worth sticking along with the tale for. As would be expected, the book ends, when you would like it to keep going. Fortuately, there are many more to be read, and I am going to be starting &quot;The Dragon Reborn&quot; very soon. All in all, it's fantastic read, and I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"Books 2 and 3 in the series are usually the ones that fans tend to gloss over on repeat readings, because when compared to the later volumes, they're not so packed full of subplots and multiple POVs. There isn't much meat to the story - it's all plot driven. This doesn't make TGH bad; on the contrary, it makes for an exciting read. There just isn't much character development.The first time I read TGH, I flew through it in 1 sitting, and read it again as soon as I was finished. Quite a lot happens, although most of it goes by so quickly that you have to stop and re-read a chapter or two to regain your bearings. RJ expands the formula he introduced in Book 1: split the main characters into groups, and have them join together at the end. And the ending is wonderful!There are plenty of heros, and we're introduced to a couple of new villains. The appearance of Selene/Lanfear adds a spicy edge to Rand's confusion about his channeling abilities and his budding maturity. The Seanchan, though, start out in the series as a very impressive adversary; we are allowed to see them through several POVs: Bayle Domon, Egwene, Padan Fain. More chilling are the second-hand reports from the Whitecloaks and Hurin that describe heinous acts of cruelty and murder. The Whitecloaks may be insidious, but the Seanshan don't mess around- they get in your face post-haste.There are a lot of impressive scenes in TGH, scenes that resonate in future books. As with the first book, this is Rand's book, and we spend a great deal of time watching him deal with the various challenges, and RJ does a good job of showing Rand mature into the role of a leader.PLOTTING: There were essentially 2 main plot threads, with one splitting into two for half the book. Separating Rand from the others gave RJ the chance to make him an impromptu leader, as well as strengthening Perrin's wolfish abilities. The girls in Tar Valon fall into a trap so obvious that it made me want to howl. The plots all move quickly and without much preamble, although the beginning scenes in Fal Dara are slow. More importantly, the plot threads are timed better than in book 1, resulting in a clear narrative. No confusing flashbacks in TGH.CHARACTERIZATION: When you're writing the kind of action-adventure story that inspires memories of Indiana Jones movies, character development tends to fall by the wayside. Of the 3 boys, only Rand has any significant development, as we see him gradually growing into a leader. We learn a bit more about Min and Elayne, but not enough to truly separate them from Egwene in our minds. Moiraine nearly disappears from the narrative entirely, but instead we get Verin, who seems as mysterious as her Blue counterpart. It is clear at this point that RJ has a great handle on the mental makeup of the average Aes Sedai. Of the secondary characters, Hurin stands our as a likable, loyal guide, and it's a shame that he hasn't made any subsequent appearances (yet).PACING: After the slow beginning, which sets up the rest of the book, the narrative moves with liquid speed, without almost any clogging introspective passages of minor plot thread side trips. The suspense builds nicely, with the false climax in Cairhien a highlight, and the real climax is written with more conciseness than you'd expect from a fantasy writer.BEST SCENE: It has to be Rand's audience with the Amyrlin. If the reader's sympathies weren't totally with Rand before that scene, they definitely were afterwards.MOST POV: Again, as in Book 1, this is Rand's book. The title of the book refers not just to the hunt for the Horn of Valere, but Rand's hunt for his identity, his destiny. TGH begins and ends with scenes that have Rand front and center, although you have to wonder if he's better or worse off by the end.OVERALL: TGH is a lot of fun, even though it doesn't match the complexity of the more recent books. The plotting may be a bit formulaic, but it's still better than most fantasy out there.P.S. Sorry for my rambling on, and making the review so long. Hope it helps!"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"I consider the Eye of the World to be more of a prelude to the Wheel of Time series and indeed can serve as a standalone novel. With The Great Hunt, the story becomes more complex as the true multiple threads begin, the Forsaken become more active, and the Seanchan arrive. Also, Rand's true ancestry is strongly hinted at for the first time, which adds new dimensions to the breadth of the storyline.The novel maintains the fast pace of the first book, although the story isn't quite as linear anymore! It's hard to put the book down, especially as some characters' loyalties become questionable (i.e. Lord Barthanes in Cairhien and the Shienaran warrior behind the escape of Padan Fain). The ending brings the story to a satisfying close with plenty of loose ends to be tied in the next book. A great read!I give this book a 4 not 5 because the childish behavior of some of the characters annoys more than in the first book. Aren't these people supposed to be in their 20's? Why do they act like they're 13 years old? Jordan could have portrayed the characters as innocent adults instead of stubborn kids!And the length of time Jordan spends on some of these immature confrontations is over the top. For example, an entire two chapters or so is devoted to the three girls (Nynaeve, Elayne, Egwene) frustrating themselves in not being able to &quot;sweet-talk&quot; Mat into delivering a letter to Morgase, with Elayne batting her big brown eyes at Mat and Mat complaining to himself that when women are nice they want something. The failed effort at moving a &quot;mulish man&quot; enrages the girls and puts them in a rotten mood, from which they grudgingly decide to give Mat one of Siuan's notes of authority.Anyway, the book is good, read it! Start with the first one, of course..."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"&quot;The Grave is no bar to my call.&quot; The Horn of Valere had been lost for centuries, hidden away in the Green Man's garden with the Eye of the World, a well of saidin, the male half of the One Power, untainted by the Dark One's counterstroke. It is told of in Gleeman's tales, Valere's Horn, that it would resurrect the ancient dead heroes of legend for the Last Battle, Tarmon Gaidon.Now, after all this time, it has finally been discovered. Soon after, though, and very soon, it is stolen and now, all of existance depends upon its recovery.In The Great Hunt, Rand Al'Thor, the Dragon Reborn battles against his own destiny and Matrim Cauthon, who will blow the Horn in the last battle has discovered his.In this momentous epic, Jordan actually manages to surpass The Eye of the World, the first book of the series.With four dimensional characters, a vivid vision and the most complicated plot of any story, Jordan transcends the fantastic, discovering a trale truer than any text book, a story for all stories, a legend for all time."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"I have a confession to make...I started reading Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time series out of order, and was instantly hooked by Book 2. The Great Hunt is what brought me back to reading science fiction, and am I glad that I have returned. I have not been so enthralled by a series since Anne McCaffrey took readers to the planet of Pern, and introduced them to dragons. After meeting with some of the main characters(Rand, Egwene, Lan...) and fighting with them from Fal Dara to Tanicho, I was hooked. Robert Jordan's characters seem to come alive as I read through this book page after page, and I was glad that I got to travel with them through their various adventures, as they fought Trollocs, talked to wolves, and met with the Seanchan. Robert Jordan has set the Wheel of Time turning, creating a wonderful new Pattern for readers to follow.I am glad that he is the reigning master of science fiction. I have read several pieces of science fiction while waiting for copies of his series to be returned at my local library, and none come close to his spinning of the Wheel. One of the wonderful things about his books are the fact that it doesn't matter where you begin...the Wheel never stops turing, and according to Thom Merrilin, there is always a story to tell.I hightly recommend The Great Hunt to all lovers of adventure. And while you are at it, feel free to read the rest of the series as well!"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"In The Great Hunt, Robert Jordan continues the sage from where it left off in The Eye of the World. After discovering his true identity, Rand al'Thor is determined to disconnect himself from Moraine Sedai and other Aes Sedai permanently. Having retrieved the Horn of Valere, an ancient talisman, Rand is destined to joining another quest after it is stolen by Padan Fain and his Trolloc soldiers. With the help of Eye of the World alum Loial the Ogier and some new friends, Rand signs on to another journey while Perrin and Mat, some old friends, try to follow them. Meanwhile, Nynaeve and Egwene are led to the White Tower to begin their Aes Sedai training. In this book, the character groups are consistently right and an improvement to the Eye of the World groupings. A step up from its predecessor, The Great Hunt continually surprises and pleases."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"The Great Hunt is a compelling book for the Wheel of Time epic. Robert Jordan's skill at both storytelling and convincing the reader that he is part of the story is unparalleled in most books that I've read (the only execptions would be Issac Asminov and Anne McCaffree) This novel continues the epic seamlessly and continues with Jordan's hand on building each character into seprate, yet unsepreable characters that you can't help but have feelings for through out the entire epic saga."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"I would have only givin this book 4 stars if not for the ending. The Great Hunt was so much better than the Eye of the World and people should not give up on the series. The end to TGH was the best ending to any book I have ever read, and I am sure as I read on, the endings to others will be even more magnificent! It is a little frustrating in the 2 books how Rand denies what he is, but that is whjat makes a long good storying...I guess..... This book is gooooood! Buy it."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"Jordan's second book of the series gives a clue as to the scope he is attempting, in charactrer development and hints at prophesy. Like the first book in the series, this one is VERY engaging and provides a satisfying ending to a portion of his epic tale. Where the first leaves you wondering if you really know who the main character is, this one lets you know that EVERY character he includes has interest and importance.Though I have lately become disgruntled with this never-ending series, I cannot begrudge that, even on a third reading, this and the other early books truly hold their own. It is these early master-works that keep me buying the latest on the day of it's arrival."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"Well I read the 2nd book and I feel it was as good as the 1st book. Rand still wants nothing to do with the Aes Sedai, but he tries to help his friend Mat and find the Horn of Valere and at the same time saying to himself and to any one who will listen that he is not the Dragon Reborn. Menwhile Egwene, Nynaeve, and Elayne are training to be Aes Sedai and end up in trouble. this book like the 1st one will keep you up late at night untill you finish. If you enjoyed the 1st one you'll enjoy this one. This series is so good I'm about half way through book 4. When I'm done with book 4 I'll give my review on the book."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"I began reading this series roughly 16 months ago with a paperback copy of Book 1: The Eye of the World. I have never regretted it, but I feel The Great Hunt to be the best in the series. I'm not going to say anything about the plot, because that ruins the series, but start with The Eye of the World and you won't regret it. Well, what are you waiting for? Order it already!"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"This book was not as good as the first or others I have read. Not much important stuff happened (Plotwise) but there was a lot of character building. Jordan continues to give great desriptions. This book isn't that great but continue with the series because it gets way better."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"I didn't fully appreciate this book until I had read it the second or third time. I had enjoyed the first book so much that I think my expectations were much too high for this one. Rather than sweeping along in the same high vein that ended the first book, this one moves at a very deliberate pace. There are some great stand-out moments in this book: We meet the formidable Siuan Sanche, Lan takes over the role of male mentor for Rand, the Black Ajah makes an appearance, the Seachan invade, and the Horn of Valere is found. This book is nicely plotted and moves to a great, tension filled climax. It doesn't disappoint."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"Wow! Not many authors can write a sequel to a fantasy novel and have it match its first volume with flying colors! Robert Jordan is the first author that I have read that was able to accomplish this. I read this book in less time than it took me to read The Eye of the World. It was great, if not better. I highly reccomend that, if you are a fantasy lover as I am, you check out this series. It's the best I've seen, and most likely the best I will ever see. I happen to enjoy writing myself. Robert Jordan is one of my inspirations for writing (although I will never top his work). Once again, thank you, Rob, for an incredible series. And guess what: the third, fourth, and fifth books are just as great as the first two. Read them all!"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"I think this was a wonderful way to further the plot of the series. First it gives the reader something to cheer the heros and heroines on for...with the urgency of Mat, Rand , and Perrins quest for the Horn of Valere, but more importantly to Mat the Ruby Dagger. Then it gives you the perfect Enemy. Fain. He's easily the scariest of ANY enemy that the 3 have to face because 1st he's human, 2nd he doesn't have any special powers like being able to channel the one power or anything, but rather he can kill or corrupt with just a touch and is linked like Matrim to the ruby dagger. The book ends superbly introducing a 3rd forsaken and seemingly ending the confrontation with Baalzamon at yet another standstill. Paying attention to detail will pay off when reading these books for many characters are introduced by visions of Tel'aran'rhiod where the one seeing doesn't know them and can only describe them by their looks. Overall this is a wonderful sequel with many plot points that will stand out much more clearly when the series is re-read"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"Unlike the action-packed reading of The Eye of the World, The Great Hunt takes a more daring approach: it is a surreal epic across many worlds, filled with magic spells and eerie encounters. This all ends with one of my favorite fantasy battles ever."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"For people looking for a great book to read this series is what you're looking for. The first book (the eye of the world) was a good book. The writer is of a rare bread and keeps you wanting more,wether the next book or next event. However the books are lenghty so they are thick and alittle bulky. Overall I would strongly recomend this series if you like fantasy and stuff like that."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"The Eye of the World was my favoriate book. Now after reading the second book, I conclude that this is my favoriate series. The Great Hunt made me think if I was part of this pattern. Indeed Robert Jordan is the greatest writer."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"After finishing &quot;Eye of the World&quot;, I had to go on to the next book. I figured Robert Jordan couldn't top his first book and he didn't. It was a great book though, just not &quot;Eye of the World&quot;. He did bring the characters further along to their destiny (which stops around book 5) and he did bring in the new Seanchan people who were very interesting. Also you get your first glimpse of Fremen.. er.. I mean Aiel which are very interesting (though I swear they remind me of Fremen). We still get all the fights and squabbles between the men and the women (at this point it's still funny). It has a fairly climatic ending (though it was rather predictable). I say read this book and keep reading through the series, you'll most likely enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"This book, far overshadows the first book in the series, by the mere fact that its beggining and end is not nearly as rushed and excited as the in the first.

It had to follow greatness and not disapoint its loyal followers. This book not only held its own, it may have surpassed its predicessor. The plot develops into a masterpiece of fictional brilliance, with a classic matchup between two well defined sides of good and evil. The Great hunt tells the story of the quest for &quot;good&quot; to strike a blow to the plans of the dark one's plans. Jordan tells the tale with reguard to particular detail and character development, something most contemporary authors fail to do. THe author lets us into a world solely of his creation with memorible characters and relationships. His ability to create a history for this place leaves the reader mesmorized and wanting more."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"Other reviewers have summarised the plot.My main negative criticisms fall into two parts.Although Jordan creates a rich world with an interesting history, political geography and institutions, I found too many ideas which seemed like Tolkien with knobs on... an imprisoned Dark Lord, Trollocs (orcs/trolls), the Ways (the Mines of Moria), the 'Mountains of Mist'.More seriously, the main characters are fundamentally unbelievable. Witness the conversation of the female characters which at times seems like something lifted from a 1930s schoolgirl book - \\"I've never had an adventure. I bet we won't either of us cry ourselves to sleep on an adventure\\".And the youthful characters themselves act like children in many respects - are we to believe that this group never have any sexual encounters either amongst themselves or with others, at most one character finds another to be goodlooking or attractive.The series would have been much improved by realistic characters acting and speaking like adults."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"While I enoy the series, it is no Tolkein! The stories are too long, and here in book two I'm already getting completely fed up with the interactions between the sexes. Men don't understand women, women don't understand men, all Aes Sedai are manipulative and untrustworthy.... Some good developments in the story, but as the cast of characters grows, Jordan needs a synopsis of previous stories and a much much better and more detailed Glossary. Is the Great Horn important enough to warrant a whole 700 page book? We'll have to wait and see if it ever re-appears in later books...."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"Just like the first time I read the series, I jumped straight from the first novel to the second, and understood how the series changed. In retrospect it can be difficult to look at the details and see how this story is different in scope from the first - Rand and the other Emond Fielders set out on a journey that takes them halfway across the known world, exposing them to dangers small and large, social and mortal, along the way. The parties are split, as they were before, and wind up with reconnecting paths. Stepping back, however, we see the larger picture of a story slowing down, biting off a smaller chunk to chew more thoroughly. Where the first story introduced -everything-, cramming in so many new people and cultures and factions and enemies that we couldn't help but empathize with the small-town town heroes staring at the world around them with saucer eyes, in this story there is very little that is actually -new-, but what has already been hinted at is fleshed out. The Aiel were vague before, now they begin to become concrete. The Ogier were seen only through the lens of the uncharacteristic Loial before, and now we see them in their natural habitat. Even the Forsaken are a bit more well-rounded this time around.So, The Good: Above all else, Robert Jordan gives you someone to care about with his characters. So you may not be the Rand type, and I don't know who is the Mat type, but there's always Perrin, or Nynaeve and Lan, or Min to keep you moving along. The stories are huge - three to four times the length of your typical novel - but they read quickly because they are so engrossing. Unlike many less mature fantasy stories, there are -both- black and white and shades of gray - good and evil mingled with different points of view. The Seanchan may be the biggest threat, but can they really be called evil? The one point of view we get from within the Children of Light, easily the most despicable group in the stories, is very empathetic and yet totally committed to the Children. The story is pulpy, yet not single-dimensional. It deserves its length.The Bad: The final battle feels like it was trying to build up to so much more than it was. How underwhelming were the Heroes of the Horn? While I like the new Seanchan, it feels like so much less new was introduced compared to the first book. The \\"sense of wonder\\" that so characterized the first book is missing.The Takeaway: There's no excuse to leave the series yet, and still plenty of reason to stay. Even if it's not a thousand pages of rubbernecking, in The Great Hunt the characters and themes mature in consistent, but not necessarily predictable ways. Two down, twelve more to go."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"I won't say too much on the content of the book, it's been thoroughly covered. I've enjoyed this series. It's fantastic for road trips. The seller did a great job of packaging and shipping the product in a timely manner. My disappointment lies with the packaging of the CD's from the manufacturer. They are in a cardboard type sleeve which I believe allows the CD's to become scratched during shipping. I have purchased the first two books in this series from two different retailers and both have skipped right out of the box. In my opinion it's not too bad but it is annoying to buy a brand new product that has flaws. For me it won't prevent future purchases, I'm eagerly awaiting my next road trip!"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"Robert Jordan is an excellent author and having unabridged audio cds of his stories are great.

I started the series when my school libarian recommended the first book, Eye of the World, to me. I loved it, but after finishing the second book in the series called The Great Hunt, i started wondering about a few things. First off, where did the big bad guy, Ba'alzamon, come from? The way the the first book explains it he just popped out of thin air. And how did Min, the foreteller, suddenly change her behavior big time from being the freaky worker at the inn in Baerlon in the first book to being the light, sensitive character in the second? And finally, where the heck did Selene come from?! She's just like Ba'alzamon popping out of nowhere!

Mr. Jordan has done very well on this one. In the first one Rand and his crew are being chased by trollocs and darkfriends and such. Now in this book Rand, Mat, Perrin, and some Shienarans are following the horn of Valere and and the shador logath dagger. (the one Mat is attached to, but it was stolen) If you are a fan of the fantasy genre you will absolutely love this book and the rest of the series. Good job Mr. Jordan I can't wait to read the rest of your books!"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"As with the other books in this series, I am addressing each book as it stands, not taking into account the whole series. This second book, in my opinion, is a actually better than the first. Character developement has reached a point where it is much easier to track the exploits and tribulations of each of the many, many characters Mr. Jordan has introduced. The story line continues to be solid. As with the first book, this continues to be a very complex work and you cannot just flit your way through it. I did read a couple of other reviewers who felt that Jordan's writing was somewhat juvenile. I might suggets those reviewers go back and take a second look. So much is in they eye of the beholder. I should be able to write like Jordan...sigh. Again, after well over fourty years of reading this particular genre, I feel this is some of the best. It may not be my favorite, but it is good. As to the rest of the series...well we shall see. I highly recommend this one."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"I've always loved the 'Wheel of Time' series. It was one of the first series I ever started reading and I was in love with it from page one. This second book is a great edition to the series. It's not quite as fast paced as the first book, but it's because it's evolving the characters and expanding the world.I'll add for the sake of fairness that some people have a problem with the series, because they feel it's a rip off of Tolkien. I don't believe this is true. At most, there is a nod to Tolkien, but even the things that people say it has in common aren't unique to Tolkien and Jordan. Also, with comparisons of things like the dark riders and fades. They are similar only in that they are bad guys wearing dark cloaks and they are supernatural. After that the differences end.I'll admit to anyone that I read WOT first and may be more biased toward it than Tolkien. However, I ,enjoyed and felt much more engaged with WOT than LOTR. I found the characters more realistic, believable, and relatable. For anyone who still isn't convinced and think it's a rip off of Tolkien. Who cares, don't you want more of what you love. How many people watch comedy movie after comedy movie that has the same exact kind of story line. Just read and enjoy."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"After the eye of the world, while this was a devouring read, it was also lacking. Next to the complexity and nuance of character and depth of plot in the eye of the world I found the great hunt not nearly as satisfactory for a number of reasons. One, is that it contained an element of inflation. Characters who, a few months prior were no-nothing novices, albeit with deep inherent wisdom, become powerful heroes. Rand is now a swordmaster, timetraveling, Dragon. Neyneve is a elemental wielding Aesedai. Second, the lack of trust/intimacy/communication between characters is frustrating and rather unbelievable. Perrin still shares with no one about his wolf skills. Rand is generally contracted. This basic lack of trust, while somewhat plausible, drags down the narrative into an individualistic journey of psychologically closed down characters. Thirdly, there is an unnecessary degree of violence and bloodshed. Eating children, driving stakes through eyes, and skinning alive captives - is an over the top gruesome addition to this sequel. While I am all for bloodshed and evil in dark characters it seems to me that Jordan pushes the edge where it is not needed, creating a kind of horror-fantasy genre that I am sure will only deepen in the preceding volumes. The fourth is that a degree of mystery of certain characters, Lan and Moraine in particular, is betrayed in that there are multiple chapters where you see into their thought and actions. I like this on the one hand, yet on the other, the seeing in lacked the depth and nuance that I would have imagined from reading the Eye. All these critiques aside, I could not put it down. He strings chapters together in such a way that five chapters might be a continuous thread of plot. Also, the use of magic and the beings that are introduced are deeply captivating. All in all Jordan has created an impressively complex and nuanced world that I have to laud him for. Just don't expect it to be nearly as good as the first."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"This is a good fantasy adventure, though sections are repetive.

Great plot and characters and very well written. Such a pleasure to read it. Will be looking forward to reading the whole saga.The Great Hunt: Book Two of 'The Wheel of Time'"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"4.5 stars.I read and reviewed The Eye of the World a few weeks ago. I had mixed feelings about it mostly because it was plodding and dull in large stretches of the book, though the idea itself was interesting and the characters compelling. But regardless of my lukewarm impression, I decided to give The Great Hunt a go and see if it was any better. I'm glad I gave it that chance, because it was better, tenfold.The Great Hunt sees Rand al'Thor, recently revealed to be the Dragon Reborn , trying to escape the grasp of the Aes Sedai, a group of women who possess the magical ability to wield the One Power. Rand wants nothing to do with his destiny, which claims that he will destroy the world. He hides the truth from his best friends Mat and Perrin, but when the Horn of Valere is stolen from the Aes Sedai, The Great Hunt begins, and Rand and his friends and allies find themselves on a desperate race to find it before it falls into the hands of evil.I found this to be a much more interesting plot. It was fast-paced and packed with details which made the characters more engaging. I particularly appreciated that so many of the chapters were in the point of view of Rand. He has grown into quite the able protagonist, and despite everything that has been thrust upon him he still keeps a level head and does not jump at the chance to use all the power that he possesses. His is a very sympathetic situation and I found myself rooting for him and hoping that he would finally accept his destiny. I also liked having a glimpse into the heads of Moiraine, the Aes Sedai, and Lan, her Warder, though those parts were all too brief, in my opinion.While some of the \\"main\\" characters were great, there were others that downright annoyed me. With Nynaeve, for example, I oscillated between liking her and wanting to reach into the pages and give her a good, hard, smack to the back of the head. She has so much pride it's a wonder no one has tried to do it in the books! There are some situations where pride is acceptable, but when it comes to being smart and knowing when to show respect for certain individuals, she has a long way to go. Mat, Rand's friend, drove me up a wall with his jealousy. Several times throughout the book I wondered why he was included as a main character and if he would turn into a Darkfriend. He is the one who will have to go through the most growth throughout the series if he is to succeed in helping defeat the Dark One.The Great Hunt also elaborates a bit more on the world that Robert Jordan has created. The exploration of the One Power, the Dark One, and Rand's role in the Wheel of Time was something that I wish had been developed more in the first book, so I was glad to see it added in more detail here. I still don't understand the concept of the Wheel of Time, per se... I don't know if it's because I'm not paying enough attention to the book or if it hasn't been revealed just yet.Overall, The Great Hunt was a great adventure, from start to finish. I can't wait to read the next book (with nervous anticipation, every bit excitement as anxiety, since I've just consigned myself to a 13+ book series!), and I hope that, like this one, it outshines its predecessor by leaps and bounds."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"The Great Hunt is book 2 in the Wheel of Time Series.This book takes place 6 weeks after the last one ended, Rand has learned his future and plans on leaving the group for fear of hurting them when he eventually will driven crazy by the One Power he can now wield.Before Rand can leave the head of the Aes Sedai arrives he summoned to her chambers thinking that he will be her pawn, but he is instead set out on his own with a party to retrieve Mat's Dagger and the horn of Valere after it is stolen and the darkfriend Paden Fain is set free to run havoc.That's all I can say without spoiling anything, but if you Read the Eye of the World, you can get more of the same filler stories that are for the most part pretty interesting. The first 200 pages are really interesting, then he has maybe 100 in the middle of stuff that will payoff later in the story, but it was just hard to get through. There was one chapter that was split between captain Doman of the Spray, that had a bit part in The Eye of the world and the other part is about the children of the light's captain. both these stories play out in the end ut they brought the momentum to the book close to a halt. The final 150 pages are so exciting and will have you wondering if some of your favorite characters will survive.The twist and turns in this book are really great, and make complete sense and don't feel forced at all.I would say I barely liked this book over the Eye of the World, the ending had me reading pages way into the night and couldn't stop til it was over."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"I have been looking for an author on par with the above mentioned, and it seems I have to keep looking.

Not only did the Darkfriend steal the Horn of Valere but he also managed to steal a cursed item that a friend has been carrying. Without that item, that friends life will slowly dwindle away.

So far it just keeps getting better. No disappointment at all from the series."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"Hmm, I'm only one book in and already some cracks are beginning to show after what was an excellent start inThe Eye of the World. This book continues right from where that one ended and features a pretty strong beginning dealing with the effects of Rand using the Power and what help/hindrance he can expect from the Aes Sedai. But soon after that the problems start. The horn that he just got back is stolen, along with the knife that Mat needs to be restored to health. Naturally Rand has to go help look for these instead of running away and evading his fate as the Dragon Reborn. All this is dealt with by chapter 10. The book concludes with Rand rescuing the girls from a race of men from across the sea who enslave Aes Sedai. This plot point starts on chapter 40. You may begin to see the problem here. In case you're wondering, yes they do spend the middle 30 chapters wandering around the woods looking for that dang horn. That and deciding which dinner invitations to turn down. Riveting.The padding in this book is unnecessary and excessive. There are over 600 pages here when the plot really only needs half that. So much of this material is a waste. At one point Loial makes a staff, which they describe in some detail, only to discard it unused two chapters later. Why? What was the point of describing that? It's not as if this material is character development either since Rand's entire arc goes 'no no, I won't be manipulated' and never really gets much further than repetitions on that theme until the very end. The first ten chapters are important. The last ten chapters are important. Why did we have to have thirty chapters of fluff in between? There's nothing there that can justify more than five or maybe ten. I understand that this only gets worse later on in the series. It must be a danger inherent in these long new fantasy series since Martin'sA Feast for CrowsandA Dance with Dragonsboth fall into this same trap: Excessive verbiage, underdeveloped plot.Another problem that was gnawing at me in the last book was the underdeveloped characters. Well here it really hits. The three Emond's Fielders are as dull as ever, and so are all their travel companions with the exception of Moiraine and Thom, both of whom merit little more than cameos. The relationship issue hits quite hard here with a full four girls competing for Rand's attention. This is made extra annoying for two reasons: 1. Rand never does anything but try and ignore it. He doesn't even reject any of them. The reason behind this is largely due to: 2. The boys and the girls spend most of the book apart. This doesn't stop the girls from constantly going on about how great Rand is, even those who only knew him for a few minutes. Rand is starting to become the most obnoxious kind of Peggy Sue character and it's really annoying. All the relationship malarchy just seems childish and while Jordan has thus far been able to cover this by continuously repeating ta'veren and the threads of fate, it's starting to wear pretty thin. I really do hope it improves in future books.So why, given the strongly negative tone of this review, do I still give the book three stars? Because the first and last ten chapters are truly excellent. The threat to Rand's soul is very real, even if it's overmentioned, and the twists of fate that bring Rand towards his destiny are fascinating. When the book is good, it's good. There can be no question. If Jordan had only managed to trim down the middle 3/5s to a manageable number then this book would earn five stars. As it is I recommend reading it with a lot of creative skimming.The story continues inThe Dragon Reborn. Hopefully (given the title) this will contain more of what made the last book so good. And maybe we'll actually get to see Rand being decisive for a change."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"The perfect follow on from book 1. The pacing and character development is very good. Looking forward to book 3 already."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"For anyone who enjoys fantasy, this series is incredibly entertaining. This book in particular really steps the pace of the series up and was a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"With book 2 of this neverending saga, Jordan continues in much the same vein as in The Eye Of The World. Some improvements are made, though at heart this is a well developed tale with less of the trade mark 2-D characters and easy resolutions that has so often dogged fantasy - for example David Eddings. Still, I would like to see some villains with greater range than the likes of the Dark One and Padan Fain. It seems that Ba'alzamon wants Rand to be converted and yet he shows little restraint in showing his contempt at Rand's every word. I don't know about you but I think that the Dark One would be much more suductive and dangerous if there actually seemed to be some advantage in joining him. To add to this, every darkfriend they encounter has gained nothing for their troubles except an untimely end. I hope that Lanfear proves to have greater depth. One other gripe are these helpful traits that all the good guys seem to have, an example being Hurrin, the &quot;sniffer&quot;. It's just a little too easy to say that he can smell the trail of violence, particularly when it's so vital to Rand's cause. However, while all that is true, we do have great inner conflict present in the main characters with a sincere look at the great burden they are carrying as a result of being so strongly linked to the Pattern. In essense, the main protagonists and the handling of plot revelations are what drive this series, giving it the necessary epic qualities that Jordan is no doubt striving for. 4.5 stars."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"WOW! Is all I can say about this book. I finished it in basically 2 days despite it's size. I also got no sleep in the process.The pace of the books makes it's size a small matter. It is full of action and new twist and turns that will keep you glued to the pages until you turn the last one.I loved seeing more about the Oiger and the steddings. We got to travel the Ways once again..with a twist. Were introduced to the Black Ajah and to a new/old enemy. I also loved the twist of the Seanchan and I can see Jorden weaving thread for further books. I also loved the Stones....the exalinations of the worlds that &quot;could be&quot; and Rand and the others'experience with it were gripping. It kept me ver yinterested from start to finish..that is all I ask for in a book.I liked that we got to see a little more about Lan and the Morigaine's relationship...I'm very interested now how they will be affected by all of this. I got to more of Min..which is a character I love. More Perrin...always great. And we got more about the inner workings of the White Tower. And thebest was the introduction of a new hunter...Rand better watch out..I knew that woman was trouble.But my absolute favorite part of the book was the ended. It just does not get better than that (so far..I've only read up to part 3). That ending will stay with me for a while.Complaints: ONce again...what's up with Mat?

I have bad omens.Rand's women:...Rand must have some serious charm for all these women to be dreaming if him like this. Sheesh.

In this book the glimmerings of a great story unfolds into a fantastic mesmerising web of plots. It is rare to see such a great number of plots where each thread of the story keeps you waiting on the edge of your chair (or bed). Don't read this series if you have major school or work committments, you may regret it since there are seven books each averaging around 700 pages and it's a one way street. The start of chapter one in every book bears the &quot;Eye of the World&quot; trademark where Jordan follows the wind into the scene of the plot in prose that reads like poetry (or is it visa versa?) The characters are full of wit and lend to a vivid story as only a master could write. If you like predictable plots then don't read this book. The great hunt is full of great creative twists (perhaps more so than the other books in the series)Somehow everything weaves into a grand finale at the end of the book while it still leaves you hanging for the next book leaving you with withdrawal syndrome when you are done.The soft-covers are flimsy and often come off, perhaps because the books are so thick. Its best to buy the hard-covers instead.Although its hard to compare great fantasy novels (by definition each will be great but different), I found the Amber series by Zelazny, Earthsea series by Le Guin, Magician series by Feist, Glen Cook's Black Company and Hyperion by Simmons as great works of Fantasy and Science Fiction. We can't leave Tolkein out of this list of course.-Shahin M. Movafagh (shahinm@primenet.com or shahinm@rocketmail.com)"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"&quot;The Great Hunt,&quot; volume 2 of Jordan's huge Wheel of Time series, is better than the 1st book, &quot;The Eye of the World.&quot; Jordan gets off to a great start by filling in a lot of information about characters and bits of story he left the reader wondering about in the first book. He also garners praise for making good use of parallel universes in this book.Well, Jordan made good use of it until the disappointing exit from that universe. The hero, Rand, is often dumb as a brick in this book, and that ultimately leads to a slow and frustrating middle section of the book.There are no heroics in this book, and no grandeur. The Great Hunt is nowhere to be seen, being rather a plodding, somewhat boring hunt between just a few characters. Jordan never takes us to Illian in this book--the site of the Hunt's origin--and the scope of the book is not broadened by any new characters until the latter half of the book. Rand and Loial finish the first part of their &quot;hunt&quot; with a completely ludicrous scene (SPOILER) where they sneak into the Trolloc/Darkfriend camp and simply grab the Horn and Ruby dagger and run (and get away with it!). This is one of the least believable scenes I have ever read, and suggests a recurring flaw in Jordan's writing; he seems incapable of putting a satisfying finish to his stories and subplots.Jordan does provide some interest with the Seanchan, a cold-hearted and viscous people that have invaded Toman Head. We are lead to believe that they might be the descendents of Artur Hawkwing's armies come back to &quot;retake what was theirs.&quot; Jordan surprisingly takes much of the mystery out of this, and other areas of suspense (such as who Selene is), by providing answers in the book's glossary.Then comes the big ending, with the rather improbably concurrence of events that bring it to fruition. What a disappointment this ending is, a huge magic-saves-the-day groaner. Jordan does provide a reasonably good build-up with good story elements that could have made this ending great. (SPOILERS here to end) The Horn is finally blown, the heroes of the past arrive, and: no ceremony, no heroics (even with all the revived heroes around!), no chills, no thrills, no mystery.Everything is left up to Rand, and the story completely focuses on him: the dead heroes have no use in helping him fight Ba'alzamon. They do help drive the Seanchan off Toman Head, but Jordan spends almost no time on this part of the battle. Since the Seanchan are the descendents of Artur Hawkwing, who is now present and fighting them, Jordan has a great plot element to work with. Absolutely nothing is mentioned about this, or other possible plot elements that the reader would expect to expand the scope of the story.Very quickly, for such a long build up to it, Rand and company win. But, similar to the end of the first book, Ba'alzamon seems to undertake no negative effects from losing. This is a very flat and unexciting ending. Once again, Jordan seems incapable of finishing off his story properly, with real suspense or surprise or mystery to satisfy the reader.A third of the way through the third book, &quot;The Dragon Reborn,&quot; there is no help to prop up the collapse at the end of &quot;The Great Hunt.&quot; The story simply continues as if almost nothing had happened. This is a good time to quit this series, and find another author than can write satisfying endings to her/his books."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"Sometimes a hit isn't as good as the second time around. Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series debuted in the slow, ponderous \\"Eye of the World.\\" The follow-up is a bit better, with a slightly better plot and some Machievellian intrigues, but Jordan's mediocre writing and glacial pace turn it into another pulpy mess.Rand and company have arrived at the home of the Aes Sedai, the female sorceresses who now hold his fate in their collective hands -- because he can do magic, albeit by accident, they might \\"gentle\\" him. What he doesn't know is that Moraine and the Aes Sedai leader, the Amyrlin, are secretly plotting to keep him safe -- because they suspect he is the Dragon Reborn.All the Aes Sedai intrigues are interrupted when the stronghold is invaded by trollocs and a Myrdraal -- and a message for Rand is scrawled on the wall in blood. Turns out that they were stealing the legendary Horn of Valere, which can raise dead heroes. So Rand and his friends -- including Mat, whose life is bound to a stolen dagger -- go out in search of the horn.Robert Jordan's books are slow. Really slow. Incredibly slow -- the hero, Rand, spends a hundred pages fretting about something that never happens. He spends an entire chapter getting dressed. Long books -- Dosteyevsky, Tolkien -- are often good things, richly nuanced and full of intricate plotting. But Jordan just seems to be describing everything in detail.The plot itself has promise -- the action scenes tend to be swift, gritty and tense; the idea of a stolen horn that can raise the dead is an intriguing one. But between it is endless pages of quibbling and personal tics, as well as dozens of minor characters who have no bearing on the plot. For example, Jordan introduces countless Aes Sedai, but only two other than Moraine have any plot purpose.Sadly, Jordan's writing isn't up to the challenge -- he reads like a second-rate pulp writer. The force of ultimate evil is called Shai'tan (can't he come up with a better name?), and just stops short of cackling out loud. The characters all interact by flirting or bickering, usually with women expressing disdain for the men. Jordan devotes a great deal of attention to the jewelry and clothing of the characters, even devoting a paragraph to a piece of Moraine's jewelry.The characters are more like a collection of tics and personality flaws than actual people -- Rand spends all his time worrying, but breaks out long enough to be a hero. Nynaeve and Egwene pull their hair and snipe, while Perrin feels inferior and Mat flirts. Of all the characters, Moraine is the only one who comes across as a person, especially since she keeps most of her plans to herself.\\"The Great Hunt\\" is one of those fantasy books that could have been quite good if about three hundred pages had been whittled out of it. As it is, it's merely a sloppy book with second-rate writing."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"I loved &quot;The Eye of the World,&quot; and I continued to read The Wheel of Time series with &quot;The Great Hunt.&quot; I was scepticle at first, it would be hard to follow up The Eye of World, but I still read it, and I was surprised by how pleased I was. The book starts out with the Amrylin Seat riding in to Fal Dara, and Rand tries to excape her. The story is quite interesting despite my opinions before I read it. Yes, Jordan can blab on and on about things, and when other authors do that than the turns out to have little plot and uninteresting. But when Jordan goes on and on, you really enjoy what he's saying bacause the world that he created in the Wheel of Time series, is an excellent world, and the people and characters are fascinating.There aren't many new characters popping up in this book. Rather Jordan tries to develop most of the previous known characters. The character development doesn't really change the way you think about a character, or it doesn't change their moods, it simply molds all of the characters, fleshes them out. Loial, the Ogier, is getting a lot neater in this book, he's very fun to read about. You can always relate to what Rand is thinking, he is probably my favorite. Mat, is very pleasing, because of his funny character. Also, the evil Aes Sedia, Liandrin, was quite fun to read about.The ending was probably the best part of the book. The action is very well-written (everything is well written in The Wheel of Time series). The duel with The Dark One and Rand was the best duel from the first two books. I strongly suggest anyone who likes fantasy to try The Wheel of Time series, but start with the first book, The Eye of The World.

Now I'm glad I did. The Wheel of Time-series is the best books I've ever read! They capture you from the first page to the last, and it doesn't matter that they're very long, it only keeps you in the wondeful world of Rand, Mat, Perrin and the others for a little longer.

It is everything a good book should be: exciting, interesting... I'm amazed that Jordan can keep track of all his characters! I won't say anything about the plot; it's useless, because you have to read &quot;The Eye of the World&quot; before you read this, otherwise you won't understand a thing.

The writing is tighter, the balance is better (although still geared towards Rand; from here on out, though, no one gets more than 20%), the characters are better fleshed out, and the whole series gets a lot more epic. So why don't I like it as much?Rand and Moiraine doing things that irk me. And when these are some of my favorite characters in the series or indeed, in modern literature, that's a mark against it. It's not out of character, and it's even understandable, so this is pure emotion, but it still rubs me the wrong way. Moiraine is trying to manipulate Rand. Rand is doing the typical \\"It's Not You, It's My Enemies\\" bit that is SOO cliche (even though he has a better reason than most, what with the insanity and unstoppable power surges).And then of course there's Selene. I'd like to say I knew who she was on first reading, but honestly I don't recall; I DO remember thinking \\"ten miles of bad road!\\" Rand does get thrust into a wider world in this volume, dealing not only with the Power, but also as a leader and getting exposed to the political labyrinth of Cairhien.Now, the part that I really hate is paradoxically the part that makes it good. I mean everyone's least favorite imperialists, the Seanchan. This part actually held me up for weeks on this reread, because I didn't want to go through it again, even knowing how things turn out. That's a pretty good sign of emotional connection and character empathy, as well as being the perfect way to shut up Tuon fans. And then the battle at Falme, where I had to pause on each page because \\"THAT IS JUST SO DAMN COOL!\\"We are introduced to several characters who we'll see later, such as Siuan, Verin, and Birgitte, constituting three different flavors of awesomesauce. We also get more Min (yay!)...including a POV chapter (YAY!). Which is good, because we won't see much of her in 3, 4, or 5 (boo!). We also get the best scene in the series so far, the Portal Stone episode, which...wow. That chapter alone is enough to establish Jordan's rep as one of the best voices in epic fantasy.Still great, still reading, can't wait to continue my reread and anxious to get the last volume next year."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"What more can be said? Destined to be a classic series with a swiftly growing audiance as the years go by, Robert Jordan has once again delivered a stunning epic that is even better than its predescessor.The book is slow in places, but never lacks in literacy value. The gradual build-up during the last 100+ pages or so climaxing with the battle at Fal Dara in the end (which includes Rand's own battle) is masterful and keeps you on the edge of your seat.The Eye of the World is great, the Great Hunt is incredible. The coolest thing about Robert Jordan's writing is his ability to give new life to sometimes cliche plots. I am a BIG-TIME fantasy buff, and I like to read original works, but I'll read Jordan's &quot;cliches&quot; any time. He seems to love to keep the reader excited that he knows where the story is going (becuase he's read it all before), and then pull out the rug from under him by offering a unique twist.In the Great Hunt we have Rand and co. chasing after Padan Fain who has presumably stolen the Horn that will ressurect dead heroes. Many chilling and graphic scenes of death throughout the hunt for the Fain, some extremely disturbing, but great for the plot.In &quot;Hunt&quot; Rand's own battle against the temptations of Ba'alzamon escalade, and he continues to have nightmarish &quot;dreams&quot; involving the hellish demonic force. How he combats against this evil is always enthralling, and the character developement is excellent! You can really see Rand maturing through this book.As always the subplots are good as well, sometimes even better than the main story, but Jordan weaves them all together eventually, and the climax in &quot;Hunt&quot; is truly fulfilling.Trust me, this book is worth the 28 bucks in hardback. But of course, if you're cheap like me &lt;grin&gt;, then the $7 paperback is fine, too.Happy reading!-----------------Samuel Van Eerden"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"The Great Hunt is a masterful sequel to The Eye of the World. The plot never slows in this novel. I am honestly amazed by the difference between Jordan's first novels and his latter ones. He still shifts between multiple plots, but people can still see how they are connected. Egwene and Nyn leave the White Tower, but they are still involved with what happens to Rand. What also makes this novel better than some of the later ones is that you can pick this book up and read it without reading the first one. Somethings may not be clear, but you will still enjoy a good novel.What happens. Rand feels abandoned by Moraine in Fal Dara and resolves to leave without his friends. He makes it as far as the stable before he learns he cannot leave. While he is trapped in the city, trollocs storm the keep; Mat's dagger and the horn of Valere are stolen. With's Mat's need and the knowledge that the followers of the horn will follow whoever blows it, Rand joins the chase for the horn. Egwene and Nyn are off to the White Tower, but after three months are off on their own adventure. The chase for the horn covers multiple countries and starts and finishes wars. But in the end it is Rand versus the Dark One for the lives of his friends.I cannot do justice to the action or excitement of this novel. I have read it recently and encourage you to buy this novel, because like me, you will probably read it more than once."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"For those of us who have read Jordan's Wheel of Time series to date, this volume takes us back to the days when the story was fresh and new, the characters interesting and vibrant, and the story not mired in an attempt to produce an Epic and more than likely to generate massive sales revenues by stretching the conlusion out as long as possible.In this installment, Rand al Thor, a boy with the power to channel the five elements and destined to go mad as a result, is resisting his destiny to become the Dragon Reborn, the savior of the world who must also \\"break\\" it. Moraine Sedai, a trained adept of the white tower with the ability to channel the \\"safe\\" (from madness, at least) female half of the power, still struggles to shape Rand into the tool she ultimately hopes will save the world. Her plan is simply to MAKE Rand the Dragon by having him fulfill various points of the prophesy of the Dragon Reborn in a purely contrived fashion. One of those is the recovery of the Horn of Valere, which will summon the archetypical heroes of legend to the aid of the one who sounds it. As an aside, Matt, the rogueish, probably least interesting character (in the early days at least) in the series has lost possession of the dagger which infected him with the dark spirit of Shadar Logoth, doomed city of the dead, and must recover it or die."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"After the entrancing Eye of the World, we come to the equally enthralling Great Hunt. After the Eye of the World was broken and the Horn of Valere discovered inside, Rand and his companions rest in Fal Dara, only to have the horn stolen from the keep by the crazed Padain Fain. The group splits, with a party chasing hot on Fain's heels and another going back to the White Tawer of Tar Valon. I give it a poor telling however, though no matter how much is said on all these reviews somehing will be left out.In TGH the Emond's Fielders aren't completely the trusting bumpkins they once were, they start to see things more as they are then how they're portrayed. The writing is equally grand as it was in Eye of the World with the believable world and events. Even the magic system stands most critics abuse because it's been well thought out. One of the few things I was malcontent with was the ending which seemed too much alike the ending in Eye of the World and the world map. All in all this had it's faults but not enough to drop it a star."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"I must say, this book is absolutely breathtaking. This particular volume seemed to get out of the rampant gender politics plaguing TEOTW, and focused more on the characters as individual people.The settings are hypnotic, and the level of characterization is such that you feel like you've known these people for ages, maybe identify with some of them. I, for one, could not resist reading Verin Sedai's lines aloud to get the perfect effect of her character (hey, I can dream of portraying her in a WoT movie, can't I??). This series is developing into quite the escape from reality...maybe making an alternate reality. History is tangible here, from Seanchan to the Horn to Artur Hawkwing and his armies.Again, I urge nonfiction addicts who have never touched fiction in their lives to take note. This series reads like a third-person biography, and is ten times as addictive."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"The Great Hunt is a sequel to the Eye of the World. If you have not read the first book you will probably be lost, but it will still be a good read because the plot has not developed far by the end of the first book. This book is better than the first because the plot is developing. There is more action and we learn more about the characters lives. Jordan continues to create bonds between characters and readers. I have read this book twice, and each time I have been unable to stop thinking about. Once I finished it, I had to start the Dragon Reborn the same day. If you are thinking about buying this book, my recomendation is to buy The Great Hunt and The Dragon Reborn."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"If you are looking at this review, you are probably at least somewhat interested in reading this book (or the entire series).

You are familiar with the characters, and the adventure in the story is simply great, without sacrificing small details that bring a world to life. This is one of the books in which I judge all other fantasy books by. In these early books, Rand is a awesome character to read about, and the Battle of Falme was truly one of the best parts of the entire series. Read this!"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"This book, like the other books in the series, is fantastic! Robert Jordan beatifully illustrates all of his characters and the world they live in. If you thought that nothing could ever beat &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; then your wrong! This book continues the story of Rand al'Thor and his friends: Perrin Aybara and Mat(Matrim) Cauthon. In this book, Rand and his friends are involved in an interestng plot. The Horn of Valere, which brings the heroes of old back to life to fight against the shadow, has been found and it is stolen by Trollocs. The reader is caught up in a series of battles where the horn is stolen and then retrieved. If you want to learn more, then I suggest you get this book!

Keep it up, Jordan!"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"This book was even better than the Eye of the World. I absoluty loved it! The only bad thing about it was the cover ( I mean, Loial is 4 feet tall, the Trollocs are men with weird helmets, Selene is wearing a dress that has spandex, there is no box for the Horn, etc.), but what counts about a book is what is between the covers, right?"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"These books are outstanding! The Eye of the World was great and following was the hypnotic Great Hunt. Robert Jordan takes you to a place of unbelievable imagery with all the detail included.

Great storyline and characters.. once you start you will want more and more."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"I love Jordan's writing... he is the master of characterization. How can you not like Perrin, Rand, and Mat? The story behind the great hunt for the Horn of Valere is awsome, and it seems stretched until you actually get to the end of the book."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"If you thought Eye of the World was good, you won't be able to put this one down. This book picks up where the surprisingly slow EotW leaves off. Making all the main characters face some of their greatest fears. The trollocs still bug me though, with their unrelenting creatvielessness. Ooh! Let's combine a troll and an orc and put an eagle's beak and goat hooves on him! RJ, you screwed up with that little creation, but I still love ya'. If you can deal with that you can survive the book!"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"I love the capability to read and write these reviews! In The Great Hunt, our heroes Rand, Mat and Perrin, and heroines Egwene, Elayne, Min and Nynaeve, begin to understand that their lives are not meant to be simple or uncomplicated. Reluctant as they may be, they are central to the outcome of the great struggle between good and evil. Many others are working to help or hinder them. The story disperses them across the country, across dimensions, across time and many possible lives. They learn some hard lessons about themselves. When finally they come back together it's in a climactic episode that throws in everything but the kitchen sink. Irresistible reading. And it gets better!"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"I am not a fantasy reader....I had read Stephen King's \\"Dark Tower\\" series, and a friend at work recommended \\"Wheel of Time\\". I have to say, I really enjoyed the first book \\"Eye of the World\\". The way the story developed and the characters was fascinating and I was sucked in. About halfway through this second book things.....began....to....slow...way....down. I don't know if I am just tired of following of the same story or if Jordan's writing pace is just wearing me down. I enjoy in depth character studies....but usually only when it pertains to characters who will be focused on throughout the story, Jordan seems to give even the bit players a lengthy description. Also, I am beginning to suspect that almost any storyline involving the main characters; Perrin, Mat, Rand, Loial etc..are beginning to lose the tension the first book held because I don't think Jordan will let any real harm come to them in these first few books. So, when Mat's life seems in danger midway through the book, I don't feel the urgent need to read on because I already know he will survive. I don't know how...just that Jordan doesn't seem willing to kill off one of his main characters. Also, I hope that Jordan will begin to populate his novels with average looking or ugly people. So far everyone who happens along is exceedingly beautiful or strikingly handsome. I was kind of hoping Rand would be described as looking like Clint Howard just to balance things off. Still this isn't a bad book, but I don't think it lives up to the promise of the \\"Eye of the World\\". The action and climax of this book is very good once you get there, but be warned, you don't want to start this series here, you would be completely lost."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"TGH is a step and above the first book in the Wheel of Time series. The pacing is much better and the characters receive much more development. IMO, the Seanchan were an interesting touch, and learning more about the curious Ogier gave more depth to Loial, one of my favorite characters. The climactic battle involving the Seanchan, the Whitecloaks, the heroes summoned by the horn, as well as Rand and Ba'alzamon was amazing. in fact I could clearly visualize it in my mind. On to Dragon Reborn!"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"This is one of Jordan's best books, in my opinion. The pacing is excellent (one of the few flaws of EotW), and the climactic battle was absolutely beautiful. Getting a closer look at the Ogier was a real treat, especially since Loial is one of my favorite characters. Having a glossary at the back that included new names was very helpful. Now, on to Dragon Reborn."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"With &quot;The Eye of the World&quot; tucked under his belt, Jordan had the fan base, the financial and critical success, and the foundation he needed as encouragement to make this series what he wants it to be: and with &quot;The Great Hunt,&quot; he starts to spread his wings a little. This continues the habit of &quot;Eye&quot; of rambling over the lush world that he has created, giving each nation, each people a sharply distinct set of personalities, characteristics, even accents: what other series of books do you know of where you can immediately place the nationality of a character simply by the speech patterns of their first line of dialogue, or the cut and color of their clothes?Jordan doesn't hesitate to ratchet the action up a notch here, either. The book has more of an adventurous feel to it, whereas the first maintained a sort of cool nervousness about the whole thing (actually a clever literary device to keep you sympathetic to, and connected with, the main characters).Overall this is better than &quot;Eye,&quot; not quite as good as &quot;Dragon,&quot; but still worthy of five stars."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"This book has some really good (male) characters but is marred by an overall agonizingly slow plot and annoying females. I'm not looking for constant action but after a time people need to shut up and move on."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"&quot;The Great Hunt&quot; is an excellent book. It is one of the books that you can simply read from beginning to end because all the point of views wrap up what they were working on by the end of the book (unlike in later books).This book is pure entertainment and we see some of the characters development greatly. There are some classic scenes throughout the book that I read over and over again.This book is well worth the read because it is relatively short, and it flows very well. This book is my favorite of the series so far."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"While the end of the book and the beginning are rather good, you as a reader should look forward to a long and boring mid section of this novel. It rambles on and on about detail and things that have little if no action.For a period of a few months I quit reading this book because the fourty or fifty page sections with the three women characters were so boring that I felt like I was wasting my time.So I warn you... if you are willing to fight through the boring sections with the women characters then I suggest reading this book, its ending is worth the wait."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"This book is a really well written book that I thouroughly enjoyed. At times it did get a bit dry, but when you did come to a good part it was fantastic. The characters after a while, feel like your best friends like you've known them forever. It is a great book for someone who is into a really long book, but for the people (kids) out there who want a good book that will hold your attention every minute that does have end this is not a book for you, ... may I recommend Tamora Pierce."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"and I find myself to be weak, very weak.I recently picked up The Eye of the World for the second time, and swore to myself I would read it slowly and thoroughly. I lied. Two days (school days, mind) later I had finished it and picked up The Great Hunt, also for the second time.It was much better than I remember it, and I infact, finished it only seconds ago. Chills are still going through me, and even though I know what will happen, I ask myself over and over again, what DID Rand decide?I feel a deep Longing, and though I do not have a stedding tocall home, I feel my Longings will not be quenched until I can find The Dragon Reborn again.Peace favor your sword, may the Light shine on you, and my you shelter in the palm of the Creator's hand."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"Much like Eye of the World, The Great Hunt's success lies in its characters and Jordan's uncanny ability to create tense and interesting situations for them. Also like TEOTW, the resolutions occationally feel a bit too easy - a common symptom of fantasy - and I feel it's not enough to simply say that the 3 men are ta'veern. One such example is the presense of characters with unusual 'gifts', such as Hurin's ability to sniff out danger. This comes across as awfully convenient for Rand and the others even though this is a world of magic and legend. The Dark One also appears overly simple and unsubtle, thus far, wishing to convert Rand yet not offering him anything truely seductive. Hopefully, Lanfear will prove more interesting as her character is fleshed out in later books. Even with these cons, I can't help but like Robert Jordan's style and pace - particularly the internal struggles of the main characters as they try to cope with their ever worsening situations (eg. the idea of the damane) - as well as all the loose threads he manages to handle effectivley. Combined with the grand scale of the unfolding events, The Great Hunt achieves the epic quality that Jordan is no doubt aiming for."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"Thus far, I have only read Books 1 and 2 of the WoT series. I'm sure we've all heard of how the series is starting to &quot;suck it up.&quot;I think liking this book (and this series) depends wholly on what the reader has geared him/herself toward. Some people claim to be &quot;spoiled&quot; by Martin's Ice and Fire series, I thought of it as a political intrigue more than an epic fantasy tale. I like to think of myself as someone who enjoys Fantasy that shares a likeness to Lord of the Rings, Narnia, Earthsea. Anyone who has those same tastes should do well to pick up the first two Wheel of Times Books, as they are choked with classic fantasy elements. (one could also call this &quot;borrowing ideas&quot;)Onto the review. Book 2 leaves off not long after Book 1. Everyone is getting ready to go their own way and pursue their own thoughts when &quot;The Horn&quot; (from the end of the first book) is stolen away. So begins the pursuit to regain what is lost.Without spoiling anything, this one has plenty of surprises, mysteries, excitement. With that, comes its fair share of disappointments. The main thing that really gets me with WoT thus far is how restrained Jordan makes his characters. They can whine, bicker, moan, and threaten death upon each other, but when the time comes for actual vengeance, things tend to not go that far.Let's say someone has ruined your life, killed your friends, your family, burned your house down, captured and tortured you to near death. You finally escape, and get ready to send them to the next world, when someone steps in and says &quot;Don't do it, don't stoop to their level!&quot; What do you do? Jordan likes to put his characters into these kinds of situations, and has them back out of doing the actual deed. This annoyed me to no end, as it's (in my opinion) completely out of character for anyone put into the kinds of situations they're put in.Well, that aside, this is very entertaining as far as classic fantasy is concerned. As soon as I can find a copy of The Dragon Reborn (Book 3) I'll be picking that up and reading it."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"After having read most of the 1000 reviews of &quot;Eye of the World&quot; I can say that many of the negatives are laid to rest with &quot;The Great Hunt&quot;:1) The Tolkien factor: Yes, there were many similarities in Book 1. I never felt that way in &quot;The Great Hunt.&quot; There are no Seanchan in LOTR2) The no action factor: Many complained about the slow middle section of EOTW. There is much more happening in this book. It is not simply a chase from town to town. Even when Rand and company spend a good deal of time in Cairhien, it seems like this will be developed in future books. As an aside, even some of the incidental characters Rand and Mat met in EOTW come vack in The Great Hunt. farmer's daughter Else Grinwell even reappears in a very minor role. The ending is just chilling -- I had to read it a few times.3) To many unanswered questions from Book 1 -- many of those unanswered plot points from Book 1 are resolved or at least developed in Book 2. To be fair, there are many loose ends in this book as well -- I HOPE Jordan returns to some of these in future books (I have not read Dragon Reborn yet).4) Crummy villains -- The villains IN EOTW were mostly Tolkine retreads and not all that great. We are introduced to several new villains in Great Hunt including the Seanchan and their damanes. the Black Ajah and more is learned about the Forsaken.OK, there were still some confusing issues. If you don't want to read a Spolier go no further. I'm still wondering what the motivation was of the Whitecloaks through this book -- why were they advancing on Toman Head. 2) Who let Padan Fain out of his cell? 3) Who were all the people in the Prologue? I know who several of them turned out to be but not all."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"I've looked over both rave reviews &amp; hate reviews before starting mine. Personally, I feel that the series hits a good stride here. The first book was a better than adequate introduction to the characters and the basic story line. Now, this second book takes us deeper into the mythology and develops some of the minor characters from the first book along with a few new ones.I enjoyed this one better. While the middle of the first book subjected us to a long trek with repetitious happenings and dreams along the way, the middle of this one keeps going with the differently developing threads between the female characters and the males on the hunt.The ending did make me hungrier for the next book in the series."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"\\"Tia mi aven Moridin isainde vadin.\\" Thus it is written on the Horn of Valere, meaning \\"The grave is no bar to my call.\\" For hundreds of years, storytellers have told the legendary tale of the Great Hunt of the Horn of Valere.

I also love the way he has created a whole other world. Again two thumbs up, this book rocks"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"The second book in the Wheel of Time series is an enjoyable sequel, even if it is a little bit short of the first book's greatness. The story takes place where the first book left off--in Fal Dara, near the Blight. Moiraine and Lan don't have quite the roles as they did in the first book. In fact, they only make about two appearances. But in a way that prevents redundancy, which is good. So if you think that the second book is a rehash of the first, you're wrong. Instead of the bad guys chasing the good guys the tables have turned so that the good guys are after the bad guys--with a few exceptions. This book sticks with the same winning cast of characters that the first book had, but occasionally adding a few more characters along the way. If you get confused as to who's who, there's a glossary in the back. New lands are reached in this book, so get those red pens ready so you can mark where they go. There is one part toward's the beginning of the book that may be very confusing to some people, as it was to me the first few times. But now I can explain it. Know the part where Rand is in the village and has 3 visions, all of them almost exactly alike (same wording and all)? No, Mr. Jordan was not out of his mind when he did that. There is some symbolism in there if you can find it. Think of the number 6. In each scene, a 6 is mentioned. Put three of them together and you get 666--the sign of the beast. Why RJ did that is beyond me, but that's my way of seeing it. One of my favorite parts of this book--and the series--is when one of the characters has a vision about what would have happened if they had NOT left Emond's Field. I won't tell you anything about it, because it is definitely worth reading several times. That part alone adds an extra dimension to the work in that it justifies what the character's are doing. The last battle at the end of the book also has some symbolism. Think Moses and his raised rod while the Israelites are fighting and you'll probably figure it out. Overall, this is a fast-paced, well-written, symbolism-full book. It is definitely worth your time and money."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"This book is just as good as The Eye of the World, if not better. I loved both of these books, and while The eye of the world has the thrill and originality of being the first book in the series, this book answers many questions remaining from the first book, and is just simply a great read. The hunt for the horn, how the balance keeps constantly shifting back and forth between the light (rand and co.) and the shadow makes for great suspense (ill admit that i near screamed when it was stolen...). I also like how Jordan gradually introduces the Forsaken (I can't say too much without spoiling it but you'll understand when you read it). Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"Second in the Wheel of Time series, this book can be viewed as the first in this saga because the first book was pretty well contained. The Great Hunt, however, opens up this series as we are introduced to some great charactors, twists and surprises. The writer here has done an excellent job describing a place and time which seems so accurate, if you let yourself go, you can believe it is real.In, the Great Hunt, we start shortly after the last book ended. Rand, and his friends, are up north recupperating after their last battle. Rand, in particular, is becoming moody because of his struggle with his power and his destiny. I am not sure why, but why do so many fantasy figures struggle with their power? In most books it is latent but here, at least, it is very openly expressed. If Rand, or anyone man, uses their power they will go crazy. This, for me, is a distraction, but a minor one. There are alot of good things happening in this book.For example, since Trollocs come from the North, I expected Rand to lead, or be involved, right away, in some type of invasion of their land. But very quickly we learn that Rand must go South, for a surprising reason. At least, I was surprised. We also learn that Moraine has problems with the other Aes Sedia. Another surprise to me.We learn more and more about this land, time and people. And every bit is interesting. My only criticism, a small one, is that there may be too much here to digest. The last book had a great appendix which explained more about the lands and people. Here, the appendix is less detailed. As such, from time to time, when I was confused I didn't really have anywhere to turn. It didn't happen often, but it was a little annoying. Compared to the overall scope of this book, however, it is a small complaint. The Great Hunt is, well... it is great. Well worth reading."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"Continuing on with my journey through the Wheel of Time Series I found \\"The Great Hunt\\" to be a tremendous sequel to Eye of the World. Jordan thrusts you further into the Wheel of Time universe by deepening the character development, and cranking up the action. As the reader you almost feel the pull of Ta'veren towards the characters. Jordan creates the effect that your life is being drawn in and changed as you follow the story line.It will be interesting to see how long Jordan can maintain the momentum during the series, and how he chooses to tackle the difficulties of an ever-expanding story. I know some answers to these questions are already out there, however, I am still in book three, and I don't want my opinions to be tainted by the evaluations of others."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"The book is amazing but came with out a dust jacket.This is my second time reading through The Wheel of Time series.

The tormented protagonist (ala Rand). The supporting characters who fear their companions (ala Mat). The notion that prophecy was not fixed...that working towards it was noble but couldn't guarantee safety.Looking back, reading on my KFHD, I have to say that TGH has met the match of time. On my re-read, I felt the same connection with the characters, the same fear that things were not as they seemed, and the same eager hunger to read the next in the series. Some of RJ's best work."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"I read these books when my boys were younger, since they told me I &#34;had to read these books&#34;.

It will take Jordan another whole book before this series starts to show it's quality. Whether or not it's worth your time will be up to you."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"Great book and the best way to formally launch the Dragon Reborn series tword its final conclusion. Awesome says it best"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"With the untimely and unfortunate passing of Mr. Jordan, one of the most epic fantasy series of all time lingers in the hands of another author in its conclusion (Brandon Sanderson) leaving the rest of us the task of revisiting the first eleven (plus prequel) volumes as we wait patiently.I have recently taken this opportunity to begin again in the hopes of timing it smoothly so that hopefully book eleven can flow right into book twelve (although it seems I am progressing a bit too quickly for this to happen, but that's besides the point).Some may find it strange that my review of the series begins not with book one (or even the prequel for that matter) but with the second book, The Great Hunt. To justify real quick- there isn't much more that can be said for Eye of the World that hasn't been put forth already. In the hopes of cutting down on redundancy, I will concede to the mass consensus that Eye of the World is an imagery rich and well developed novel worthy of the five stars I would have given it.That said, onto this review... The Great Hunt picks up quite seamlessly where Eye of the World concludes and takes our small band of heroes into foreign lands in their quest to rid the world of evil. The pacing in this book is quite well done (though perhaps not precisely as well done as it was in EOTW) and the backbone follows Rand's mission to retrieve the stolen Horn of Valere (and with that Mat's evil dagger). The main story is then divided by the progress of our heroines in their struggles to become Aes Sedai. Intermingling within these are still even smaller plot segments that introduce us to a ship captain (Domon) and a mysterious woman whose true identity is only hinted at by the end of the book.The most successful aspect of the book in my opinion is Jordan's ability to bring all of these threads together by the book's conclusion. Truly nothing was said just for the sake of saying it. Also well done is the separation from Rand and his brood for much of the story- it would seem that his apparent inability to rely upon the support of Mat and Perrin would unbalance things, but thanks to some well-developed cohorts in the form of Loial the Ogier and Hurin the Sniffer, the dynamic never misses a beat.Additionally, Jordan does a great job with the concept of foreign lands (and the cultures inhabiting them). All too often (in fantasy especially) the only way of knowing that we are whisked away to a far off place is a sentence in the narrative that tells us so. Here, however, there are enough strange practices and unique cultural references (especially in the matter of slavery) to make the locales feel far from home.About the biggest criticism to the subtle beauty in the prose would come in the form of lack of character development. I suppose when one considers the fact that we have the expanse of 12 thick novels to do so, it isn't entirely critical to grow the lead characters up in just the course of the first two, but be forewarned that Rand, Mat, Perrin, Egwene, Nynaeve, and even the elusive Moiraine are, for the most part, mirror images of the characters we met at the very beginning of Eye of the World despite the fact that by sheer experiences alone, one would think they would be slightly more jaded if nothing else.All in all, revisiting this series is an absolute joy especially after spending some time with some of the more recent entries to the fantasy genre that certainly pale in comparison. I literally closed The Great Hunt and went directly into The Dragon Reborn in effort to keep the rhythm going as stated above. While I'm not so enamored in the nostalgia to pretend things won't bog down in the later volumes, one can hardly help but enjoy The Great Hunt for its adventurous charms."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"The 2nd book in the Wheel of Time series, I give this book 4.5 stars. This book picks up about a few weeks later from the ending of the 1st book, The Eye of the World. If you haven't read the first book in this series, I'm warning you now there will be spoilers throughout this review. If you don't want to be spoiled, don't read on.At the end of the Eye of the World, one of the young men, Rand, realizes he can channel saidin, the male half of the True Source. After using the Eye, a secret chamber was found beneath the Eye that holds several very important objects: the banner of Lews Therin, called the Dragon, the male Aes Sedai that led the forces of Light against the Shadow during the Age of Legends, an object made of cuendillar (or heartstone) one of the 7 seals of the Dark One's prison created by the Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends during the War of the Shadow, and the Horn of Valere, a horn that will bring back the dead heroes tied to the Wheel of Time to fight for whomever blows the horn.All very important objects, and all signs that lead Moiraine (the female Aes Sedai that led the Two Rivers villagers in the 1st book) to believe that Tarmon Gaidon, the Last Battle with the Dragon Reborn and the Dark One, is fast approaching.The book starts to pick up the pace when the minions of the Dark One (Trollocs, Fades, and Darkfriends) attack Fal Dara and steal the Horn of Valere and free a very interesting Darkfriend named Padin Fain (he was introduced in the first book and he was the one that caused the villagers to first flee their home in that book). Rand and his friends Mat and Perrin, with escort, ride to hunt for the Horn of Valere (hence, the title of the book) and retrieve it.In The Great Hunt, the main character Rand struggles with who and what he is throughout this entire book. He also becomes less naive, more wary and suspicious of the motives of the Aes Sedai, and more aware of the heavy duty that lays on his shoulders (\\"Death is lighter than a feather, duty heavier than a mountain\\"). Having read the other books in the series, and knowing how his personality changes, it was interesting to read the first seeds of this personality change occur. While he did harbor these suspicions in the 1st book, they really don't start to take root until this book. It is something that doesn't ever go away, it only grows with time throughout the series to the point where it actually hinders Rand and what he has to do (which is save the world!).You also learn more about Padin Fain, and I won't spoil it, but he becomes an important character later on so you'll see more of him. Rand also encounters a mysterious woman who goes by the name \\"Selene\\" and I'll just say she is also a character of importance and Rand doesn't meet her by accident.Mat and Perrin, important secondary characters, don't get as much page time as Rand. What I mean is, you don't get \\"inside\\" their head as much as Rand in this book. There are also some snippets from the viewpoints of Nynaeve, Egwene, Moiraine, and Padin Fain but most of the book is Rand's perspective. The other characters I mentioned have significance as well, they play big roles in the series.I think my favorite scene out of this book is the ending scene. A lot of tension and action, a battle scene, and finally Rand realizing his fate and being resigned to his destiny. The Great Hunt is a worthy sequel to the Eye of the World, and it only gets better! =)"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"The Great Hunt continues the saga of Rand al'Thor and his teen cronies as they search for the 'horn of valere' a mythic relic reputed to bring dead heroes back to life. Along the way, the group gets split up, several new characters are added, and revelations about Rand and his role in the upcoming battle unfolds.I liked the Great Hunt more than the Wheel of time. The characters are slightly better written, more mature, and I liked the Seanchan. I also liked fewer dream sequences than the first and fewer appearances from the \\"I'm so eeeeeeevilll...\\" villain, Shai'tan.Negatives: I admit I found Rand a bit tedious, though. Must every female character find him hot? Perhaps a bit of Mary-Suism there. The parts with the wookie-like Loial just held no interest for me. Also the Ais Sidai are quite stereotyped: all browns are nerdy introspective people, all reds are man-hating women, all greens idealistic.. A little too cliche for my tastes. Also, I fail to see the attraction as to why so many otherwise normal intelligent people would choose to be dark friends. The author fails to show what enticements/rewards the 'dark lord' offers for the service. Instead we see darkfriends hurt humiliated and abused. I ended up feeling sorry for most of them, which is not, I think what the author intended. Also, I think Paddon Faine has run his course, at least for this reader.4 stars. Good. Could still use some editing and a few less characters."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"This is the second volume of the endless Wheel of Time series and the best of the 5 that I've read. Rand and his companions are chasing after a powerful magical object, the Horn of Valere, while the Aes Sedai apprentices Nynaeve, Elayne, and Egwene have been tricked by the Black Ajah. All their paths converge for a dramatic conclusion in Falme, where Rand finally accepts his destiny. (Not that we ever had any real doubt about that - it would have been hard to keep this baby going for 10,000 pages or so if he hadn't.)There is some repitition, unsurprisingly. The thousandth time or so that a character repeated the all purpose oath 'burn me', I started hoping that their prayers would be answered with some spontaneous combustion. But overall, the plot does move quickly and actually comes to a conclusion, while the main characters advance and some developments from later novels are set up."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"I can't believe that Rand is such an idiot in this book. In the beginning he keeps telling himself \\"The Dark One's dead, the Dark One's dead.\\" Trollocs and Halfmen storm Fal Dara and still \\"the Dark One's dead\\". He gets an sudden rush of dizzyness when he names the Dark One's name and still \\"The Dark One's dead\\". Darkfriends are still looking for him and still \\"The Dark One's dead\\".Rand still doesn't trust Aes-Sedai, even after one of them cured his father, helped Mat, guided them through Trollocs, Halfmen, and creatures in the Blight, and saved his village from Trollocs.Rand refuses to believe that he's the Dragon Reborn, even though he knows he's the only man alive who can channel the One Power and that he's not the farmer that he always thought he was, and even when Artur Hawkwing himself calls him Lews Therin.Man, I wish I could go inside the book and just smack him around a bit.I also didn't like how Min and Egwene were captured and treated cruely in Falme.And I can't believe that Rand doesn't make a move with Egwene, Elayne, Min, or Selene.But other than that, I thought that this book was cool. There are several suprises and cool action scenes. I'll deffinatly read the next book. I just hope that Rand isn't the idiot he is in this one."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"I found Jordan's second adventure in the Wheel of Time even better than the first. I didn't think it possible, however, Mr. Jordan pulled it off. I was amazed at the world that the author created around his characters. I really enjoyed the fortress of Fal Dara. Jordan stays with his initial characters, not really introducing any new ones. He gives you a large taste of the Dark One and a glimpse at the forsaken. The characters are so well developed that you can really relate to them. I think Rand is my favorite character with Matrim running a close second. As each character struggles to learn their place in the story, you can feel there emotions and almost understand their thoughts. Jordan has done a fantastic job at brining a world alive as vividly as any author I can think of. The only draw back to this series is as I look ahead, I am not sure how long he can keep it going. I was sceptical that the second book would leave a lot to be desired, however, I think it is better than the first. I urge anyone who enjoys fantasy writing to read the Wheel of Time Series. Off to book 3!"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"First of all, I would like to say that I am not the most experienced fan of Robert Jordan's books, having only finished The Dragon Reborn, but I have a fair idea about what's going on, and second if you have not read the Great Hunt please don't blame me if you find something you didn't already know. Of the three I have read, I find The Great Hunt the worst of them. The Eye of the World set up things well and was an entertaining read, but The Great Hunt, despite also being entertaining, was also rather flat. A previous review has mentioned that it was linear and focused, but this is the problem, as I see it. There simply was not enough going on, and the Horn being stolen seemed just an excuse to write a book. Okay, fair enough, some things were brought in (Rand's first experiences of channeling, Verin, Seanchan...and not much else really) but on the whole there only seemed to be one thing happening, and that was the Hunt. I can hardly even remember what happened. Despite my grumblings, it is an essential piece of the series, but I got the impression it could have been summed up in a few pages. You could read up to say, chapter 5, then read the last couple of chapters and not miss much. All you'd need to know were a few things, including the oh-so-obvious Selene (raise your hand if you didn't have any idea she was Lanfear, I knew that and I had only just finished the book) and about Nynaeve's raising to the Accepted.Mind you, the ending made up for it. What a FANTASTIC finale!"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"This second installment in the WoT series is one of the better ones. It contains none of the bland mid-game maneuvering of books 5 through 8, and maintains the adventurous romance of book 1. The pace starts off slowly but concludes in one of the more unforgetable endings in the series. This book was the most difficult one to read for me because of its ponderously slow start but the last third is enthralling. After this one however, the series takes a generally downward trend.If you really enjoy this series, give George R.R. Martin a try. His current fantasy series, A Song of Ice and Fires, is the best yet. It starts with A Game of Thrones, followed by A Clash of Kings, and the soon-to-be-published A Storm of Swords. And unlike The WoT recently, every book is better than the last. Worth every penny."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"This book is much better than the first. In this, you care about the characters. The bad guys are still a joke. Jordan makes the Trollocs out to be tough fearsome monsters, yet not even a horde of them even come close to harming our heroes. The whole thing is mostly predicatable, but a few things stand out. The last quarter of the book is excellent and contains many surprises, with the Seanchan's damanes, Ingtar, and the battle. The funny thing about this book is that is basically another fantasy chase across a &quot;fantastic&quot; land. In the first book the good guys get chased by the bad guys. In the second book, the good guys chase the bad guys. In the third book, which I just stared, it seems now the good guys are chasing each other. Will the series stop with the chases already? I really hope so... but despite all that I did enjoy the book, even if I had to suffer through the middle of it. My favorite cheesy line: &quot;At dawn the day was born, just as twilight gave birth to night, but at dawn, night died, and at twilight, day.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"I have to say Jordan did it again I really enjoyed the book I felt it was well written and well done. I enjoyed the story of Rand and his refusal to be something he is not and the way he goes out to help his friend Mat and help him and find the dagger and the Horn of Valere all the while saying to himself that he wants nothing to do with the Aes Sedai and being named as the Dragon Reborn. I aslo like that he also focus on the women of Two Rivers and what happens to them while they try to learn to be Aes Sedai. I'm currently reading book 3 and I'm almost done with it. I heared that some people don't care for it because Rand isn't part of the main story and just shows up here and there. Well I enjoyed the book and learning more about Perrin,Mat,Egwene,Nynaeve,and Elayne.I highly recommened this book to everyone, I fell you well enjoy this book and may be a fan of Robert Jordan."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"Best series I've ever read. Really fast paced and still thought provoking. Can't wait to finish the series again for the 7th time."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"I've read the Wheel of Time series more times than I can count. Every time a new book comes out I re-read the entire series - on one hand I love reliving the characters and the story, but unfortunately as the series drags on you almost have to in order to keep up with the ever growing cast of characters.That said, books one through four are probably the most linear and easiest to follow. Book Two, although a great book by itself, really serves to provide the background, plot lines, and character development necessary to make book three more significant. Although there were some major plot developments, I didn't really get the same sense of satisfaction when reading the ending that I got when I read book one or book three. This might be because Robert Jordan basically set the path for Rand and the others at the end of book one. When they still haven't reached Falme when you're 75% through the book, you know that it has to end fairly soon and Jordan's not so subtle guidance of the main plot lines leaves little to the imagination in how he's going to tie the end of the book together.I had to bring up the negatives though the positives far outweigh them. The characters deep, involved, and make the story come to life. Although every woman seems to resemble one another in many respects, they each have their own quirks and shine during the second half of the book following their arrival at Tar Valon. Even the auxiliary characters make more of an impact, with Thom back in the fold and Bayle Domon joining the case of regulars. Though I could do without as much interaction with the Whitecloaks who are horribly boring and seemingly one-sided, the Seachan make their first appearance and help Jordan craft a great final battle scene.Overall this is a great book, though it's more of a tie in for the books before and after it than a standalone read."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"I thought the book started rather slowly, finally started picking up a bit in the second half.

The Great Hunt is one of the better books in the series. The Hunt introduces several important objects in the Wheel of Time in an interesting and informative manner.The Seanchan, for example, are set up as an intriguing player that will affect the destiny of the world. Robert Jordan has them seen as an enemy to most because of the brutal tactics and unethical culture system (the Sul'dam and Damane). At the same time he keeps them part of the forces of light by telling us the reasons behind their beliefs and actions. They are like another version of the Whitecloaks with only a couple diffences.Jordan has a good use of multiple storylines (Rand in the Hunt, Eugene at the Tower) to set everything in place for the climatic battle between the Seanchan and the Heroes of the Horn which parallel Rand's own battle against the Dark One. This allows the readers to see why all characters and objects are present in Falme before the battle occurs.The Great Hunt is an excellent sequel to the Eye of the World. It continues the primary storyline of the Wheel of time while expanding on questions raised by the first book. While the Great Hunt answers many question it replaces them with new ones for the readers to think on. This book and series are something that I would highly recommend."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"Jordan does it again with this book. The whole book is very in depth down to the last page.

I have never ever read such good fiction. I read this one in 2 days, because &quot;The Eye of the World' was so good, and I wasn't disappointed, Jordan is a fantastic writer. In each book, you find yourself feeling closer to the characters, thats how well he portrays them. Not only that but they're lovely and thick! I love thick fantasy books. Basically, if you like fantasy even remotely, READ The Wheel of Time sequence! You won't be disappointed. I am so impressed, and tomorrow I will be moving on to book 3."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"Very rarely do you find a fantasy book that has not completely copied Tolkien, Jordan has not done so.All fantasy is based on Tolkien weather you agree or disagee, its a fact, if it was not for the English writter Tolkien then maybe the whole 6 shelves of fantasy would not exist.However, Jordan has produced a world non- linear and fresh, with compelling and interesting characters that intrigue you to read on and see how they develope.I personaly loved the book and found it just as original as the &quot;Faseer Trilogy&quot; and the characters just as deep.I intend to finish the whole series, just the size of the books and how big the whole lot is just is screaming &quot;read me&quot; and it makes you wonder what could be enclosed within those few milloin pages.But let me tell you, not alot does actually happen hahaha. Anyhow, great book well done jordan. Buy it, read, buy the next one!"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"After the... ending of the first book, Eye of the World, I was set to be disappointed in this book.Present in this book are all the things that made book one so enjoyable such as the rich characterization, thick plot developements, and sweeping epic saga feel. So too are Jordan's weaknesses such as his inabililty to not fluff up his books with padded filler and his \\"convenient\\" storytelling.What I mean by \\"convenient\\" storytelling is when an author resolves conflict or struggle in his plotline by having happen whatever needs to no matter how improbable or related to the plot it might be. An example of this might be: 'Our lone hero has been captured by the demon and is held captive in his cave. A short distance away, our hero see's his magical sword. If only he could reach it, he could free himself from his bonds and slay the demon. In the dark, our hero hears the demon coming, most certainly to finish him off for good. Our hero is doomed. Fortunately, our hero just manifested the ability of telekenisis (the ability to move objects with your mind) and uses his newfound ability to summon the sword to his hand and free himself to slay the demon.' Stupid huh? But Jordan does this, and does it a lot.Maybe if Jordan's books weren't so big, he'd go back and perform re-writes. All it would take for the author of my fictional example to do was set up this ability in our hero earlier in the story and develope it with the plot. Indeed, this ability is part of the plot since it is integral to the resolution. Having things happen just because you need them to is \\"convenient\\" storytelling.Some of you may have caught that my reference bears a strong resemblence to what actually happens in another fantasy story. You'll recall that in The Empire Strikes Back, Luke Skywalker is our lone hero trapped in the Wampa's ice cave. His lightsaber is too far to reach to save himself, and the Wampa is coming. It's one of the most memorable moments of the story and isn't cheap like the example I gave. Why? Because Lucas developed this ability in Luke much earlier. It's part of the plot.Fortunately, Jordan's use of \\"convenient\\" storytelling is limited mostly to subplots in this book so the reader doesn't feel as cheated. At the end, he again uses it (like in the first) book to allow the hero to miraculously dispatch of the antagonist, but at least this time, you know who the antagonist is from the beginning of the book. He isn't introduced in the last few pages like in book one's ... ending. The battle is climactic relying largely on the books key plot element, The Horn of Velere. Finally, the true ending to this book isn't the battle the hero conveniently wins, but rather the choice he makes at the end which is made based on the events in the book so is not contrived.This book is the best of the first four that I have read, though I was a bit frustrated that the main characters were still acting like a bunch of whiney babies. Rand (my favorite character) at the end shows he will be the first to grow up and do something about the peril the world is in which made me feel rewarded reading all the growth and development through out the books. The rest of the characters stay their narrowminded, immature selves, but that too will change eventually.This review is assuming that you have read book one and should be meaningless to you otherwise. If you have read book one and liked it at all, you should read this book. You will find it worth your time, as Jordan does indeed improve from the first book. I was ready to give up on the series after book one, but this book made me believe that there are great things to come."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"In this second part of Wheel of Time, Robert Jordan does a decent job of telling a good story while building interesting plot-lines. There's a lot of Tolkien-esque themes here for those who loved \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" and this book is a much richer, varied, and complex book than the first one."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"I'm re-reading the series for the first time since college so I can get up to speed to read Sanderson's conclusion. Sure, there are epic fantasy series that are far better and intricate that do not lose control of the plot as Jordan does starting with book 6, but this is some fine bedtime reading.While the writing itself leaves something to be desired (Jordan tends to reuse phrases, images, etc. rather frequently, sometimes just pages apart he'll use the same turn of phrase), and the continuity is not super (for example, Perrin notes that wolves have no sense of direction, 150 pages later, the wolves tell him that the children of the light aren't going west), and rife with distracting tangents that have nothing to do with the story, this series is perfectly serviceable.I would say that if you haven't read the stormlight archive, the game of thrones, or the mazalan book of the dead, you should go with those before you pick up this series. They're better written, just as epic, and page-for-page more enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"Was very happy with this.

The first book in the series was somewhat slow and didn't hold my attention too well but I thought I should give him a fair chance so I bought The Great Hunt.His characters get more and more whiney, they make stupid, ignorant decisions, and the constant denial of Rand that he is the Dragon Reborn is more than annoying.All in all, the book could have been about 300 pages less - less would definitely be more as far as Mr. Jordan is concerned. He is not a particularly talented writer, sticks with cliches quite often and creates his characters' voices in such a way that I just wanted to slap every one of them.For a good fantasy read, read Terry Goodkind's 'Wizard's First Rule' and the rest in that series. Phenomenal writing, beautifully drawn characters and a fun, nailbiting read."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"I can't handle it any more. I've come up with some new rules for starting/continuing a series because of Robert Jordan.1. Do not start any series at all unless the author is dead or the series is completed unless each has a stand alone plot. (no matter how great the first installments are)2. Never buy a book in a series until you have read the set and find it good enough to want to re-read.3. If you find the first book to have irritating elements that get worse in the second stop reading. In the long run you'll be better off as those elements only get worse.4. Let someone else waste their time and money sorting through all of the pulp...since it's apparent that some publishing houses will print anything that sells.This seems draconian and would probably make a dent in the genre/publishing if everyone did this; but this series is a perfect example of why they deserve it. If the publishing company is so confident in the author let THEM take the risk and front the time and money to see a project through and not burden their readers with this abortion of a series. I can't say enough bad about the cynical, conniving, and money-grubbing, that this series represents on the part of the author (his editor wife) and publisher. Start publishing and finishing quality before we kick the publisher and not just this author/series. Everyone else should take notice too...if you want to sell into this market, I'm not into buying any more books like this."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"I have never been dissatisfied with any purchase from Amazon,you expect quality and you get it."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"I dont like this book.

It was written by David Eddings and it was titled, \\"Pawn of Prophecy.\\" It featured the young farmer of unknown parentage who sees a mysterious shadowy cloaked figure trailing him at times--but it's always gone. It has a blacksmith of virtue and oh-so-practical values who doesn't like to hurt people or be called \\"Lord.\\" It has a mysterious dark-haired, beautiful sorceress who is very imperious, allows no nonsense, and can often be found brushing her hair before bed. It also has an old storyteller who has more skills and knowledge than others would believe--he's more than he appears. Oh, and there's a connection between the main characters and wolves. Jordan has ripped off most of these elements in this book but FAILS to cite his source, which to me makes this plagarism.This particular installment lacks logic. Characters blunder around stupidly until the last 20 pages, then, suddenly, all goes right, for no real reason. Where are the bad-guys? What are they thinking. There are supposed to be super-powerful AND skilled evil adepts. They show nothing worth fearing, hence they fail stupidly and this book has no tension. This stinks."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"The first was good, but this was a very, very, very bad book. Yes there is such a thing as TOO MUCH detail. I mean, how can an author write such a great first novel and then screw up so completely in the second installment? I won't even bother to summarize this 700 page bore, but I will tell you one thing about the plot of this book. The legendary Horn of Valare was stolen from Rand, stolen back by Rand, stolen from him again, and then recovered at the end. Talk about a space waster. That book could have been 300 pages shorter and been classified as excellent. I guess he was trying to make this book as immpresively long as his first, but the result was TRASH. If you liked the first one, don't dicourage yourself, get a discription from a poor friend who had to suffer trough this book. Jordan does try to emulate Tolkien, but with this book didn't even come close. A Very Disappointed Reader"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"This series hardly promises to be new or unique. Unlike others, I don't care that Jordan rips off Tolkien (trollocs, anyone?). Instead, I'm furious that he has stolen characters straight out of Eddings's Belgariad: the sturdy blacksmith with down-to-earth values, the haughty, blue-clad, imperious sorceress, the vagabond old man storyteller, and even a connection with wolves. The opening of the first novel, where Rand suspects some shadowy figure following him is also straight out of Pawn of Prophecy. Why hasn't Eddings sued this poser? Also, the boys vs. girls theme that Eddings began to take a little too far by the 8th book (in the Mallorean) is already overdone obnoxiously by the end of book 1. Surely we can find better authors that don't steal their ideas straight from better sources. Read Eddings and compare for yourself.

I was a little reluctant to pick up The Great Hunt, but I was pursuaded. I couldn't put it down. Jordan's writings are very complex and it took all of the first book for me to understand the world he creates. Now I have to go back and re-read the first book.

Truly and amzing book and an amazing anthology."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"Taking up where _The Eye of the World_ left off, _The Great Hunt_ begins to show us a little more of Jordan's complex world. Jordan is deft at weaving numerous story threads together, bringing them all to the end of the book with a moving flourish.I was more taken than I expected to be with the magical system of the Aes Sedai. Many fantasy realms boast mages and schools of mages, but Jordan's is one of the few that is clearly defined and makes sense on both intuitive and logical levels. I was also impressed with the clear sense of place, both social and physical. The rules are so well-defined that when someone breaks them it really means something.Jordan's world is one of the most complex and unpredictable I have come across. I usually have no patience with dualistic Good vs. Evil systems, but Jordan's really pushes the boundaries, with good people doing bad things and vice versa. Despite the ostensibly Dark/Light division, you are never quite sure who to trust or why. I also really like the concept, which becomes more prevalent here, of the Dragon Reborn being both a saviour and a destroyer. Too often the violence that heroes do is minimized or glorified, or they miraculously manage to save the world without damaging any but the clearly deserving evil-doers.Jordan is also adept at managing many different levels of reality. Nearly as much of the action takes place in dreams as it does in the waking world, and Jordan writes some of the best dream sequences I have read. He doesn't minimize the dream action, either; from the start it is clear that what happens in dreams is just as real as what happens when the characters are awake, and sometimes more disturbing.The one difficulty I have with this book is that sometimes the introduction of new concepts and characters is confusing. When the Seanchan invaders first appeared, for example, I found myself wishing he had spent a little more time on them rather than just throwing us right into the midst of a battle. It's easier to follow the second time around, with the information from the rest of the books behind you, but the first time I kept flipping back to the glossary hoping for clarification that I never really found.All in all, though, a good follow up and a remarkably good series."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"The story continues. I'll just summarize a little. Rand has been told that he is the Dragon Reborn, but denies it and does not want anything to do with the Aes Sedai. Meanwhile, The Great Hunt of the Horn of Valere has started again, this time it really shall be found. Also, Nyaneve and Egwene start to train to be Aes Sedai, yet problems arise. This is no Eye Of The World, yet the story is improving. There were some parts that were hard to read, but very little. Very good work!"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"Wow - this book was just fantastic! I don't think fantasy can get any better than this. Jordan has created a world in which the characters are real and become like &quot;old friends&quot; as you go from book to book. The battle scenes are realistic and well presented. The typical cliches are nowhere to be found. Instead a completely realistic world with believeable characters all in a richly detailed historical context.Get it and read it - you won't be disappointed.

It's a bit frustrating how Jordan never seems to get to the point: there's a lot more empty space than necessary in The Great Hunt, everything between Fal Dara and The Toman Head isn't so essential to the storyline. But the end... well, here we can really see, for the first time, what Jordan can do at his best.The first appearance of the Seanchan is a positive shock. The whole thing really knocks you out, and then, when our heroes stumble into that long before seen clash with them, the thrill is superb. Excellent writing.

Unfortunately, that trend disappears as you get farther and farther into this monstrosity... unfortunately, by the time you realize that the later books are trash, you have so much time invested that you keep reading just so you will eventually know what happens in the Final Battle (if Jordan EVER gets around to writing it... he has already said that he knows exactly what will happen in it, and has for 15 years...). I think 9 books to set all of this up has been excessive; it might not have been if things had worked out differently, but the way that they are written, 9 is excessive, and it's not even finished. There is very little character growth and/or development, with the exception of Rand becoming a little more... well, unstable.Anyway, up to this point everything is still enjoyable, so I would also highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"The second book of the Wheel of time was as good as the first one.

Our characters are more confident, have grown and learned new skills and are overall more heroic. A great relic is found that our main character needs to defeat the dark one, but it is stolen right off the bat. A group of knights is formed to get in back in a holy quest. Our lady Aes Sedais in training move on to Tar Valon for training, but nothing happens as it is meant to. New twists and new characters pop up in the book as well as a new enemy nation that was only spoken of in rumors.

I still enjoyed the convenient chapter marks at the bottom and I'm sure it was true of the first one but apparently the speech synthesizer is enabled in this book for an impromptu audio-book-like-experience. Of course the text-to-speech can't make heads or tails of the special words in a fantasy book and a character named Min is apparently too much to handle (kept saying minimum). I still think a commercial product I paid pull price for shouldn't have these formatting issues but they are easy to ignore. I don't think there was a map of the world included in this book but I don't suppose it would be very clear on a Kindle-sized screen anyway (I have the smaller one).I should perhaps note I have only read the first two books and I'm writing this having not started the third one yet. This review will be spoiler free (I try to stay vague).As for the book itself I think Jordan learned some lessons from the first book and avoided making the same mistakes. There were a few obvious foreshadowing moments here and there along with some blatantly convenient plot devices to move the story along and avoid the issues that would have come up had he not resorted to the plot devices (one example is conveniently skipping over several months and traveling a long distance just when it was needed).After a while I got a little tired of the main character constantly denying he was this reincarnated (for lack of better term?) ancient character with a destiny. I mean a lot of stuff has happened here to him that wouldn't necessarily happen to any random humble sheep herder. It just got tiring after a while. Can you imagine if say Luke Skywalker constantly whined about being manipulation into bringing balance back to the force and talked about wanting to go back to Tatooine and be a farmer? Do you know how annoying that would be?I think some people have mentioned the straight story with no symbolism. And that's mostly true but I can't help but think \\"The Source\\" that is constantly such a temptation to use, super powerful and can inadvertently hurt people and yourself could have some kind of subtle or not so subtle metaphor. Or maybe I'm reading too much into it, that could be.Judging by the title of the third book (spoiler?) I think he's finally going to be over it and accept that he is in essence a super-hero-like-guy...I've already purchased the third book and am looking forward to reading it."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"I really like the series and the book, however, they all contain typos!Sentences are split between paragraphs, characters names have letters missing/different and the italicised thoughts are so choppy!I have read the paper versions, which didn't have all this going on.

Robert Jordan wrote the plot in a very slow pace. Six young people from a remote village gradually found themselves being a major part of the grand pattern that could change the world. That was a lot to take on one's life, therefore, the length of words to tell how those people adjusted themselves was justifiable, I supposed.These characters took a long time (like one full book between 700-800 pages) to step up to another level of acceptance. It wasn't bad. I think we, readers, were given enough time to follow the mental growth of the characters when they were struggling with fate that changed their lives forever.I like the way Jordan described his world. Although for that, I had to slow down my reading pace, to grasp the rich tapestries of that world. It was described in detail, that I could imagine vividly everything in it, each place with its very different people, buildings and grooves.What Jordan lacked though, was a clear description of his female characters. I found it difficult to tell the difference between Nynaeve to Egwene or Moiraine, or Selene. They were all very similar to each other. I don't understand why they were angry all the time. There was not enough back ground to explain these females' angry attitude towards the world in general. Whenever any other character in the book said anything at all, the females replied with harsh words, or balled their fists, or twitched their mouths/eyebrows. All this only showed they were angry, but no particular logical reasons provided at all by Jordan.Also, from several times description through the boys' thoughts, all those females were the prettiest girls the boys had ever seen in their lives. If it was said once, I can understand it. But as it was said to describe all the ladies, I found it confusing. I mean, all the ladies had was the same things, the prettiest face on earth and an angry attitude, how to tell their difference then? I don't know if in the following sequel books the female characterization would be improved, but I certainly hope so! It is too bad if such a good story line with a richly described world became annoying at some parts, due to some flatly described characters."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"This was a great continuation to Part One - and blended in so perfectly, they could have been one, long, fantastic book.I look forward to the next volume!"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"The book itself is quite good, but I've noticed more typos in the Kindle edition than in any other Kindle edition I've read.

He was afraid to channel, and he hungered for it like a starving man for food.\\"** END SPOILER ALERT **all in all, i enjoyed the book and will definitely be continuing on in the series. however, i really hope that Jordan is able to focus the writing a little more and provide some consistency in his brilliance. there is no denying that he writes well and that when it is good, it is great. i hope that the boys really develop into noble men, rather than the annoying boy heroes that they are. and, i can't wait to see what is in store for the women!"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"I absolutely love this series and I've been waiting a very long time for the last book to be released.

I was left wanting more when it ended. Can't wait to start the next one. I would recommend this book to anyone who has the ability to read.Thank you Robert Jordan!"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"I read a lot of fantasy fiction, and this series was recommended to me by many people. I was reluctant to dive into a 12 book series, and was not hooked by Book 1, but I am now, with Book 2. Book 1 was a little slow setting up for my taste, and with so many characters to introduce, I didn't find myself very attached to any of them. I did/do like the 'wheel of time' and 'pattern' theme, as a way of exploring themes of free will vs. destiny, legend vs. history, and the idea of history-making. I also liked the theme of men and women having different ways of channeling the 'One Power' (a twist on yin/yang) and the idea of a world in which only women can channel, due to so many men going mad from the past. It's a nice setup for exploring a lot of different social and occult themes.Since my favorite parts of fantasy fiction are always those concerning magic, 'seeing', and occult abilities, Book 2 appeals to me more because some of it takes place at Tar Valon, where Egwene, Nynaeve, and Elayne (the 3 main women protagonists) begin to learn how to utilize their natural abilities. This is interrupted by some dramatic plot twists which I won't spoil here, but either way, they continue to learn. Rand also finally begins to see who he is and his own abilities. I find some characters annoying - Nynaeve's ongoing hatred of Moraine seems displaced, surely at this point we know Moraine is just another player and not controlling events. Mat is also frustrating at times, with his immaturity and chip on his shoulder. But what's a cast of characters without some complexity? Overall, by the end of Book 2, we have a much better sense of our main characters from Two Rivers, as well as those who have joined them along the way, and a lot of new plot developments too. At this point I can see the potential for a long series, and am ready to keep going.If you like well-written, character-driven fantasy fiction with lots of legend and magic included, this series is a good bet."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"A great follow-up to book one,straight in to book three...this story just keeps getting better the further you get in to it."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"I loved this book, its a great story and a great collection.

I'm just left wondering, with the story progressing so quickly, what could possibly happen in the rest of this epic series?"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"Loved reading this book. It's a great series and reminded me of all 3 books in the title.While this could feel to some like the author is copying other authors, I felt that Jordan's storytelling was still unique."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"As with the first book in the Wheel of Time series (The Eye of the World), I will review this book on its own merits and not use things that happen (or don't happen) in the other books of the series to judge this one. I found The Great Hunt quite enjoyable. Many of the characters are still trying to learn their place in the world while events aren't very accommodating to a leisurly learning pace. Naturally, since this is the second book of a series, there are things that won't make sense to a reader who has not read the first book. Despite that, it is still a solid stand alone book. It has a solid beginning and a solid and exciting ending and centers around a specific quest (though not without side quests and side threads).What I liked:*Further development of strong characters and the introduction of other interesting people.*A fascinating exploration of a very rich and highly detailed world. New places and new challenges.*The first inside look at the workings of the White Tower.*A journey and quest that is so well presented that by the time you finish, you felt like you were with the characters and can understand their joys, frustrations, etc.*The East meets West factor (would have to spoil things to explain that).*The Game of Houses (quite hilarious I thought).*The first Aiel encountersWhat I didn't like:*The alternate reality thread. Can't really put my finger on why, but something about that sequence was a little tedious (for lack of a better word) for me.In Summary:Once again, RJ has written a great story that one can lose themself in with exciting combat (one vs. one as well as army vs. army), intrigue, mystery and other things that contribute to a great fantasy story. Even the alternate reality part that I didn't like, was very well thought out and described, so I don't feel right in taking a star away for it."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"Book 2 of WOT is at least equivalent to the first installment of the series, possibly even better. All the characters introduced in the Eye of the World are further developed (notably Rand, Perrin, and Mat, who will become the three \\"main\\" characters) in intriguing ways. Rand's realization of his birthright makes an excellent tale as he begins to understand his potential and power. One of the greatest aspects of WOT in general is the complex and intricate system of magic, possibly the most well developed system I've seen in a fantasy to date. It is in the 2nd and 3rd books that Jordan really gets rolling with the magic and how it works.Definetly a worthy continuation of the series. Reading WOT is like climbing a mountain. It gets better and better until around book 6 or so, then its a downhill plunge. Have fun!"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"The Great Hunt is the thrilling sequel to Robert Jordan's first novel, The Eye of the World. The plot is just as captivating and exciting as it processor with an ending even more addicting then the first. It had me sitting up until early hours in the morning trying to reach a satisfying ending point more then once; and more often then not I ended up reading until my eyes were beet read and stinging like crazy. This is science fiction fantasy in its prime.I do not recommend reading this book without reading The Eye of the World first, it makes so much more sense when you know the background of the story and how everything came to be how it is. It begins a few months after Jordan left off with The Eye of the World in the fortress of Fal Dara. When the Amyrlin Seat herself arrives in Fal Dara, Rand can't help but feel like the Aes Sedai are trying to use him for there own purposes. Meanwhile, Fal Dara is attacked by monstrous trollocs and the Horn of Valere is stolen by Padan Fain, a darkfriend who was formally thought to be a simple peddler that used to visit Rand's home, the Two Rivers, regularly. Along with that, he steals Mat Cauthorn's ruby hilted dagger that he needs to survive. Mat and Perrin (Rand's best friends) set out to hunt down Padan Fain and the horn, return it to Fal Dara, and recover the dagger to save Mat's life. Determined not to be an Aes Sedai puppet, Rand joins them to escape their snares while Egwene and Nynaeve depart to Tar Valon to begin training to become Aes Sedai.One of the nice things about this book is the narration. Not only do we see things form Rand's point of view, but we get a glimpse into Moiraine's mind. We get to learn a little more of her intentions and get a taste of what the Aes Sedai mean to do about Rand since he can channel the One Power. Another trait that adds color to the book is the little bit of emotion we finally see out Lan, Moiraine's stone-faced Warder. He laughs! Actually laughs! And smiles more then once. Who would of thought he and Rand would become such good friends. (He still calls him \\"sheepherder\\" though; doesn't quit with that until the forth book.) Apart form that, we begin to see Rand developing his talents with the One Power and assuming his roll in the world as a ta'veren and military leader. There are many obstacles in his way that he learns to overcome and new friends and enemies are met along the way. Perrin also begins to bloom and must learn to accept his connection with wolves and use it to his advantage. It is a fascinating journey for our three ta'veren that is sure to earn this book a place on your favorites list.The Great Hunt is a brilliant masterpiece and a wonderful addition to the Wheel of Time Series. Just be forewarned that the series is addicting and you're in for a few late nights and a fabulous story. Robert Jordan has such ability to capture a reader and hold their attention through heart-pounding suspense. This is a must read for anyone looking for a lot of excitement and an enjoyable read. This is definitely one of the best books I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"First, I need to clarify something. The number of pages listed is misleading! There are only 681 pages to this book. I wish the Webmaster would get it right! (Just a little misleading) Anyway, this is an outstanding continuation of the Wheel of Time Saga by Jordan. I'm usually a slow reader but so far, I've managed to finish these stories in about two weeks! And these are not short novels of less than 400pgs! Very easy to get into and Jordan fills in the gaps between books quite adequately. No questions remained in my mind. Then it takes off and you with it! If you've never read Robert Jordan, I recommend it. Although, unless the reader starts with Book 1, they will be lost. It's like a TV series joined in progress. Best to start at the beginning and you'll never want to put it down. Character development is superb. Jordan can bring each one alive. I wouldn't mind if someone decided to make a movie or series out of these writings (With Jordan's involvemtent though!) I do have to say it is quite exhausting. Since starting this series, I've slept better than I have in months! Can't wait to pick up #3!As a side note, I've noted a number of very negative and desperaging remarks about these books. You don't HAVE to read them! They are stories and not all stories appeal to everyone. Perhaps there are those that look for gratuitous sex or graphic violence. I, for one, appreciate Jordan's tact and finesse where things of this nature are concerned. There are several parts where he very well could have been very graphic. However, like a GOOD, no FANTASTIC author, Jordan has left a lot up to the imagination. Rather than degrading the human mind and wasting countless pages on things like that, he describes in detail the setting to put the reader there. That is true authoring. I appreciate good story telling that puts the reader in the middle of the action but leaves some details up to the imagination. He makes you think. I guess he can be called a descriptive story teller. Not unlike the story tellers of old. If you don't like this kind of story telling, then find another author. I, for one, intend to read the entire series then probably again. Maybe not Tolkien, but there are many parallels. I think Jordan may have been inspired by him but that's pretty much where it leaves off."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"If only each subsequent volume of The Wheel of Time could have been this carefully plotted and efficiently but gratifyingly sewn up by the last page! (Of course, RJ would probably be finished with the whole series by now if that was the case.)The Great Hunt picks up right where The Eye of the World left off, and immediately does two very pleasing things. First, there is action almost from the very first with a surprise attack in the middle of the night. Second, we are shown--not told!--details of the heirarchy of the Aes Sedai, Moiraine's long-running quest for the Dragon Reborn, and interesting details about the Borderlanders.The novel presents the struggles of young people who are forced to grow up immediately rather than gradually: Rand as a leader in the search for the Horn of Valere, and Egwene and Nyanaeve in the White Tower. This theme permeates the novel from start to finish.RJ has also filled this book with more of the seeds from which he presented The Wheel of Time universe than in any subsequent volume, carefully revealing backstory and exposition through encounters with Aes Sedai (particularly Verin), Forsaken, Cairhienin nobility, the Black Ajah and Borderlanders, to name but a few. Still, the plot has its share of action, including a night battle between Rand and a band of Trollocs that earns Rand high esteem from Perrin's wolf friends. Lord Ingtar is a particularly compelling presence in the novel.I am disappointed in the little time devoted to Moiraine and Lan in this volume, and though there are other complaints, on balance they are minor and do not detract from the book overall.A fine read, superior to its predecessor and subsequent volumes."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"So far I have read the first three instalments of this series and by all means The Great Hunt is outstanding. Where Tolkien failed to deliver the atmosphere and tension required for such a book, Robert Jordan delivers that masterfully. The Great Hunt is a fast paced page turner developing multiple complex story threads at the same time. In this instalment, the complexity and vast extent of the Wheel of Time world is revealed for the first time. This book has everything for people who love fantasy books which are slightly aligned to Tolkien's ideas. However, having read the third instalment as well (which I didn't like) and looking at the amount of books in this series, raises a lot of doubt about the overall goal. Jordan just recently released number 10(!) of the Wheel of Time series. I have read the abstracts for most of the Wheel of Time books and to be honest, they all read the same. I would rather prefer a series with an end to it instead of dragging the same ideas through countless instalments."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"I am re-reading the series, after reading the Sword of Truthm and the Game of Thrones series. Both Excellent.. Yet. Not at the caliber of character development these are.I find in the second reading of the series, this book to be amazing with many many little comments, and tidbits that I missed the first time through. Many pertaining to later books.I have to say, excellent series.Well worth the first read, as well as the second."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"This IS a good book, but it is just not as tight as the first one. The author starts wandering into political intrigues and lots of new characters, so many it is hard to keep up with who is who at times. I love the action!"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"I am currently reading The Great Hunt, which I started as soon as I ended the excellent Eye of the World. I am portuguese, non native english speaker, but even so, with more or less dictionary help, I am dwelling throw WOT with utmost pleasure. Jordan is a exquisite writer, detailed, accurate, and these options make the books unnavoidably less speeded than the normal one-book story (or even three-book-story, for that matter). WOT is a monumental work, a life's work I guess, and I will be thrilled if the author chooses to write 30 more books, beeing the last finished, or not, when he dies (him himself states that he will be wrtting until they nail his coffin, and that is a good thing indeed). Of course not all of us shall agree on this, it depends on our own moods and likings towards fantasy books, and my own, for that matter, is &quot;the longer the better&quot;, book or series.I cannot agree with the rather illogical and systematic comparisons that are made between Jordan and Professor Tolkien. Tolkien is the Master, the original Creator of the genre, the icon for everyone who comes later on fantasy path. His life, his historic time, the circumstances of his life, have nothing to do with contemporary writers, and saying that this or that is better than Tolkien is, in my view, not understanding at all what Tolkien and his work are!!!Let Jordan stand in his own path, which is great! Let Professor Tolkien stay at Olympus, where he belongs!!!"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"This book really kept me reading. However, it left a lot of questions unanswered: Why were the Children of the Light sent to Toman Head? Why was the Black Wind in the ways seeming to follow them from portal to portal? Where was Moiraine for the whole book? etc. One can only hope that the answers to these questions will become clear in the next book. And why are some of the characters so stupid?? Why does Rand constantly tell people not to call him &quot;my Lord&quot;? It's stupid to keep saying it. Or to keep saying, &quot;I will not be used.&quot;? He begins to sound like a broken record. Why doesn't he listen to Loial?? Why wasn't he at all suspicious about &quot;Selene&quot;??? HEL-LO!! And why does Mat keep cutting Rand down? Why doesn't he just shut up? Only Perrin seems to have accepted his role in the saga. He's the only one who is not constantly raging inwardly with a misdirected anger (Nynaeve), or withholding necessary information from everyone &quot;for their own good&quot; (Moiraine). Whatever its flaws, though, I enjoyed the book. I loved to hate the Seanchan - I got SO mad about the &quot;Leashed ones&quot;! Happy reading."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"This book is a read all.Any body that reads fantisy should read this book.My mom even read it and liked it,and she only reads Romance novels.I love this series.The only one I didn't like all that much was The Path of Daggers and that one wasn't even bad."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"This book has a lot of really neat original ideas, i really like jordans stlyle, but sometimes it gives too much of an overview of the first book, and there are a lot of references to the arthurian legends. Lots of names just changed a little bit. overall though, ive always been enthused by this book and i reccomend it to anyboldy. awesome"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"Like it says in the title, The Great Hunt picked up where The Eye Of The World left off and it adds more characters and more emotion. Just thinking of the characters in the book puts more of an emphasis that maybe all Children Of The Light are bad, the Darkfriends are closer to Rand than you thought, how horrible the Seanchan acted to the channeling women, and truly who Padan Fain is and what his reasons are. Overall this book shouldn't be read before you start The Great Hunt, it's like missing out on one episode of X-Files. Please remember that you should have a lot of time on your hands (even though I finished in 21 1/2 hours). You will probably enjoy this book as well as I did,"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"I have to agree with one of the 'critics' below me -- the beginning and the climactic ending of the book were great, but the book had too many pot holes, places where the it was just the story and developement that the book depended on. Well, that's me; I look forward every time to the romance between the characters (especially between Lan and Nynaeve!) and the parts where the training takes place in the White Tower. Overall? A good book, although plagued with story developement at times. The Seanchan suddenly mixed 3/4 through the book was a little more than bewildering, leaving you wondering about who they are and why why why? I can't wait to get my hands on the next one (grumble ... can't believe I have to go through 6 books to get to Path of Daggers)."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"With out a doubt in my mind I can say that Robert Jordan has produced the best Fantasy books EVER! It is so in depth and gripping that one could almost become obsessive. I have purchased every book in this collection since The Dragon Reborn the day they were put in stores. The only problem I have is that it has been taking one and a half to two years for him to get his books on the shelves. In my opinion there are very few books that evev come close to Robert Jordans Wheel of Time and I have been reading Fantasy since 5th garde and that is all I read. A word of coution, if you are just starting his books, SLOW DOWN! because you will get to the end of his latest novel and then you'll be one of the people like me who have to wait two years for his next. If you have finished his books, read them again I am willing to bet that you missed something."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"The purpose of the book, I found was very revealing in the development of the characters involved. The significance of the Horn of Valere seemed to be a mystery although the explanation of its power was a definate understatement. I feel that the author did a marvelous work in the development of this novel. I look forward to reading the next one."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"In the Great Hunt, Robert Jordan takes the story that he made and made it a hundred times better! This book takes Rand al'Thor from a farmboy that he was into the Dragon that he must become. The story is more in-depth than the first one, and Jordan takes the characters that he made from simply believable, to downright alive. The ending leaves you NEEDING the next book, and the next, and the next. . . . a must read for anyone looking for a good book. Not just action, but story and depth. . . A great page turning epic!!!!"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"After reading the first book, Eye of the World, I couldn't wait to get the seond book and read it. I liked the opening scene, but from there it got a little boring. The test Nynaeve took in Tar Valon was and Rand's adventures with the portal stones were probably the best parts of the book until the last 80 pages. By that time, all of the different plot lines in the book came to a head and started coming towards one spot. For those people who have not read this book I will not spoil the ending, but if you are bored in the middle it is worth the read until the end. Everything that happens in the book, however tedious, comes together in a huge climax. It completely surprised me, and unless you cheat or you just don't like this type of writing, it should surprise you too."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"This was a fantastic book!

Though there are a few weak points in the story, it held many more surprises. The arrival of the Seachan and the hint that Black Ajah does exist are two of them. The climactic battle between the warriors back from the dead and the Seachan is one of the best battles every written. This book does prove the theories from the end of book one that Rand is the Dragon Reborn, and carries on the excitement of the first book.

I've now read the first two of the series and have been left unimpressed. I felt that the series appears to be lacking in a number of areas.First of all I'd say that the character development, while lengthly, has come off as somewhat clumsy. I have found myself annoyed on a number of occasions by scenes that I imagine were meant to be endearing. For example: Rand says to himself &quot;I wish Perrin were here, at least he knows how to talk to women&quot;, meanwhile Perrin of course is thinking the same thing about Rand....um yes, how cute.Second, the story line is a bit hackneyed is it not? Forces of evil chase a group of ingenues through a series of adventures (that will no doubt lead to said force of evils' ultimate demise). Rinse-wash-repeat.My last major complaint is that I found the that often the characters are painted into situations where they are fooled by nefarious forces or indivuals. So what, you may ask? Well the problem is that the situations themselves are described in such a manner that anyone this side of a total idiot should have figured out what was going on from the get go. Yes, they are supposed to be naive...but do they need to be stupid too?The books aren't bad per se...but they are a tad innocuous. Personally, I'm waiting for the next George R.R. Martin book to be released. Though I'd also reccomend the Black Company books by Glen Cook.Sid."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"I am currently going through my Wheel of Time Re-read in preparation for A Memory of Light, and The Great Hunt still remains one of my favourite books, if a little frustrating. Rand and Perrin are finally starting to mature (does Mat ever mature???), the story moves along at a much faster pace, and we start to see the magic and politics of the world become an integral part of the story as Jordan starts positioning all the pieces for some big action scenes. Also a very nice reference to the Towers of Midnight in this book, its amazing to think how far out Jordan managed to foreshadow the big events."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"There are few things in life as pleasing to me as a good adventure. This is the 2nd (actually 3rd if you count New Spring)part of a story I have been following for 20 years. It's well constructed, always fresh, filled with life lessons even for those of us who live in this world.The characters are not perfect, Sometimes they make mistakes.There is love lost and found, war and conquering heroes, bitter losses and sweet revenge.The ultimate battle between good and evil. Once I start reading I can't put them down until I have finished.This series is in my top 3 of all time along with The Gunslinger series and The Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"Let me start by stating that I love this series and suggest why you might like it as well!Why you'll like it:1. There's nobody else who can write like this. As an avid reader, I'm always searching for a new fantasy series to sink my teeth into, but I have not found anything to match it for character, plot, or details. It's a wonderful escape into a different world that is so captivating I finished this book in one day!2. Robert Jordan deftly juggles plots and subplots so the storyline is never static or stale.3. The characters are well developed, three dimensional characters that you can identify with.4. He doesn't use the archetype where all \\"good\\" characters are inherently good etc. His characterization reflects the idea that good people can be \\"bad\\" too.5. If you enjoy reading between the lines to guess what the character really intends to say or left out, you'll enjoy this book. There is definitely some court intrigue!Why you might NOT like it:1. Sometimes I like minimalist writing, but Robert Jordan does not skimp on detail. I only noticed this as I read it for the second time.2. The books can be very long, but I never think about the length of the books (at least 600 pages) because I don't want it to end!Ultimately, I think you do yourself a disservice by not reading these books. I have always thought that the best books change the way you think about the world around you and say something meaningful about human nature; I hope you get the chance to read this series so that it can have a significant impact on your life as well!"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"The Great Hunt is more original than The Eye of the World, but the story occasionally gets bogged down by some rich poetic world building. If that sounds ok to you, then you'll enjoy reading this book.Story:Rand and the rest of the party are on a quest to find an ancient battle horn with the power to summon undead heroes. The Eye of the World, Book 1 of this series, was basically a Fellowship of the Ring clone. In this book, the heroes find themselves on a new adventure, traveling across the world and facing new enemies as well as old ones.World:The world that Robert Jordan has crafted is amazing. It's a world building fan's dream. There's a deep history, a myriad of different factions at war, mystical creatures, a well developed magic system, and parallel universes. It's easy to understand how his fans can get lost in these books.Writing Style:The strength of Robert Jordan's books is his rich writing style that pulls you into his world. At times, the books seem slow paced, but it's mainly because there are so many poetic details that bring the world to life. Jordan has one of the most mentally engaging writing styles in all of fantasy.Characters:The survivors of the first book are back, but they seem a bit thin this time around. There's so much effort spent on the world, the characters seem a bit secondary. Also, there are so many main characters that it feels like there isn't enough time spent on their development.Action:The magic battles are fantastic, but the sword fights are not. Lightning rips the sky and strikes the ground throwing cobblestones in all directions. Arcing fireballs destroy buildings. The visceral descriptions of the magic battles are great and pull the reader right into the action. However, the swordfights are written like, Rand performed Monkey steals peach, then Cutting the Silk, followed by Angry Humming Bird. Really? It's terrible. The swordfights need to have the same visceral descriptions as the magic battles. Swords should cut enemies down, pierce their bellies, lop off heads... Some of the action is good, but some of it is too poetic to carry an impact.Maturity:There's no sex, no swearing, just a complex plot, fancy college words, and some fantasy violence.Overall:If you liked The Eye of the World, you'll like this book. The main appeal is the richly developed world, but take note that the characters and action do take a back seat. Fans of Stephen Erickson will also enjoy these books.If you want some light reading that's heavy on action, you can probably skip this series."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"In my neverending quest to prepare myself for the twelfth book in The Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan, I re-read The Great Hunt for, I wanna say, the third time? Maybe fourth, not sure.Rand Al'Thor, a man who can channel, who will surely go mad, is drawn in further by the pattern, with every step working toward his ultimate destiny, becoming The Dragon Reborn. The horn of valere has been stolen, and it's up to Rand, Mat, and Perrin to ride with the Shienaran soldiers to retrieve it from Padan Fain. Egwene, Elayne, Min and Nynaeve are all locked in their own struggles within the White Tower of Tar Valon. And a new threat comes from the other side of the ocean. Artur Hawkwing's blood, returned to conquer and enslave all women who can channel the one power.The Great Hunt is, in my opinion, better than The Eye of the World simply because the characters are finally starting to grow up. Now, eleven years ago when I read this book for the first time, I wouldn't have said that. A decade later, I'm not really in the mood for books starring sheltered backwoods kids anymore. The Great Hunt delivered much more intrigue, and showed the fans of the first book that there was much more going on in this world than they had ever imagined, and secret plots at every turn. Best of all, the characters started to think for themselves, rather than just react to everything going on around them. No longer starstruck by the lives they are forced by prophecy to lead, they begin to act according to what they feel is best, making their own decisions.In this book, unlike some of the books that followed, I really enjoyed what every character added to the story. Yes, even Egwene, for all you haters out there. She had a great story right at the end of the book.Now, as to what I didn't enjoy in this book. Two scenes both stand out to me, one with Rand and one with Egwene. They were just too dimwitted to be believable, I guess. I found myself acting like one of those crazy people at the theatre shouting at the woman to get out of the house because the killer's after her. I mean, could they really be so dumb that they couldn't see what was right in front of them. If you've read the series, you probably can figure out which two parts of the novel I'm thinking about. If not, read it again and I'm sure you'll see Rand and Egwene acting like morons a couple of times. Yep, there they are.Verdict: 9/10. A deeper, darker, more interesting book than The Eye of the World. Well worth the read, and if you've already read the first, you had darned well better read the rest"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"Slightly shorter than Eye of the World, but slightly faster paced, the Great Hunt matches the bar set by the original and drives the story forward.The two things about the Wheel of Time that I enjoy the most are probably the characterization and the worldbuilding. The various cultures and lands are well-fleshed out, and Jordan develops every place that the heroes stop by on the adventure. Shienar was an excellent example, along with Tar Valon. The characters are at a high caliber, the writing is well-done and descriptive, the story is excellent, the plot is slightly tighter than the first book, and Jordan manages to incorporate some of the grit of real life without turning this into an R-rated book. . . .Though I admit it would probably have been better if he had. ;)Minor bits of goodness mixed in include: The concept of the Heron-mark is cool, the characters' magical powers actually progress over time(Are you listening, Terry Goodkind?), the plot is complex and requires intelligence to keep up with, no ham-handed messages or foreshadowing, realistic take on learning and using swordplay, and some definite moments of hilarity.Sad to say, there are still a couple of problems. Some of the female characters are starting to get on my nerves, particularly Nynaeve(sp?), who never develops out of playing the part of the stubborn, bitchy, bullying manhater.(I'd also like to know what strange problem is inducing the female characters to \\"sniff\\" every few chapters.) Egwene is working her way up there, too, though she's not very annoying compared to Nynaeve. It would be safe to say that Elayne Trakand is probably the best female character at this point. Unfortunately, her viewpoint is pretty much absent from this book.The plot is good most of the time. There are a few definite places where it moves along a bit slowly, though it is an improvement from the first book. I have the same problem with the Wheel of Time that I do with the Song of Ice and Fire; there are too many damn chapters where we're taken away from the action and getting into the heads of random people along the way. If an author does this, then we should at least be taken right into some tense excitement somewhere. I don't really care about Bayle Domon mulling things over while gloating over his cuendillar collection, or some exotic goons from across the sea arriving to take over villages and make them swear oaths of loyalty. Can we get back to Egwene/Elayne at the White Tower and Rand/Mat/Perrin hunting the Horn, please? The plot is wonderfully structured and engaging and all, with a better resolution than the first book, but that sometimes makes the interruptions all the more annoying.The Great Hunt is at times frustrating, but patience is rewarded with a great storyline and characters, especially in the two books following, where the action really heats up. I give the Great Hunt a solid 4 stars out of 5."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"The Great Hunt is better than the first book of the series, and infact I think it's my favorite of all the books I've read so far. Thereasons are many, and I will try to outline as many as I can in ashort amount of text. This book is the best in a literary sense, interms of what it does for the story as a whole (the whole series), infamiliarizing the reader with the artificial world, and in terms ofpure entertainment and action. Best of all, this book lays groundworkfor later books in the series in highly unpredictable ways --- one ofJordan's trademarks. Now that I'm reading the later books in theseries, I find myself tracing back ideas and events not to the Eye ofthe World, but to The Great Hunt.Speaking just in terms of the literary quality of the material, thisbook is very well-written, dramatic and epic in all proportions. Theway that Jordan describes the world (worlds, actually) that hischaracters exist in is rich and poetic. I enjoy Jordan's words asmuch as his stories, because they are not overly literary, but thisbook combines the best of Tolkien-esque story telling with Jordan'stypical wit and \\"down-home\\" story telling skills. The plot iswell-constructed and consistent, with plenty of twists and turns. Youhave to read the first book, of course, but once you have you have thegroundwork to sit back and enjoy Jordan's words, and his vividdescriptions of every detail of the world. I think that after youread The Great Hunt, you'll have the urge to re-read The Eye of theWorld as you will have a better handle on visualizing the charactersand the world they live in.Another way this book excels is in getting the reader familiar withthe workings of \\"Randland.\\" There is much history in this book, aswell as detailed workings of the politics of the lands involved(Cairhien, in particular). This is a key element in the unfolding ofthe story, but also in understanding the motives of the variouscharacters, and how they carry out their machinations. Things getvery complex, and the groundwork laid by The Great Hunt isparticularly helpful in understanding why every character does whatshe does later in the series.More interesting, however, is the exposition of the workings of theWhite Tower. In The Eye of the World, the White Tower is something ofan abstraction --- it very well could be something out of a Gleeman'sTale. Tar Valon is something that the characters don't really seein the first book. However, in The Great Hunt, the reader actuallysees the workings of the White Tower, the ceremonies of Aes Sedai, andhow these affect the characters and their own development in thestory.And of course, you get your first Aiel encounter.For pure entertainment and action, this book is over the top. Thereis more action than in the first one, and there are more cleverdevices for building that action. Much of it is like The Eye of theWorld, where the reader has no idea what is \\"really happening,\\" butmost of it is explained in the course of the entertainment. This bookfollows a pattern that is followed up until Lord of Chaos: thecharacters collect themselves in the place they ended up at the end ofthe previous book, then set out on a journey, the culmination of whichcomes at the very end, and then the pattern starts over in the nextbook. Sounds predictable, right? Well, the way Jordan does it, youwill be on the edge of your seat the whole time. This book does notfollow the pattern I've detected in the Fires of Heaven and Lord ofChaos, where three quarters of the book is build up for majorEarth-shaking twists in the last two hundred pages.There is a diversity of opinion on Jordan's work, many people saying\\"the later books really suck, just read the first three.\\" However, Ialso heard a friend say \\"Yeah, I read the first one and it was cool,but I read the second one and it was just like the first one.\\" Idisagree with him. This is a very different book, and you will bewell-rewarded for reading it. I only hope I can re-read it after Ifinish the series for the first time."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"Many of the characters improve in Book 2, after the rather silly last 200 pages of book 1. It starts with a very edgy prologue, and then is essentially a story of the hunt for the horn. The story starts to get more interesting in the second half as Nynaeve develops as an interesting character. Moiraine plots as always. Rand grapples with his problems. The Seanchan introduction in the last half really improves the book, which is falling into the same sleepy inn / road / town pattern of the first book in the first half.One criticism with this and the first book is \\"the ways\\". I don't really approve a deux au machina which enables characters to reach a certain place in record time, as it seems to be just a substitute for good writing. I understand if others dont share my contempt of this."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"A great extension from the begining book, I highly recommend this book and series!!"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"Read/Listened to book one, and was hooked.

Then again, the Wheel weaves as the Wheel will..."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"The Great Hunt had a lot of responsibility. It was following one of the greatest fantsy epics ever. It had a lot of plot lines from the previous book to bring together. The Great Hunt did just that. It is an amazing book that fuflilled its duty and went beyond. It further develops its characters and paints such a beautiful world you can almost reach out and touch it. The length is almost nothing now. When I'm reading, the length just seems to disappear. I wish this series would never end. Its vast history almost makes Jordan's word a reality. In The Great Hunt. we find Rand al'Thor facing dramatic changes in his life and how it affects his two friends. As I was reading other comments, I realized a lot of comparison to Tolkien. Jordan stands alone in his own genre of fantasy. There are undeniably similiarities but the simple truth is Jordan has changed it into his own style and that's what makes it special. Luckily, I started the series late and I don't have to wait for the next books to come out. THIS IS A SPECTACULAR SERIES!"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"Okay, some others may have read my negative reviews on Eye of the World and Dragon Reborn. Just to prove I'm not such a clod, The Great Hunt is the best of the bunch so far (I'm currently on page 600 of The Shadow Rising). I liked The Great Hunt because, unlike The Eye of the World and Dragon Reborn, the plot line doesn't wander as much; I don't get the sense that Jordan is just filling up space. The plot of The Great Hunt is fairly linear and straight forward--a stolen horn, and the chase to get it back. And when Jordan does wander, in the final third of the book, it's actually quite entertaining. I have to admit that all of the Senachan stuff thrilled me greatly; I was unable to put the damn book down.I was persuaded to read The Wheel of Time series by a friend. Though my tastes sway towards literary fiction, I've been trudging though Jordan's books as best I can. Sure, I may be critical at times (I think books one and three are borderline lousy), but it must say SOMETHING that I'm still reading the series (I'm on book four). Like a soap opera, I'm hooked!!!"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"The Great Hunt, Robert Jordan's second 'Wheel of Time' book, follows very much the pattern of the first (The Eye of the World). I have also read the third book (The Dragon Reborn), and it follows the same pattern also. I am not sure whether the later books of the series continue down the same path as the first three, but that the first three follow the same basic plot pattern is not good. This is the outline:1. There will be a long journey, or several journeys, by the main characters.2. At the end the characters will come together more or less accidentally.3. There will be a big fight at the end in which the hero will kill the Big Bad Guy. Lest you think that all fantasy has this trait, I will point out that 'Lord of the Rings' does not, nor do most of the Weis/Hickman DragonLance books.4. The climactic scene or scenes will be rushed and written less well than the earlier parts of the book.5. There will be many characters and subplots used along the way that have no purpose except to clutter up the book. Example: In this particular volume some 'Whitecloak' characters are introduced in the beginning. It seems at first that the story will turn around these characters, but in fact they serve little purpose except to get killed in the end, unto no discernible purpose whatsoever.6. None of the main characters will die, as they are needed for a raft of sequels that will bring Jordan a truckload of royalties. Unfortunately, considering how long they stay around, none of the main characters are interesting enough to make me care about them.In my opinion Jordan's story is simply too big. He would have been much better off creating his world by telling a story of reasonable length and then spinning more stories within the same fantasy universe. But to keep dragging out the same continuing story interminably begins to get old with this, the second volume. I cannot imagine how old this will seem if I last long enough to read all ten books of the series (though by the time I get to the tenth, there could be a few more...)Jordan is a good enough writer for me to rate his book a notch above pure pulp -- thus two stars. You could do worse when it comes to contemporary fantasy (R.A. Salvatore, for example). But you can do so much better!"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"... My memory of certain parts of the book is still fairly good, but I certainly don't remember everything that went on.This book, more than any of the others, could have used a sliding scale of points. ... my evaluation would probably have gone something like this:+2 stars for the Darkfriends' meeting in the beginning of the book, which gives various clues to the identity of Darkfriends later.-3 stars for the Borderlands society, where the woman pretend to let men rule for no apparent reason. ... I could understand this if the book's societies were portrayed as violently anti-female and the women felt the need to manipulate things from behind the scenes in fear for their lives, but this is not the case for any of the book's societies. ...+1 star each for the initial appearance of the phrases \\"Death is lighter than a feather, duty heavier than a mountain\\" and \\"The grave is no bar to my call.\\"-1 star when I realized that the death-duty proverb would keep reappearing again...and again...and again... Apparently, having found a good thing, Jordan is reluctant to let it go.+3 stars for the initial descriptions of various parts of Aes Sedai training, such as the flower visualizations used to help novices and Accepted unlock their powers. Very few fantasy books describe the *details* of magical training, so this caught my attention.+4 stars for the description of the flies in the village Rand passes through. I still remember that. Many descriptive authors regularly evoke beauty, but few remember how effective it can be to evoke disgust.+1 for Mat's reaction to learning that Rand might be the Dragon. He is almost the only character who reacts realistically, and he became my favorite character from that moment forward.-6 stars for \\"The Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills\\" and the sternness of everyone in power about yielding to fate. Now, my intense love of free will might be a personal trait, but the idea that mindless obedience is encouraged and invidiualism, independence, and rebellion absolutely discouraged wore on me. It also allows Jordan to use the most fantastic coincidences and get away with them. Hey, it was fate!-2 stars for the apparent forced marriages of males among the Ogier. This might be some kind of analogy to the forced marriages of women throughout Earth's history, but if so, it read more like vengeance than an analogy. ...+10 stars for the Seanchan and their society. The strange beasts (about which we never really hear much, alas) and their intriguing caste system introduced a strong sense of the alien that doesn't appear anywhere else in Jordan's work, except possibly with the Aiel.-12 stars for my sudden realization in this book that Jordan apparently possesses no sense of linguistic reality whatsoever. His people come from culture after strange culture, and there's only one language for the *whole* *entire* *continent?* Some people have accents, and the Seanchan slur their words, but that's it. And apparently the language spoken now has no real relation to the Old Tongue. And apparently the villagers of Emond's Field, despite staying in the same spot for hundreds of years and only having contact with the occasional traveler, can understand the speech of capital cities with ease. ...+3 stars for the battle at the end, and -1 for my realization ...+2 stars for the lines \\"Masema, who hated him. Masema, who looked at him as if seeing a vision of the Light.\\" (at least I think that's how it goes). That moment has stayed with me, probably because the wording thrills me.I've left out quite a lot, and some of what's in here is (no doubt) due to personal idiosyncrasies. But I do think there are problems with Jordan's work that people don't mention often to be pointed out, as well as strengths to be praised."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"This review is being written with only having read this book and the first.What struck me about the Great Hunt is the characters seem to be a lot deeper than the first entry. They still have a lot of oh golly moments but they all seem to have different emotions tugging them along. This is an improvement over the first one.The world building continues and by the end of this book you will have visited a lot more of the map.

It's hard to become immersed in a book if whole sentences make no sense and you have to go scrambling for the original p-book version to see what is wrong!"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"The Great Hunt is the second volume in Robert Jordan's gigantic, rainforest-devastating Wheel of Time series. It was originally published in late 1990 and like the first volume, The Eye of the World, was an immediate big seller.The story picks up a month or so after The Eye of the World. Rand al'Thor has discovered he can channel the One Power and thus is doomed to go insane and die, wreaking terrible destruction at the same time. Normally it would be the responsibility of the Aes Sedai sisterhood to 'gentle' him, remove his ability to channel, but Rand's Aes Sedai mentor, Moiraine, and the head of the sisterhood, Siuan Sanche, believe that he is the Dragon Reborn, the long-prophesied saviour who will defeat the Dark One at the Last Battle. As such, they have no choice but to let him go free. When the twisted, insane Padan Fain steals the legendary Horn of Valere and the cursed dagger from Shadar Logoth upon which the life of Rand's friend Mat depends, a band of hunters are assembled to track Fain down and reclaim the dagger. Meanwhile, Egwene and Nynaeve travel to Tar Valon to begin their training as Aes Sedai, but find danger lurking even within the walls of the White Tower. In the far west, on Toman Head, rumours speak of the arrival of strangers who apparently use the One Power in battle and use savage beasts in combat, strangers who will not rest until all the lands are under their control...again.The Great Hunt sees a notable widening of the scope of the world seen in the first book. Whilst the first novel perhaps veered too close to Lord of the Rings' characters and structure to be entirely comfortable, the sequel takes off in a completely different direction. Whilst the series' slightly irritating tendency to be obsessed with 'plot coupons' gets its start here, it does give the book a classical quest structure and deals with the parallel timelines as the core group from the first book gets split up and we follow them separately until their reunion at the end. Jordan also introduces a whole new threat in the form of the Seanchan, a powerful empire ruling a continent beyond the western ocean who now want to reclaim the homeland of their founder (Artur Hawkwing's son). This out-of-left-field threat does an excellent job of shaking things up, whilst the suspicious timing (the Seanchan invasion occurs at the same time the forces of the Shadow are gaining strength in the world) is later revealed as deliberate. The characters are deepened and made more interesting, particularly Rand and Perrin who are shown to grow and change as a result of the revelations they have discovered and the things they have suffered in the first novel. However, we also get to see the Dumb Aes Sedai plot trope get the first of many wearying outings, as Nynaeve, Elayne and Egwene get led into a trap which couldn't be any more painfully obvious. Only their relative youth and naivete makes it convincing in this book; the fact that Elayne is still falling for these things as late as Book 11 is rather more dubious.The Great Hunt (****) is a notable improvement on the first book, taking the world, story and characters in refreshing and interesting new directions. Jordan's mastery of his enormous narrative is evident here, and even a certain economy (not a word normally associated with the verbose Jordan) of plotting can be detected as some major storylines are rattled through in just a few pages (the Seanchan themselves, surprisingly, don't appear until the book is more than halfway done). The novel is published by Orbit in the UK and Tor in the USA, and is followed by The Dragon Reborn."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"Robert Jordan was born in 1948 in Charleston, South Carolina, in a house built in 1797. He was a graduate of The Citadel, the Military College of South Carolina, with a degree in physics. He served two tours in Vietnam with the U.S. Army; among his decorations are the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Bronze Star with \\"V\\", and two Vietnamese Crosses of Gallantry. It was the report of his sad death, aged 58 on September 16, 2007 that caused me to look back through his books and in particular the tremendous Wheel of Time seriesThe Great Hunt is the second book in an adventure that covers thousands of pages, more probably than even the author envisaged. Robert Jordan's series just grew and grew. I loved all of the books and this second one in the series just makes you want more and more. The books themselves are large volumes, several hundred pages each and there are almost a dozen of them, so you can understand the enormity of the task the author had set himself.Some of the previous reviews reflect the differing tastes of readers. Some say that this epic series went on too long, others loved it and cried for more. I think I was somewhere in between. To me they were what I would call mood books. By that I mean I would read anything up to half a book and then maybe leave it for a while and read something else. Not something I would normally do with a book but with the Wheel of Time books, the plot always seemed to stay fresh in the mind and the thread could be picked up again several days later, or even longer.One of the problems, if indeed it is a problem is that with such large volumes and such an epic storyline there are bound to be a large number of characters and keeping track of them all is sometimes a problem, but a small price to pay for the enjoyment the books bring to the reader."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"This one is much better than the first. While Jordan tends to go overboard in monotonous details that nobody cares about, especially when you want the action, this novel really delivers the action. The descriptive writing is great, the dialogue varues between entertaining, believable, and cheesy. What I really liked was the suspense, action, and the battles. Even characters that got on my nerves in the first book and first 75% of this book became really cool. If you were disappointed in the first one, I recommend giving this one a shot.

The author played the smart card by telling a story of daring adventure and flight in book one with little character development, we learn who the main cast is and who the other players are basically.Now, in book two, we have a little bit of knowledge on who the people are and what they're like, but not much more, this is where this book shines, while not as 'action packed' as book one, it gives very strong character development, the story revolving around two of the three main males is most of the story. Showing a gradual progression, while some think that because it doesn't run as fast as the first book it isn't any good, the reason that it is slower is, as far as we and the cast know, nothing is chasing them anymore, nothing is forcing them to move on quicker than they usually would.Its a good read if you want to get to know the characters deeper, but to understand everything, go for book one."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"Very well written.

RJ is right. Some scenes I read through were interpreted differently when I heard them on Audio. This purchase is worth it. The abbridged versions skip far too much. It is better to have this treasure word for word. A definate buy."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"I am enjoying this book!! I haven't finished it yet, but it is hard to put down and I hate having to put it down just to go to bed!!I realize that many people give this book/series low stars stating that Robert Jordan isn't like their obviously favorite authors, however I realize that Robert Jordan is different.

Most are in a bookshelf unfinished never to be touched again. This book is NOT like those others. After the initial set-up of the first few chapters I was swept away never to look back. The book charged ahead with vivid characters and intense action.Multiple story lines weave and meander together brilliantly leaving you a bit off balance and hungry for more. :) Truly a masterpiece!"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"By the end of volume one, &quot;The Eye of the World,&quot; I was hooked, and the morning after I finished it, I ran out to buy the other 4 volumes available at the time. &quot;The Great Hunt&quot; only enthralled me more. Here is where our heroes and heroines really learn the politics and stakes of the epic war they have entered. I've read 9 of the WoT books and this is Jordan's best."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"The Great Hunt is a fasinating tale which many people do not believe in. Tis true though the horn is real and can awake the heroes of the age of legends. Rand Al'Thor found the horn hidden under the eye of the world. Though shortly after it is stolen and this story begins. Riding through the land in search of the horn the characters in this book experiance great gains and losses. There are many great events happening that will change the world and the Dragon will ride again soon.

I read the Eye of the World all the way through and I found it kind of slow in the beginging but I kept going and the last half was great. The Great Hunt had none of that slowness in the beginning. I like this book series because it is imaginary and good against evil and even has some romance in it ^_^ (Nynaeve and Lan, Rand and Egwene) I LIKE Rand. Everyone's like &quot; I find him annoying... I LIKE him. I hope the books don't get bad after the 5th book. That's a whole lot of reading. ahhhhhh...."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"The Great Hunt is a lot of fun, even though it doesn't match the complexity of the more recent books. The plotting may be a bit formulaic, but it's still better than anything Terry Brooks has ever written.Also Recomended: The Harry Potter Series by J.K. Rowling, The Left Behind Series by Tim LaHayn and Jerry B. Jenkins, The Shannara Series by Terry Brooks, The Saga of Darren Shan by Darren Shan, The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien, and the Remnants Series by K.A. Applegate."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"This is a spectacular book. Jordan has so many events going on in this novel that it always keeps you excited. Although aa lot of his ideas come from Tolkein books. For example: Tolkein as &quot;The Dark Lord&quot;, while Jordan Has &quot;The Dark One&quot;. But Jordan also has amazing creativity. He has the language used in the age of legends name,&quot;The Old Tongue&quot;, And he evan has definitions for the language. Jordan will continue the series from the Wheel of time till ages come and pass, leaving memories that become legend. Then the legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when that author that wrote book one writes it again."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"This book is very very good. It takes all of the good parts of the Eye of the World and expands on them. I really like the way Robert Jordan paints pictures with words. I won't give away any of the plot, but I will tell you that it is very well done and has some surprising developments, especially towards the end. After this, I can't wait to read the third volume of the series."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"This is a great book that sticks to the theme of the great hunt really well the other books seem to have nothing to do with thier titles and Im not to cool with that but they are still all a great read"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"Many times, sequels (or in the case of Jordan, subsequent books in a series) don't measure up to the level of the first book.&quot;The Great Hunt&quot; does.With each page and each chapter, one feels as though one is being drawn into a world bigger than one's self -- and the tension mounts with each passing page.I felt that the ending of this book was particularly dramatic and effective.One of the best of the series."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"I have to confess, I was already a &quot;Jordan Junkie&quot; long before I found this site. I bought books 1-2-3 at the same time, and read them straight through. Since then I've spent several long years being slowly tortured as I wait for each painfully drawn out release date.Now to the book:I have read many of the reviews where people complain that Jordan seems to stretch out the story or wander a lot. I can only say that I believe it makes the story better. Every extra sentence allows Mr. Jordan to add yet more detail and clarity to his stories, and allows us-the readers-to relish this great story for that much longer. Life itself would be much less interesting if we were to remove &quot;a sentence here or there&quot; and as for wandering, can anyone tell me what their mind does on nearly a non-stop basis anyway? Especially for those of us drawn to the Fantasy genre. Mr. Jordan creates a world that you can almost see, feel, smell, and hear. you find yourself drawn to the characters like friends, and can identify with the feeling and emotions they have. In some ways they seem very real, Jordan gives them the same thoughts and feeling we all have-be they good or bad.As each new book is released, I go back and reread the entire series first to last. Given the fact that I have read the entire series now at least 4-5 times, and still look forward to the next time, you could say that I feel it is a very good set of books, and well worth the time to read. You will be a better person for it."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"A pinnacle of fantasy, Jordan weaves so much depth you never want to put it down. I don't think I've ever went through 700 pages quicker."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"First the good. I really appreciated Jordan's writing style in this book. Given, he does repeat himself more than once, often utilizing certain cliched phrases that become tiresome, but overall his writing should be admired. He gives more than enough attention to detail, and his dialogue has some \\"pop\\" to it, giving the reader the impression that the characters are real people who will always react to given situations in different ways. The main character, Rand, is especially developed in this book. His character has some depth, and I look forward to seeing how Jordan uses him in the next book. The plot line of \\"The Great Hunt\\" is straightforward and rarely wanders, unlike its predecessor \\"The Eye of the World\\". That being said, however, I must admit that it's not *that* difficult to have a straight flowing plot when the characters are doing nothing but seeking something, in this case the Horn. The story pretty much flows itself along without much outside help. Jordan does a good job of touching the reader's emotions in several chapters - I found myself really caring about what the good guys cared about. That kind of writing cannot be learned. It's a gift.Now to the bad. Again, as with \\"The Eye of the World\\", the story is too long and drawn out. The good writing compensates for some of this, but still, the story could have easily been told in 300-350 hardback sized pages. Instead of making it short and sweet, Jordan drags it out for nearly 600 pages, not including the tedious appendix. Also, I found the character of Selene to be a very much on the annoying side. I'm guessing Jordan will bring her back in the next book as he did at the end of \\"The Great Hunt\\", but still, she served hardly any purpose other than to harass three of the main characters. It was tiresome at first, then grew sickening. I was also disgusted by some of Jordan's sexual undertones. I got the feeling that it was put there simply for shock value. If not, I doubt Robert Jordan can normally relate to the opposite sex, and I feel sorry for him.If you're just picking up the books, please don't expect another \\"Lord of the Rings\\". \\"The Wheel of Time\\" series doesn't even come close. However, it does have some unique moments to offer. If you're a fantasy fan, and don't mind spending hours and hours and hours only to realize that you've only advanced 30 pages, then \\"The Great Hunt\\" and the entire \\"Wheel of Time\\" series is definitely for you. Four our of five states."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"I am a big WoT fan and i love the series. The Great Hunt starts of slow but picks up speed. Soon Rand,Loial and Hurin are of chasing the Horn! And it just get's better, Mat blows the horn at the end of the book! Very exciting."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"This is the second book of the Wheel of Time series. Its only a bit, I repeat, a bit better than the first book and thats because there's more action in it. On the whole, this book was useless.The Horn of Valere is stolen in the beginning by Darkfriends and so Rand & Co sets out to retrieve it. I still doesn't understand why the villian waited for 3 months for Rand to come and take the Horn back. He should've used it for himself in between. At the climax, Rand finds out where the Horn is kept, enters the building and picks it up without any difficulty?? Comeon, we're speaking about the greatest weapon of the world, which can bring back the army of dead. And I've even found other reviewers claiming the final battle sequence to be a masterpiece in literature. Unfortunatley, I didnt find it a bit interesting to hold my attention."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"One wonders, given the over-arching 'tribute' to eastern mysticism and eternal cycles (and after ten drawn out volumes), whether Mr. Jordan is going to republish volume one now under a different title as \\"volume eleven\\" (Knife of Dreams), since according to the tiresome preamble to every book all this nonsense is supposed to happen all over again anyway. What's the point? Why have a hero at all or even a struggle if it's all ultimately pointless anyway (except as an exercise in cynicism).I have tried to get into these books...perhaps if I were still in my twenties, I could read this and pass over the unimaginative names, places and empty stereotypes and dull storyline (just try reading the prologue out loud with a straight face) without letting them stop me. But life's too short.Mr. Jordan writes better than the narrow confines of this so-called genre. Too often these books read more like gaming manuals than novels. He deserves to be released from this straight-jacket--because in spite of the hobblings foisted upon him by the formula here, the man knows how to write rich, descriptive prose. And I will stubbornly keep an eye out for whatever new comes from him, hoping he will tire of this wheel and take delight perhaps instead in something truly new one day."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"I read tons of books like this all the time. It takes me little time to complete them. But this series is so slow and reading it can be such a drag that I just can't do it anymore. I give up on this author and this series which I hear he can't complete because he's written himself into a corner. It's a hard read because it's so slow paced and such a slow read. i recommend going someplace else despite the interesting story line."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"In My opinion, this book is the best in the wheel of time series.

Anyway, the whole series is amazingly written in a way I can understand."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"The book gets off to a slow start then speeds up over time. the ending of the book is superb; great action and a suprising turn of event. if you can get though the constant bashing of men every 15-20 pages and about 150 pages of boring stuff then its a good book. one other problem about the book is the women sometimes they are just too annoying, stupid, and men bashing."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"Another great book by Robert Jordan. I am a huge fan of the Wheel of Time series, though it does sort of bog down later on. But during the Great Hunt everything is still relatively simple and easy to take in. I believe this takes place after Rand's first encounter with one of the Chosen (in the first book). Very good character developement and a lot of intrigue. Highly Recommended.LennoX"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"THE GREAT HUNT is bloated and boring. I'm not sure why this book even needed to be an entire book in itself. The plot is so slow and the developments are so minimal--so much of it is needless dialogue--that it easily could have been summarazed and folded into another novel as back story. Or at least much of it could have been. I loved EYE OF THE WORLD and read it in 3 days. This one has taken me more than three weeks to read. I hope THE DRAGON REBORN is better, much better. If not, I don't think I'll waste my time with the rest of the series. I've recently read George R. R. Martin's SONG OF ICE AND FIRE novels (the three that are available). Robert Jordan ought to take some lessons from him. Martin is a truly magnificent writer. Jordan isn't even a close runner up."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"Ah. The wheel of time.

My boyfriend and I are both reading the series and can only marvel at Robert Jordan's writing capabilities. He has created a whole universe that is unbelievably detailed and woven together. It is so easy to get submerged in the world he has created, as it seems so real. Great storytelling!! I enjoyed the first book in the series, &quot;Eye of the World&quot;, but &quot;The Great Hunt&quot; just rocked!

If somebody didn't complain that he writes too descriptively, they'd complain that he DIDN'T write descriptive enough. And what's with everybody comparing every little action to Tolkein? Is the 'art' of just reading a book for the mere enjoyment of displacing your mind for a few hours a week gone? If you wish to read a book that studies and compares Tolkein work, go to your local library, and pick up a biography of Tolkein. Sheesh.Well, enough of my bantering.

Jordan obviously uses some of Tolkien's ideas, such as the Uncrowned King. He also uses Tokien's device of large amounts of information and legends presented in the story, but Jordan does not interweave this history as well as Tolkien did into the story."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"I'm not going to give much on the plot, since you'll have to read the first book in order understand \\"The Great Hunt.\\" But I will tell you that this is a great, if not excellent, sequel to the first book in \\"The Wheel of Time.\\" Like the original, this book goes far into detail with locations, objects, and especially characters. There is no \\"less is more\\" approach here; the excessive details really work here.Then, there are the characters. There are so many diverse people here: people have different pilosophies, different motives, different emotions about important things, etc. There are those you will love (Rand al'Thor, Egwene al'Vere, Loial, Hurin, Siuan Sanche), those you love to hate (Ba'alzamon, Padan Fain, the Seanchan), and those you will have mixed feelings about (I know Ingtar tries to do good, but his emotions are WAY too forced).And who can forget the many locations? There are hundreds of cities and forests and mountains, and I doubt that we'll dwelve into all of them when \\"A Memory of Light\\" is published.The way everything intertwines, it's all brilliantly organized. The sub-plot involving the Great Hunt of the Horn, for example, does well with the sub-plot involving the many Ajahs of the Aes Sedai.In conclusion, \\"The Great Hunt\\" won't do wel with those who haven't read the first book (read \\"The Eye of the World\\" if you want to read overly complex The Wheel of Time series).

The books are longer, and that's good! You don't finish a book in 2 days."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"THis book is just great. The horn of Valere is stolen from fal Dara by Myrrdraal and something else...something even more powerful than a myrddraal, more deadly, more dangerous. Together, Rand, Lord Agelmar, Loial, and a handful of soldiers go to retrieve the horn. Rand meets Selene, a mysterious woman who appears to them in a world that could only be reached by one touching the One Power. however, she says she isn't Aes Sedai, and shows as much contempt for those so-called \\"Tar Valon witches\\" as for the Dark One himself. So who is she? I'll let you figure that out for yourselves. While Rand is busy meeting her, Egwene and Nynaeve set out for the White Tower, meeting Elayne and Min, minor characters in the Eye of the World. Their adventures lead them to a people more wicked then they had every dreamed possible; and also the discovery that the Black Ajah really exists.However, the Wheel of Time also has its faults, like every book published.Here are a few that i find particularly annoying.. Characters can hardly think a sentence with out adding a, \\"Light!\\" or a, \\"Burn me/her!\\" or a, \\"Blood and ashes!\\",occasionaly a \\"Blood and Bloody ashes.\\" At first i just found it amusing, but as the series progress these phrases start to appear at least once on every single page. Yes, annoying, repetetive, irritating...you get the point.. Men, especially, Rand, are such fools. Are they always falling for woman merely because she looks good? It seems so. Rand moons after selene because, well, \\"Light, but she's beautiful.\\" Sames for Egwene to Galad, \\"Light, he's so beautiful.\\" Ugh! it's enough to drive one crazy, the way R. J makes such a point of this. Oh, well, the books already published, though.Now, since i went through the negatives, i'd better do the credits, too. As follows.... Cliff hanger on almost every chapter.. New magical things, surprising and creative.The Wheel of Time is a series worth its weight in gold. To read one book is like entering a whole new world, filled with prophesy, adventure, and plenty of magic; to read the next is like to live in that world, experience it for oneself. Robert Jordan is an exceptional and extraordinary writer; I highly recommend his books to anyone willing to get addicted to series."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"The aptly titled The Great Hunt is about just that; a long trek made by Perrin, Mat, and Rand across the continent to find the Horn of Valere, an artifact which calls the dead back to fight the horn-blower's enemies. The rest of the book deals with Egwene, Elayne, and Nynaeve's adventures in the White Tower with the aloof Aes Sedai.This book continues in much the same fashion as the one before, with a long long journey capped by a climactic final sequence. More Aes Sedai are involved in this one, which means more time is involved wondering what everyone else is thinking and not saying, but it isn't so top heavy yet. Peripheral players like Min and Elayne are given actual roles here, with Min in particular starting out on the road to being one of the best characters in the series. The scenes in Cairhien with Rand befuddling all of the schemers by ignoring all of them are decidedly entertaining. Even though the heros aren't being constantly chased by baddies in this one, a sense of urgency is still included by way of Mat losing his dagger of evil and suffering as a result.In the end, if you liked the first book, then you'll like this one. The storytelling is still tight, and while the conclusion is sort of confusing (I thought Ba'alzamon was dead?), all in all it is a satisfying read."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"Two accomplished voice performers, Reading and Kramer, give bold, vibrant readings as they bring to colorful life the thoughts and actions of the myriad of characters author Jordan has so memorably introduced. Expressive and dynamic, their performances capture the thrill of adventure and wonder of fantastic happenings.Jordan has been quoted as saying that fantasy literature &quot;appeals to a simpler time of life with recognizable good and evil.&quot; Both of those forces come to the fore in his Wheel of Time series as listeners/readers eagerly wait to discover which will have the upper hand.In The Great Hunt. the sequel to The Eye of the World, an onerous theft occurs. Gleemen have long related the tale of The Great Hunt of the Horn, and now that very Horn is discovered. It was believed to have been only a story, a legend but here it is, the very thing that will raise the dead heroes of the ages.Now, it has been stolen and the hunt is on.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"As has been the case with other fantasy series I have read, I thought that the first addition of the The Wheel of Time series was very good, it made me go out and grab this book immediately, but it was not until I was in this book a hundred pages that I became an official Wheel of Time groupie. Once I began my next journey with Rand and the boys, I knew that there would be plenty of books to follow. The first book to set you up, and the second to suck you in.If you have not read the Eye of the World (the first installment of the series), than I suggest you go back and tackle that first. Not having the knowledge that comes with that book would take away from this one. The rest of the review is based on pre-knowledge of the Wheel of Time characters.I thought that this book was the surperior to its predecessor, if only because we began in the meat of the story and do not need to go through too many explinations-although Jordan does have an annoying habit of redescribing every character in detail and reliving other tibits of their past, seemingly for the reader, while I would imagine all readers already know what he describes. One aspect of the book that really enjoyed was learing more about Moriane as a person rather than just an Aes Sedai-though this is not a very large part. I also thought that LoR similarities I saw in the first book did not carry over into the this one. Jordan's world is its own, and alomost as distinct to me as middle earth.I have two major complaints: the first is about when Jordan shifts between story lines. I am used to giving one sub-plot a coupld of chapters then switching at a cliff-hanger to another sub-plot, but Jordan's changes are irritating. After what felt like half the book of one or two plots, right towards the end a third comes into play (I do not want to be more specific) and really made me put the book down for a little bit-not something I had done lightly before. The second complaint was of the stupididty that surround some of the characters at times. When it feels that the pages are screaming &quot;danger will robinson&quot; but Rand, or whomever, don't seem to hear it. I can see that there are plot lines based on a character's density, but come on, lets be more subtle about it, please.All that said I loved this book and would give it a 4.5 if I could. I began the Dragon Reborn as if it were an extension of The Great Hunt, not missing a beat. I highly recomend it, and the series, to all that enjoy fantasy."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"Jordan seems to give his stories to people like a doctor giving his patient painkillers. Once you take it in, it can become very addicting.

The roles of the characters from the Eye of the World are made more obvious in The Great Hunt. Rand finds out what he really truly is. Nynaeve and Egwene finally get on with the process of becoming Aes Sedai. Ingtar's true intentions are revealed. Even the Captain of the Spray is involved yet again!

A lot of forshadowing occurs so you get a taste for whats to come in the next couple of books."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"The Dark One's minion Trollocs and Myrddraal raid Fal Dara where the heroes who defended the Eye of the World are gathered. The evil horde free Darkfriend Padan Fain who before fleeing the border village absconds with the Horn of Valere which when blown brings legendary heroes to fight the user's side and also takes Mat's soul-stealing dagger.Lord Ingtar puts together a team to include the three male defenders of the Eye of the World (Rand, Perrin, and Mat) to retrieve the stolen relics. At the same time their female comrades Nynaeve and Egwene travel with the Amyrlin Seat Aes Sedai witch Siuan Sanche to Tar Valon to begin their training.The reprint of the exciting second Wheel of Time fantasy is an action-packed thriller especially when the focus is on the quest to repossess the purloined Horn and dagger; the female training comes across as weaker sister distracting from the prime plot. The different people met on the journey enhance and expand the Jordon mythos while the five heroes of the Eye of the World seem to have lost their coming of age maturity they obtained during their previous harrowing adventures. Still overall this is an entertaining quest fantasy that sub-genre fans will appreciate.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"I have totally enjoyed all of Mr. Jordan's books that I have read so far, and am looking forward to reading more of his offerings.."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"2nd book read in 2012.number 65 out of 234 on my all time book list.Follow the link below to see my video review:[...]"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"I can't remember how many of the Wheel of Time books I read back in high school. I think it was the first six, and at that point that was all there was. So I resolved that one day when the series was finished, I would go back and read them. It's been interesting going back and rereading the series after so long, I remember some things, but have forgotten enough that it isn't a complete rerun for me.I was concerned reading this series now that it would read too adolescent for me. I have to admit I enjoy my fantasy reading these days to be more dark and gritty than I did in high school. And some parts were. Seriously every female character thinks so highly of herself and so lowly of all the male characters that it is a wonder that children are ever born in Jordan's world.On the other hand, the story in this book I found very entertaining. The pacing was good. I felt like a lot happened that not only moved the story forward but also helped to flesh out the world that Jordan created. I find Rand to be an interesting character despite having a clich&eacute; origin story. There are several factions that want to use Rand for their own reasons. He is self aware enough to know this and works throughout the book to keep from becoming one of their pawn. I will note that there isn't really very much character development beyond what they were in the first book. I am sure with as many books that I have left to read in this series that there will be plenty of character development as the story goes on.Bottom line I enjoyed this book and look forward to starting the next one. There were some parts that were clich&eacute; and maybe a little cringe worthy, but none of it was so bad that the book stopped being entertaining."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"We continue to follow the 5 friends from Emond's Field as they find, lose and recover The Horn of Valere, which is believed by many, to be mythical. It is to be blown by the Dragon Reborn, to summon Artur Hawkwing and his long-dead army, for the final battle. By the end of this book, there's no denying that Rand is the Dragon. To be continued in the 3rd book The Dragon Reborn (Wheel of Time, #3)."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"Another fantastic read by Robert Jordon. So glad I took the time to start the series! Difficult to put this book down for many reasons. And difficult to forget the story. Love the characters, love the story, love the adventure. Highly recommend if you love fantasy."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"THE GREAT HUNT is a well seasoned concoction of mystical, magical, mythical elements. Like old wine in a new bottle skillfully blended with forgivable appropriations from Middle Earth, Dune, King Arthur, Indian and Oriental notions of circular time, THE GREAT HUNT celebrates modern fantasy tropes along with embracing the old, the comfortable and the familiar. All without a single talking dragon or elf in sight. Written before Wheel of Time was a guaranteed success, THE GREAT HUNT is great fun, the fertile series yet untouched, untainted and unshaped by fame, fortune and fandom.The whole affair gets off to a brilliant start with the Man Who Called Himself Bors doing some Halloween-type partying with some of the black hats. Excellent and well drawn minor characters like Bayle Domon and the Sniffer appear to claim some enriching face time. Rand becomes more conflicted while learning the sword; Loial and he have a singularly cool side-adventure after waking up in an alternate reality with airplane contrails in the sky before they encounter one demonstrative chick. Mat's lifespan seems genuinely threatened but he makes the acquaintance of pyrotechnics and subsequently learns he can give Chuck Mangione a run for his money. Egwene's capture and escape from the Seanchan are as riveting as her story ever gets be it in the Aiel Waste, Tar Valon or Tel'aran'rhiod. Plus all the other core players start developing into multi-faceted characters.The most satisfying fantasy book ever written, rivaled only by THE SHADOW RISING. Top flight top shelf imaginings."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"A worthy sequel to the first book in the series. Admittedly, The Great Hunt drags a tad as Rand is drawn into those parallel worlds and dallies with Selene. Who cares? By now readers are so completely drawn into the story of Jordan's Wheel of Time that you appreciate the tension and wait before further plot elements arrive. A staggering conclusion redeems any imperfections (wait... St. Jordan wasn't capable of those. No, really. He wasn't) the book offers."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"This is the fantasy book that made me fall in love with the genre and became my gateway to so many other greats. It took me a while to dig into the story and finally convince myself to open myself up to the world within. At first the writing felt too embellished and long form. But little by little it grew on me. By the time I finished book 2, I was head over heels, hook line and sunk.After Jordan, read George R.R. Martin, Steven Erikson, Terry Goodkind, and Robert Jordan. Then you'll still have C.S. Friedman, Daniel Abraham, and Susan Clarke. So many books and so little time."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"A must have book for the Robert Jordan fan!

It just is that great. So great that I remember each unforgettable event that has happened in the book vividly and still emotionally. This was an extremely pleasant sequel to Eye of the World, and utmost fitting to such a great beginning and to such a deserving series. I feel so fortunate to have ever came to read this series being overwhelmed with such powerful story-line. This book is like a permanent bond towards the series, which I'm totally welcomed to be a part of.

And meanwhile, Mat is being killed from the inside by a dagger he found in Shadar Logoth, a city full of evil. Though he also needs the dagger to survive, somebody evil, worse than a mere Darkfriend, wants the dagger as his own, and will do anything to get his greedy hands on it. This book is extremely good, but I only recommend it to those who have completed the first book in this series."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"Robert Jordan's \\"The Great Hunt,\\" the second in the huge and ever-growing Wheel of Time series, is a well-paced, well-plotted, engaging fantasy story that deserves to be read by fantasy readers - even those who will be inclined to ultimately drop the now ponderous series before it ends.The story is your standard fantasy fare. There is an item of great power. There is a group of innocent young folks caught up in an adventure. The item is lost. And they quest to regain the item. Throw a slew of subplots, characters, creatures and locations into the mix and you have yourself a modern fantasy tale.None of this is at all bad in the case of \\"The Great Hunt,\\" which is an enjoyable read.At this early stage of Jordan's series, the characters are interesting and fresh. New characters are regularly introduced, as are subplots, and all seem to fit well into the epic story gracefully being built up in this, the second volume of who knows how many. The action is brisk, the twists many, and the epic sweep of the climax engaging. Robert Jordan proves that by-the-numbers fantasy doesn't have to be bad. This works in every way and is likely to leave you turning pages until the wee hours of the morning.Readers new to Jordan's series should be forewarned: It's a long series that has not yet ended, nor is there even an end in sight. With each successive volume reader complaints have increased. Many find themselves loving the early books only to quit the series before it's over. Others, however, have enjoyed the expanding scope of the story and revel in the sprawling cast of characters and innumerable subplots. It's a matter of taste, to be sure, but one thing is for certain - where Jordan's series has gone these days is certainly love it or hate it territory. Know what your tastes are and read reviews of future books before getting too deeply involved.Later volumes aside, \\"The Great Hunt\\" is a worthy addition to any fantasy library and is recommended reading even for those who have no plans to actually finish the series."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"While &quot;The Eye of the World&quot; introduced us to Jordan's vision, &quot;The Great Hunt&quot; is where the world of the Wheel of Time series is defined.If you read the book's synopsis, The Great Hunt might sound like a spin-off of its predecessor. Although the leading subject matter plays off the first book, this book is a continuation of the series - not a merchandising piggy-backer.Here, in The Great Hunt, we follow multiple story lines as the characters introduced in the first book begin to really define their individuality and uniqueness. Jordan's world comes in to focus, as you follow an adventure that stretches from the world's most Northwest regions to a peninsula jutting off into the East. As if the world wasn't complete enough, Jordan also creates parallel worlds and a world of dreams that is all hauntingly too real.It is with this book that readers grow to appreciate what they can expect with this sweeping epic series. It is a series not to be heralded as the most definitive book off all time; however, it is a solid, imaginitive, yet realistic, series that can hold its own in this age of fantasy."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"The events in this second book of the Wheel of Time series begin shortly after the events from &quot;The Eye of the World&quot;. Everyone is in the town of Fal Dara. The Amyrlin Seat; leader of the Aes Sedai, has arrived to meet with Rand, Mat, and Perrin, but before the meeting can take place, a raid by Trollocs and other followers of The Dark One results in Padan Fain, an imprisoned follower of the Dark One, being freed from prison. This raid resulted in Fain acquiring Mat's cursed dagger along with the Horn of Valere, which, if blown, will awaken the dead spirits to fight, regardless if the person who blows the horn is good or evil.After Fain's capture of the Horn and dagger, Loail, Rand, Mat, and Perrin set out with Ingtar and his soldiers to recover them. Mat must recover the dagger and deliver it to the Aes Sedai for healing or he will die.Meanwhile, Egwene and Nynaeve begin their journey to the White Tower in Tar Valon to begin their training as Aes Sedai. Once there, they meet two new friends, Min and Elayne, and also a future enemy, Liandrin, who ends up betraying them.Many new characters are introduced in this book, and long-lost and feared dead gleeman Thom reappears as well. The story flows along very well and the action is fast paced and exciting. The momentum picks up greatly from the first book. I've enjoyed this series so far, and I'm looking forward to the next installment. Fantasy fans will definitely enjoy this action-packed series. One aspect of Jordan's books that I've found helpful is the glossary that he includes in the back of his books. It makes it much easier to keep track of terms and places by referring to it when necessary."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"The Wheel of Time books have always been a guilty pleasure to me. They take up time that I could spend reading Dickens or Tolstoy (yeah right). Of course, I love them anyway. This series will be the one that keeps you reaching for the next book in the series.

However, it's not for everyone. Jordan is probably the most descriptive writer I have ever read and he will describe everything he possibly can in one situation in order to set the mood properly. This makes his books, and the chapters, very long. Some people don't like long and descriptive, elaborate writing like this, I do, and I believe that Robert Jordan is the best author I have ever read. Read the series in order, starting from the first book, and it will make a lot more sense and be much more enjoyable reading. I've gone back and read all of them over again at least twice."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"THe level of quality just increases with the numbers.

The reason I put five stars is to correct the 4 stars I gave Eye of the World but this should make the average more correct."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"Here we go again. There are ten books, I hope you all know. Ten fat books, and this Wheel just goes downhill. And I don't think its ever going to end. Jordan is just milking the cash cow.Now, I'm sure we all LOVED the first book. That's what everyone says, right? Well, it was great but do you know what else everyone says? I'm refering to those who have only read &quot;Eye of the World.&quot; I'm advising all of you to drop out of this series when you can. I mean, didn't you notice the problems with the first book? Childish behavior? Stupid behavior? Stereotypes? Not to mention, all the chracters were the same: men misunderstand women and vice versa. God, since when did all men and women act like this? Jordan can't portray people very well. Though he's very good at describing meaningless things like tea, clothing, scenerey to the point of frustrating excessiveness.Don't expect it to get better. The Great Hunt is exciting, with action, but for 700 pages, it is not nearly enough. Rand's chapters are the most interesting and the book comes to a pretty thrilling close. When you read, don't be afraid to skip pages. It is probably for the best.There are lots of other series in the genre that suffer these kinds of problems. &quot;Sword of Truth&quot; is as bad as it gets. Most fantasy epics cling on to Tolkien's style. And to compare Jordan and other modern fantasy authors to Tolkien's Lord of the Rings is a terrible insult. They all know how to start something but can't end it. And that is what separates the good writers from the bad ones. These guys can barely leave suspense at the end of their chapters, let alone their novels.Now the ONLY fantasy series that is worth reading &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; by George R.R. Martin. It's the greatest series since Tolkien. I know, its another epic (3 books out in what is supposed to be a 6-book series). But the exception is that the story is not seterotyped. Read the reviews for that one and forget this series.I'm not stopping you, if you're going to read The Great Hunt. But well, you'll be sorry later. Reading this one and maybe Book 3 is worth your time. The other books are worth nothing. In fact, they ARE mostly about nothing."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"If you thought the introduction to the Wheel of Time (also known as Book 1: the Eye of the World) was long-winded, you haven't seen anything yet! Robert Jordan has taken that introduction and rewritten it as the second book of his overlong series, calling it the Great Hunt.It's a great hunt, too: you'll be hunting for originality as you trudge through this 700 page episode in Jordan's elephantine epic.As with the first book, the storyline is nothing new to fantasy readers. The chosen ones that the prophecies foretold come from humble beginnings to great power (guided by a benevolent magician) in order to defeat a great evil that's plaguing or will plague all of mankind, if it ever gets around to it---but it will, don't you worry! We've got prophecy, after all! This is yet another romp across a fantasy land kind-of-novel.We do see some development in our characters, though, albeit small. Rand, Mat, and Perrin are bungling idiots for the most part, but they're learning, if slowly. Moreover, there's some further development to the subplots, which are the good bits in this huge story. We also get a limited view onto a completely foreign culture---the Seanchan---who come to invade the continent in which the main storyline takes place. Egwene's capture and torture under the hands of these people makes for a chilling and decent part of the book.Those subplot pearls are few and far between though, and not because Jordan's focusing on the main storyline. Far from it, he instead spends pages and pages describing locales with so much attention to visual detail that your own imagination is not necessary anymore. These picturesque scenes, including building styles, colors of roofing tiles, cuts of dresses, are so enormously detailed that you just stop caring. After all, there's far more to a culture than just what color boots people where in Caemlyn!The crowning touch that makes this book a near duplicate of the first one in the series occurs with the &quot;final&quot; duel between Rand and the &quot;Dark One&quot; (oh please). Yes, in case you missed it in book one, you get to see it again in book two. Is this the &quot;final&quot; duel, really? Will this ultimate evil ever just die off? No, we're on book 2 of 10 (or more)---there are more &quot;final&quot; duels to go! (Luckily, Rand doesn't duel with the Dark One at the end of books three, four, five, or six.)"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"Well, I started reading this series about three years ago, and then for some reason quitted (college and everything linked with it keeped me to occupied to read 700+ pages of each book). So it was about time that I try and read it again. This time I hope I'll last trough the whole series.Okay, now that being said, I'll say what is the main problem of this book. Let me put it this way. For six hundred and fifty pages Jordan's characters travel around, making small talks, noticing new and weird stuff around themselves all the time having in their mind some goal which will eventualy resolve itself cause \\"Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills\\". And in the last fifty pages entire story, or better, part of the whole story reserved for this book is solved. Fifty pages. One does begin to wonder did we really need those six hundred of them, six hundred pages of various characters appearing and disappearing, all making some wisecracks comments about life and the universe, every five pages Rand mutters to himself that he is not the Dragon reborn and that Tam is his father (though much less than in the first book -> in this one, he slowly starts to accept the fact). It is like stereotype of bad fantasy game (you might even call it a book). Linear travelling from point to point and events just roll by. Oh, and I cannot put out the king of pathetic endings which you will have to read for yourself (if you're going to).So to summarize what do we have here... It is average fantasy with stereotypical characters (while I could name types that appear in other books widely read) with tendency towards epic storytelling which sometimes gets out of hand.If you are fed up with television and want to realx yourself, choose this series (or just the first three books) and then upgrade your yearnings towards something better..."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"The Great Hunt is an epic fantasy novel that continues the story begun in The Eye of the World. The book follows the adventures of the same group of village boys (and girls) and, thankfully unlike The Eye of the World, this book doesn't start as a retread of The Lord of the Rings in any fashion. The unique storyline and the fact that characters are developed more three-dimensionally makes this novel even more enjoyable than the first novel. There's plenty of action, intrigue and suspense and the novel as a whole has more direction. Also, The Great Hunt ends much more satisfyingly than rushed and disjointed conclusion of The Eye of the World.As with the Eye of the World, I give The Great Hunt 5 stars and place it among the top fantasy novels every written, and I recommend this book to anyone that enjoys them, but always with the caveat placed on the later books. Sadly, Jordan has either begun milking his story line for more books and money, or he has created so many loose-ends and characters that he's unsure where to go with it. By Book 10, the handful of main characters from Book 1 have multiplied into literally a hundred that you have a difficult time keeping track of. But again, the series started off so fantastically that I still occasionally reread the first 3-4 books. Book 5 is the pivot that marks the downfall for me. You can actually read the first 3 books and they stand alone very well and can feel like a complete trilogy. Book 4 is better than the first three, but it doesn't give you the apparent resolution that book 3 gives so it's not a good book to stop on. Yet, if you're daring, you can move on, but it'll probably be to your own disappointment."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"Just like &quot;The Eye...,&quot; TGH starts out with nothing but action.

I started with book three then went to book 1 and on. The Great Hunt is a great addition to any science fiction, and fantasy collection. I have not been so enthralled by a series since Anne McCaffrey took readers to the planet of Pern, and introduced them to dragons. After meeting with some of the main characters (Rand, Egwene, Lan...) and fighting with them from Fal Dara to Tanicho, I was hooked. Robert Jordan's characters seem to come alive as I read through this book page after page, and I was glad that I got to travel with them through their various adventures, as they fought Trollocs, talked to wolves, and met with the Seanchan. Robert Jordan has set the Wheel of Time turning, creating a wonderful new Pattern for readers to follow. I have read several pieces of science fiction while waiting for book 10, Crossroads of Twilight to come out and only one other matched his spinning of the Wheel. (The Price of Immortality) One of the wonderful things about his books are the fact that it doesn't matter where you begin...the Wheel never stops turning, and according to Thom Merrilin, there is always a story to tell.

And they worked together to a degree that they have not since, as in the next book Rand is by himself for most of it, and in the fourth Perrin goes off on a mission of importance, and the three heroes have not been united since. But also we find more about the origins of Rand and how he came to be. Plus, and to my mind most interesting, we find out how Moiraine and the Amyrlin Seat tie into the story and when they tied in to it. The way Mr. Jordan did that was just captivating to my mind."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"Finishing Robert Jordan's second book in his Wheel of Time saga will only leave you almost immediately wanting more.The first lengthy book seemed a mere prequel, setting up the story of Rand Al Thor and his friends Perrin and Matt. More engrossing than the first, it will demand your attention as Jordan presents new sparring political factions who all have their own agendas surrounding The Dragon Reborn. If you haven't read the first book, you have to to have an understanding of what's going on. I would also suggest buying &quot;The World of Robert Jordan&quot; which serves as a great companion piece to the series."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"This is the first time that I have bought this book, but the second time that I have read it. This series is amazing. Robert Jordan was a master of suspense in his own way. I don't mean the Alfred Hitchcock type of murder/spy suspense, but the edge of your seat, \\"I must know what happens to these people next,\\" suspense. It's truly an amazing series."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"I really enjoyed this book and Iam looking to more of the series.

Just as good, you want to read more and it has its suprises too. I stay up late, sometimes its morning when I read this series. Sadly I am going out of town for the weekend and I didn't get the chance to pick up book three. I have just finished Brandon Sandersons Mistborn triology and Warbreaker before starting this series. I was looking for something that would not end in three books. So I was very happy to know this series has 14 books and I find them very enjoyable. If you like Lord of the Rings, D&D or the medieval time frame this will get you hooked."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"Sometimes destiny can not be avoided, or so Rand Al-Thor and his friends find out in the second book of the late Robert Jordan's immensely popular series, *The Wheel of Time*. As the story begins, things appear to be on an even keel and pretty relaxed from the denouement of the first novel in the series.All of this is soon to change, however, when a raid on the castle where the heroes are staying leads to the theft of the recovered Horn of Valere and the evil-tainted dagger of Shadar Logoth. The Horn is desperately needed to ensure that the heroes of Legend will be on the side of the Light in the story, and the dagger is needed to complete the healing and keep Rand's friend, Mat, from dying. Rand, of course, goes with the small force of soldiers in search of the Horn and dagger. Accompanying him is Mat himself and Perrin, as well as Verin of the Aes Sedai.As if all of this is not enough, Rand finds out that he is the *Dragon Reborn*, the reincarnated spirit of the guardian of the Light against the forces of darkness. All of this is a bit much, so it should come as little surprise that Rand resists this destiny as long as he can, until literally the end of the novel.Though they are not the same level of importance as Rand, Mat and Perrin are also important. Arguably, they are part of the larger picture as well. Not only are they Rand's closest friends, but they are also what is known as \\"ta'veren\\", or those whom the Wheel of Time weaves around to serve it's purposes. It is hinted that they are important as well to the prophecies of the Dragon that foretell of Rand's rise and battle with the Dark One.To say that Mat and Perrin are as resistant to their destinies as Rand is, would be an understatement. All of these divergent threads tie together in an epic confrontation and battle between the forces of good and evil. Pulled into the mix are other important characters such as Nynaeve, Egwene, and other friends of the Ta'veren.As you can see, this is quite the story. There are numerous threads to keep track of, and while it is all worth it, this is, if anything the one of the two major weakness to the narrative that I can see. The various plot threads are long and drawn out, and at times, quite *difficult* to keep sorted out and track of.The other criticism of the book that I had while reading it is that the story just did not, until about two-thirds of the way through it, have the same sense of camaraderie and friendship among the characters as the first novel did. Even though the narrative is much faster-paced, and not as boringly descriptive in parts as it's predecessor, it really suffered form this lack of emphasis on friendship exemplified in the first book. There is a criticism that the series dovetails too much with J. R. R. Tolkien's *The Lord of the Rings*, but this book avoids some of that from the first book, though not all to be sure, and suffers from this. The last third of the book with the emphasis on characters and friendship was by far the best part of the whole book.A very poignant, to me, part of that last third, was the heroic redemption and sacrifice of one of the characters. I won't say which one, so as to not spoil the book too much, but I will say that it was thoroughly touching. A character driven to desperation found redemption and hope in sacrificing himself for the sake of the heroes he believed in. The main heroes, Rand, Mat, Perrin, and their allies, later take up that calling to wage the final confrontation. This, *this* type of narrative is what makes books great. If Jordan managed to keep it up, and make the rest of the books more like the first one, and last third of the second one, this will be well-worth reading.Very rarely have I come across a secular fantasy series that I could sink my teeth into and enjoy. This is one of the few that I can take pleasure in, and boy, is it fun! :D I look forward to starting book three, titled, aptly enough, *The Dragon Reborn*. Give the series a try. You won't regret it. Recommended."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"Great series if you like the genre. The new writer for books 13 and beyond is very good. RIP Mr. Jordan."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"The Great Hunt is even better than the Eye of the World, if you could believe that! I strongly suggest continuing on in the series OR starting it if you haven't already. You will have no regrets whatsoever! I've read a lot of books, and this series is one of the best I have read, if not the best! This book is great for all ages. I'm only 15, and I suggest that anyone around my age have a good vocabulary or have the ability to assume the meaning of some words in context. I only say this because one of my subs asked if a 10 year old would be able to read this book, and I do not suggest anyone under the age of 13 or 14 to read this because you will probably get lost. So yeah...READ THIS SERIES! Robert Jordan was an amazing and talented author, and it sucks that he passed away before finishing the series, but I think that Brandon Sanderson will do a good job with the final books!"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"Spoilers.After rereading the first and second books now, I actually think The Great Hunt is superior to The Eye of the World. For one thing, it's dark. Very dark. When I first read Hunt, it was so dark, it actually took away from my enjoyment. I wasn't expecting THAT. I wasn't expecting certain chapters to turn me white hot with rage and to make me hate a fictional people group so intensely. I can appreciate the power of the story a lot better now and not get so caught up in the emotion of it. Another thing that makes Hunt a better book is that, like the first one, we are treated to a fantastic journey into the vast unknown, but unlike it, we are not constantly getting info-dumped. Exposition seems to be less as well--either that or it blends more naturally into the story. This book is also a lot more character-oriented. The first one had to spend a lot of time introducing us to characters and setting the gears of change in motion. In this book, we get to watch the gears grinding.A lot of people fault the book because of that grinding. They dislike Rand's refusal to accept the Pattern raping his life. Instead of empathizing with him in his struggle against that raping, they seem to think the raping is a good thing and that he should just accept it and be the bad-ass Lord Dragon that he is. But that struggle is part of what makes this story so good. The first book spent a lot of time getting us to recognize that this wasn't going to be a fairytale-type story. The hero of this story is no Clark Kent who finds he has these amazing powers and then flies off from the farm to kick arse and set the wrong things right. No, the hero of this story is someone who is torn from home and family and has to fight for his life so that by the time the Pattern has used him to keep the Wheel of Time turning, he hasn't slaughtered everyone and everything he loves or become so destroyed that there's nothing left of himself either. Rape is a good metaphor for this book. Egwene being raped by the Seachan, Mat being raped by the dagger, Fain being raped by Ishamael and Mordeth, Rand being raped by the Pattern. Yet it also has redemption. Ingtar's repentance and final stand gives us hope that no matter how tragic the lives of our characters become, they may not be completely lost.We get to spend a lot more time with Nynaeve, who turns out to be a pretty freakin' awesome character. We spend more time with Min (one of my faves in the series). Hurrin becomes a standout minor character. Masema goes from the only one hating Rand in the beginning to seeing him as a god-like figure at the end. We get more insight into Lan and Moiraine's \\"relationship\\" than New Spring ever offered. It is curious that we get to see females being enchanted by Galad's supernatural beauty and males being enchanted by Lanfear's. Is Robert Jordan trying to say something about appearances? The book started and ended with a unifying theme (sheathing the sword), which makes the book stand out as a complete entity unto itself. It ended with another wonderfully bizarre, distorted reality event like the first book (seeing things from both above and below, having Rand's battle with Ishamael in the heavens linked to the battles on the earth, etc). We are treated to one of the most excellent moments in the series where Rand gets to live alternate lives. We travel across surreal landscapes, encounter a \\"time trap\\" with flies, witness the unearthing of something greater than even the Eye of the World, get caught up in the absurdity of the game of houses, and watch the Dragon Reborn standing before the Amyrlin Seat. This is certainly a great hunt. The two Forsaken are, however, more annoying than they are fearful and awe-inspiring. But it is fun to watch Lanfear as she starts getting to know the new incarnation of her old lover.All-in-all, an excellent book where Robert Jordan departs from the influence of Tolkien to come into his own (with a parting farewell at the Nine Rings Inn)."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"(Excerpted from the White Tower Guide to Channeling, Section Four: So You're a Man who can Channel:\\"There comes a time in every young man's life where he begins to notice some changes - maybe you have new feelings about the Girl Next Door, or you may want to spend more time away from your parents. And there will of course be changes in your body, that's for sure. Yes, it's all part of a young man's journey into becoming an adult!Some of these changes might be a little embarrassing - acne, wet dreams, or, in some cases, channeling the One Power.Yes, some unlucky boys may find themselves able to move objects without touching them, light fires with their minds, or make the very earth under their feet shake and crack. If you have experienced unusual happenings, followed by feelings of sickness, euphoria or general unease, you may be able to channel the tainted saidin that drove Lews Therin and every male Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends horribly insane. If left alone, your future does not look good.This is Jimmy. He started channeling when he was eighteen years old. He didn't want to, and he tried to stop, but the Wheel Weaves as the Wheel Wills, and in one night he killed everyone in his village with a raging firestorm. Unfortunately, the Aes Sedai couldn't get to him in time, and he hanged himself before his twenty-first birthday.This is Freddie. He started to channel when he was twenty, and managed to hold it off for five years. Then the wasting disease set in. We would show you the other side of his face, but trust us - it's not a pretty sight. If Freddie had gone to Tar Valon earlier, he might have avoided this terrible fate.Billy here was one of the lucky ones. When he started to channel, he was quickly found by the diligent sisters of the Red Ajah. He was rushed to Tar Valon where he was gentled, making him a threat to society - and himself - no longer! Put on a happy face, Billy! You're a productive member of society again!So if you're a young man experiencing the dangerous thrill of channeling saidin, rush to the White Tower today! Your life - and the lives of those you love - may depend on it!\\")Unless, of course, your name is Rand al'Thor and you happen to be the Dragon Reborn. In that case, you have a lot more to worry about.Rand is caught in a bind. After the events in The Eye of the World, he has discovered that he's able to channel saidin, the male half of the One Power that drives the Wheel of Time and thus underpins the universe. Unfortunately for him, saidin was tainted many years ago by the Dark One, as a final revenge against those who trapped him in his prison. The result is that any man who channels saidin is doomed to go mad, waste away, and die.But Rand is not just any man. He is the Dragon Reborn, the man who is fated to face down and defeat the Dark One during the Final Battle. He is the reincarnation of one of the most powerful Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends, Lews Therin Telamon, the man who led the mission against the Dark One that ended in the Breaking of the World. If he were to go mad, it would be a Very Bad Thing, thus all the Capital Letters.He loves his friends, but fears for their safety. He wants to leave the keep at Fal Dara along the border of the Blight, but he can't. He wants to be free of Aes Sedai, but he soon finds himself before the Amyrlin Seat, the woman who leads all Aes Sedai. He cannot stay and he cannot go, and the pressure is starting to get to him, to the point where he tries the classic trick of trying to distance himself from his friends by making them think he doesn't like them anymore. Mat and Perrin know something is up with their friend, but they don't know what. As for as they know, Rand is just putting on airs and letting the fame of finding the fabled Horn of Valere go to his head. If their disdain is enough to protect them, of course, then Rand is willing to encourage it.All of this is put on hold, however, when Padan Fain, one of the darkest Darkfriends in the world, escapes from his cell in Fal Dara's dungeon and steals both the Horn and a cursed dagger that is linked to Mat's soul. Without it, Mat could die within weeks. So, they go off on a great hunt for Fain and his co-conspirators, hoping to find the Horn before it is blown and the spirits of the greatest heroes in history are forced to serve the Shadow.Elsewhere, Egwene and Nynaeve, two women from Rand's village, are on their way to Tar Valon to start their training to become Aes Sedai. There they meet Elayne, the daughter-heir of Andor, and become entangled in a plot by the Black Ajah - a fervently denied secret group of Aes Sedai that serve the Dark One. The women find themselves in the coastal city of Falme, where they face an army of nightmares. The Seanchan have come from across the sea to reclaim the rights of their ancestors, and any woman who can channel the One Power is forced into horrible slavery.It's a dense book.There were several times during the book where I looked at the diminishing pages in the back and thought, \\"Wait, isn't there more that happens here?\\" The answer, of course, is yes, but what takes up comparatively little space in the book looms much larger in my mind. The events at Falme, for example, with Egwene's captivity and the plot to set her free, to say nothing of the Seanchan occupation itself and Rand's rematch with the horrible Ba'alzamon, only take about 120 pages. The ramifications of those events, and their importance to not only this book but the series as a whole, seems to overshadow the brevity with which they're told. And so I found myself surprised that so much happens in so little space, without it feeling horribly rushed.That's a common feature of these books, which usually - but not always - comes off without a hitch. Jordan jumps between character groups, spending a few chapters here and there so that we never forget who's doing what, and with whom. There are the occasional interludes to show the wider world - in this case, the activities of the Children of the Light, a fanatical, quasi-religious group that are a classic example of how people can do evil in the name of goodness. But the information is laid out very carefully, so that once you get to the climax of the book, you know everything you need to know so that the action can move as quickly as possible.Of course, our world starts to expand as well. We not only get to see a few new places - Cairhien and Falme in particular - but we get a look inside the way the White Tower works, with Nynaeve's test to become Accepted and Egwene's new life as a novice. We get to see more of the Whitecloaks, who will do anything to preserve what they believe to be The Light. And we get a new view of history, especially with regards to Artur Hawkwing, one of the greatest rulers of the world after the Breaking, who is a constant presence throughout the book, even if he only shows up at the end.The overarching theme of this book, at least as pertains to Rand, is leadership. As the Dragon Reborn, Rand is going to have to lead the nations of the world in the last battle against the Dark One, something he doesn't feel particularly confident about. But that's destiny for you, and what he wants doesn't really have anything to do with how he's going to end up. So this book is about Rand coming to terms not only with his identity as a leader of men, but also as the man the world has hoped for and feared for so long - the Dragon Reborn.If you're reading the series, then you don't need my encouragement to go pick this up. If you're still unsure if you want to commit yourself, however, be assured that this book does exactly what it should do - it propels the story forward, keeping the energy of the first book and giving us more questions than answers. It ends with what turns out to be a surprisingly emotional sequence. As many times as I've read it, I'm still moved by Egwene's rage, Rand's determination and Ingtar's redemption.For as much as this is Epic Fantasy, which isn't so much about the characters as it is about the world in which they live, Jordan has created great characters here. People you want to know better and feel for as you read. You fear for their safety, not just physically but the safety of their very souls. When they triumph, you share their joy, and when they fail, you share that too. As big a story as this is, it's all about the characters at this point, which makes for excellent reading.Enjoy.----------------------------------------------\\"Rand al'Thor.

These books are very accessible to fans of fantasy and to those who value realism. Some may argue that they are grander in scope than Tolkien's masterful Lord of the Rings trilogy. This reviewer cannot and will not validate this most difficult of questions. They are both fantastic works. In the Great Hunt, we follow Rand al'Thor and his friends as they seek to eradicate the dark one and free the world of his tyranny. All the characters return from the first installment and there are some surprises from the modern day master of the art of fantasy writing, Robert Jordan. Trollocs, Fades, Aes Sedai and False Dragons abound in this extraordinary follow-up.

It follows our heroes from the first book, as they try and find the fabled Horn of Valere. It is very enjoyable, Jordan can tell a good story. It does however have one very large flaw that results in a sequel weaker than 'The Eye of the World'. Some of the character's are way too naive. Specifically I am speaking of Rand trusting Selene who obviously has way too much knowledge to be who she claims, and Nynaeve and Egwene blindly following Liandrin whom they had never trusted before. This level of naivete might be plausible in the first book, but not after all the adventures they have had. It weakens what otherwise is a good sequel."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"This sequel breaks the typical pattern where the author pours him/herself into a book that garners immense success and then follows it up with half-hearted volumes that ride the coattails of the original book. This book continues the strong story that Jordan began in \\"The Eye of the World\\" on the same level. The overall narrative continues at an exciting pace and the characters you fell in love with in first book continue to develop well. New characters are introduced that add to the plot in meaningful ways--no superfluous page-filling here. Jordan's second installment deserves high praise and warrants further reading in this series."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

Was very hard to put down."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"I found this version to be well done. The readers were dynamic, and seldom boring in tone. My one big issue with the presentation is the change on certain chapters to a different reader. Each of the two readers remain consistant in their seperate chapters with the pronuonciation of characters names and the names of places. However, the readers are not consistant with each other. This makes for some confusing moments as you try to figure out that a character is talking about the same thing/person/place that was being talked about just a chapter before. Someone who has read the series in paperback will have less of an issue, but I could see more problems for someone who is just being introduced to this book.Otherwise, I enjoyed this audiobook. I have read all of Jordan's Wheel of Time series available, and this is an excellent presentation of his work in The Great Hunt. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good audiobook."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"To say nothing of the book, which is excellent, I think you will really enjoy the Audio Book adaptation. It is split between two readers; a female does the interactions with the female characters in places, and a male does the parts surrounding Rand and the other males. At first this is a little distracting but you come to find out that they blend together pretty well and give you a nice sense of change, which is welcome in books this size. The book is read very well and is perfect for this series. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"Here it is, the ultimate Wheel of Time Novel. Some may disagree with me so I'll explain.This book is a big improvement over the previous one for several reasons. First of all a lot of the fantasy quest cliches in the first book are discarded here (not all by any means). for example, we get to see the characters begin to go on with their lives/careers. As a result, we get to see parts of this world we usually wouldn't get to see.There are other things that make this book stand out. Jordan has always had a problem with age... his characters don't act like they have any.. They are stuck at about 13 years of age. This is the last time that this fault can be completely overlooked because the pages are turning too fast for you to care. Add to that a plot that is complex but not overly complex and you have yourself a classic.Oh yeah, and don't forget the pyrotechnics.. about 200 pages from the end a street blows up and eventually a mid-sized city is turned into a warzone that Rommell couldn't fight his way out of.This is it folks, it's all downhill from here.. the next book introduces Faile.. a character so badly depicted and drawn that I have to take 2 stars off any rating for a book she is in... bu that's the next review."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"After the captivating seedsower that was The Eye of the World, Robert Jordan's massive fantasy series goes from juvenile to adolescent. After each main character has been faced with a problem or ability in the first book, in The Great Hunt, they start to cope with these new obstacles. Book 2 starts some three weeks after the ending of Book 1. In the fortress of Fal Dara, the Horn of Valere is stolen and a Darkfriend, Padan Fain, escapes during the attack. Rand, Mat and Perrin must set off with an Ogier and a band of Shienarans to recover it. Egwene and Nynaeve travel with the Amyrlin Seat, leader of the Aes Sedai herself, and her Aes Sedai escort to begin their training in Tar Valon. The Great Hunt is better than its predecessor. The conflict takes up where Book 1 left off, with no introductions. Rand can channel, and he must choose between endangering his friends or facing the Shadow alone. Egwene and Rand struggle to choose between what they want -- each other -- and what they must do. Mat and Perrin deal with their own problems. Mat is dying because of his attachment to a tainted dagger from Shadar Logoth, and Perrin tries to escape wolves, that he can talk to. Egwene and Nynaeve cope with problems faced in Tar Valon. In the end, however, through the machinations of the Shadow, all five characters arrive at the same destination, led by fate and pulled by Rand, Mat and Perrin. The trio are ta'veren, individuals who shape the Pattern around themselves. In the end, this is one of the most eventful books in the Wheel of Time series. There are revelations in which characters reveal their true colors, the Shadow strengthens and a people from a land across the ocean threaten the Westlands. All that is skilfully revealed on the Hunt for the Horn that can call back heroes of legend from the dead to battle the Shadow, and the dagger that Mat needs to stay alive. On the way, Rand realizes that he is the Dragon Reborn and what it is he must do. Jordan enriches the map that is present in all the books, by revealing the characteristics, customs and convoluted political battles of the land. More storylines are interwoven into the ongoing battle, new insights into the workings of the Shadow, and simply an enrichment of story, world and characters. And, to top it off, any fan of The Eye of the World that is hungering for the clash of steel on steel and serious magical destruction will not be disappointed. The climax is incredible, and unprecedented things happen in this book. Conversation with the Forsaken, a couple of great duels, a massive battle, and oddly enough, laughs. This is one of the better books of the series, and doesn't make the mistakes its predecessor and many of the later successors do. Jordan doesn't make a hash of the ending, but instead carefully plans it. Neither does he slow down the action, in fact this is the fastest-paced book of the series. The Great Hunt is worth the money, worth the read, and the series is worth the commitment."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"Here's another really fun installment of The Wheel of Time. Like The Eye of the World, The Great Hunt kept me thoroughly entertained. Everything I said in the review for The Eye of the Wold goes for this book, too.We get to meet some excellent secondary heroes and villains in The Great Hunt -- Egeanin and the Seanchan from across the sea who use captured and chained women with power to fight for them, and ship captain Bayle Doman, for example.There was only one truly obnoxious scene in The Great Hunt: three women get possessive about Rand while he lays dying. I wonder if Robert Jordan thought that women really act like that in emergency situations?Overall, I enjoyed this read -- it's certainly one of the better novels in The Wheel of Time series. The audiobook production is excellent. Too bad the cover art is so horrid. --FanLit.net"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"It is funny. I had given up reading RJ around Winter's Heart - all the characters had begun to annoy me, I couldn't remember who the minor characters were that I was reading about, and the plot had become completely bogged down. But for some reason I picked up the Eye of the World and the Great Hunt again. I couldn't decide whether to laugh or cry. Reading the Great Hunt reminded why I read the about Randland to begin with - the rich characters and complicated world - the constant excitment - the characters that aren't hateful...I would say to anyone read this book - The Great Hunt is great fun. However I would also warn that the series goes down hill after the sixth book in the series so prepare yourself for some disappointment. Maybe it would be better to read the first six books and then get someone to summarize the rest for you..."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"This was good, some of the best fantasy that I have ever read. It is an improvement to the Eye of the World. It continues to follow the tradtional fantasy guides that the Eye of the World started with. The plot improves and gets more complicated. There are new forces, enemies, whatever you may call them that enter the book and the idea of the Hunt for the Horn of Valere was good. The end of the book also has good drama and action. Three forces come together in battle, and the battle scene is awesome. The final charge, the invaders from over the sea and...well I won't spoil it, you should read it for yourself. If you have read the Eye of the World, you will have to start with that. The Great Hunt is good and anyone who enjoys traditional fantasy should try this."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"Despite the fact that the extremely famous Wheel of Time series seems to have lost some popularity with fans by the 10th book, this is a good epic (at least for the first 4 books I've read so far). Just like Tolkien allegedly created his world to explore the various invented languages, so too it seems that one of the motivations behind Jordan's creation is to suggest how mythology is born, lived and forgotten. As a result, the Wheel of Time world is centred on the idea of the revolving wheel where the succession of ages, is circular. The series contains a very well thought out universe and mythology as well as interesting characterisation and good writing. I don't really consider fantasy a favourite genre but this series has been good at least in the beginning.In this, the second book, we go inside Tar Valon as the Edmond's Field girls begin their training in channelling, and all encounter the politics behind the various Ajah's (sort of like guilds that the Aes Sedai are divided in). The book is largely dedicated to the Hunt for the great Horn which is said to possess the power to bring back the heroes of old in a time of trouble. However, there is a personal interest in the boys joining the hunt, as Mat's life depends on in. In this book we also meet the amusing Ogier race and the deadly Seanchan who bring slavery and domination to a new level.Although the fans may be right about the books faltering eventually, this one is enthralling fantasy with the richness of the world being the main strength in my opinion."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"&quot;The Great Hunt,&quot; representing the second volume in Robert Jordan's apparently never-ending series &quot;The Wheel of Time,&quot; is a great deal like its predecessor, &quot;The Eye of World.&quot; Jordan's narrative style is the same (straightforward, linear, and utterly lacking in judgement as to what to show and what not to show), his characters are the same (resolutely refusing to change in any way, regardless of events), and the basic story elements are the same (mostly an extended chase, although in this case the heroes are the chasers rather than the chasees). As before, the imaginary world Jordan has created lives and breathes more convincingly than any of his characters, though it should be noted that this is true for most writers in this particular genre.&quot;The Great Hunt&quot; does manage to improve on the first volume in several ways, however. While some of the devices Jordan employs to move his characters around seem contrived (the Waygates and Stones, for example, are little more than excuses for teleportation), he uses fewer of the &quot;deux ex machina&quot; escapes from hopeless situations that characterized &quot;The Eye of the World&quot;--though, of course, they are not eliminated entirely. The climactic meeting with the Dark One near the end of the novel seems more like an earned outcome and less like a lottery win as it did in the first book, though again, the lottery &quot;feel&quot; of the ending is not entirely missing. It is also in this volume that Jordan gives the first hints of how complex he can make things, and how he'll be able to stretch this series to 8+ books, with the introduction of the Seanchan, the Black Ajah, the Aielmen and other elements.Like all writers of epic fantasy, Jordan owes an unpayable debt to Tolkien, and is half the writer besides. Still, I suppose the same could be said for this book as I said about the first one: if you go for this sort of thing routinely, you'll enjoy this book. Otherwise, this is not inspiring material, but might be worth a read, if only to experience another fully realized imaginary land."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"Robert Jordan's the Great Hunt is a solid follow-up to the first novel in the Wheel of Time series, the Eye of the World. The Great Hunt features many of the same qualities as its predecessor, as well as some of the same pitfalls.Jordan's writing has improved since the Eye of the World. His narration and descriptive passages remain stellar and he has also improved his dialog considerably. To put it simply, the Great Hunt is very well written. One of the biggest weaknesses of modern fantasy writing is mediocre authors depending on magic pulled out nowhere to suddenly save the heroes from an impossible situation (a la Terry Goodkind). For the most part, Jordan avoids this major pitfall, although the protagonist, Rand, does seem to develop abilities at the right time. Of course, he is growing into his powers so it is only logical for the development of abilities to occur over time. Jordan's writing style has one or two other weaknesses as well. After only two novels, the Wheel of Time lacks variety of story development. The vast majority of the story follows the characters traveling to where ever it is they are going. It seems like it takes two hundred pages to get to a place and five pages to move back to traveling. In addition to both novels being devoted mostly to traveling, a lot of the same things occur in each to the travelers. For example, in both novels, Rand gets separated from the rest of the group and is aided by a new character of questionable loyalties. However, many different things happen to the travelers in the Great Hunt, so the repetition is not overwhelming.Although the Wheel of Time features a solid collection of likable and fairly realistic characters, Jordan does seem to have trouble creating a diverse group of female characters. Every main female character (there are around five at this point) is strong willed, intelligent, capable and have special abilities that few others have. While it is certainly nice to see a male author able to create strong female characters, Jordan seems unable or unwilling to create female characters from a different mold. The unfortunate effect of creating all these strong women is that the characters are very similar and have ultimately become defined by their relationship with male characters instead of their own character traits. Also, why is it that with so many of the female characters seem to fall in love with Rand so quickly? He is supposed to be an attractive young man, but so are others, like Perrin, and he is hardly a smooth talker. It just seems a little too much that so many intelligent, beautiful, strong female characters fall for him so easily.Finally, the similarities with J.R.R. Tolkien which were so abundant in the Eye of the World do continue in the Great Hunt. As in the second of the Tolkien trilogy, The Two Towers, the heroes of the Great Hunt are pursuing a party of trollocs (orcs in the Lord of the Rings) who have stolen something, the Horn of Valere in the Great Hunt, Merry and Pippin in the Two Towers. Also, a character previously assumed dead returns as Gandalf did in the Two Towers. Despite the similarities, Jordan manages to make the events unique enough that the reader cannot easily predict the outcome based solely on how it happened in the Lord of the Rings.Overall, the Great Hunt is every bit as good as the Eye of the World, and is definitely worth reading. Which one is better depends on your preference in a story. The Great Hunt focuses more on character development and plot progression while the Eye of the World is focused on world and character building. But whether the series drops off later on or not, no one should regret reading the Great Hunt."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"With \\"The Great Hunt,\\" Robert Jordan continues to build on the momentum produced with the first book, \\"The Eye of the World.\\" Rand knows he can channel the One Power and is told he is the prophesied and feared Dragon Reborn, destined to save the world while destroying it at the same time. The Horn of Valere is stolen and with it a tainted dagger Mat relies on to survive. The Children of the Light plot on Almoth Plain while invaders from across the sea threaten the land. The Black Ajah stirs in the White Tower and Dark Friends carry out their master's wishes.Even with all this excitement, two aspects make this good story into a great story:- Rich Characterization that make characters seem like real people- Complex subplots that merge together at the end to produce a grand finaleIn my opinion, the best aspect of Robert Jordan's writing is his ability to produce multi-dimensional characters. Jordan so successfully provides each of his characters their own distinct personality, likes/dislikes, conflicts, goals, and relationships with other characters in such a way that they seem modeled after real people. At many times in the book I think to myself: \\"Hey, I know someone like that.\\" Mr. Jordan seems to have given much thought into how \\"normal,\\" simple-folk would react to extraordinary situations such as being told they must save the world from destruction or that all the monsters you were scared of when children are real.One reason why I was hooked to this book (rhyme unintended) was in seeing how the characters I grew attached to after the first book would react to their new lives:- will Rand accept that he is the Dragon Reborn; how would his friends react to him knowing he can channel?- will Perrin accept that he can talk to wolves or will he try to deny it?- how will Egwene and Nynaeve handle training at the White Tower?Robert Jordan has a way of making the reader care about the characters, hate the villains and take sides, despite knowing that the book is fiction. This ability is especially rare in the fantasy genre where though a story may be good, characters are usually wooden and clearly fearless \\"heroes\\" that are hard to identify with.Another reason why I like the book is in the manner in which seemingly unrelated story threads are masterfully brought together at the end of the book in an enormous climax. This strongly reinforces the idea portrayed in the book that one cannot escape duty and that the lives of everyone are tied together to help fulfill an ultimate meaning or destiny. It provided for a very satisfying conclusion and several hours of lost sleep!That said, the above reason can also lead to some of the negative aspects of this book and other Robert Jordan books I have read. The beginning can be slow and seemingly directionless with all the separate story threads. Also some subplots are more interesting than others. However, at the end when everything converges, the book becomes truly addictive.Ultimately, \\"The Great Hunt\\" by Robert Jordan gets my highest recommendation primarily because of its rich characterization and masterfully handled subplots. A word of caution though, be sure to read book one first or you will be lost. Also, the series is extremely long and after getting hooked, there is no turning back!"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"If you've read any of the other comments on Amazon regarding Jordan's Wheel of Time series, you've probably seen alot of mixed comments. After reading over the reviews for a while, I finally decided I had to see for myself how good, or bad his work really is. There are those that complain Jordan's work is too drawn out, but so far I am enjoying his pacing. Granted, I have only read the first two volumes.I have just finished The Great Hunt, and I have to admit I enjoyed it more than the Eye of the World. Some of the characters introduced in this volume seemed to bring life into the story that I felt was missing from the first book. For some reason I enjoyed Hurrin, and Ingtar's presence, As well as the Aes Sedai and Damane Plotline. I won't spoil the story for anyone that has not read the book, but there are some turns that should be able to hold your attention. (Unless you have little of it.)The pacing may be slow, but so far I'm enjoying it.

It's perhaps the most standalone of all the Wheel of Times books (I've lent it to friends who haven't read book 1), although that's relatively speaking. It was also for many years my favorite book in the series, but that has changed as I've come to appreciate some of the latter books (notably A Shadow Rising) in the context of the entire series.The Great Hunt is aptly named. Most of the book is devoted to The Great Hunt, literally the hunt for the Horn of Valere, which is stolen early in the book. It's great because a chase is one of the things Jordan does best. Pretty much the entire book is a huge chase (the first three books are all very chase-heavy, for that matter). Much angst is expressed over fantasy authors' propensity to set their characters to traveling and the boredom that ensues as their travels occur. Traveling is far less boring with Jordan; it's always a mad dash away from danger or a desperate effort to catch someone (too bad old-fashioned travel is rendered irrelevant later).The Great Hunt features the first of Jordan's two great \\"exotic\\" created cultures--the Seanchan (the Aiel being the other). Such a culture, likely drawn from various real world analogues but stitched together and added to in such a way they become unique, is one of the great joys of a fantasy created-world when done well, achieving the right blend of not plausibility necessarily but a realness and a foreignness. It is extremely difficult to do both, which is why it can be so special (I've always maintained that it is the Tsurani alone that lift Feist's Magician above standard fantasy fare). The Seanchan are such a culture, based off Imperial China, Edo Japan, and the Persian and Ottoman empires but with exotic creatures, a cruel method of controlling channelers, and a few quirks all their own. The Great Hunt also further fleshes out Shienarian culture, one of my favorite from the Wheel of Time and with heavy analogues to generic Western European cultures and feudal Japan.The Great Hunt also begins opening up Jordan's incredible world to us. We learn much more about the magic of his world as Egwene, Nynaeve, and Elayne begin their training to become Aes Sedai. Nynaeve's test to become Accepted and the trips by Portal Stone begin to show the serious thought on the interaction between destiny and free will so central to The Wheel of Time. Carhien is our first exposure to convoluted national politics. Egwene, Nynaeve, and Elayne (collectively, the Supergirls) begin having their own adventures.Supergirls \`It's a Trap!'

In this book we begin to see how Rand must deal with being able to channel. In the beginning he is really shocked that he can channel the one power and purposely isolates himself from his friends because he he is afraid that he will unintentionally hurt his friends using the one power. He attempts to leave Fal Dara because the Amyrlin seat arrived with thirteen Aes Sedai. He was afraid that they were there to gentle him. He failed in his escape because supposedly no one was aloud to leave Fal Dara. While he was hiding, Fal Dara was attacked by Trollocs and Dark friends. During this attack the Legendary Horn of Valere is stolen and the dangerous Darkfriend Padan Fain is rescued and he steals Matt Cauthon's dagger from Shadar Logoth, without this dagger he wil slowly die until he can get to Tar Valon and be separated from it.This event is what prompts Rand to go on a recovery mission to reclaim the horn and save his friend Matt. He sets out with twenty soldiers and his three friends Perrin, Loial, and Matt, they are also accompanied by a sniffer called Hurin. He can pick up the sent of evil people based on their actions. Rand's Journey takes him to a parallel time frame because he inadvertantly channeled the one power near a portal stone. In that time frame he meets a gorgious girl wo claims she is nobility from Cairhien and got lost. They find another portal stone and travel back to the regular time period. They realize that they are now ahead of the trolloc band and must now wait for them. They wait and are able to recover the horn and dagger but are stiil separated from the soldiers and Matt and Perrin. So Rand,Hurrin, Loial, and Serene now travel to Cairhien. But on the way Serene purposely leaves them. While in Cairhien the trollocs and Padan Fain come and steal the Horn and the dagger back. Then the soldiers and Matt and Perrin arrive with an Aes Sedai named Verin. rand knows he must go to Toman head but cant gey their through a Waygate and must use a portal stone.

Meanwhile, Egwene and Nynaeve begin Aes Sedai training with unexpected results.This 700+ page novel is far too long for its own good. Robert Jordan clearly loves the world he has created, but he goes on at such length that it bogs down the story. Part of the length is due to Jordan's commitment to keeping his large cast in play even when they have nothing to do. Moiraine and her bodyguard warder Lan appear to be investigating something of great import, only to vanish from the narrative about midway through the novel. I suppose their object will be revealed in a later book, but that lack of closure weakens *this* book. A character named Selene is introduced in a manner that leads us to believe that she is important; she also vanishes abruptly, never to be seen again. I guess she, too, will reappear later, but I think Jordan would be better off leaving such characters off-stage entirely until they are ready to have a significant impact on the plot.All of these complaints probably leave the impression that I dislike the book, but I actually enjoyed it. Jordan tells a good story and has created an interesting world. I just wish he had more discipline or a better editor."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"Wow, this book starts off with a roar.In Fal Dara, Lan is brought closer to fore as he helps develop Rand's fighting skills. In doing so, they also develop a friendship. The Amyrlin Seat, leader of Aes Sedai, comes to Fal Dara, and Rand must meet with her.There are battles. The Great Hunt for the Horn begins. Rand is plagued with his usual terrifying visions.Sounds great, right? It is for a few hundred pages. Then the story gets stuck. It's like Jordan is wearing a ball-and-chain - he runs like he's free, then the chain snaps and he stumbles.Wow, this book ends with a whimper. It is just too slow.Let me put it this way: I own The Dragon Reborn, the third book. I've owned it for half a year. I don't want to read it.This book is half good, half bad. That's not enough.

It's got the same flavor s the Eye of the World, but as the story unfolds, it becomes better and better, more characters pass by and you find out more about the world, which was already detailed in Eye of the World. Anyway, it's way too tough for me to describe how cool it is, because no words have been invented for this amount of coolness so far, but believe me, when you read it, you're gonna yearn for more.

However here, just like in the first book, some of the characters act stupid e.g. Rand always denying that he is a lord. But it is a gripping book, with a lot of secrets and several stories developing simultaneously. Read it!"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"While I enjoyed the prequel, Eye of the World, the second book far surpasses it. Unlike Eye, the Great Hunt gives no hint of ripping off Tolkien in plot, and the book benefits tremendously for it. Jordan is a master of running multiple plots at once. However, one thing he didn't abandon was his ability to describe things. His attention to little detail, like how houses are built differently in different countries, is the leading factor in his ability to make his world real. If his books keep this pace, this series may yet out do Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"the horn of valere is found and blown to help with battle at falme. mat is bound even more to rand by blowing the horn. rand's first battle with the dark one is in this book."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"I mean, I read Eye of the world and when I finished I was like &quot;I have to go buy the sequel&quot;.

It's full of action, intensly interesting characters (That sounds humorous, but it's true)and puzzles and suspense. (Puzzle: Why on earth does almost everyone have a name similar to one in the King Arthur legends? Moiraine, Morgaine, Egwene al'Vere, Gwenevere, etc.) Well, anyway, this book is definately one that should be read."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"Of all the WoT books, this is undoubtedly the best. It's a long day, but you won't be able to put this text down. Oh, there are plenty of problems and holes. Jordan spoon-feeds you into submission. You love him and you hate him, because books like The Great Hunt give you so much, and yet promise so much more. I've read the next five books, but this books gives more answers than all the rest put together, with a rare glimpse of genius."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"The Great Hunt is quite possibly one of the best books I've ever read. In my short life of only 15 years, I have tried to read as much as possible, and can only comapair the feeling in the book to books considered to be for childreen, but if you haven't read them you are really missing out. When Jordan wants us to, we cry. I have never cried with a book, save for the immortal Where the Red Fern Grows, and then it was nothing like what I did with this book. When Jordan wants up to question (and I question everything I read) there is a need to stop and think, much like Tuck Everlasting, another childs book, but still charged with questions I only see in aftersight, and anwsers that lie in the heart of humanity, a veil I do not want to peer under at this time of my life. Jordan is one of the best wrighters I ever had the pleasure to read, and Conan was hardly the begining, to say the least. The Great Hunt made me feel like Sebastian in The Never Ending story. if you do not put this one in your cart now and check out, along with the first book, and the third and all of the other books in the series, then you are missing out on the best fantisy books since Tolken weaved his web."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"This book is a worthy successor to The Eye of the World, but just doesn't give enough bang for the buck. Most of the time the reader is left drooling in anticipation, to be disappointed in the next chapter. Another grudge I have is that Jordan's volumes don't stand by themselves - only a very superficial conclusion is reached in the last chapter. It shows Jordan's writing skill that he can make even this insufficient ending so enjoyable. But I don't give up my money for a single chapter's worth of enjoyment"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"This book improves even over the top-rateThe Eye of the World, developing more complexcharacters, and having previous ones return.A brilliant ending sets the stage for the nextbook."},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"My lord, watch out for this series is picking up speed that will take more than a brick FLAW to slow it down. The characters feel like my best friends. I got my girlfriend actually reading it. She doesn't even read fantasy. This should be on the FDA list for drugs because it will kill you if you try to read it to many times in a row, because 'The Great Hunt' will keep you away from food and water and even sleep.

In this book, the plot grows increasingly more thick as it is divided down the middle when the women head off for the White Tower while the men run off to find the Horn of Valere, which has been stolen. In this novel, we become more aquainted with Rand, and we are introduced to many new and interesting characters. The ending of this novel is probably the best ending of all the novels in the series of seven that have been published so far. It is not only thoroughly exiting, but it gives a satisfying conclusion which leaves you hungering for book three. This book is a must read"},{"Title":"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)","review":"The twists and turns of the search of the Horn of Valere made me stay up all night reading what will happen.

In the final scences in the Battle above the Sky, and the approach of the Whitecloaks is particularly captivating. However, at sometimes the book seems to forget to describe something, and describes it later; which i found my self reacting my seeing if i was missing pages. But the descriptions always came, which i guess must of been Jordan's little suspense ploy, but over all i really really enjoyed the book. Right now i'm looking to find the sequel.

Anybody interested in topics as leadership, financial matters, founding, strategic alliances, entrepreneurship, excellence in performance and establishing trust in the field of the non-profit business, will benefit from reading a particular chapter or the whole book. Different authors, all experts in their fields, with practical axperience participate to a wide focus of the topics in question.

I always treat myself to the various Christmas anthologies because they make a particularly nice read at the holiday season when things get so frantic you begin to wish Christmas had never been invented! I recently obtained a few of the old Signet Regency Christmas anthologies now out of print and it was truly worth the effort.If you never read another Christmas regency novella, may I recommend Mary Balogh's &quot;The Porcelain Madonna&quot;. This exquisitely written (what else would you expect from Mary Balogh?), emotionally tender and moving story is the best I have ever read in the Christmas setting, either contemporary or historical. The painfully tragic story of the difficult, prickly but kind hearted Darcy Austin, the Earl of Kevern, and the gentle, sympathetic Julie Bevan, is full of healing, joy, compassion and love. Their personal &quot;go between&quot;, the little boy from the slums, Charlie Cobban, is also a memorable character whose family, through the birth of yet another mouth to fill, brings real peace and healing to the bereaved Earl.I simply cannot speak highly enough of this charming little story - it is the sort you will want to turn to again and again when you need a little inspiration and comfort.The other stories are also good; I was quite surprised by Emma Lange's as I don't know her and she presented a well written study of a large family which is mindful of Georgette Heyer's &quot;A Civil Contract&quot;. Marjorie Farrell is a favourite of mine; she writes very well and her contribution, &quot;Christmas Rose&quot; tells a poignant story of a couple who have drifted apart through the curse of infertility (told within the proper context of the times and painfully realistic). How a foundling child first brings them together, then drives a wedge between them and then ultimately brings them peace and joy is also a wonderfully heartwarming illustration of what Christmas really means.I do recommend this collection. It's worth the effort to obtain an out of print copy. What a star is Mary Balogh!"},{"Title":"A Regency Christmas 4 (Super Regency, Signet)","review":"*** \\"The Christmas Tart\\" by Mary Jo Putney. re-read.I've actually read this one 3 times in different anthologies, and it hasn't improved on the re-reads. (Some stories do.)A young seamstress is erroneously accused of theft and turned out of the household that had employed her--the wicked employer keeping her savings, assuming they were the profit from her theft. Homeless and penniless, she's mistaken for a prostitute by the hero's friends who \\"give\\" her to him as a gift. It's Cinderella and Pretty Woman set in the Regency period, and I didn't quite buy that they actually fell in love.*** \\"A Seasonal Stratagem\\" by Sandra Heath.This story's plot is a romance standard: the rakish hero makes a bet that he can seduce (in this case, just get a kiss from) the virtuous heroine; he succeeds, but not before he's lost his heart. But then she finds out about the wager, feels betrayed, and he has to work to convince her he's serious. This isn't a bad story--it's just that there's nothing special about it, either.**** \\"The Porcelain Madonna\\" by Mary Balogh.Wow. Now this story made the whole volume worthwhile... and I'm not a fan, or even a regular reader of Ms. Balogh--she seems to turn up in anthologies I read pretty regularly, but I don't believe I've ever read one of her single titles. Maybe I should reconsider that.Anyway. This story grabbed me from the beginning. The hero is self-deprecatingly cynical about Christmas, and we first see him as the shabbily-dressed heroine is admiring the procelain madonna of the title in a shop window. A young boy tries to pick her pocket, and the hero comes to the rescue. The whole story is about his cynicism clashing with her optimism, made poignant by his desperate desire for hope.I think, if it had been written differently, this story could have been too schmaltzy, but since we get his POV with his self-deprecating remarks, and get a very clear view of his character from the beginning, it's instead funny and warm-hearted.* \\"Christmas Rose\\" by Marjorie Farrell.Speaking of the writing making the difference... this story has the opposite effect.The hero and heroine have been married for 5 years, and have drifted apart because they've been unable to conceive a child. When he comes home \\"fizzy\\" one night and sees a woman leaving a baby in a basket on an absent neighbor's doorstep, he convinces her to move the baby to his. The baby brings him and his wife together, until a servant's comment makes the wife believe it's her husband's bastard.It could have also been a poignant story, but it was told from such a distant POV that I never connected to either of the characters. Even worse, what I did learn about them made me dislike them.** \\"The Best Gift of All\\" by Emma Lange.*sigh* I really, really, couldn't like this hero who brings his mistress (and his mistress's husband) home with him for Christmas. And I couldn't rejoice with the heroine that the husband she loved decided she wasn't so bad after all.This is more a case of genre confusion than anything else, I think. It was, admittedly, entirely realistic that a Regency-era aristocratic husband would have a mistress and ignore his cit wife. I just couldn't stomach it as a romance."},{"Title":"MCSD Visual C++ 6 Desktop Exam Cram (Exam: 70-016)","review":"I recently passed both the Visual C++ 6 Desktop &amp; Visual C++ 6 Distributed Exams in one month using Mr. Lacey's exam cram books.

I like to quickly overview technical books to discover early on where the authors are leading. I often learn a great deal in this way. Not with this book, you must be prepared to be at a keyboard and concentrate on each line. There is so much between the lines and you can miss important facts if you dont think hard. You cannot breeze in to a chapter, you must work on them all in the right order. Once in there it's like being led through a maze. There is virtually no explanation of what you are doing. The theory is lacking. Terminology is thrust upon you ruthlessly. You learn a bit about the GUI in VAJ, and it helps with general familiarity with the software, oh yes, the bit you really want to know, you don't learn much about Java."},{"Title":"Programming with VisualAge for Java 2 (2nd Edition)","review":"If you want to learn how to write the generic &quot;ATM&quot;, use this. Otherwise, find another IBM RedBook (IBM's official how-to books), they're much better. Ackerley, et.al., fail - the aspects of the VAJ toolset are not explained, nor the rationale for the splitting of the panels and subtools,their interrelationships less than obvious. The &quot;connections&quot; section to tie methods to actions (event handling) is so poor that I believe their reason for not giving a better explanation was that they themselves do not understand event handling- a developer must've told them &quot;do this, and trust me- it works&quot;. When you finish, you say, &quot;well, that was a waste of time, now how do I make the best use of this tool and its environment?&quot; VAJ is a good tool, though its insistence on splitting your source code into ever-exploding snippits is exasperating and at times loses your updates.

This book does nothing to help anyone learn how to program with VAJ. it merely confuses the reader and leads them around by a ring in the nose.

I had used the product for a couple of months and gone throught the online samples.. From this perspective it leads you VERY well into further development.

It covers most of the features. The examples are easy to follow. Easy to read. However it only covers features in the Professional Edition as the preface mentioned.

I was dead wrong with this particular book. It reads like it was written in a weekend with each topic hastily reviewed with a major emphasis on scantily provided detail combined with large font types to give the visual appearance of an impressive body of work. Don't be fooled, this book is not worth the effort. You would be better served using the Visualage for Java help panels than attempting to apply any of the aspects of this book."},{"Title":"Programming with VisualAge for Java 2 (2nd Edition)","review":"The book comes with VisualAge for Java pro version 2, which was a surprise. The book contains good information, but learning Java from the book is not easy, and is made more difficult by errors. Even as you start the very first project, a figure is misnumbered in the text, making even starting the software confusing. The authors would have been well-served by having someone use or proofread the book by going through the examples, figures, and directions to comment on their usability before publication."},{"Title":"Programming with VisualAge for Java 2 (2nd Edition)","review":"I am not sure this is one of the worst books I have seen on using an IDE, but it must be on the top of that dubious list.

Just consider the following fruity passage, concerning the rapid adaptability of HIV (p. 33):\\"But students don't learn about evolution in medical school, [Palumbi] says, leaving them about as well prepared to combat HIV as a flat Earth astronomer would be to plan a moon shot.\\"Really? Do the authors of the original \\"US News and World Report\\" article (Hayden, Ruvinsky, Gilgoff and Sobel) expect us to believe that ANY graduating medical student doesn't understand that infectious organisms change and adapt (mutate) over time? That any of them escaped learning the basics of evolutionary theory somewhere in their pre-med studies?Having been involved in the whole debate for thirty-some years, I haven't met even the most rabid young-earther who doesn't believe that bacteria can become disease-resistant, or that all dog breeds didn't develop from a single wolf-like species within human history.Sorry to say I stopped reading at that point. Maybe there is more meaty data later in the book. But that absurd comment poisoned the rest of the book for me and drove me to this review (to be fair, there was a creationist book that did the same thing to me with a line like, \\"Isn't it wonderful that God made the animals to inhale oxygen and exhale nitrogen, and the plants to do the opposite?\\")"},{"Title":"The Chinese Tao of Business: the Logic of Successful Business Strategy","review":"This is a book that I had difficulty putting down. It begins in South Carolina at the Haier (China) facility and cuts through history, georgraphy, culture, politics, and of course strategy. The burning issue is why are companies running into China? As Usha Haley and George Haley point out most have never made a profit there -- and most never will. The complex answers on culture, civilization, survival and hubris should make one think. Buy this book -- and read it."},{"Title":"The Chinese Tao of Business: the Logic of Successful Business Strategy","review":"Review below stated little/no coverage of MNCs in China -- at least 3 chapters cover Western MNC strategy in China. About half the interviewees are Western MNC CEOs interviewed by George Haley and Usha Haley. There is also information of Japanese companies -- but this is less than Western or Chinese."},{"Title":"The Chinese Tao of Business: the Logic of Successful Business Strategy","review":"I agree with some of the comments of the previous reviewer -- but not all. The book is easy to read and useful,the title is funky ;-), and the part on relationships excellent. However, this book is aimed not just at Chinese companies moving to the West but also at Western companies who are operating in China and most have never made a profit there as the authors point out. As the German CEO and other Chinese CEOs tell us in The Chinese Tao, quality is paramount to success -- so are other factors (which the book spends about 300 pages going over). There are a great many statistics, especially on market size, that I found very useful. Also many case studies that are insightful. One Chinese company's moves into quality that the authors discuss in length is Haier.Overall, I highly recommend this book. Usha Haley and George Haley are regularly featured on the business news as commentators on Chinese business and government (...) and I think this book provides many helpful details and background to flesh out their recommendations."},{"Title":"The Chinese Tao of Business: the Logic of Successful Business Strategy","review":"This is a serious book with some counter-intuitive conclusions. Logical, easy to read and based on a solid theoretical foundation - I recommend \\"chinese tao\\" heartily. At a minimum it will force you to think -- at its best it should bring about a serious retructuring of what it means for us to do business in China, and vice versa."},{"Title":"The Chinese Tao of Business: the Logic of Successful Business Strategy","review":"I read Chinese Tao on an overnight flight to Beijing, after reading a news interview with author Dr. Usha Haley and I found the book very helpful. I wish I had read it earlier. Although this book is clearly written and in a jargon-free manner, it does present some complex and counter-intutive ideas that need digesting for full impact.For a novice to China, I would recommend reading the book about a month before making a trip to China -- and then perhaps again after returning. Old China hands in my company also found the book helpful to explain why things did not move as they thought they should in their business dealings."},{"Title":"The Chinese Tao of Business: the Logic of Successful Business Strategy","review":"A must read book for China aficionados, businessmen and politicians.

Many practical insights dealing with tough local issues such as corruption, but very sensitively handled.Liked the review in China Daily (China's leading English-language newspaper) from last month:\\"On its own, such an analysis could be very abstract and academic. But when combined with a broad overview of Chinese history, interviews with leading Chinese businessmen and illustrative case studies, the result is a very perceptive and readable analysis of Chinese business strategy. Anyone who has worked in China will recognise the underlying credibility of the picture that emerges.\\""},{"Title":"The Chinese Tao of Business: the Logic of Successful Business Strategy","review":"Excellent, easy to read book, brimming with insights based on solid research. Dr. George Haley et al. have written a book that no manager (whether currently doing business in China or planning to do so in the future) should be without. Buy it and read it -- carefully."},{"Title":"The Chinese Tao of Business: the Logic of Successful Business Strategy","review":"If you are wondering why your company is spinning its wheels in China -- this is the book for you. Usha and George Haley have written a marvellous book on culture, civilization, history and its impact on business. The CEO interviewees read like a who's who in Chinese business (Lee Ka Shing, Stan Shih, Pan Shi Yi, etc.) and include top managers of the major Western business interests (from Philips, GE, Bayer, etc.). Despite the vast and ambitious area covered, this book does not assault the senses: engagingly, even wittily written, it smoothly and effectively conveys the problems and strategic opportunities of doing business in China. I strongly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Chinese Tao of Business: the Logic of Successful Business Strategy","review":"Why are most US companies losing money in China? What can we do about it?

But, if reviews are your thing -- read the Wall Street Journal review of The Chinese Tao. It was the only book recommended on Asian business last year by this illustrious publication.I really liked the book -- and I read it too. I have lived and worked in Asia all my life and have done business with China for the last 10 years. I learned a lot from the authors."},{"Title":"The Chinese Tao of Business: the Logic of Successful Business Strategy","review":"This book goes beyond other business books about China. Other books tell you the story of foreigners making business in China or troubleshooting books helping you to survive in a Chinese environment. The Chinese Tao of Business goes to the core on how Chinese companies work. You will understand why China will influence our own way of doing business in the forthcoming future."},{"Title":"The Chinese Tao of Business: the Logic of Successful Business Strategy","review":"[...]The Chinese Tao has received over 50 favorable reviews in the media, including in China Daily, the Wall Street Journal, CNN (a special report on the book), Voice of America (which ran a special program on it), the South China Morning Post and numerous other journals/magazines around the world -- including in Asia and China (...) It was on the best-selling list in Asia for over 4 months! I can hardly turn around without seeing the authors discussing the book on TV or in the press. It's unlikely to have gotten so much local and international attention if it contributed nothing except media clippings.[...] Most write about Chinese strategy without ever speaking to the CEOs that make it. The authors here had in-depth access to about 30 CEOs of Chinese and Western companies that worked in China. This alone makes the book worth reading. The numerous cases, statistics and history add to the comorehensive flavor. The authors certainly have a point of view [...]"},{"Title":"The Chinese Tao of Business: the Logic of Successful Business Strategy","review":"So you are doing business in China and are spinning your wheels. You've read the culture and etiquette books and the ones on market potential. STOP! Read no further until you read the Chinese Tao. This unassuming (though not little) book packs a punch. If you want to make money in China as a private business, everything is conspiring you -- history, culture, laws and managers -- and mastering them, or atleast anticipating the punches, is key to success in China. A thoroughly enjoyable book, and Usha and George display wry humor through the sometimes weighty material. Recommended reading!"},{"Title":"The Chinese Tao of Business: the Logic of Successful Business Strategy","review":"I found this book very well-written, full of anecdotes and personal nuggets as well as statistical backing. In sum, it explained for me the contradictions, opportunities and pitfalls behind the \\"China miracle\\". I have read several books on China and I recommend this one over the rest.A book of this kind is very difficult to write, as the authors chose to incorporate history, culture, modern business practices and the law (among other things!) to explain business success and failure in China. However, depsite their tall task, they did a good job. I especially liked the historical and political grounding combined with really fabulous personal interviews with CEOs. Some of the stories were fun (the golf story with Li Ka-Shing) and some were insightful (Pan Shi Yi's rise). I found the chapter on legal affairs in China useful but heavy going. However, regulatory risk is a big component of operating in China (just ask all those companies that have lost their patents there) and there is probably no \\"fun\\" way of communicating this. The authors' insights and recommendations were very useful.This book should be read carefully and digested. I certainly do not advocate an overnight read (300+ pages!) but some chapters must absolutely be read before foriegners go to China -- and I think before the Chinese go abroad. George and Usha Haley have cut behind the hyperbole to reveal some very disturbing truths about this super power and the global business environment which it has changed for ever. More importantly, they have given us some ammunition to help us to control our destinies in this brave new world. A must read!"},{"Title":"The Chinese Tao of Business: the Logic of Successful Business Strategy","review":"I found some information useful and interesting. However, what was disappointing was the stilted writing of the authors. I often got the impression that they were too repetitive and presented the work as if it were an instructional manual. Also, there was the feeling that the book was edited in a cut and paste format. Overall, there were interesting anecdotes, but this book will never be a THE reference for foreigners trying establish businesses in China."},{"Title":"The Chinese Tao of Business: the Logic of Successful Business Strategy","review":"Actually, I like the book despite the somehow funky title. The authors try to make sense of Chinese business and they do a pretty good job. They argue that it is misleading to judge chinese business with the same standards like in the west. Apart from Tao, which I think is actually not that important to understand the authors points, some of the basic Chinese values are explained and put into a cultural context. Especially revealing are the patterns of trust. It is often frustrating for Western Businesses when confronted with the Chinese attitude to intellectual property rights. The authors argue that it is not shrewdness or fraudulence that guides their behaviour. Their advice: When in China, try to understand Chinese business patterns and play by their rules. Quite a general rule but still hard to follow for westeners. The book contains a lot of practical advise.The downside is that the book is based on interviews with executives only but not on really thourough statistical analysis. For instance, it is interesting that they regard product quality as already very important in the chinese market, but the authors cite he same person several times (a German!) to support this claim. Though the subtitle of the book is the 'logic of successful business', successful strategies of western firms in China are covered on two pages. Apparently, no Japanese business executive was asked although Japanese firms are among the most successful in China. In addition, there are contradictions, for instance they advise to 'invest for success in the long run' but at the same time 'get out of the country soon when you don't make money'."},{"Title":"The Chinese Tao of Business: the Logic of Successful Business Strategy","review":"Usha Haley and George Haley would be considered among the top academics on business in Asia and China. Their research is covered in the news almost weekly. Therefore, it is no surprise that their latest book is a \\"must read\\". Insightful, no holds barred, theory-based, surprising, logical, humorous, beautifully written -- and yes, I learned quite a bit from them after working on business in China (futilely) for several years. For obvious reasons, I will not divulge my name or company -- but suffice to say our company now puts \\"The Chinese Tao\\" on its to-read list whenever we work on a project in that country. Strongly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Chinese Tao of Business: the Logic of Successful Business Strategy","review":"Never dull and a surprizingly easy read, despite the wide swathe this book cuts -- philosophy, legal environment, strategy, and most importantly, recommendations for success. I strongly recommend the latest book on Chinese business by Dr. George Haley and Dr. Ushe Haley."},{"Title":"The Chinese Tao of Business: the Logic of Successful Business Strategy","review":"Very informative book. Having done some business in China, I was impressed by the insights. Certainly some of our mistakes were covered and solutions offered. I bought a copy for everyone in my division."},{"Title":"The Chinese Tao of Business: the Logic of Successful Business Strategy","review":"Although it never talks down to you, this book is very helpful to outsiders who want to succeed in Chinese business. Written by 2 American experts on business in Asia, Chinese Tao provides a great overview of the cultural, legal, and economic differences in China's business environment that may escape most -- yet that affect business performance. With their extraordinary access to business leaders in China, and their insights into what it takes to succeed in the new Chinese economy, the authors have also written a book that should help Asian businessmen, who are rarely introspective or analytical. A must read for anyone doing business in China or studying business operations there."},{"Title":"The Chinese Tao of Business: the Logic of Successful Business Strategy","review":"Usha and George Haley are in the media so often elaborating on some aspect of their research that I missed the obscure bad review of The Chinese Tao that was mentioned below. I remember the CNN special report on The Chinese Tao. I also saw it reviewed very favorably in China Daily when I visited China last month.I think the reviews (both by Mr. Wong and the Internet publication he mentions) are unfair. Yes, there are a few typos -- but I'd be hard-pressed to find a book published today that does not have them! Ah, for the good old days of type-setting...I first read Chinese Tao because it was on the best-selling list in Asia for so many months -- and I make frequent business trips to China. I re-read the book several times because it made sense to me. I bought it on Shanghai airport when I left my copy at home.The authors are authoritative and the book is very well-written. Despite the vast terrain it covers, it flows well. Unlike other authors on China books (which has become an industry), the authors had some excellemt personal interviews with major industrialists who have succeeded in China. They also had clearly done a lot of pain-staking research and know the history and culture extremely well.I strongly recommend this book and have used it in my company (with teams going to China) with very good results -- especially the AHA factor and a better understanding of why business is so complex and difficult there, and what to do about it."},{"Title":"The Chinese Tao of Business: the Logic of Successful Business Strategy","review":"This book excels as an easy to read and to understand primer for doing business in China. Many foreign businesses are unaware of the pitfalls and opportunities that lie in wait for them -- including the extensive reach of the Chinese government, and the cultural/historical factors behind this. Because of this, I recommend the Chinese Tao of Business as essential reading for any US company in China. As the authors also highlight cultural and social misperceptions that permeate our business decisions, it is probably also essential reading for any Chinese company doing business in the West. George Haley and Usha Haley have done an excellent and monumental job of communicating the complex Chinese business terrain."},{"Title":"The Chinese Tao of Business: the Logic of Successful Business Strategy","review":"I am a fan of George Haley's and Usha Haley's work. Both give straight forward, honest advise from the hip, and their many books testify to this. Yet, I am not exaggerating when I say this is the best book on doing business in China that I have read (and I have read them all because I do business there). This book is honest, it's grounded in theory and practice, its philosophically based yet beautifully written. George and Usha have written a must-read book on how to succeed in China. Read it or die!"},{"Title":"The Chinese Tao of Business: the Logic of Successful Business Strategy","review":"Although loaded with theory on the front-end, this book is realy great on explaining why China remains \\"foreign\\" toWestern companies and what they can do to make profits.I really enjoyed this book. It is extremely well written and even the theory was palatable. Novices and old-China hands will find something they can take away from this book."},{"Title":"The Chinese Tao of Business: the Logic of Successful Business Strategy","review":"I bought the Chinese Tao of Business after hearing authors Usha and George being interviewed for the hour on VOA's Talk to America. The civilizational chasm which covers not only the Tao but other Chinese philosophy provides an interesting and convincing base for the strategic and managerial implications the authors provided. The book is also very topical even covering the SARS epidemic and the Chinese handling (unfortunately not brought up in the program, but time was short). I strongly recommend this book to understand how business works in China. I look forward to hearing both authors again."},{"Title":"The Circus at the End of the World","review":"In less than 200 pages Brackenbury creates characters who depend on their strength and conviction to carry them through the dreary hardship that turn most people into whiners. But these characters don't whine; they win. And they juggle (literally and figuratively) to explain life to themselves. Brackenbury, who is a poet, uses the tightness and verbal tension of poetry to create vignettes of landscape, personal and natural, that will stay with the reader long after the book is done. Each of the characters is a protagonist, each situation inevitable. There is great unity of purpose here. A young man's search for his mother is really a search for himself; a deserted lover's fierce focus on a vineyard is a fulfillment of self. A quick read, good and satisfying."},{"Title":"Who's a Goblin?","review":"This is a cute little rhyming book about a little boy who thinks he sees a Goblin on Holloween.

The storyflows nicely and children will be able to follow easily.A very nice little book.Shirley Johnson"},{"Title":"Outside and Inside Giant Squid","review":"As a longtime fan of cephalopods in general and squids in particular, I was very impressed by this book. It's quite good at being accessible to readers of a fairly young age while not \\"dumbing down\\" the science at all. It has a variety of color plates, both from giant squid dissections (from the lab of Clyde Roper, one of the world's foremost experts on the giant squid) and from pictures of other squids in their natural environment. (Until recently, no one had ever seen or photographed a giant squid in its environment at all, so showing smaller squids is really the best way to illustrate these amazing animals... and Ms. Markle is careful to describe which pictures are giant squids and which are smaller ones.)This is a great book to get for a budding marine biologist... I expect it's interesting enough to hold the attention of a lot of kids, but it will particularly appeal to those who are excited to visit the Monterey Bay Aquarium or watch Jaques Cousteau documentaries.It's important to note that this is really a biology book, and it does show photographs of dissected animals. I don't find it disturbing at all, but for someone extremely squeamish, that could be an issue."},{"Title":"Outside and Inside Giant Squid","review":"I had to learn a lot about the Giant Squid and this book was so great, and excellent for elementary learners especially."},{"Title":"Cdo and Mapi Programming With Visual Basic","review":"This book is very thin, but don't let that throw you. The examples are easy to follow, and very concise. I just wish that there was a .NET version available."},{"Title":"Cdo and Mapi Programming With Visual Basic","review":"For the size of this book, it does a good job of covering the MAPI/CDO (both Win32 API and ActiveX) objects at an intermediate-programmer level - presenting the objects and object models with enough information that you can begin to use them right away, but not getting so technical that you lose interest or begin to only understand the minority of what you are reading.The author does include sample code for most of the objects that are covered, although many of those sample codes are spread out over a page or more and separated by paragraphs of explanatory text which can cause a little delay for readers that skim, or jump directly to topics, as back-tracking is often needed to find the start of the desired code. The publisher's web site does provide a download for some of the sample code - but the download only includes the full projects the book goes into, and not most of the smaller projects or snippets used in the bulk of the book.I did find that the author had included many unnecessary screenshots for a book aimed at intermediate to advanced programmers; it was also frustrating that many of the screenshots the author choose were of related topics but only used to explain how to \`point-and-click' through making settings changes, rather than how to perform the task programmatically. One such example is the Mail control panel applet, where the author showed how to add an information provider to the selected user's profile (in the book's case the Personal Address Book service was added) but did not cover how to do it through programming. In fact, it was never mentioned if the task could even be performed programmatically.Overall, the book is a great reference for MAPI/CDO objects and will come in very handy for anyone needing to generically access the common e-mail functions and folders (inbox, calendar, contacts, etc.) quickly."},{"Title":"Cdo and Mapi Programming With Visual Basic","review":"This book is written in a warm, conversational tone.

After all, it's the Bible! The NIV (New International Version) is a great, accurate and understandable version.The print is very readable and the verse numbers are in bold type which makes it easier to distinguish from the regular lettering.It only comes in hardcover and I would like to see it in a leather or bonded leather soft-cover. Also, I was hoping for a &quot;verse by verse&quot; set up in a &quot;Drill Bible&quot; (as it is in the King James or New American Standard Versions) instead of the standard NIV &quot;paragraph by paragraph&quot; layout (the reason I only gave it four stars). Although paragraph by paragraph is more readable for other uses.All in all, it is a great basic Bible for the price."},{"Title":"Arab Human Development Report 2003: Building a Knowledge Society","review":"There is a great deal of value in this report. However, it does not squarely face the profound problems caused by Arabic diglossia i.e. using Modern Standard Arabic for writing and formal speech and the numerous Arabic \\"dialects\\" for normal conversation.Modern Standard Arabic is based on the Arabic of the Quran and has the same relationship to the spoken forms of Arabic as Classical Latin has to modern French or Italian. The prestige of the language of the Quran in Islam, and the fact that Modern Standard Arabic is similar throughout the Arab world, have combined to support the opinion among many Arabic speakers that their native spoken language is \\"bad Arabic\\". Of course, Modern Egyptian or Moroccan Arabic is no more \\"bad Arabic\\" than the language of Madrid is bad Latin. The tremendous barrier to education and modernization of diglossia is described in \\"Language Education and Human Development Arabic diglossia and its impact on the quality of education in the Arab region\\" http://literacy.org/products/ili/pdf/OP0002.pdf.An analogous situation was overcome in Europe during the renaissance by the development of the vernaculars as literary vehicles. In all likelihood, something similar will have to happen in the Arab world by either adopting educated spoken Egyptian Arabic as a universal standard or by the development of a few regional standards based on the educated speech of major regional cities."},{"Title":"Preparing for Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional McP/McSe Certification","review":"Buying this book is your first step to MCSE. I was very impressed with the presentation of the subject, the pictures, and the alternative resources offered in this book. This book was obviously written by a teacher that wants his students to do more than read the material. Tennefoss starts at the beginning, takes your hand, and leads you through everything with detailed pics and instructions. If you want your MCSE, THIS is the book that you should start with. I like the idea of studying for the MCSE, and getting the MCSE step by step, not with one book that has a 1,000+, in-your-face, pages that you have to know. GET THIS BOOK!!!!"},{"Title":"Designing for the Web: Getting Started in a New Medium","review":"I found this book by accident in the library when I was starting the process of designing our office's web site. Because I was a rank beginner to the world of web design (although I knew the PC, Windows 98, Microsoft Office, FrameMaker, PageMaker and a little Photoshop), I needed some hand-holding to get my feet wet. This book was better than anything else I found for that task.There are other web design books I like (like Roger Black's book on Adobe Press) but this is the best one I have seen for the person who literally knows nothing about the topic.Yes, it was written in 1996 and is somewhat dated for the person who wants to be cutting edge, but you have to crawl before you can run, and this book got me through the crawling stage so I could start to feel comfortable with the concepts I would need to work with my Adobe (and now Macromedia) software.The writing style is crisp and clean and right to the point. I read it in three hours.Try this book if you don't know anything about web design, then take a look at Roger Black for one designer's viewpoint on design issues. Once you have those two books under your belt, the author's latest book, Web Design in a Nutshell, would be a great next step."},{"Title":"Designing for the Web: Getting Started in a New Medium","review":"I found this book to be a great way to become familiar with the range of issues that come to bear on incorporating graphics into a web page. Despite the exclusive use of Photoshop in the examples, the concepts are explained in such a way that makes it easy to identify the same graphic-editing techniques needed to be used with other software such as Paint Shop Pro, my graphic editor of choice.

Her history is gloriously downwardly-mobile as she abandons her arid marriage and ancestral home to find love in the arms of her husband's ex-mistress and life in the underground activities of the new communist movement during the Revolution of 1848 in Paris. Warner's delight in the absurd and the romantic is balanced by her meticulous sense of history; first published in 1936, her narrative's vitality reflects her new political excitement--she joined the communist party in its fight against fascism in 1935--and her day-to-day delight in her ongoing lesbian relationship with poet Valentine Ackland. Summer Will Show is the best &quot;lesbian novel&quot; I have read; celebratory, funny, and worldly-wise, it carries no trace of the anxiety in Radclyffe Hall's The Well of Loneliness and most other representations of lesbianism of that time."},{"Title":"Summer Will Show (Virago Modern Classics)","review":"Summer Will Show is Sylvia Townsend Warner's most bold lesbian novel. The book uses numerous scenes and even characters from other great English novels such as Great Expectations. After Sophia Willoughby loses her children to smallpox, she goes to find her husband with his mistress in Paris. She finds them both and his mistress Minna and Sophia find themselves unnaturally drawn to each other. Eventually they find themselves to be soulmates and both become actively involved in the French Revolution. The book contains the wonderful style and metaphors characteristic of Sylvia Townsend Warner. A must-read for Warner fans."},{"Title":"Summer Will Show (Virago Modern Classics)","review":"NYRB's reissue of one of Sylvia Townsend Warner's greatest novels could not be more welcome. Written after her conversion to communism the year before, Townsend Warner's 1936 novel is her most romantic, and shows the pleasures of abandoning yourself both to another heart and to a larger political cause (and indeed the two are often conflated in the novel). SUMMER WILL SHOW is not as formally innovative as Townsend Warner's next novel, THE CORNER THAT HELD THEM, but it may well be more challenging because of its intellectual sophistication: though this is a love story and a historical novel, it is also very much a novel of ideas.Its heroine, Sophia Willoughby, enjoys a great measure of independence living at her ancestral mansion Blandamer House overseeing the management of the estate and the raising of her two children. Her rakish husband spends most of his time in London, or in Paris seeing his mysterious mistress; this is largely as Sophia prefers it because his absence allows her to do largely as she pleases. But when smallpox carries away both children in 1847 in the novel's bravura first section, Sophia is left without much purpose in life, and she surprises herself the next Feburary by traveling to Paris to see if her husband will grant her more children. And then she surprises herself again by falling in love with his mistress, Minna, an extremely ugly but mesmerizing storyteller who is also a leading figure in the February 1848 revolution against Louis-Phillipe.The third and fourth sections of the novel have their longeurs as far as action goes, but they are absolutely essential to the meaning of the novel. Townsend Warner's characters never do or say quite what you'd expect (or what they would), and the movement of their ideas--and of Sophia's character--is so complex as to be nearly impossible to chart out. Yet nothing here feels forced or unnatural. This is one of the smartest books of the 1930s, and absolutely essential to understanding how British writers of the period were attracted to the promises of international communism particularly during the Spanish Civil War."},{"Title":"Summer Will Show (Virago Modern Classics)","review":"I can't speak for everyone else, of course, but to me Sylvia Townsend Warner is a bit of a surprise. She doesn't seem to be very much read these days, and in many respects she'd be perfect for today's audiences. She had some profound political wisdom, she never did the same thing twice, and she was one of the earliest writers in English to examine gay themes and content on a regular basis. So get with it, audience.On the other hand, she spent a considerable amount of energy on historical novels - her early career as a musicologist involved collecting church music from the Tudor period in England's 15th and 16th centuries. When she turned to fiction writing, she set several novels in times not her own. Maybe that's why today's audience has missed her. Even with the politics and the gay content, historical fiction is a hard sell these days.\\"Summer Will Show\\", for instance, the author's 1936 offering, takes place about 90 years before that, largely in Paris. We'll get to the characters in a minute, but first let's set the scene. In 1848 France is about to experience yet another in a long series of revolutions. There was a king, Louis Philippe, and the people were sick of him because the economy was lousy. Next thing you know, people are setting up makeshift barricades across the roads and fighting the national troops, waiting for the king to step down. And of course, food is scarce, and there's certainly no time for fancy-schmancy affectations like art.Meantime, over in England, a wealthy landowning heiress named Sophia Willoughby has sent her philandering husband packing and devoted herself to caring for her two young children. It's no spoiler (the information appears on the back jacket of the book) to tell you that both kids die of smallpox, leaving Sophia with little to do. After a few tries at redefining herself, she goes after hubby to demand that he come home and give her another child, but surprises herself by falling in love with her husband's ex-mistress, the performing Jewish storyteller Minna Lemuel.So what we've got here is a rich lady who falls in love with another woman and thereby enters into her new partner's association of bohemian artists and secret communist revolutionaries. This actually seems fairly straightforward, and not even an original plotline. In this case, though, the emphasis is not on how the main character changes. Rather, we get to see how both women change and stay the same. It's a risky maneuver, because watching people not change isn't particularly interesting. Townsend Warner pulls it off because she's very wise about one aspect of human nature - people may change their political opinions, their sympathies and even their sexual orientation, but they seldom change their behavior.Sophia, for instance, approaches every circumstance of her life with the same grand certainty that she knows what's going on and how to bend it to her will. She knows how to manage a great estate and goes about trying to manage the new revolution in the same way. She's in for a big surprise, of course.Minna, too, clings to pretty much the same behavioral pattern whether it's effective or not. The child of a Jewish community in Poland wiped out in a pogrom, she learns to survive by telling the story of her life in manner that fascinates anyone within earshot. Which is all very well when people have the leisure to sit around and complain - when they're starving, no one has the time or the money to listen to Minna.So, as usual, Sophia and Minna must confront their public and private lives, a process made more urgent by the fact that both aspects of life are undergoing a revolution. Public life is in flux, to such an extent that Sophia the landowner finds herself providing scrap metal to a communist cell. As for private life, it's fairly clear that neither of these women have even considered gay love before. Not that either one of them tells the other \\"I love you\\" in so many words. A professor of gay literature could probably explain why Townsend Warner left that bit out - I can't tell whether she felt overt lesbianism would chase all the publishers away or whether she was just being coy - but interestingly, the absence of any obvious love-talk makes the relationship seem more real. \\"Summer Will Show\\", by avoiding any academic discussion or abstract theorizing, shows just how it might be to live as a lesbian during a revolution.I'll bet most people never even wondered what that would be like, let alone looking for a work of art that would express it, but leaving the specifics aside, there's something exhilarating about a simultaneous revolution in public and private life. You might not enjoy an actual life in which all bets are off - on the other hand, you'd probably enjoy reading about it, especially when the narration is so skillful. It's important, for instance, to see that even with food scarce and possible danger close by, Minna's storytelling abilities are amazing enough to attract an audience of children in a public park without even trying too hard. Townsend Warner was good enough to write that scene in such a way that we believe it, which makes it easier to believe that Sophia would stay with her.The novel starts with a quick poem to explain the title - \\"Winter will shake, spring will try / Summer will show if you live or die\\". Which could mean a great many things, but one thing's for sure; if there's to be a revolution, public or private, our old ways of doing things will not be sufficient. This story is useful in showing us how that might work, for better or worse.Benshlomo says, One way or another, the revolution's here."},{"Title":"Dunnan's Guide to Your Investment$ 2000: The Year-Round Investment Sourcebook for Managing Your Personal Finances (Dunnan's Guide to Your Investments, 2000)","review":"Since becoming an investment professional in 1988, I've been purchasing this book regularly for my library since it caught my eye in the early 90's. Dunnan employs a simple, easy-to-read style in compiling an investment sourcebook that serves simultaneously as a &quot;how-to&quot; manual and a reference guide, without implying that the reader is some kind of dummy.Each of the 36 chapters contains easy to understand, practical information interspersed with helpful hints and cautionary asides (denoted by a checked box and a little cannonball bomb, respectively) that add a clever dimension to the financial discourse. What impresses me most about this book is that Dunnan has no bias (unlike other noteworthy publications) when it comes to the topic of investment advice and fees. She provides encouragement and insight as to how to get the most out of your own efforts, if you feel comfortable on your own, or out of your investment professional, if you don't. Topics range from beginning to complex investment vehicles, choosing financial professionals, financing major purchases, on-line investing, and considerations related to insurance and retirement. There's even a chapter on the tax status of your investments, arranged alphabetically by subject. All throughout, there are numerous listings of alternative information sources (e.g., organizations and publications) to bolster your education. In the back of the book you'll find a decent glossary (conspicuously absent in other books) of Wall Street jargon. Unless your goal is to day-trade, this book is for everyone who has a question involving the world of money and investments."},{"Title":"Darwin and the Barnacle: The Story of One Tiny Creature and History's Most Spectacular Scientific Breakthrough","review":"Charles Darwin's contribution to science looms ever larger, as his work on evolution continues to be confirmed as elucidating the foundation of life on Earth. His account of his travels on the _Beagle_ are still enjoyed by readers looking to see how he began his insights, and his writings on the evolution of species and humans are of course well known and epochal. Less appreciated these days is that Darwin did not always write on the big subject, but he disciplined himself by writing on the small. In _Darwin and the Barnacle: The Story of One Tiny Creature and History's Most Spectacular Scientific Breakthrough_ (Norton), Rebecca Stott has taken one important aspect of Darwin's long career, with the idea that the barnacles, in many ways, were the making of Darwin as a scientist. Much of this information is not particularly new and is covered, though in less depth, in the many Darwin biographies. However, Stott's attention to Darwin's barnacle work, his family issues of the time, and his growth as a biologist focuses welcome attention on an important part of his life and career.After his return from the _Beagle_ voyage (and his first collection of a barnacle specimen), besides writing up his journals and discoveries from his voyage, Darwin formed his first ideas about the origin of species and evolution. He wrote up his ideas, but refrained from publishing; he not only knew how controversial evolution would be, but he realized he needed to issue these ideas after having more basic biological knowledge. So for eight years, from 1846 until 1854, Darwin worked on barnacles. He had to dissect hundreds of them under the microscope. He had to work with both the adult forms and the free-swimming larval forms. He corrected misconceptions and made startling discoveries about their sex lives. As a result, his eventual volumes on barnacles were the sum of all knowledge in the field, and continue to be used by specialists. His home in Kent became the world capital of barnacle studies, with specimens and scientific visitors constantly coming in and out. He gained new ways of writing in scientific jargon, but also ways of carefully building up an argument, using his own doubts on an issue to gather evidence to present a solution. He gained first hand knowledge of zoology and embryology. He had a firmer concept than almost any biologist of what a species was, and what the relationship between species was. Natural and sexual selection, ever on his mind, were confirmed in his studies on all the myriad variations of the humble barnacle. After his eight years toiling among the _Cirripedia_, he began his work on his _Origin_, and it was a grander and more confident work than it would have been had barnacles not been his companions all those years.Stott's accomplished retelling of the barnacle stories is accompanied by descriptions of Darwin's extensive medical problems over the same years, and his treatment by a quack's \\"water cure.\\" There are stories about his visit to the Crystal Palace with his family. There are also accounts of his loving relationship with his wife, and his exemplary capacity as a father. These years also included the sad death of his beloved daughter Annie. Most important, however, is how the barnacle years transformed Darwin. While he is reviled by many because of his clash with their religious opinions, Stott has concentrated on the celebrated characteristics of Darwin the scientist as formed and manifested by his laborious conquest of an uncontroversial corner of natural history. She has done students of Darwin the service of showing how important he was for the barnacle, and how very important the barnacle was for his scientific development."},{"Title":"Darwin and the Barnacle: The Story of One Tiny Creature and History's Most Spectacular Scientific Breakthrough","review":"Read 'Darwin and the Barnacle' as a prequel, if you will, to Darwin's 'Origin of Species'. It was Darwin's work on barnacles that prepared him for 'Origin'--the one book for which he will be eternally known, and wherein he articulated his theory of species evolution by natural selection.Following Dava Sobel's 'Longitude,' the past few years have provided us with a flood of books on the theme of \\"the lone man of genius and his scientific discovery that changed the world.\\" With rare exceptions, however, many of these have been less than profound or failed to make the case for the true relevance of their topic. Stott's 'Darwin and the Barnacle,' however, is a fine exception, and a book of a wholly different order. She forgoes the typical formula (misunderstood scientific hero fights haughty, blinkered scientific establishment to prove out his discovery that is destined to change the world). Instead, Stott's story provides a balance between exceptional narrative (the drama of scientific discoveries that truly do change the world, after all, makes great subjects for narrative), and solid, informed research.Best of all, Stott avoids the \\"lone scientific genius\\" syndrome, by demonstrating that Darwin, as he worked on his barnacles, became the center of a world-wide scientific network that took advantage of nineteenth-century social and technological advances (a postal system, railways), institutional developments (burgeoning scientific societies, and scientific professionalization), and European imperialism (colonized outposts, and voyages of scientific discovery).History of science is too often either popular (though shallow) drama, or thorough (though impenetrable) scholarship. \`Darwin and the Barnacle' is the best of both worlds, with the pitfalls of neither. Substantial and entertaining, well written and well researched."},{"Title":"Darwin and the Barnacle: The Story of One Tiny Creature and History's Most Spectacular Scientific Breakthrough","review":"Stott brings Darwin to life! An extraordinary story, so well crafted it brings a wonderful sense of humanity to the history of science. Primarily, \`Darwin and the Barnacle' brings into focus the central essence of Darwin as a human being. It presents Darwin's raw excitement with life, seemingly ignited while strolling studiously (almost romantically) along the foreshores. Which in turn encouraged him to undertake his famous tour of discovery upon the Beagle.The sensitivity of the author helped develop in me an understanding of and interest in Charles Darwin as a person. I was moved by learning more about the man and how he lived his life; by the grief he experienced as his beloved daughter died, how his wife and he read to one another, about his ill health, his day to day activities and about his dedication if not dogged determination of his scientific observations.In reading this book I came to understand how much time and energy Darwin dedicated in undertaking his labourious investigations into barnacles, how this hard work paved the way for honing his monumental work on the \`Origin of the Species'. Yet for me it is not a defence of evolution, but rather its Darwin who is placed under the microscope. It was literally as if Stott breathed life back into Darwin - which suddenly took on more importance than the revolutionary achievements that he is so well regarded for. \`Darwin and the Barnacle' is a great book I only wish I had read this book when I was a geological student."},{"Title":"Darwin and the Barnacle: The Story of One Tiny Creature and History's Most Spectacular Scientific Breakthrough","review":"I was prepared to really like this book. It is centered on Darwin's study of barnacles and their contribution to his evolutionary thinking. In some ways the author sort of got there, but along the way she often got off the track and uses some strange analogies in the process. There were several typos that were disturbing. Perhaps the worst is that we are told on page 21 that the marine segmented worm Aphrodita aculeata has stinging hairs (it does not! - see Sue Hubbell's excellent book \\"Waiting for Aphrodite\\"), and that it is parasitic (it is a carnivore, as Hubbell also noted). In stating that Aphrodita has stinging hairs Rebecca Stott was repeating an error that has come down to us through a book published in 1558 by Rondelet! Also \\"aculeata\\" does not mean, \\"stinging\\", but spiny! One would think that by now this misinformation would not continue to be repeated. However, the main problem is that the author rambles a bit too much and covers a lot of ground not pertinent to the subject. In fact she covers a lot of the ground in regard to Darwin's personal problems that is better explored in several other recent books. This is not a fatal flaw, but the book would have been more original if the focus had been kept on the barnacles rather than on background material that nearly every biographer of Darwin has investigated. As for the book being \\"lavishly illustrated,\\" I am wondering what the writers of the dust jacket blurb meant! I would not have described it in that manner at all! Maybe \\"adequately illustrated\\" would have been better!This book is worth reading and does give us some of the details left out of other books on Darwin, but the author has not answered the questions about Darwin's barnacles I would have liked to have had answered."},{"Title":"Darwin and the Barnacle: The Story of One Tiny Creature and History's Most Spectacular Scientific Breakthrough","review":"Darwin's belief in species development through progressive changes over time did not spring full-blown in a single stroke. In fact, it seems not to have occurred to him at all when he started his career in natural history.The Victorian era witnessed exploration of every kind, geographic and scientific, with masses of samples arriving from every corner of the globe. From here, it seems that anyone with reasonable diligence could find an unstudied subject and bring its secrets to the world. So did Darwin, with his selection of the humble barnacle. Large parts of this story recount his studies of the widely varied clade of creatures, and with his growing certainty that a single body plan lay behind all of them, modified in different ways to support the different needs of each species. Time after time, he discovered apparent exceptions to nearly every rule - like the species in which only females had been observed. Time after time, he discovered that the rules remained valid, but needed to be interpreted more broadly than anyone had dreamed - like the discovery that the species indeed had males, tiny ones who lived nearly parasitic lives with their larger mates.Eventually, the hundreds of specimens he acquired from worldwide sources allowed him to see patterns that hadn't been recognized before. Slowly, the pattern of patterns became clearer to him, suggesting his startling theory - that all extant species of barnacle derived from common ancestors. Despite wild variations in their physiologies, nearly every pair of extremes could be seen as ends of a continuum of intermediate forms.Darwin new that his theory would face a difficult reception, not least within his family. Partly out of sensitivity to his wife's piety, but largely to bolster his case with unassailable evidence, he worked for years without sharing his thoughts. Occasionally, another writer would propose something similar, only to have it rejected because of weak reasoning or vague evidence. Darwin learned from others' errors. By the time he published his famous opus, little room was left for rational argument.Stott has put together a readable, even exciting story about this critical phase in the theory's gestation. Microscopes and museum samples might seem dry stuff, but not when seen with a scientist's passion. Stott has done what few other authors manage - she brings that passion to life.-- wiredweird"},{"Title":"Darwin and the Barnacle: The Story of One Tiny Creature and History's Most Spectacular Scientific Breakthrough","review":"I have already read at least 15 books on Darwin and his life. I was ready for a study of the creatures that took up 8 years of his work and purchased this book thinking it would be mostly on his barnacle research. Maybe it is good that barnacles took up only a portion (perhaps less than half) of the book because Darwin and the Barnacle turned out to be an extremely readable and interesting addition to the many other available Darwin books. Unless you are actively studying barnacles, author Rebecca Stott includes enough relevant barnacle information to give a survey while adding a nice overview of his adventure on the Beagle, his relationships with his contemporaries, and his life in general. There is much more coverage than you may expect on his sickness and the \\"cures\\" but it is well-written and adds to the overall interest of the book.While the title may be somewhat misleading, it is still an excellent read both for anyone wanting an introduction into Darwin's life or alternately, for those who want to read still another author's viewpoint of a life that has been extensively covered."},{"Title":"Darwin and the Barnacle: The Story of One Tiny Creature and History's Most Spectacular Scientific Breakthrough","review":"As another reviewer said, I really wanted to like this book. And for the most part, I did. I'm not a scientist but learning what went into the development of Darwin's theory was interesting.However, the book felt both a bit bloated and, curiously, unfinished. There is as much about Darwin's personal life and times as about his scientific work. Two random examples: the detailed descriptions of Leith harbor in the first chapter and of Dr. Gully's water cure later in the book could have been significantly shortened without damaging the narrative at all. And while it may sound heartless, I couldn't believe there was a whole chapter on the death of Darwin's daughter. Like the author's &#34;Darwin's Ghosts&#34;, the sequel and companion volume, this book could have used sharper editing.At the same time I was left unsatisfied about the main point: how his work on barnacles fit into the development of his theory. The author is clear (to the point of unnecessary repetition) that Darwin felt he needed to prove himself as a meticulous scientist before venturing to publish his controversial idea about how species developed. And there are hints along the way about how the amazing diversity among members of this lowly species surprized even him.But we jump from the publication of his last book on barnacles to publication of &#34;On the Origin of Species&#34; with almost nothing to tie the two together. Yes, he felt pushed to get his theory into print because another scientist was developing a similar one. But (to quote another reviewer) his exploration of barnacles feels like a mystery story where the detective presents the solution without explaining how he figured it out.With these caveats, however, I recommend this book to anyone who wants to know more about Darwin and how he developed his theory. The story itself is one that few people know today. The description of his correspondence with other scientists to collect specimens and test his ideas is a good reminder that the theory that bears his name didn't spring fully formed from his brain alone. And even though she spends too many words on it, the author's evocation of the time in which he lived helps frame a truly remarkable piece of scientific history."},{"Title":"Darwin and the Barnacle: The Story of One Tiny Creature and History's Most Spectacular Scientific Breakthrough","review":"Seeing Darwin as a part of the cultural milieu makes him much more than the man with the theory. His relationships with Grant and reaction to Chambers' publication provide a sense of Darwin's concern for culture, family, religion, and science. His development as a scientist was driven by an underlying need to present himself, and thus his thoughts and ideas, as both valid and defendable. Rebecca Stott presents Darwin as a person of the times in both Darwin and the Barnacle and Darwin's Ghosts. These are must- reads for historians, cultural anthropologists, and those interested in the role of science and biology in the modern world."},{"Title":"Darwin and the Barnacle: The Story of One Tiny Creature and History's Most Spectacular Scientific Breakthrough","review":"This book has several problems, the most noticeable one being that it doesn't even live up to its own subtitle- &quot;The Story of One Tiny Creature and History's Most Spectacular Scientific Breakthrough.&quot; I think that, based on that subtitle, it is a reasonable assumption that the book is going to link Darwin's study of barnacles to his theory of evolution by natural selection. Well, I read all 261 pages of this book and let me state categorically that the author never makes the connection. We get a lot of information about barnacles, no doubt about it. We find out about barnacles that secrete their own shells, barnacles that burrow into other creatures' shells, barnacles that attach themselves to flesh, etc. We also get to know about hermaphroditical, bisexual, and unisexual barnacles. But the author never goes into specifics regarding why these variations developed, nor does she explain how the study of barnacles helped Darwin to further develop, or fine tune, &quot;History's Most Spectacular Scientific Breakthrough.&quot; (A debatable assertion, by the way, but hyperbole in modern publishing is so prevalent that I guess we're not supposed to take these things too seriously.) I kept reading and reading and said to myself that the author must have a purpose in barraging us with all of this barnacle minutiae. Must be she'll have a chapter near the end where she'll explain the specific biological/environmental reasons for the variations and show how this helped Darwin to clarify his thinking. Well, sorry to say there is no such chapter in the book. It was sort of like reading a mystery and the author never tells you how the detective solved the crime. Another problem that this book has is that the narrative flow is disturbed by some very bizarre analogies. If you think that I might possibly be going overboard with my choice of the word bizarre, consider the following: a developing fetus in Emma Darwin (Charles's wife) is compared to a barnacle attaching itself to a host; and Charles undergoing an examination of his stomach is compared to a dissected barnacle being studied under a microscope. There are many more examples scattered throughout the book. All of them made me wince. So, does this book have any saving graces? Yes, it does. We learn about what an incredibly hard job Darwin took on when he decided to devote years of his life to studying barnacles, due to the seemingly endless variations he encountered, not to mention the problems involved in dissecting and studying such tiny creatures (even though I just mentioned it). We learn that Darwin didn't work on his own: he corresponded with many other naturalists, some who would generously loan him barnacle specimens and fossils from their own collections. He also had people all over the world gathering barnacle specimens for him, which they would send to him by post. In this case, as in so many others, the myth of the lone genius working in seclusion is shown to be just that- a myth. Ms. Stott is also careful to balance Darwin the scientist and Darwin the man- we learn about his self-doubts, health problems, and of his relationship to his wife and numerous children. Unfortunately, none of this is sufficient to overcome the problem of an author not accomplishing what she set out to do. Cruel as it might sound, you'd be much better off reading any collection of essays by Stephen Jay Gould."},{"Title":"Breviloquium,","review":"St. Bonaventure's BREVILOQUIUM is an excellent introduction to Scholastic theology.

It also has some good examples, including an example of how to turn some non-thread-safe linked list code into thread-safe code.

Trust me, there are non-obvious errors too. If you're looking for an overview, this will do you fine.

However, before grasping at concepts or just using tools without any understanding or their makeup it would be wise to add this to your learning curve.This book gives a good basic understanding of Pthreads. Of course, you will later have to apply it to the real world but as a learning tool, this is pretty darn good. The website or path on the site has changed since publication; but the examples are still there. Because I am using AIX, it does take a little time to convert from a gcc format to an AIX format. Then a little more time to apply AIX specific advantages.As you go from the front of the book to the end the samples are added to and new concepts become available. There are plenty of diagrams for the visual learner. I personally found the signal handling of great use.Any way this book is not the end-all, be-all, of threads but it sure cleared many concepts up for me.1. Why Pthreads2.

Its treatment of the issues associated with threads and signals I think was especially useful. My only complaint is with the Quick Reference in Appendix C. The reference provides no description of possible function call errors. While I admit the errors are dependant on the particular Pthreads implementation, however there are a core number of errors that would be common throughout all, or at least most, implementations. The point is if you are to do any actual programming, which I presume is the reason for a reference of function calls, you need to know what return values to expect. Providing no reference would have been better then providing a useless one."},{"Title":"Pthreads Programming: A POSIX Standard for Better Multiprocessing (O'Reilly Nutshell)","review":"This book does a nice job for describing the pthread API. When I have read this book, my multithread programming experience was mainly with Win32 threads and reading this book was my first exposure to the condition synchronization objects. With the help of this book, it has been a breeze to learn how to use conditions. What is missing from this book written 10 years ago, which is also missing in all multithread books that I have read of that era, is coverage on issues with parallel processing. If all you have to do with threads is to launch a background job while keeping UI responsive or asynchronous I/O on a single core processor, you will be fine with this book.However, if you try to crunch an array of data with multiple threads each processing their own chunk of the array, you could fall into cache line alignment problems even if your threads does not access the same memory locations. Those problems are platform dependant. I have written such a program that was working wonderfully well with a Sparc station and a PowerPC based station but once ported to a x86 architecture, the program was actually becoming slower than the single thread version. It is very hard to get it right. You have to be careful about the array alignment in memory and where the boundaries of the chunks of data that you assign to threads are. What will happen if 2 threads located on 2 different processors access to the same cache line is that one processor will have to flush that cache line back to the main memory and the other processor will have to fetch the values back from the main memory to its cache. The overhead of this is so huge that processing the array from a single thread could be faster.I still have to find a book that addresses these problems. I expect it to come soon with dual and quad core processors becoming mainstream but this is not this book."},{"Title":"Pthreads Programming: A POSIX Standard for Better Multiprocessing (O'Reilly Nutshell)","review":"I used soe of it , and did not finish reading , but considered a good start in addition to teh website that talks more with exmaples abut using teh pthreads"},{"Title":"Pthreads Programming: A POSIX Standard for Better Multiprocessing (O'Reilly Nutshell)","review":"This is a nice book, very clear and covers lots of important points.

I give a pretest on Monday. If a student misses fewer than five out of twenty of the spelling words, they study these vocabulary words instead. The book is organized wonderfully well, so that you can assign one prefix or suffix each week. The author gives you a list of ten words with the pre- or suffix (for visual learners), a page with the words and meanings mixed up so they have to cut it apart and match them up again (for your tactile learners) and then a multiple choice test where the students must determine which word fits into the sentence (very difficult - student needs to apply their knowledge and comprehension of the word to determine in which sentence the word would work.)

As a practitioner myself I see such a book as important not only for the consumer but also for everyone who produces software.I liked the approach that explains how customer service staff experience customer complaints and how NOT to complain (ie screaming and shouting will at best get you onto the PA system for the customer care staff to enjoy). Complaining is a psychologically difficult terrain and Cem's book helps doing it more effectively.There is a short coming (not of Kaner's fault) in that in chapter 7 he refers to the American laws, which obviously do not apply overseas.

Whereas Rosen has a tight, highly rigorous focus on his goal in \\"Life Itself\\", Kampis paints on a somewhat broader canvas, referencing the work of many other researchers (including Rosen). However, Kampis is similarly detailed and methodical.Kampis first describes the limits of dynamical models, and state-based approaches, including the limitations inherent in the 'canonical formalism' of mechanics.He then goes on to introduce 'component-systems'. This is a general formal representation of a system as being composed of some number of components out of an essentially unlimited number of possible components. In component systems, the \\"rules\\" for the dynamics of the system are not independent of the components themselves. Self-modifying component systems generate new components and delete others, thereby changing the identity of the system itself. In mathematical terms, a self-modifying system is like a function f that belongs to its own domain and range (\\"f:f-->f\\"). The result is that such systems are non-algorithmic, nor are their dynamics describable in a state-based formalism (e.g., Newtonian, Hamiltonian, etc.). This has notable consequences for approaches that attempt to treat such systems as algorithmic, or via modelling their state-based dynamics. By comparison to component systems, cellular automata and similar algorithmic formal systems are entirely trivial.Kampis devotes many chapters to what I have cursorily mentioned, and there is much, much more in this book that is worth reading. Although there is not alot of math, what is there is important to understand. It would be helpful for the interested reader to generally understand the basic notation of mechanics, first-order differential equations, basic logic, Godel's Incompleteness Theorems, Turing machines, basic set theory, system theory, a modicum of philosophy, and linguistics. Most of these aspects are fairly well-explained, so a diligent reader can pick them up as he goes along.This is not a book of vague handwaving arguments. It will take some studious effort to read and grasp the concepts and profundity of what he presents. However, it will be well worth the effort, and afterward you will never be able to look at dynamical systems and models, complexity, and self-modifying systems, in the same way.Although there are alot of similarities between Kampis' and Rosen's works, they are sufficiently distinct in approaches and conclusions that both are well worth reading.One final note: the \\"typewriter\\" font used throughout may be a bit surprising to see in the 21st century, but I found it entirely legible and comfortable once I got used to it."},{"Title":"Self-Modifying Systems in Biology and Cognitive Science, Volume 6: A New Framework for Dynamics, Information and Complexity (IFSR International Series on Systems Science and Engineering)","review":"The theme that Kampis examines in Self-Modifying Systems is the self-generation of information by the nontrivial change (self-modification) of systems. Such a system is a network of many components, which have the property of being able to transform each other and organising themselves into larger components. It is this feature that makes such component systems closed to efficient cause. Component-systems, then, are not algorithmic, but this is not a reversible equation in that component-systems can, Kampis argues, give rise, in fact, to any particular algorithm. Kampis describes the difference as that between known complexity, that is to say complexity-to-be-realised, and unknown complexity, or complexity-to-be-explained. The first of these is relatively easy to realise, the second being impossible in that \\"a complex operation operating on components and bringing forth yet unknown and unidentified components cannot be described as an algorithm\\" (Kampis 1991:239).Component-systems, therefore, have a high degree of creativity, but they also have characteristics that avoid many of the problems that other forms of nonlinear models.Kampis argues that nothing that such a process gives rise to can be predicted before hand, and no identity can be traced back to an origin. From this, Kampis states that the creation thesis emerges. This thesis can be stated in the following way:The organisation of the world is continually self-creating; this process is at any given stage incomplete. Information about the future is not only inaccessible but does not exist in any form. Creation is a basic and general phenomenon that cannot be explained logically. (Kampis 1991: 258).Self-creation occurs in the form of self-modification. A system that exhibits creativity, then, has to be continually redefined because, in the course of time, all variables and their interrelations will change in so far as each component is replaced by another. It is a system which will be defined (and constructed) by the very processes it undergoes. (Kampis 1991: 490).The book unfolds, then, as a wonderfully sophisticated model to account for the very process of change and the important limitations of prediction the process of change implies. This book deserves to be one of the key texts of autopoiesis."},{"Title":"Self-Modifying Systems in Biology and Cognitive Science, Volume 6: A New Framework for Dynamics, Information and Complexity (IFSR International Series on Systems Science and Engineering)","review":"George Kampis follows in the ground breaking tradition of Robert Rosen.

SKY BATTLES SKY WARRIORS is an exciting collection of 32 air war stories spanning the decades from WWI through Operation Desert Storm. Though long out of print, it's certainly worth a look-see as it features Price's patented combination of detailed research and easy writing style.Basically this 1998 release from England's Brockhampton Press is a straightforward combination of two previous Price titles: SKY BATTLES! AIR WARFARE ACTION (1996) and SKY WARRIORS! CLASSIC AIR BATTLES (1998), As befits its two-fer nature, each section is numbered separately.I found it hard to differentiate the focus of one section from the other. For instance, the SKY BATTLES section includes articles on the S.E. 5-equipped 84 Squadron in action in WWI; the early combat career of the Ju 87; the Battle of the Coral Sea; the first Regensburg strike, the 10 May 1972 furball over Hai Duong; the loss of an RAF Tornado fighter-bomber on 14 February 1991; etc. Part two of the book - the SKY WARRIORS section -includes stories on a WWI German attempt to re-supply its forces in east Africa using a Zeppelin; the 'Battle of Britain Day' air action on 15 September 1940; opening missions of Operation Barbarossa; USN patrol bomber use of homing torpedoes in the North Atlantic; the 6 March 1944 strike on Berlin; the Great Marianas Turkey Shoot; the 'Black Buck' strikes flown during the Falklands campaign; etc.As is to be expected, the stories are well-researched and well told, offering the reader a nicely done sampling of air combat throughout the ages. Several photo inserts supplement the text.If you are interested in 'yank-and-bank' aviation, you should enjoy SKY BATTLES, SKY WARRIORS.

The pictures and diagrams are wonderful and incredibly helpful. To give a random example, the chapters on cell mitosis and meiosis. This can be a potentially difficult subject if you're expected to memorize the various stages, and what the chromosomes are doing and when, but this book gives very helpful and colorful diagrams and light micrographs of each stage. The authors really understand the importance of visual learning in conjunction with reading.Speaking of the authors, I was pleasantly surprised that the writing had a hint of personality, and didn't have the dreaded \\"textbook dry\\" monotone. It didn't feel as if robots wrote the book, as in some textbooks. I noticed they reinforced important core concepts throughout to drum it into the students head, like the the connection between \\"form and function\\", or how the size and shape of, for example an enzyme, is really it's most important characteristic.I bought this book new and it came with a cd-rom, that for me, put my grades over the top. I'm not sure I would have done as well without this cd. In it are all sorts of quizzes and tests, a complete on-line version of the book, various links to helpful internet sites, and which I used the most, animations and voice commentary of each chapter.

In general it is well written and comprehensive. There are errors here and there; a few terms which appear in the glossary are not in the index, for example. It's rather distressing when all I can find is the glossary entry for a term. In a book that's 1200+ pages and on a topic this huge and complex, a properly cross-referenced index is an absolute essential.The interviews at the beginning of each unit are worthwhile, if only to give one an idea of biology career possibilities. It's interesting that one of the people interviewed is Dr. Nancy Hopkins of MIT, the same scientist who stomped out in a huff during Dr. Summers' talk at Harvard because of a speculative remark about women and science. Her excuse was that his ideas \\"nauseated\\" her. Is this a scientist we should all emulate?The real weakness in this book is the CD-ROM, which lists comprehensive resources such as animations and tutorials on the book material. Unfortunately, many of these are simply links to the publisher's web page, which requires registration and a 12-month limited access password. After 12 months you need to purchase access by the year, similar to subscribing to a magazine.In this day and age, a CD-ROM is plenty big enough to store tons of animations, tutorials, documents, html, etc.; clearly the publisher is trying to make a quick buck off the students. Having already spent upwards of $120 for the text and study guide, I am reluctant to sink even more money into this publisher. What's more, other textbook publishers such as Pearson/Prentice Hall provide splendid supplemental websites that are freely accessible.I wrote Benjamin Cummings a letter about this but did not receive a reply. My advice, therefore, is to buy this book used if possible and do like me and complain vociferously to the publisher to discourage this kind of shoddy practice in the future."},{"Title":"Biology, 6th Edition","review":"I was studying for the National Medical Assessment Test in my country and i used this book to review my biology. Note, however that my pre-med was a humanities degree and economics. So, I really needed to bone up on my biology. I was intimidated by the size of this book and was reluctant to purchase it but after reading so many reviews i relented.And i was very happy i did so. I just couldn't put this book down. It was thick and the letters were so small but it was also accessible and comprehensive while providing in-depth information. Biology really comes to life with this book. Everything is put into context and ideas truly build up on one another. Unlike other biology books I've read, other branches of science (e.g. chemistry & physics) are introduced to show how all of science are indeed connected to facilitate a deeper understanding of science itself and not just biology. It even explained many ideas in organic chemistry more clearly and succintly than the intro to org chem book i used.Some have commented that this book is too thick and i have to disagree. This is not a reference book (it could be a good one i think) but an introduction. As an introductory text it has to lay a solid foundation in understanding the basics innerworkings of biology and how all of it is connected to other sciences. This it does well. I have found that the book usually only uses one short paragraph to introduce one organ/organelle/cell/a step in a chemical cycle/chemical/etc. to describe it, what affects it, and its functions. I do not think the authors could've done any better. People who want a shorter text i think really want a reference book or a bio book that just lists down facts with little or no connections/explanations."},{"Title":"Biology, 6th Edition","review":"I used this book in college when I chose to take the real, hard-core 2-semester Biology course as an elective. (I am a Physics major and I do NOT like Biology.)At the time, I found it readable, although it seemed full of information. Without a professor lecturing, I probably could not have picked out the &quot;wheat&quot; from the &quot;chaff&quot; in this book. That's where my comment in the title comes from. This is a heavy book!Now I teach high school science. I am in a really small, rural school, so I teach everything, grades 7-12. Obviously, that includes Biology, Advanced Biology, and Anatomy. As I already said, I don't like Biology. Furthermore, the textbooks I have available at my school are so error-filled and ideologically driven that I've chosen not to use them and write my own material instead.To do this, as someone who doesn't like Biology, I need an accurate, reliable source of information. This book is excellent for that. I've taught Biology long enough now to be able to pick out what I need in high school and toss the rest. This book is accurate, reliable, and clear. Furthermore, the pictures are excellent.However, in any book or writing, it is important to be brief and to the point. I would never choose this book for even an advanced course. It is too full of information. I suppose Campbell is trying to appeal to a broad market: chemistry focus, genetics focus, ecological focus, or some other focus. However, this creates a big book. Maybe this is appropriate at the college level, and this is certainly a college book, not high school, but after my experience both as a student and as a teacher, I think Campbell needs to find a focus.In short, brief summary: it is not appropriate as a textbook, particularly in high school, but it is an excellent reference book for teachers at all levels."},{"Title":"Biology, 6th Edition","review":"After living with this book for 2 semesters, it really grew on me. It is very detailed, very well written, and just the right amount of pictures and graphs to explain more difficult concepts. This book will serve me well for the years to come, well beyond graduate school, as a source of information. Also, my teacher told me, most of the questions on the subject GRE in biology are from this book!"},{"Title":"Biology, 6th Edition","review":"Having used the 4th, 5th, and 6th editions, the 6th edition is obviously the best; new, clear illustrations, especially on the section on plant growth, have been updated, while updates on subject matter can be found scattered throughout the text. The reading, for the most part, is interesting, until one reaches chapters exceeding 40 pages--the material sometimes seems excessive and dry. Additionally, the text hasn't changed significantly from the 5th edition and the questions at the end of the chapters remain the same--thus, for my intro class, the 5th edition would have been more than suitable and I could have saved quite a bit of money.I do not recommend getting the entire biology package; the study guide book is somewhat helpful, but there is an outline following the chapters in the textbook, anyhow. The second book in the package is an illustration book, in which the reader labels various parts of the pictures(practically useless). Finally, the cd is not nearly as good the one found in the 5th edition, for it requires one to register online for a limited membership(don't bother unless you have broadband). Save money and just get the textbook. The study guide and questions in the textbook are more than sufficient!"},{"Title":"Biology, 6th Edition","review":"This book is very complete. I was assigned this book in my college biology I and II classes. It was a good book for helping me learn the necessary details for the class. The book went over such topics as cell structure and function, plant and animal structure and function, photosynthesis, Calvin Cycle, Electron transport system etc. The book is an excellent resource. I also found the following to be right on the mark for preparing me for my college exams. I got them on amazon.com, too. These study guides are.The Ultimate Study Guide for Biology: Key Review Questions and Answers with Explanations Vol 1 is isbn 1933023007. Vol 2 is isbn 1933023015, and Vol 3 is isbn 1933023023. These study guides make my college biology I and II classes much easier because they prepared me for the type of questions to get ready for. This textbook and these study guides are well worth it."},{"Title":"Biology, 6th Edition","review":"I had this book in college and then it got packed away and I can't find it.

It was a great supplement to compliment my teacher's lectures (who never used the required book, went strictly off of notes) when I just couldn't get something through my head.The pictures are great and very clear, something that can be hard to find. It's a very detailed book yet explaining some of the most trivial theories in plain English for someone to understand. I'm certain tha I'll use this book in the high school setting once I get there!Must have!"},{"Title":"Biology, 6th Edition","review":"Biology with MasteringBiology (8th Edition)This is not the edition being reviewed (older edition I bought.) Also Amazon seems to have my name wrong! Oh well)However, I have been doing a self-study program with online courses (general Biology 1A and 1B UC Berkeley) that use this book and two other courses (DVD and MIT online) that use Scott Freeman's book and another use's Purves et all.The Campbell book is by far the easiest to understand because the writing is clear and does not add \\"extraneous\\" material, such as more people and history although there is some. It seems to give just the right amount of detail. At times it has clarified concepts in such a simple way (one line or sentence) that somehow the Freeman book makes so complex. I like the Purves book second. And the Freeman book third for it's extra detail. I back up whatever comes up in class with Wikipedia articles, animation, and pictures anything I need more on and with Khan Academy (college prep) I did not have.I highly recommend this book for intro Biology animal and plants. The Campbell book also has better questions (than the others though not perfect) at the ends of the chapters. You cannot \\"guess\\" the answers as in the other books and have to be able to rule out each choice because you understand why they are not correct. This approach helps make sure you really got the chapter and develops critical thinking."},{"Title":"Biology, 6th Edition","review":"Purchasing this book was a fantastic idea and I am quite happy that I did.

So I looked it up, and I wanted something cheap, and it turned out that the book is cheap and basically new."},{"Title":"Biology, 6th Edition","review":"This is a great book with lots of info. A friend loaned us an older version of this book, which made me decide to get this version for my son's AP Biology class. It helped him a lot, since the book chosen by the school was not really as good for an AP Class. As a Biologist myself, I recommend this book to anyone who will dedicate the time to study the book. It is not an easy book, but it is very good. It has plenty of information, maybe a lot more than needed for an AP Class, but very good foundation for someone who shoots for a career in the areas of biology or Medicine."},{"Title":"Biology, 6th Edition","review":"This book set the bar for general bio classes.

The total price for the order (including shipping) was less than 15$, and I got a 1200 page textbook that was as good as new.

Everything is straight forward and the visual aid is awesome."},{"Title":"Biology, 6th Edition","review":"I have the 5th edition of this book and I find it excellent. I was looking through the reviews and I found one reviewer who didn't share the view of evolution...I don't know if this guy was serious or not, because to me it sounded too far out. Now, I'm not gonna sit here and say evolution is right. Evolution is a theory, a theory that is supported by some evidence. The idea is pretty good, but doesn't mean it is right. Theories come and go. The information is presented, it is up to the reader to determine whether they believe in it or not. I don't care if you don't, just don't be a hypocrite about it. This guy (who hails from the Garden of Eden (such arrogance, no?) says that evolution is fed down the throughts of children and that the real knowledge must be given...Isn't telling children your belief without thought to anything else the same type of force feeding textbook authors do? I'm sorry to not really review the book, it's just arrogant religious zealots piss me off. I don't care about what you believe in, just love your neighbor and don't be a hypocrite.Back to the book: I used the 5th edition in AP and it was the best book I have ever seen. This text combined with my teacher helped me get a 5 on the AP exam, and that was a blessing seeing how I hear so many smart people here at my college are having trouble getting a good grade in the class. It has EXCELLENT diagrams and the biology is SOOOOOOO comprehensive. Get this book and keep it if you are in any life science major."},{"Title":"Biology, 6th Edition","review":"excellent book, but overly superfluous ...there is jargon everywhere...I'm the type that wants a book to get to the point and be professional... much like a russian style rote testbookthis book does have one strength (it can beat into the minds with lower I.Q.s, what other professional texts can't)"},{"Title":"Biology, 6th Edition","review":"Althought this book is good in displaying the information it contains to much information to be used as a general biology book."},{"Title":"Biology, 6th Edition","review":"I think this book contains some unneccessary details, which is a waste of time for students. Other than that, it's a good book."},{"Title":"Biology, 6th Edition","review":"Hands down, Campbell's Biology is the most beautifully written and illustrated biology textbook on the market and has remained so through many, many editions. I am a plant biologist and was pleased to see that even at the introductory level, this book gave plant life equal prominence with animal biology. If you want to fall in love with biology, this is the text to get you there. Campbell and Reese accompanied me through freshman biology, every upper level undergrad and graduate biology course I took, and finally served as an indispensable reference when studying for my qualifying examinations. I don't currently teach intro bio, but if and when I do, Campbell and Reese will lead my selections for the textbook.On more practical matters for the potential book buyer--While it is fantastic to have the most up-to-date edition, we are talking intro bio here. So you really can't go wrong by grabbing a discount copy of the sixth edition and hanging onto it for dear life. Every edition of this text is worthy of a place in your permanent collection. And it is heads and shoulders above a crowded field of competitors. Couldn't offer any higher praise than this."},{"Title":"Biology, 6th Edition","review":"Amazing book! so friendly, even funny, the graphics are incredible, go deep enough in the subject, still right to the point...and very important, you never lose the track when you are reading, something that is very common in other biology books. It keeps you focus, very high quality; definitely, one of my favorites Biology book. Yes, it's good as a mother! :) I love this book!!"},{"Title":"Biology, 6th Edition","review":"I first used this book for basic bio but as a near graduating student of science I find myself constantly refering to it. It has been great for quick reviews and basic vocab. that doesn't always stick with me. I have had many opportunities to sell this book but I wouldn't part with it for anything. I plan to use it until it falls apart."},{"Title":"Biology, 6th Edition","review":"I found this book to be very informative. Although I wish it would have explained the concepts a little bit better, it was a very good book for my Principles of Biology course. I hadn't had Biology in over 10 years and this book helped me hop right back in Biology like I never left it. And I have the grades to prove it! I recommend this book. It'll take deep into the concepts of Biology. Great for any science major."},{"Title":"Biology, 6th Edition","review":"I use this book in AP biology. It is colorful, very informative, and goes in depth for an intro biology book. However while very comprehensive it is often a tedious proposition to read through a chapter, as it is not very entertaining and the enormous amount of material presented in each chapter is difficult to swallow."},{"Title":"Biology, 6th Edition","review":"This book is a masterpiece. It begins by explaining principles of chemistry that are essential to understanding biology. Then, it thorougly covers evolution. The chapters on genetics clearly unlock the mysteries of the introductory concepts of this fascinating topic. I would recommend this book to anybody interesting in mastering the basic subjects of biology, the study of life."},{"Title":"Biology, 6th Edition","review":"Good pictures, good information, diagrams are updated. Campbell always makes quality general biology books in my opinion. HOWEVER... for the Campbell bio books, if you're a college student on a budget, buy the edition before if your course does not rely on it heavily for specific questions--it will be the same info with a bit of different pictures. My friend had the 5th edition--the pictures were a little different and the pictures were a little different; he still got an A."},{"Title":"Biology, 6th Edition","review":"Book was almost in new condtion when I received it and the price so low. I will defintely but another book if I need it."},{"Title":"Biology, 6th Edition","review":"This was exactly what I was expecting. It was in good condition, but it wasn't the edition I needed. I knew that when I bought, it but it did create some personal problems. I didn't like the book that much. The format was confusing, and so was using it. I was satisfied though. It served my purposes. LOVED the price."},{"Title":"Biology, 6th Edition","review":"I got this for my mom who is interested in learning cell biology.Its only 1 or 2 editions old, and about 99 dollars cheaper."},{"Title":"Biology, 6th Edition","review":"This book is the course for the introductory bio sequence here. So far, I have not had a problem with the book because the diagrams are strategically placed, the reading is easy to follow, and the material has in no case been ambiguous.My prof uses it as a supplement to his lecture, when he goes over all sorts of material that are not covered in the textbook. When I go back and do the assigned reading, I easily understand the big picture. Part of the joy of being in BIOS 201 is because of this book.If your course uses this textbook, awesome. It is probably the best, if not among the best, introductory biology textbooks on this planet."},{"Title":"Biology, 6th Edition","review":"If the 7th edition is too expensive for you, this is the one you should choose."},{"Title":"Biology, 6th Edition","review":"I love my textbook. I am in high school and as a sophomore last year, I took this class. It was hard, insanely hard. But, this book explained it so well, and i knew the book page by page, it helped me and 50% of my classmates get a 5 on their AP Exam. It was an amazing book. Even after you are done with the class, you can still go back and refer to this book. I would recommend to anyone and everyone!"},{"Title":"Biology, 6th Edition","review":"This book is for a college course, but it has been a terrific read! We have made so many discoveries in science in the 20+ years I've been out of school that it is fascinating just to look at the pictures. It also comes with access to online learning. I may keep it so my high school son can get a head start on his science classes!"},{"Title":"Biology, 6th Edition","review":"The Campbell and Reece Biology book is one of the best biology books out there. It is extremely well-written; the text is exciting and engaging and includes good examples to reinforce concepts. The illustrations are clear, well-done, and informative. The enclosed CD is an enormous help in studying. It helped me a lot when I was studying for my tests; the animations were particularly useful--they brought to life ideas and concepts from the book.I used the book in my AP Biology class and I got a 5 on the exam. It's a fantastic book for studying and reading. I could probably learn better from the book than from my teacher."},{"Title":"Biology, 6th Edition","review":"You get your money's worth with this book. The accompanying CD and web resources provide graphics, animations, and a very good quiz and test review for each chapter. Unlike many other textbooks, which require you to pay extra for a solutions guide or study manual, this book provides all of the answers to the end-of-chapter problems, as well as additional multiple choice quizzes and tests available online or through the CD. The authors put much time and effort into this textbook, and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Biology, 6th Edition","review":"This book gets top marks of writing and organization. This is a superb book to use if you want a general introduction to biology. One improvement in the 6th is the use of dictionary symbols in the glossary, so pronunciation is now unambiguous.However, one wonders why such talented writers and teachers would allow such a poor physical package to carry their name. No bows here!The book is approximately 1250 pages long. While the previous, 5th edition used small type - making it hard enough to read - the 6th edition now uses a lighter even harder to read type. The book is also quite heavy and awkward, and is best read at a table or desk. Its physical size is more suitable for an encyclopedia than a text.Three other minor issues:To find the pronunciation of new unfamiliar technical terms one must turn to the glossary in the back of the book, an awkward process with a book this size. Perhaps, in the next edition, the authors will consider providing pronunciation information where new terms are first presented as well as in the glosary.The enclosed CD is a nice touch with enough variety to keep it interesting. However, some more care needs to be given to matching it appropriately to the book. For example, the activity for Heritable Information for Chapter One presents numerous chemical concepts not yet covered, and is clearly inappropriate at this point in the book.While the form of the glossary is improved, some pronunciations (plantae, deoxyribonucleic, etc.) still do not appear to match those of standard dictionaries or rules for scientific pronunciation.In summary, this is a superb book to learn from whether in or outside a class. Its major problems relate to its seriously flawed physical layout. It cries out to be split into two volumes, and for many of the gratuitous pictures to be pruned so room for more readable type is available.The books content easily deserve five stars - the rating here. The layout, sadly, much much less."},{"Title":"Biology, 6th Edition","review":"This was my textbook for Biology 101 & 102. This book was a pleasure to read. It is clearly written and not dry at all so it was easy to keep focus. Even in my upper level classes, I find myself referring back to it occasionally and am still impressed by it. An important point I would like to make is that, if you are using this as a course textbook, the CD is invaluable. The animated tutorials and chapter quizzes, (which are quite thorough), kept me one step ahead. That CD shaved hours off of my study time for each test."},{"Title":"Biology, 6th Edition","review":"I used the 5th edition of this book, but I've seen the 6th edition, and think the improvements (especially in terms of the diagrams and additions to the accompanying CD) are worth the upgrade.This is an excellent resource for anyone interested in biology. It's the gold standard for a reason. Clear writing, excellent diagrams and pictures, and with an appropriate amount of depth for a college intro-biology course or for AP Bio.Don't forget to use the CD as a resource, since it makes complicated processes like the Krebs cycle a lot easier to understand. An animation is worth a thousand pictures."},{"Title":"Biology, 6th Edition","review":"I started out studying physics for electrical engineering and needed to prop up my weak background in chemistry, and ended up learning an awful lot about biology.I couldn't put this book down. I started reading it because I struggled through boring chemistry text books (it has a fantastic basic chemistry chapter) and I ended up getting interested enough in biology that it inspired me to take some biology classes! Now, quite normally a \\"hard sciences\\" guy wouldn't be seen dead in a \\"soft science\\" class at my particular institution, but the jeers and pathetic looks were a badge of honor for me. I loved it. These pratts didn't know what they were missing out on.This book contains the most wonderful, easy to read, inspiring and beautifully written chemistry primer I have ever seen, and I have struggled through half a dozen. It raises the bar so high that no other text book on any subject can ever match the brilliance and thoughfulness that went into this wonderful book.I devoured the chemistry chapter in one sitting and sailed through the rest of my chemistry education (as little as it was for my electrical engineering degree).If you are learning biology by all means read this book. But if you've ever suffered through the torture of boring chemistry text books that fail to explain the most basic, beginning concepts, then you need this book, too."},{"Title":"Biology, 6th Edition","review":"This is an exceptional textbook. Each topic (covered clearly and thoroughly) lays the necessary foundation for each successive topic. The diagrams provide further clarity to the material and are placed accessibly on the same page as the written text. I highly recommend this text to anyone who wants a solid grasp on the fundamentals of biology."},{"Title":"Biology, 6th Edition","review":"Thank god I bought this book! I had just recently forgotten my biology book for a project I have to do over Christmas break, which was a newer book for the curriculum and instead of having to search for second rate information over the internet this book contains everything you need. In my opinion the new Standard Prentice Hall Textbook is only a quarter of the quality of this book."},{"Title":"Biology, 6th Edition","review":"I used this textbook in AP Biology almost a decade ago and I still have fond memories. It is concise and well written. It's also a good basic reference but perhaps not as detailed as Alberts Molecular Biology of the Cell. Unlike Alberts, you can read this one cover to cover!"},{"Title":"Biology, 6th Edition","review":"I am an unusually harsh critic of most textbooks. However, I must say that I am pleased to give this book 5 stars. As an introductory book, it is simply superb. It even covers some subjects far past the introductory level. Some may say that this \\"completeness\\" is something of a hindrance; however, I disagree. If the student carefully and actively reads, he should find no problem cutting the fat out, while retaining important intro material. Then, once the student has the basic information cold, the book makes a superb reference for a segway into intermediate or advanced topics. The books organization is very carefully planned and the integration of old material into new material is particularly deft for such a long text book. The section on plant physiology and form is particularly good and molecular biology is stressed throughout most chapters after an early introduction. My only complaint is that the problem sets at the end of each chapter are somewhat short, but this is not a serious problem. The binding and paper quality is pretty good as far as modern text books are concerned. All in all, a very good book."},{"Title":"Biology, 6th Edition","review":"I took a biology course this summer and this was the book assigned to the course. It was a wonderful experience. The book was well written, well organized and had more details than needed. When you are learning concepts in class and you do not fully understand the root of where the info comes from or how it really works, the book is a great asset to have. This book is definitely going to remain on my reference shelf! I recommend it to anyone who needs to learn and understand Biology. Beautiful pictures!"},{"Title":"Biology, 6th Edition","review":"I used this book this past summer in order to place out of College Bio I and II through a CLEP exam. Through independent study from this book and its companion CD I was able to place out in the 97th Percentile.There is a reason why this book is still continued to be used today in classrooms as it is on its sixth edition. The authors use of layout in the book is well thought out and organized. His vast use of pictures, graphs, and tables streamline with the text of the book. In addition, the companion CD and web site provide the reader with an even greater study guide-- using interactive flash programs and video to further explain biological processes.Further, in addition to the basic Biology taught in classrooms, this book goes one step further and explains some advancing fields in the Biology Profession. For example, chapter 20 covers the use of computers in analyzing biological data and gives prime examples from the current Human Genome Project. Further, every section of this book covers an interview with a specific individual in that profession. Such, if one is not aware of what exact field one wish's to pursue, interviews that cover some of the daily activities of these individuals are provided.I would recommend this book for anyone who is seriously interested in Biology."},{"Title":"Biology, 6th Edition","review":"Sorry for me late reply! The book is great. I purchased this book from Taiwan and my friend in the US brought it back for me! The book is in good condition and it helps me a lot. Thanks!"},{"Title":"Biology, 6th Edition","review":"The text is the best on the market. First of all, it's the biggest of all intro biology texts on the market ( exceedingly large book, caught your attention on the first sight). It's also good on the inside. texts were printed in big letters, so don't worry if you are using glasses ( this is a little draw back cause i prefer smaller letters). Seemed i haven't mentioned any thing about its quality on biology. It's quality is UNQUESTIONABLLY THE BEST. Clear, and funny (not to the extreme). The word CLEAR is so vague. So many people used it to describe good works, but the CLEAR i used means it REALLY teaches you the important points.For example, Protein has four levels of structure. Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, Blabla... In most other texts, difference between secondary and tertiary structure was not CLEAR. IS the secondary structure cause by hydrogen bonding along the backbone? Are side chains on the amino-acids involved? Other authors made is so UNclear. However Campbell made it clear(though with certain risk of been wrong). Secondary structure is SOLELY cause by hydrogen bonding along the backbone. Tertiary structure is solely caused by interactions of side chains on amino-acids.I owned three texts: Starr's, Solomon's and Campbell's. The first two have been collecting dust on my book shelf. The third are becoming used."},{"Title":"Biology, 6th Edition","review":"Note clearly said CD included. It is the only reason I picked this vendor out of all options.

The book provides a great sampling of numerous different areas in biological science. Campbell's book begins with biochemistry and cellular biology, moves on to human body systems, progresses to zoology and taxonomy, and concludes with ecology. It even includes some interesting chapters about sociobiology and psychobiology. This text truely features a plethora of information. It encompasses 50 chapters and is longer than 1000 pages. Each chapter concludes wtih about 12 questions to test the reader over the material that he or she just covered. I also found the CD-rom that came with the book quite helpful. The CD has a quiz and a test for each chapter. This greatly helped me prepare for tests, because sometimes my teacher's questions were very similar. Overall, this book provides anything you could possibly need to learn biology, and serves as an excellent source of basic future reference.Obvisously, few introductory biology courses will cover every chapter in this book, especially if the course is only one semester long. There are several chapters, such as the evolution of plants (Campbell get his Ph.D in botany), that can easily be passed over. Also, this book may not be the ideal text for a non-major course--textbooks are expensive and this one is a pepperoni pounder in terms of length.Personally, I often found this book rather interesting to read and think that I provided me with valuable information that I will need in the future. You might want to check it out if you are thinking of becoming a biology major in college."},{"Title":"Biology, 6th Edition","review":"I found this book very thorough and well written. What made it so enjoyable is wasn't dry and boring; the colloquial style made it very readable, especially for lay people. I work in a related field - as a medical doctor - but, sad as it is, I sometimes like to read about it for fun! This book was the perfect blend: informative and straight forward yet also reasonably entertaining. Most important, it is accurate and truthful with a good sense of the latest cutting edge research."},{"Title":"Biology, 6th Edition","review":"This book covers absolutely everything. It even has a chapter on cell-to-cell communication. Every biologist should have this book on her shelf for reference. Having said that, I much prefer Sylvia Mader's Biology, which is much easier to read and does not bog down so in the details."},{"Title":"Biology, 6th Edition","review":"I don't have much of a Biology background, but I worked my tail off and was able to get the concepts down to barely pull an 'A' using this text.

The book is written extremely well and eloquently. The illustrations are amazing and they really help in understanding the concepts. Campbell, one of the coauthors, helps write the AP Biology Test, so he covers everything you need to know and the questions that are given on the CD-ROM and in the book are very similar to the AP style because he writes some of the test."},{"Title":"Biology, 6th Edition","review":"The molecular biology portion ( Ch 1-9 Kreb's Cycle, Calvin Cycle etc.) was a bit lacking due to its confusing terms and bad explanations but the rest (Ch 10-fortysomething was WONDERFUL!The photos and diagrams were an improvement over the previous edition and I can honestly say that the book was straight-forward and easy to follow. It also came with an interactive CD-rom that had chapter reviews, activities, animations, and interactive tests on it which was a tremendous bonus while studying.Each chapter seemed to relate the human world to other animals and plants whice was a good thing because it clearly showed how everything was related in the world."},{"Title":"Biology, 6th Edition","review":"Campbell and Reece once again set the standard for undergraduate general biology textbooks.This book is also commonly used and highly recommended for advanced high school biology students. Many Advanced Placement high school biology courses use this text with their students. It is well correlated to the information tested on the AP Biology exam as the writers have had associations with that test themselves.I use another of their new textbooks &quot;Essential Biology&quot; as the text for my 9th grade honors biology students as it does well to prepare them for taking AP Biology in their 11th or 12th grade year."},{"Title":"Biology, 6th Edition","review":"Written by experienced authors, this book has become the (unofficial) standard for many discerning learners. Its coverage of Botany and Zoology: including all those morphological and anatomical details, is overwhelming. The same applies to its accompanying CD-ROM, which bears several test-questions that students should exercise with.Another endearing feature of this book is the way it simplified all the complex biochemical pathways that it presented.It is a very impressive text; (only that non-American users may complain that it did not stick to the S.I. units)."},{"Title":"Biology, 6th Edition","review":"I have a B.S. and M.S. in Biology and taught Intro. Biology Lab for two years, so I know a lot of basic biology. This book is the best for undergraduates to read because not only does it give a complete overview of all the major fields in biology, it also goes into depth when needed. For example, freshmen and sophomores don't need to memorize 1000 different species, they need biology basics like cell biology and biochemistry. This is where the book goes into detail, with the glycolytic pathways, and organelle specializations. This book prepares the way for more advanced texts, such as Cellular and Molecular Immunology and Genes VI."},{"Title":"Biology, 6th Edition","review":"Make sure your instructor doesn't mind you using an older edition. If they don't, this could be a much cheaper alternative. I compared this edition to the latest that my class was using, and there were very little changes.

As a college student, I have used Campbell's Biology publication in both Advanced Placement Biology in High School as well as Biology 1 in College.

Euphemia and her husband are good-hearted people, but not very bright. They take up residence in a canal boat (named Rudder Grange), then have all kinds of humorous adventures, or experience them vicariously through their maid Pomona.

It not only tells you the pros about the breed but also the cons, and gives you a realistic look on what the breed is about.

Very little practical information about care of dogs in different domestic settings (minimum exercise requirements, can they live with cats, how big a yard do the need.....)....so disappointing. But lots of anecdotal stuff on the history and development of the breed which is great. But unfortunately this is all inadequately referenced and there is no bibliography or list of sources...Basically there is a lot of information here but 'could do better'"},{"Title":"The New Complete Alaskan Malamute","review":"The New Complete Alaskan Malamute is exactly what the title implies, a compendium of facts and relative information about the breed. Covered are aspects of the history, personality of the breed, sledding, backpacking, medical/genetic issues, grooming, the breed Standard interpreted, a glossary of terms, and much much more. For the prospective or fisrt-time owner, and even long term fancier, this book is a gem for the wealth, depth and breadth of information. Acquisition of this notable work is a must for all fanciers."},{"Title":"The New Complete Alaskan Malamute","review":"This book is full of great history on the breed and information on how to show and sled your dog (once you get to that stage in growth and training!). If you have or are bringing home a new puppy it is not the book for you. I searched for this book because it was recommended to me. I think now that recommendation was only because this certain breeder had a few &quot;mentions&quot; in the book. I am looking for NOW information on my new puppy. This book is great for my friends who stop by -- they look at the pictures."},{"Title":"The New Complete Alaskan Malamute","review":"I bought this years ago, lost it, and just re-bought it. It has a lot of great info on the breed: where they came from, what they can do, what health challeges they have and tests for them, and resources for learning more. I'm sure some of the info is outdated, but the bulk of it--the real reason for having the book--is timeless."},{"Title":"The New Complete Alaskan Malamute","review":"This is the re-write of a prior publication entitled 'The Complete Alaskan Malamute', which was co-authored by Maxwell Riddle and Eva B. Seeley. One of the early breeders instrumental in getting the Alaskan Malamute breed recognized and registered by the AKC was Eva B. Seeley. This book, 'The New Complete Alaskan Malamute' is co-authored by Maxwell Riddle and Beth J. Harris and it appears that it doesn't have the heavy hand of Eva B. Seeley trying to write the dialogue.This book and it's prior publication contain a wealth of information concerning the early days of the Alaskan Malamute breed. While the earlier book includes chapters such as 'Selected Alaskan Malamute Pedigrees' and 'Champions and their Pedigrees by Months and Years', this book only includes 'Registers of Merits' for Sires and Dams in the appendix. So in that respect, the earlier book is more complete for historical reference, but this book contains more pertinent information on the breed itself. In other words, this book appears to have been written to appeal to current or prospective owners of Alaskan Malamutes and is much more readable, whereas the original book places heavy emphasis on documenting the early stock of the breed, making it a more valuable research book (eg. breeders trying to trace heritage).Owning any dog requires either an accidental incident, or careful planning. I'd advise that some research (careful planning) be done for any breed of dog you might consider owning, and if you're thinking about a Malamute, this book is a good place to start. If you happen to be the owner of a Malamute through an accidental occurance (perhaps one rescued from a dog pound), then this would \\"still\\" be the book you should read to familiarize yourself with the breed (another good out of print book regarding the Malamute breed is 'This is the Alaskan Malamute' by Joan M. Brearley). To summerize... if you own or are thinking of owning an Alaskan Malamute, get this easy to read and informative book!You'll probably have to buy this book on the used book market (amazon.com is a good place to start) as this is not a current publication; but it should be the book of choice for prospective or current Alaskan Malamute owners."},{"Title":"The New Complete Alaskan Malamute","review":"This is an Excellent book on Alaskan Malamutes. We presently own 3 Mals and are getting our first show Malamute in Dec. of 1997. I highly recommend this book to those who are getting their first Alaskan Malamute or people that already have one. It covers everything from the beginning of the Alaskan Malamute, showing conformation, obedience, medical problems, to sledding with these wonderful dogs."},{"Title":"The New Complete Alaskan Malamute","review":"For a first time mal owner this book would be just Ok, not one of the top three to buy, however, I personally am a history buff and this is a must and it gives back ground of why mals act the way they do or do not do something.

However, instead of arriving by herself, Opal has brought along her new friend Daphne. Daphne is a very special pig who can do everything the best, including standing on her head, dancing, holding her breath, playing the violin, and more. This begins to make Opal a bit jealous, for she wants to be the best at something. However, when Opal begins outshining Daphne at various activities, the tables turn.Once again, Holly Hobbie has created an endearing new tale featuring the little piggies of Woodcock Pocket and their lovely friends. Filled with gorgeous illustrations, along with lovely prose, and a message that will teach children that you can't always be the best at everything, as well as not to be jealous of someone when they can do something that you cannot, this is sure to be a hit with all.

The art is beautiful and is full of details not found very often these days. This story has a moral and is a nice segue to the conversation about \\"being yourself.\\" And who doesn't want that?The only reason I wouldn't give this book 5 stars is because I enjoy the other Toot & Puddle books a little more. This one is just a bit too modern in it's content. The others tend to be more about core childhood and timeless values.But still, the visuals are amazing."},{"Title":"The New Friend (Toot & Puddle)","review":"I am a huge fan of Toot and Puddle, so I didn't pre-read this book before purchasing. Unfortunately, I don't really want to read it to my son (who asks for Toot and Puddle every day) because the story ends up calling one of the characters a \\"prima donna\\" and then proceeds to explain what they mean by that (which isn't any better than the name-calling was by itself).Maybe many parents wouldn't mind this book, but I am careful to try to avoid examples of name-calling.Of course, the pictures are incredibly beautiful as usual, and there is a nice lesson in the story, as usual. I just wish authors as well as tv cartoon writers would be more aware of name-calling. I wouldn't want to hear my little guy or girl calling one of their friends a prima donna, no matter how well the shoe fits. I know they will learn name calling at some point in school or even the playground, but this story makes it look ok to label a friend like that."},{"Title":"Aikido","review":"Aikido was never meant to be a sport and has never even considered itself to be.

On the one hand, there is the continued movement toward hyper-specialization-of sub-disciplines within the field of ecology, of different lab groups and research centers, of individual ecologists themselves. On the other hand, there are ever-increasing cries for an approach that emphasizes the search for principles and paradigms that are broadly applicable across multiple ecological systems.Piper: A Model Genus confronts the conundrums of ecological balkanization and unification head-on. The scope of this volume is as broad as the field of ecology itself, with in-depth explorations of phenomena as varied as biogeography and chemical ecology, as seemingly unrelated as phylogenetics and ethnobotany. And the supporting cast of characters is highly diverse-everything from ants to earthworms, from spiders to fruit-eating bats. But the star attraction here is a single plant genus, itself a superb mesocosm for elucidating the regular, repeated patterns and processes that underlie so much of the variation in nature. One comes away from Piper with the satisfaction of knowing that we biologists can have our cake and eat it, too: Nature is wild and messy and complex, yet we can endeavor to make sense out of it all."},{"Title":"The Shining Falcon","review":"In a magical Russian world full of rusalka, leshyi, boyars and magic, Finist, the magician-prince of Kirtesk has a few problems on his hands--or often, talons. Oh, just the usual: a sorcerous, seductive cousin who's out for his throne, politics, magic and, of course, True Love.I loved the Russian setting and the use of Russian folk-tales to augment the excellent plot. Both characters and plot are developed thoroughly. If Russian folk-lore appeals to you, also try Mercedes Lackey's Firebird."},{"Title":"The Shining Falcon","review":"This book is like a fairy-tale.

A year later I looked through my bookshelf, needing another book to read. I picked it out, and sat down to read it. I couldn't put it down! I read it before school, in school, and after I finished my schoolwork until two in the morning.

In fact, there's a section on home computing that I've never seen in a computer book, and it's filled with terrific information and hints.

Vernon McGee is the only radio Bible teacher that I know of who consistantly pointed his listeners/students to the greatness of the Lord Jesus Christ no matter which page of Scripture he was teaching from. The Lord Jesus Christ is always brought to the front and center of his teaching.He was definitely gifted by God to teach from the Bible. He taught me how to interpret Scripture correctly by comparing Scripture with Scripture. The Spirit of God worked through J. Vernon McGee to lead me to saving faith in God our Saviour, and to turn me from the religion of Lutheranism (i.e., law and \\"gospel\\") that kept me from receiving God's GIFT of grace by faith alone, in Christ alone completely. Amen!Dr. McGee had a saying that went something like this: \\"Put the cookies on the bottom shelf so that the kiddies can reach them.\\" That was his approach to teaching the Word of God. He taught in a way that was able to be understood by every day, common people. Adults, as well as children, can become strong in their knowledge of the Word of God through the systematic teaching of Dr. McGee.The only thing that I disagree with him on is when he would stray from the Authorized King James Version in favor of the \\"better\\"/corrupt manuscripts. Overall, his teaching is mostly taught from the Authorized Version.When either listening or reading his program/commentary it is as if you are one-on-one with him. You will also discover that he has great sense of humor.I have the five volume set and recommend that if you are looking for good solid Bible teaching, this is a good eternal investment."},{"Title":"Thru the Bible with J. Vernon McGee","review":"If you are not familiar with J. Vernon McGee or his style, I would suggest that you try a single volume paperback commentary first to see if you like it. McGee reminds me of someone's grandfather...wise, opinionated, down-to-earth, and even gruff at times. If you have ever heard his radio broadcasts (from which these commentaries are derived), you know what I mean. McGee has a strong and distinct style, and he is always pressing us to seek God's will in our lives fervently. You can't fault the honesty of his vision or spirit! These commentaries give you McGee's interpretation of each chapter of that particular book of the Bible. The thing I like best about his commentaries are that they are fresh and interesting. He rarely gets tied down in seemingly obscure details or debates. If he has an opinion, he'll tell you exactly what it is and why without beating around the bush like so many other bible commentaries. Although I don't agree with all of his opinions, I respect his perspective, and rarely do his works leave me without something to &quot;chew on.&quot; This is also the only commentary that I have that can actually leave me laughing aloud at some point he's made. He had a great sense of humor!I would recommend this series of five volumes to any student of the bible. They are a great commentary for the every day person, unintimidating and understandable."},{"Title":"Thru the Bible with J.

I can't say that I enjoy McGee's radio broadcast but I do loooooove his commentaries. God has used these books to help me to love my times in the Word. I definitely reccommend starting with the 1st and 2nd volume. I find that many people do not understand how awesome the Old Testament is. McGee does a wonderful job of helping it come alive.

I read some other original pieces (all in Chinese) by the same Chinese historian and novelist lived in Taiwan. If you want to know more about history, customs, ways of thought, and many other things of Chinese, his works are the good way.

It is more pastoral, full of juicy lessons on practical theology. Manton's treatment on the subject of temptation in general, and temptation of Christ in particular as a case study consists of the nature of temptation and the tempter, specifically in the beginning by establishing a link between Satan's three attempts on Jesus to Satan's three-in-one attempt on Adam and Eve in Gen 3:8; brought together in 1 John 2:16 as the trinity of evil being the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes and the pride of life. The lure to turn a stone into bread is parallel to that of the forbidden fruit looking tasty to the appetite, appealing to the lust of the flesh. The lust of the eyes is represented by the glamorous view of the kingdoms of the world; being parallel to the forbidden fruit that is pleasant to the eyes. The bait to draw Christ to throw Himself down is similar to the forbidden fruit having an appearance that is able to make one wise; an appeal to human pride (p.32). But the greater lesson here is to show that Christ, being the second Adam, conquered not only temptations, but also the tempter and his agents, in stark comparison to the fatal miserable failure of the first Adam who was conquered by, instead of conquering the enemy.Though I disagree with Manton on the extent of Satan's knowledge of a divine plan of the cross (p.111), I am grateful his sermons, like most Puritan sermons, are now available to the public. They are edifying to the saints, a sweet cordial, full of sustaining and strengthening grace to the souls in pilgrimage through the wilderness of this dangerous world."},{"Title":"People of Passion: Spotlighting Southern Appalachia, Representing America","review":"People Of Passion is an anthology of brief stories and snapshots of the lives of great figures from American history, with especial focus upon Southern Appalachia. The common theme of the vignettes is an emotional drive that nourishes the soul, as individuals labored to fulfill their dreams, bring good works, or just understand themselves and others better. The short tales, usually no more than four pages, span history from the 1700's to the mid-1900's and bring the can-do spirit of America to the page in a burst of impressions and sensations."},{"Title":"People of Passion: Spotlighting Southern Appalachia, Representing America","review":"It surprised me - and I'm quite sure that many people are unaware of the leadership provided by Southern Appalachia settlers in abolishing slavery in America long before the Emancipation Proclamation issued by Abraham Lincoln on January 1, 1863.I enjoyed the 48 stories in this book about these settlers, but I especially appreciated the one titled \\"Freedom For All.\\" It describes how early America, much like Europe, primarily had two classes of people: (1) the aristocratic land and business owners, and (2) the menial working class. The middle class had not yet been established. The aristocrats grabbed up the fertile lands near the east coast; in the South, the system of large plantations limited the number of Americans who could prosper.Seeking opportunities, hardy colonists accepted the challenge of the high mountain ranges. Scotch-Irish and Germans, along with Huguenots (French protestants), Quakers, and poor English who had been indentured servants in the East made the trek. Many settled in the mountainous regions of Pennsylvania and Maryland. Later, they moved on down to Virginia's Shenandoah Valley.Eventually, the Shenandoah Valley became a channel for a continuous stream of people passing through, moving south into the Carolinas, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Georgia. The process accelerated as eastern aristocrats decided that enslaving Africans was more profitable and productive than the European indentured servitude system. As black slavery increased, more and more indentured servants were freed to find independence to the south and beyond the mountains.An antislavery sentiment grew among the mountaineers who came from the indentured culture and struggled to establish an individualistic way of life. Whites whose families had personally experienced the effects of servitude formed antislavery groups. One such group was the North Carolina Manumission (set free) Society. This society denounced the importation and exportation of slaves, and they provided for the purchase of slave contracts to help them gain freedom. Through their efforts, over 2,000 slaves in North Carolina were freed between 1824-1826.Between 1817-1830, Baptist ministers in the mountains of Tennessee and Kentucky joined forces to promote and encourage emancipation. Earlier efforts by a group of Scotch-Irish immigrants led by Presbyterian minister David Rice paved the way for this work. As early as 1792, when Kentucky penned a state constitution, Rice led a group to push for excluding slavery in the state. The Friends of Humanity was formed in Kentucky in 1807. Led by 11 ministers and 13 laymen of several denominations, the group promoted freedom for all humans.Leaders in East Tennessee pushed for providing education for slaves. Groups were formed in Maryville and Knoxville to spotlight the plight of slaves and take steps to assist them. The \\"Presbyterian Witness,\\" published in Knoxville, ran an editorial that claimed there was not a solitary argument in favor of educating a white person that could not be used in educating a black person.The editor wrote: \\"If one has a soul that will never die, so has the other. If one has the susceptibilities of improvement - mentally, socially, and morally - so has the other. If one is bound by the laws of God to improve the talents he has received from the Creator's hands, so is the other.\\"Through the years it has been said that the people of Southern Appalachia are withdrawn and \\"hard to get to know.\\" To a degree this may be true. A large part of this has had to do with the fact that they are very protective of their individuality. At the same time they have always tried to assist others in acquiring the opportunity to express individuality. No place has this been better shown in Southern Appalachian history than in their support to help all creatures of God experience freedom.Good reading, good information, well presented."},{"Title":"People of Passion: Spotlighting Southern Appalachia, Representing America","review":"200 years of history told through these 48 short personal stories makes great reading. Some of the stories almost tore my heart out, but the encouraging message of \\"Our good will find us out\\" resonates throughout the book. Beginning in the 1760s, the author presents stories of a wide gamut of people who carved out niches for themselves and their families in the Southern Appalachian Highlands. Mays includes stories of European-Americans, Cherokees, African-Americans, and people of unknown origins such as the Melungeons, as he presents a body of work that honestly reveals both the kindness and cruelty of humanity.Some of the personalities in the book are well known, but most of them are unknown to all but a relatively few people. And it is the accounts of mostly-unknown people such as Caleb Porter, White Fawn, Hattie Whaley, Charles Cansler, Tom Walker, Mahala Mullins, Marjorie Chalmers, and Nero and Jethro that captured my heart and soul. Mays writes, \\"Basically, these were simple, good-hearted people with faith in God, nature, themselves, and their neighbors. Though their legacy lives on, many of their stores are almost forgotten. That's why I wanted to reopen my files and revive some of their accounts in this book, a book I began over a quarter of a century ago.\\"Having been born and reared in Western North Carolina, and having a Scots-Irish Cherokee heritage, I can especially relate to this informative and uplifting book. And there is no doubt about its entertainment value. As I was reading (and re-reading) it, I thought, \\"What a great TV series this would make!\\" I highly recommend People Of Passion for a wide age span of readers. Older folks will appreciate it as it connects them with yesterday, and students can learn much about not only the heritage of the Southern Appalachian Highlands but also about American courage and spirit."},{"Title":"People of Passion: Spotlighting Southern Appalachia, Representing America","review":"The book swept me back to my youth growing up in Kentucky. When we had company, and food at the table was in short supply, how well I recall my father whispering to us kids, FHB - meaning family hold back. Yes, we were poor, but like the people in this book we were rich in those things that are truly important. A story that really triggered memories is Mountain Hospitality. And, my wife, born and reared in San Francisco, still can't get over the story about The Walker Sisters. She is getting all of her relatives and friends to read it. As the book says, these five staunchly independent sisters were living legends in the Great Smoky Mountains - and now they are becoming legends in the bay area!My wife and I traveled from California to Memphis, on to Nashville, and then to Knoxville and the Great Smoky Mountains. We had the pleasure of meeting author Carl Mays when he was signing books at the Sugarlands Visitor Center in the national park. I'm glad he was there that afternoon and glad we were introduced to People of Passion. Entertaining, highly informative, and sometimes heart rending, it is a tremendous read and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"People of Passion: Spotlighting Southern Appalachia, Representing America","review":"&quot;People Of Passion&quot; was an attractive Mother's Day gift from my son and daughter-in-law. (Click on the cover to enlarge it and you will see what I mean.) The original art by Vern Hippensteal whetted my appetite to savor the stories inside by Carl Mays. They certainly did not disappoint. They are outstanding, presenting word pictures of 200 years of Southern Appalachian history told through personal stories. I have many favorites among them, but since the book was given to me when it was, I must say that &quot;The Mother's Day Gift&quot; set in the 1930s was special. It reminded me so much of a similar event that happened when I was a child. My son and daughter-in-law got the book when they were on vacation in The Great Smoky Mountains, and I have enjoyed it even more than the delicious mountain-made candy they combined with it!From Amazon, I have ordered 3 more copies of the book to give as gifts. So, needless to say, I highly recommend this collection of 48 stories.

It is subtitled &quot;Stories of Faith &amp; Determination That Will Touch Your Heart &amp; Warm Your Soul,&quot; and the content does just that! It contains 48 short stories that cover 200 years of personal accounts of people of Southern Appalachia (1768-1965). Having moved from New York to Atlanta, I was in Gatlinburg, TN and picked up a copy of this book, and was intrigued by it from the opening page. I certainly gained an appreciation for this area and for the Cherokees, mountaineers, and highlanders who settled it. Prior to reading this book, I had an entirely different opinion of this part of our nation and the people who settled here. I am encouraging my students and my own children to read this book. It is well-written and well-edited.

It was always a fun trip, with candy apples, attractions, drives through the national park, and a lot of swimming in the hotel pool. But before I acquired this book on a recent trip as an adult, I never truly understood and appreciated the heritage of the area, even though I knew something about it. &quot;People Of Passion&quot; paints great word pictures of what came before the candy apples, attractions, rides through the park, and hotel pools. As I read the book, I could see the people in my mind and almost feel their pains, struggles, joys, and accomplishments. It caused me to feel proud of them and appreciate what they went through. I especially enjoyed the stories of Hattie Whaley (a strong, mountain woman who saved herself and children from death); Caleb Porter (a man who dealt bravely with the slaughter of his wife and child); Dr. Robert Thomas (a medical missionary to the settlement of Pittman Center); Miss Marjorie Chalmers (a heroic nurse who took care of the people of Gatlinburg for 30 years); and Nero &amp; Jethro (twins, whose story caused me to laugh and cry at the same time).

Now I am acquiring other copies to give as gifts, and I appreciate the quantity discount price offered on Amazon. All of the 48 short stories are well-written accounts of actual events presented in historical sequence. Sometimes humorous, sometimes heartrending, the stories are always inspirational. They provide us with a great appreciation for the people who for 200 years laid the foundation on which we have opportunities and privileges to build today. It is a history of the Southern Highlands told in short story form, but it goes far beyond being a regional book. It paints a great word picture of the American spirit. There are many outstanding, captivating stories, and my favorite is the account of Caleb Porter in the early 1800s. Even though this is one of the stories that will bring tears rather than laughter, it is also one that leads us to count our blessings today.

From entertaining stories like \\"The Tooth-Jumper\\" and \\"Belial, the Razorback Hog,\\" to such a touching story like \\"The Value of Religion,\\" Mays does a terrific job of painting word pictures of Southern Appalachia, which, indeed, presents the spirit of America."},{"Title":"People of Passion: Spotlighting Southern Appalachia, Representing America","review":"I was very displeased with this book.

This is when traditional political narrative is set aside in favor of a careful reconstruction of time and place and process. It's obvious that Barrow loves this approach: he draws on the mountains of documentary minutiae, and the statistical analyses they've spawned, on the odd foreign sources, on the archaeology, to present a sort of SimScotland in all its dynamic detail. When he feels forced to recount the political history, he is less comfortable, and the book drags terribly. It would have been nicer if he had been able to more clearly connect the story of power at the highest levels to the context he so exuberantly brings alive. His prose when describing &quot;life at the ground level&quot; is almost poetic; his style when relating the wars and intrigues of kings and earls is like the worst PowerPoint presentation you've ever had to sit through. At one point, it is completely incomprehensible. Fortunately, he has the good sense to keep those tedious passages to a minimum, and to focus on the &quot;new look&quot;. There is more than just reconstruction to this &quot;new history&quot;: its ultimate aim, I think, is to reveal historical processes, resolved in the finest detail available, from multiple perspectives. This engenders insight: for instance, it struck me, in the section on towns and burgesses, that these newly chartered towns (and also the new contemporaneous monastic communities) of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries can be seen as precursors to European colonialism--a sort of internal economic colonization. They were usually stocked with foreigners that had specialized skills and international trade contacts, and were created with the explicit goal of creating wealth for kings who were tired of the customary local tribute (how many cheese wheels, sacks of oats, and chickens does a king need?). I believe these were the initial steps toward the full-blown colonial mercantilism that emerged in western Europe four centuries later. The other effect of this &quot;new&quot; history is to reduce the distance between you and twelfth century Scotland--what you once thought of as olde and medieval is reworked so that one almost feels the issues and resources of the very living people of the time, and one can appreciate the dilemmas and choices they faced."},{"Title":"Nettravel: How Travelers Use the Internet (Songline Guides)","review":"This book is strong because it picks out the best travel sites and offers an intelligent, thorough description of each one.

The principal character Razumov is a quiet philosophy student who gets caught up with the anarchist Haldin. Instead of helping Haldin Razumov goes to the authorities and betrays him.This leads to further complications. Razumov has been appointed as if by fate to become a tool of the autocracy; he has no choice really. He is sent on a mission to Geneva in order to spy on Russian emigres living there.Haldin's mother and sister are living there waiting for word from him. The emigres are grotesque. Eventually Razumov confesses that he is helping the government and is almost beaten to death. In the end Razumov returns to Russia where he is cared for by a servant woman. Conrad suggests, as he does in most of his writings, that our fate is something beyond us and his skill is in showing how that is so"},{"Title":"Under Western Eyes (Malay edition)","review":"This is a Russian story for Western ears, says the narrator, an Englishman who teaches languages in Geneva at the beginning of the 20th century.A Russian student in St.Petersburg is faced with a dilemma that must have been experienced in similar form by many others in many times and countries, and by many more in their imagination. What would I do, if...Say, you were a German student with vaguely leftwing orientation in the early 70s, and Ulrike Meinhof had just gone underground, and by some strange combination of coincidences she turns up in your flat and asks for temporary shelter and some minor help in an escape plan.This is the situation that Conrad puts his hero Razumov in. Not with Meinhof, silly, but with a freshly successful assassin of a high Russian politician; the 2 students knew each other barely.From here, Conrad develops a compelling story of betrayal and espionage and political revolution, starting in St.Petersburg, then moving to Geneva. Like in real life, one might say. Switzerland becomes the playground for the Russian revolutionaries in exile and for their hunters. The title of the story means exactly that: Russian fights fought in the West for \`them' to watch and wonder over.(This book is another case of oddly misinforming book descriptions, here on an otherwise blameless Penguin: the back cover says that the book explores the conflict between East and West. What nonsense. The book explores no such thing.)Conrad was far from sympathizing with \`the Russians', but he seems to have known them quite well. His Razumov (the word means \`reason' or \`mind', says the writer of the notes) is a variation on Razkolnikov. Conrad disliked Dostoyevsky, who was \`too Russian' for him, but he was rather obviously writing \`against' him here. Razumov's guilt is his betrayal of the assassin, and his atonement/punishment comes in hard struggles between reason/self preservation and emotion.The novel has a rather simple structure, for a major Conrad novel.The narrator came into possession of Razumov's diaries; he paraphrases and summarizes them for us. (Why not stick to the fiction and let us read the \`original' diary, as Nabokov might have done? - I thought of Nabokov here because VN, like JC, disliked Dostoyevsky; it may be an interesting subject to compare the differences of the dislikes of JC and VN.)Part 1 is the story in St.Pete, by the diaries. Then we follow the narrator's personal experience in Geneva. Protagonists in the story have not read part 1, of course... This gives the narration a Hitchcockian flavor. We know more than the people in the story, and that drives suspense.JC did not have the benefit of the Bolshevik revolution hindsight, that's why some of the politics are oddly off target. It could hardly be otherwise in 1910.The novel has more women than most other Conrad books. This about the main female character: at the educational institutions, she was looked upon unfavorably. She was suspected of holding independent opinions.Quite possibly, JC wrote women into this book as a defense mechanism. He had been attacked from that angle.In the life work of Conrad, this novel is in a surprising position. He wrote it before he reached his prominent and profitable phase. It is not necessarily a shocking departure in terms of methods, but it is for sure a pure thriller: a precursor of Graham Greene and John Le Carre, and their next generation. There is nothing of the complexity and complication of Nostromo in this novel. Even the Secret Agent is much more complex.I do not hesitate to include this in my short list of best Conrads."},{"Title":"Under Western Eyes (Malay edition)","review":"The book could have been interesting but it's simply not up to Joseph Conrad's usual quality.

This book might have been a knock off of Crime and punishment. It has all the soul searching and emoting that you expect from Russian works. Self destruction is a main theme.It also has some uniquely Conrad touches. The destruction of the main character's eardrums by Nikita's violent slapping is a typical Conrad detail. The reconciliation of the traitor and the rebels also has his touch.A rather dark and heavy read, but worthwhile if you enjoyed Heart of Darkness."},{"Title":"Under Western Eyes (Malay edition)","review":"You have to be around my age (i.e., older than dirt) to remember Barry Goldwater, a right-wing Republican from Arizona who wrote a book with the above title and spectacularly lost to Lyndon Johnson in the presidential race of '64. I invoke his long-dead phrase because, without the irony, it could be UWE's subtitle. Conrad actively hated leftists and self-proclaimed \\"revolutionaries,\\" and this disgust shines through all of his best work, from the sniveling proto-unionist Donkin in \\"...Narcissus\\" through the bestial \\"generals\\" of \\"Nostromo\\" and, needless to say, the uber-hypocrite Kurtz. Razumov's moment of conservative illumination, in the snow on the night Haldin destroys his life, can be read as serious, humorous, or anywhere in between--but it is genuine. That fragment he pins to his wall (and which Councilor Mikulin finds so fascinating) sums up with Conradian depth and precision today's popular doctrine of personal responsibility. Peter Ivanovich, one of the slimiest characters on record (not to mention his \\"Egeria\\") could easily send major liberals over the wall. Naturally, all readers are free to interpret political novels as they see fit, but Conrad's biographers have documented his rightward tilt. UWE is wonderful proof that genius does not play politics.

His friend combatted autocratic despotism, the destroyer of the spirit of progress and truth, of freedom, law and justice.This novel is Conrad's version of Dostoevsky's 'Crime and Punishment': 'A moral spectre is infinitely more effective than any visible apparition of death.'Conrad was a visionary: 'A violent revolution falls into the hands of narrow minded fanatics and tyrannical hypocrites. The scrupulous and the just, the noble, humane and devoted natures, the unselfish and the intelligent may begin a movement but it passes away from them.'His picture of the world of revolutionary conspirators is excellent: double agents, opportunists, naive idealists, hypocrites, rogues, agitators, fanatics and cynics. 'It did not matter what it was, vanity, despair, love, hate, greed, intelligent pride, a stupid conceit, it was all one to him as long as the man could be made to serve.'But this book has many flaws: melodramatic overreactions (attack on Ziemianitch, secret love of Razumov), high improbabilities (confession of Razumov, interventions of 'Western Eyes') or the ultimate verdict ('he was the victim of an outrage. He had confessed voluntarily.')Joseph Conrad was an ambitious writer, but this book has not the same high standard as his masterpieces 'Heart of Darkness' and 'Lord Jim'.A worth-while read."},{"Title":"Under Western Eyes (Malay edition)","review":"I read only a few pages and did not find it all that interesting.

Unable to free himself of suspicion, Razumov leaves Russia for western Europe.In Switzerland, Razumov finds himself involved with other Russians, revolutionary plotters intent on overthrowing the Tsar. The events surrounding our protagonist's time in Switzerland are woven in Conrad's usual masterful way. Razumov finds love with a sympatico woman, a fellow exile, but ultimately nothing comes of it.I would be tempted to label Razumov a sociopath, given his described thoughts about others he encounters. He is a loner described as having no family or close friends, and seems driven by ambitions unrelated to the involvement of anyone outside himself. Fellow students he knows are seen by him as no more than nodding acquaintances. It is true that Conrad never suggests Razumov suffers from some emotional incapacity, but the evidence is certainly there.With respect to Conrad's theme about the autocratic state, we have been told that the totalitarian state is worse than one that is merely a dictatorship. Both would appear to be lawless, qualifying under Conrad's definition as autocracies. Insofar as neither would recognize any limit on the power of those in power, the foregoing distinction becomes one possessed of no substance.Today's Russia appears to differ from the Tsarist one in that some law appears even as limit on the power of the national leaders.[...]Does that leave today's Russia the same as the Tsarist one?

Honestly, you could remove any and all of the prepositional qualifiers from that assertion, and I'd still be willing to defend it. Under Western Eyes is a superb novel in every way - in emotional impact, in intelligence, and in narrative art - and it is very specifically a Russian novel as well as a novel about Russia. Anecdotes suggest that Conrad wrote it in response to his reading of Dostoevsky; if so, he exceeded his model in dazzling narrative acrobatics and in intelligence.The central character, Razumov, is the most dislikable anti-hero in all fiction, so it's an amazing feat of empathy by which Conrad brings us to care about his fate. Conrad's genius as a narrator is his ability to place himself and the reader in a realm of detachment, so that every event and every character can be observed from several angles at once. The \\"unreliable narrator\\" is child's play for Conrad. I don't want to spoil any of the prismatic effect of Conrad's narrative structure by telling any more of the tale of Under Western Eyes, but I will mention that the title is not insignificant.The Russia portrayed in this novel is a land of cynicism and naivete intertwined - hyper-emotionalism and psychological repression in equal measure - omnicompetent surveillance and hopeless myopia - ruthless bureaucracy and utter disorganization - a land in short of oxymoronic self-destruction. This is NOT, however, the Russia of Communism! The novel was written in 1911! This is Russia as it existed under the Tsarist autocracy, and everything about it clamors for revolution. It's interesting to compare Conrad's portrayal of the old regime with the nostalgic and idealized version served up by Vladimir Nabokov in his memoir \\"Speak, Memory.\\" Nabokov wrote far more beautiful sentences, but Conrad saw deeper. The horror for us, post-Stalinist readers, in Conrad's depiction of the pre-revolutionary state-of-things is that we KNOW that change will not change much, that autocratic, arbitrary repression will be replaced by...more of the same.Conrad wrote two novels aground, away from the sea - this one and The Secret Agent. They are among his best. Some readers of today seem to find Conrad's style involuted and dry, and blame it on his status as a 'second-language' writer. To my mind, they are missing the point, the complex lensing of perspective through the minds of Conrad's narrative intermediaries. This is a book to be read slowly and observantly; the effort will be rewarded."},{"Title":"Under Western Eyes (Malay edition)","review":"Conrad is a real star, I'm rather fond of him. Under Western Eyes is about living in a time of revolutionary urgency, individual fragility in a delicate system, and personal honor.To summarize; Razumov, the 'Hero' is a university student in Russia post 1905 but pre 1917 who keeps to himself and has no real family and no close friends. A fellow student and a revolutionary, Victor Haldin, assasinates a local oppressive Tsarist autocrat. He then takes a chance and takes momentary asylum with Razumov, asking him to help him get out of the city. Razumov is an evolutionary progressive, not a revolutionary. Not willing to risk association with a radical like Haldin and destroy his entire life, Razumov turns him in to the police, and Haldin is subsequently hung.The rest of the novel deals with Razumov's struggle with himself- he betrayed, and he has to live with a lie. Complicating things, he falls in love with Haldin's sister in exile. Raz can't bear it though, and eventually he does the right thing, but things get messy.Thats the general plot, but the real meat of the novel is in the characters and the ideas underlying the conversations between them. The idea of how you justify revolution, the chaos of revolution vs the order of gradual reform, the unwillingness and helplessness of the individual caught in it all. And there's a continual theme of the diference between East and West.Razumov reminds me a bit of Crime and Punishment's Raskolnikov- an isolated university student waxing the time away in a single apartment, brooding over Big Ideas and being slowly crushed by a powerful conscience. The stuff of modernity. Dostoyevsky was a little bit better, so thats why Under Western Eyes only gets 4 stars."},{"Title":"Under Western Eyes (Malay edition)","review":"Joseph Conrad is one of the most wonderful writers for me (although there are a couple of his novels that I am yet to come to grips with). Often novels give me cause to reflect on my life and my place in the universe, but this one is so personal to me that I wonder if my recommendation can be meaningful to others. You see, the narrator of Under Western Eyes is an English speaking man, an older man, an observer, who becomes a possessor of secret knowledge which reflects on the things he sees taking place around him - of the one holding the secret, of the ones ignorant of it. But the second most important character is a young woman, Natalie Haldin, living away from Russia with her mother (in Geneva). And by chance I have a work-based friendship with a colleague who happens to be a Russian woman living away from Russia (in Australia). The last chapter telling of the final meeting between Natalie and the narrator - for quite personal reasons (but it is so well written) was an emotional torment for me, my final meeting has yet to occur - I hope!The most important character in the novel (I discount the narrator, as I would myself, although he is of great importance - you may think the greatest) is a young student, Razumov, who betrays Natalie's brother and then is imposed on by the powers to spy on Russian dissidents in Geneva. There he meets Natalie and others who are totally unaware of his role in Natalie's brother's betrayal and subsequent execution. But it is known that he was a fellow student of Natalie's brother so they are drawn to him. Would Natalie and Razumov become romantically allied? Only if the secret is kept?I will not answer these questions. But I will say that Razumov, weak throughout the novel with the same sort of uncertainties that challenge me, turns out to be the most courageous of characters and, in fact, is afforded one tiny morsel of reward.Conrad is a great user of words although he does say very early on that words are the great foes of reality (page 1). The title of this review is a quote. Here are two more):The man who says he has no illusions has at least that one (page 188)There is always something to weigh down the spiritual side in all of us (page 122)While the novel may not have the same personal impact for you as it did for me, it is very engaging and rewarding. Typically for Conrad though, the writing is very dense, and for me at least, needed lots of time and reflection."},{"Title":"Under Western Eyes (Malay edition)","review":"It was a relief to find Conrad's Under Western Eyes somewhat less surreal and more concise; yet the complexity and subtlety prove to be no less daunting as the readers are lured into the very same maze in which the main character Razumov finds himself trapped in.As a time when &quot;men were sacrificing their lives for ideas&quot;, 1911 was not meant for moderates who wished to stay neutral between anarchy and hierachy. Razumov, a steadfast philosphy student in St. Petersburg is involuntarily enmeshed in a radical's political intrigue, and to put it in plain &quot;matter-of-fact&quot; tone, he betrays the anarchist. But the brilliancy of Conrad is the way he makes this statement grow by exploring the soft tissue of human interaction in between the hard mechanism of change. Razumov has no choice as the system's teaching induces him to turn in the &quot;criminal&quot; who is dismantling order in society. After the authorities dispatch Razumov to Geneva with a mission, he willingly accepts without realizing he is actually losing his individuality instead of regaining it as he once supposed. To spy on the radical's sister and mother does not lie coherent with his righteous character, yet Razumov's rigid faith in czarist bureacracy and inability to choose for himself lead to more lies. It is still truth however, that redeemds Razumov despite fate's little surprises to keep his betrayal in the shadow. And not unlike fellow St. Petersburg student Raskolnikov from Crime and Punishment, Razumov finds salvation in the betrayed radical's sister's deep love for him. Also like Raskolnikov, Razumov is at last reconciled to his existence through physical suffering.Conrad was by no means denouncing the blossom of revolution, he grazed at the thorns and showed us the many shades of reformation. No idealism remains pure in the real world; in this case, Haldin's kind of pursuit fuses with political murder as his compatriots in Geneva embrace a bureaucratic order. All this is coolly observed by Conrad's Western eyes-an outsider to the struggle and the inner turmoil of Russia to find a balance amongst the blinding clashes of change."},{"Title":"Under Western Eyes (Malay edition)","review":"Joseph Conrad had famously hard feelings for the Russians, occupiers of his Polish homeland. In \\"Under Western Eyes\\" (1911), Conrad employs tough love in depicting the Russian character, hopelessly divided between reckless radicalism and reactionary reasonlessness, between devotion and despair.Razumov is a college student in St. Petersberg content to labor under the Czarist system, under which he hopes to advance through study. Fate intervenes in the form of a fellow student, Victor Haldin, fresh from blowing up a secret police chief, who thinks Razumov is the man to aid his escape. Razumov is horrified instead, not at the murderous nature of the act but what it could mean to Razumov's future. Will he turn Haldin in, or try and get him out of the city?The introduction of my Penguin edition notes a popular criticism of \\"Under Western Eyes\\" is that its characters \\"exist only for the sake of the ideas.\\" That's a problem of much of Conrad's fiction, and after the very taut and thrilling first part is over, we are treated to a number of garden-path colloquies in Geneva that slow things down considerably. But the ideas Conrad deals with, about Russia's political and philosophical underpinnings, are often fascinating and certainly to the point, especially considering the novel was written as the real Russia stood ready to implode from the strife depicted here.Conrad tended to view revolutionaries with cynical remove, especially when they employed violence as a means to an end, yet many of the revolutionaries we meet here are a more sympathetic lot than the nihilistic goons of \\"The Secret Agent.\\" \\"You have either to rot or to burn,\\" explains Sophia Antonovna, a genuinely good character who supports the revolution. She's not one to wither quietly while there's injustice to be fought.Razumov might disagree. It's not that he believes in the system, just the futility of fighting it. \\"The exceptional could not prevail against the material contacts which make one day resemble another,\\" he tells himself. \\"Tomorrow would be like yesterday.\\" But as he is pushed into the world of revolution despite himself, he finds himself doubting more and more the shaky pillars of his prior existence.It's not clear to me which point-of-view Conrad held; likely he saw the merits of every ideology depicted here, a relativism that made him doubtful of any one solution. Certainly \\"Under Western Eyes\\" is about as even-handed a book about revolutionary struggle as you might care to read, compelling, deep, and quotable from first page to last. One wishes that Conrad could have sustained the dramatic force of the Part First in the latter three-fourths of the novel, but what you get is one of Conrad's most important books.Those thinking novels about Russians are reflexively depressing and opaque are not going to have their minds changed here, but they will enjoy the chance at seeing one of the world's most complicated nations through the prism of one of literature's most discerning, eloquent minds."},{"Title":"Under Western Eyes (Malay edition)","review":"In ways almost all students, and certainly their teachers also, are hard-pressed to explain, one particular work of an author becomes the one \\"assigned,\\" and the others are dismissed, usually unread, as \\"minor,\\" or, at least not necessary to have read in order to say that one has \\"done\\" this author. For example, for Thomas Wolfe, it isLook Homeward, Angeland for Gustave Flaubert, it isMadame Bovary. For Joseph Conrad, it isHeart of Darkness, and it still rankles me that it was adopted as a metaphor for the Vietnam War inApocalypse Now. The better intentioned readers will often say... someday...

He commenced to \\"seek his fortune\\" in the merchant marines, at the age of 16. Nautical themes are the subject of several of his works. English is his THIRD language, and it is truly humbling to recall that while reading his exquisitely crafted prose, like beautifully polished fine grain wood.\\"Under Western Eyes\\" opens in pre-revolutionary Russia, in the first decade of the 20th Century. The majority of the novel however transpires in Geneva, in the milieu of Russian revolutionaries and poseurs. The narrator, sometimes direct, at other times indirect, is an older English teacher of languages, who is the Western eyes of the title, and believes himself an impartial observer, an \\"inertial reference frame\\" if you will, of the machinations and power struggles of the revolutionaries, primarily, but also of the Russian establishment figures as well. The action commences when a student revolutionary, Victor Haldin, assassinates Mr. de P--, the President of the notorious Repressive Commission. Haldin then turns to a fellow student he does not know well, Razumov, to assist him in his escape. Haldin is betrayed to the quintessential establishment figure, Counsillor Mikulin. However, it appears that despite Razumov's actions, he is \\"tainted,\\" and must seek exile himself in Geneva, where, inter alia, he develops a relationship with Haldin's sister and mother. It is a deeply psychological novel, and much of the action is in the drawing rooms of Geneva, where the revolutionaries pose, and establish pecking orders. Of the several sub-plots and minor characters of interest is Peter Ivanovitch, who supposedly made a spectacular escape from the Far East of Czarist Russia, with the help of a woman, and thence became an ardent \\"feminist,\\" though he sure manages to abuse his housekeeper / stenographer. Another theme in the novel is similar toThe Red Badge of CourageAfter the \\"battle,\\" with Haldin's demise, who really knows what happened, and is it possible for the coward and villain to portray himself as the hero?Conrad was generally considered to be politically conservative, with a strong distain for revolutionary elements, and certainly in this novel many do not come off well. However, Conrad also paints an exceedingly bleak picture of living conditions, and the repressive nature of Russian society, certainly sufficient to motivate revolutionaries. In his notes, as an afterword, Conrad says: \\"The obligation of absolute fairness was imposed on me historically and hereditarily, by the peculiar experience of race and family, in addition to my primary conviction that truth alone is the justification of any fiction...I have never been called before to a greater effort of detachment: detachment from all passions, prejudices and even from personal memories.\\"I firmly believe that Conrad succeed in his stated objective above. The novel is also an excellent \\"spy novel\\" filled with intrigue and duplicity that inspired Graham Greene, W. Somerset Maugham and John Le Carr&eacute;. Prince Peter Kropotkin famously said that the worse things are, the better, since reform is the enemy of revolution. Counsillor Milulin understood this dictum well, and is why he fought the revolutionaries, so that his reformist agenda could succeed.It was a bitter cold February day in Santa Fe, NM when my hiking friend and I sought refuge in an excellent second-hand bookstore.

Moving further from the symbolic sea stories of his early career, it extends the remarkable diversity that Nostromo and The Secret Agent introduced. It is in many ways an extension of the latter but also mixes in elements of classic Russian fiction and other factors to make a truly great work. The novel is many things: a psychological portrait, a sociohistorical look at political unrest, a philosophical take on revolutions, a complex depiction of the Russian character, a dramatization of the conflict between politics/morality and idealism/practicality, a nuanced view of Russia filtered through a Western lens - and by extension a contrast between Eastern and Western sensibilities -, and more. It is essential for fans, and those not fond of more representative Conrad may be pleasantly surprised, especially those interested in Russian, historical, or political fiction.As Conrad's 1920 Preface notes, this 1911 work became in many ways a historical novel in only a few years. It depicts Czarist Russia's death throes, unflinchingly showing its many horrors and atrocities. Conrad always had great sympathy for the poor and downtrodden, and this may be the clearest example; the book's portrayal of poverty and other forms of want is truly eye-opening. That such suffering existed less than a century ago in an ostensibly modern country is enough to breed misanthropy in the staunchest optimist. Conrad leaves no doubt that it was ripe for reform - nay, that drastic change was practically inevitable. Revolution of course came in only six years, instantly changing the book's significance. The writing is very visceral, leaving no doubt that the era was anything but pretty; a focus on various forms of dreariness makes clear that it was in many ways truly wretched. It is particularly valuable as an antidote to those who for decades championed - and still champion - Czarist Russia as a haven of relative tranquility and liberty in the wake of the Soviet Union's admitted oppression.However, this is not a liberal work crying for revolution. Conrad was far too deeply conservative to ever write or even think such a thing - not in today's dumbed-down political catchphrase sense but in a truly pessimistic way. He had little hope for melioration in politics or anything else, tragically convinced that human life will always be pained and striving with the poor and downtrodden forever at succeeding tyrannies' mercy. I have never seen another work with such little faith in revolution or political change of any sort; Conrad's Preface concludes by mocking \\"the strange conviction that a fundamental change of hearts must follow the downfall of any given human institutions,\\" noting, \\"These people are unable to see that all they can effect is merely a change of names.\\" If this sounds dry, however astute, worry not; the dramatization is very engaging and intriguing, making the point clear without failing to entertain and managing to avoid heavy-handedness.Indeed, like nearly all Conrad, the novel can be enjoyed on a very basic level. Like The Secret, it deals heavily in international political intrigue complete with spies, assassinations, etc. It certainly has little resemblance to the superficial spy stories so sadly ubiquitous in recent decades but has more excitement and adventure than most century-old novels. Perhaps more integrally, it is told in an essentially straight-forward, though not linear, way, especially compared to most Conrad; the feeling of being lost and disoriented that turns off so many casuals to much of his work is only slightly present and used with great skill for suspense and dramatic irony. Under is thus one of his most accessible major works and a good place for neophytes to start or for the unconvinced to try again.Many other factors give wide appeal. For instance, Russian fiction's many fans would be very hard-pressed to find a more \\"Russian\\" work by a non-Russian. The novel is often called Conrad's response to Fyodor Dostoevsky, whom he apparently loathed, particularly in regard to Crime and Punishment. There are indeed many similarities between the latter's Raskolnikov and Under's Razumov; Crime fans and Dostoevsky scholars can have a proverbial field day analyzing this and other aspects. More fundamentally, much of the novel is set in Russia and is thoroughly inundated with all things Russian. We not only get a good idea of how early twentieth century Russia looked but more than a glimpse of its culture - everything from manners to speech to politics. Also, in the grand tradition of Russian greats like Dostoevsky and Leo Tolstoy, Conrad includes a wealth of thought-provoking material - without their famous bulk, doubtless to the great relief of many. The novel is both broadly and specifically philosophical, dramatizing a wide variety of abstract and practical issues in a way that forces us to confront the weighty subjects that many think necessary to great literature. The depiction of feminism, implicitly championed in other Conrad, is especially dubious and thus fascinating. Also like Dostoevsky and Tolstoy, and unlike other Conrad, much of this is done via dialogue - another striking instance of Conrad's diversity.Even more fundamentally, Under is a profoundly penetrating study of the Russian character - not only as it then was but in its essence. This is in many ways what the Russian greats were really getting at, and that Conrad was able to approach their greatness is a true testament to his artistry. Rarely has a foreigner had such a clear vision of another country or its people. The thoughts, emotions, and sensibilities at the heart of Russia and its people are given with great verisimilitude and sensitivity. This alone would make the novel worthwhile, especially to the many interested in the subject. Like all Conrad novels to this point, Under was a European commercial failure, but the Preface notes with great satisfaction that it did very well in Russia, which says much about its believability and empathy.The most remarkable thing about the book in this and other regards is complete lack of didacticism. Conrad shows the characters and what they stand for on their own terms sans comment, never even coming close to preachiness or any other authorial intrusion. He simply dramatizes sociopolitical concerns and lets us decide, remaining admirably neutral. This is extremely rare in any sociopolitical work, and the story is better for it; those turned off by didacticism have nothing to fear. However, it is all the more remarkable in that Conrad had every reason to lambaste Russia; a Pole born in the Ukraine, his family suffered under Russian imperialism, crushing his parents and forcing him to leave his native land at seventeen never to return. As one might expect, the struggle to remain dispassionate was agonizing; he had a nervous breakdown lasting several weeks during which, in his wife's words, he lived the scenes and spoke to the characters, apparently in Polish. That none of this shows is truly incredible - an amazing feat of artistry rarely seen or even attempted.Separate from, and perhaps over and above, all this is the deft characterization that will be one of the main features for many. This is not one of Conrad's acknowledged strengths, but Under proves him on par with the best in this important area. There is a notably wide variety of characters, everyone from aristocrats and generals to intellectuals and revolutionists to the poorest of the poor, and all are drawn realistically and compellingly. The most important is of course Razumov, who forms one of Conrad's - and thus one of literature's - most intriguing character studies. He is in some ways the era's representative young Russian; well-educated and intelligent with a social status neither high nor low, he is clear-eyed enough to see the problems around him, but inherited loyalty and self-interest check his liberal impulses. This again recalls characters in the Russian greats' work, as do his more universal qualities. He is in many ways thoroughly dislikable, even despicable - vain, selfish, and indecisive with occasional malice. However, in a true sign of his artistic skill, Conrad somehow manages to make us care about him, even if he is not quite sympathetic. He may be more sinned against than sinning, but more to the point, he is like many intelligent youths throughout history - full of potential but unsure what to do and thus pitiably easy prey. His lack of resolve and true convictions may offend strict moralists, but he is distinctly human; his faults if anything make him more relatable. Some have criticized Conrad for not condemning him, but this misses the point - an essentially ordinary person, he could be almost anyone. Only the very few who have been in comparable situations can say how they would act in his place. Even more essentially, though, Razumov symbolizes many conflicts that numerous youths in politically turbulent eras have experienced: personal vs. public morality, idealism vs. practicality, politics vs. morality, patriotism vs. conscience, etc. His confessions also bring up many important debatable issues. Whatever we think of them generally, the acts have a certain courage that even the revolutionaries cannot deny. These and other aspects make Razumov one of Conrad's most fully realized and important characters.As all this suggests, different as the book is from most Conrad, it carries on his tragic vision. A dark fatalistic streak is particularly notable; Razumov shows how people can be pulled into extremely precarious situations against their will, and they seem unable to escape. Conrad shows little hope of meliorism here or in the larger political sense. Like The Secret, despite being published only shortly into the twentieth century, Under in many ways anticipated much of its darkness. It depicts humanity on despair's verge with little or no reason for optimism; the time and place may be distinct, but these and other factors are sadly universal.Great as the novel is generally, a few minor problems ensure it is below Conrad's best. The primary one is the narrator and the unusual narrative style to which he leads. Many will like this last because of aforementioned strengths and because it is yet another Conrad innovation, but the character himself is somewhat awkward. Conrad's Preface makes a good case for why he had to exist, and he may well be right, but Conrad himself often seems unsure how to use him. His presence is supposed to lend the verisimilitude that can only come from direct observation, but the narrative plan - having him write in the first-person but mostly from Razumov's perspective because he has read his diary - is quite a stretch. Conrad does an ingenious job of eventually explaining how he knows all he tells, but the apparent initial impossibility can be distracting, and his intrusions are particularly so. The author also attempts to explain the latter - in fact quite cleverly -, but the whole premise often seems contrived. Excerpts from Razumov's journal mixed with the narrator's recollections may have worked better. However, the narrator frequently seems out of place even when present, having little or nothing to do with the scene; it is almost as if Conrad forgot he was there or was simply unable to come up with a reason despite thinking him necessary. The ending - not the climax - is also somewhat weak, especially compared to Conrad's usual high standard, coming somewhat arbitrarily and failing to satisfy.Thankfully, though, these are minor limitations and detract little from what is an excellent novel overall. Indeed, it is one of Conrad's most widely appealing works. It comes highly recommended for nearly everyone who likes any type of classic literature."},{"Title":"Under Western Eyes (Malay edition)","review":"If you are familiar enough with Conrad's writing you will know he has a few favorite words - like \\"inscrutable\\" and \\"destiny\\". They reflect I believe Conrad's literary outlook. He likes to take characters, give them a haunted past with some shameful secret, emphasize a fatal weakness, introduce some culminating stimulae, and watch the tragic unfold. I think he could have written a brilliant biography of Richard Nixon. But to the point...\\"Under Western Eyes\\" is a quintessentially Conradian book. But unlike many of his other novels - Lord Jim, Nostromo, Victory - \\"Under Western Eyes\\" treats of period politics (namely the revolutionary movement on the rise in Europe) as he weaves his tale of betrayal and tragedy. There are no heroes in this book (save perhaps one) but only a motley collection of victims, fools, and eccentrics. There is not much action, despite its subject matter. I don't want to give away too much. The story unfolds in Moscow and Geneva, not around political machinations but around the tragedy of the central character, a young Russian thrown into the revolutionary movement entirely against his will. In this sense, I think it would be a good companion reading to Henry James' \\"Princess Cassamassima\\", which also revolves around a certain misunderstanding and like \\"Under Western Eyes\\" unfolds its story at the crossroads of the personal and political. The saga of the young man's anger, self-loathing, and attempts to extricate himself from his \\"situation\\" form one salient plot of \\"Under Western Eyes.\\" The ultimate solution to his unsought conundrum also serves to redeem him in his own eyes, if not those of others.\\"Under Western Eyes\\" is also an attempt by Conrad to explore the peculiarities of the \\"Russian character\\". This is another line of development in the work. I put this in partentheses because such notions of racial character are naturally not so well received now as in Conrad's day. Whether you agree or not, Conrad (who himself was Polish) offers some interesting personal insights into the nature of the \\"inscrutable\\" Russian soul - its ability to persevere, its mysticism, its ultimate radicalism. Such issues were particular relevent to the time the book was written (1908), as Russia was then already breaking out in revolutionary violence. The story's narrator - a retired English bachelor - are the \\"Western eyes\\" under which Russia is regarded.I might label \\"Under Western Eyes\\" a comic-tragedy, in that the primary factor behind the story's tragic chain of events is a misunderstanding. It is ultimately for the book's central character a journey of personal redemption. Within the context of this, however, Conrad details some of his views on Russia, its people, and the nature of the revolutionary movement. I did not find it as engaging as some of Conrad's other works but anyone interested in the Russian revolutionary movement, or radical politics of the period in general, or with a bent for stories of betrayal, tragedy, and love should take a look."},{"Title":"Under Western Eyes (Malay edition)","review":"Having just finished reading Under Western Eyes, I would like to say that I found it to be one of Conrad's best books. It is beautifully written, not too difficult to read (unlike some of his other works) and raises thought-provoking ideas about revolution and personal integrity. Conrad is one of the greatest English language writers ever and this book is very much worth reading."},{"Title":"Under Western Eyes (Malay edition)","review":"Joseph Conrad's Under Western Eyes should be of interest to those with a particular interest in Russia, especially the period of the late 19th century. Others may find the book boring, given that it is largely devoted to dialogue rather than action and trite in that the main conflict is the inner struggle of a man with his conscience. The title refers to the fact that the story is told by an English professor of literature who comes across a diary written by the book's protagonist. The reason Conrad gives for this manner of telling the story is that, in his view, Western readers cannot comprehend the circumstances of life in imperial Russia and can only view them through the eyes of a fellow Westerner. On pages 106 and 107 he has the professor say, \\"for this is a Russian story for Western ears (sic), which, as I have already observed, are not attuned to certain tones of cynicism and cruelty, of moral negation, and even of moral distress already silenced at our end of Europe.\\" I find this statement to be incredibly ethnocentric, and as events later proved, entirely wrong. He adds that Western European countries have already had their revolutions and thus are no longer able to fully understand czarist Russia. We can certainly argue with this viewpoint and in my view this literary device does more to get in the way of the story than to help explain it.In any case, the book begins with the professor saying that he has come across a manuscript written by a Russian student at St. Petersburg University, Kirylo Sidorovitch Razumov. Razumov is impoverished and without family and sees his only chance for success in life as coming from academic success. Accordingly he largely avoids the other students and is intent on his studies. As he is in his room one evening another student, Victor Haldin, comes to see him proclaiming that he has just assassinated a prominent political figure and asks Razumov to help him to escape. Razumov, having no sympathy for Haldin's cause, is reluctant to get involved but finally agrees to go to the lodgings of a sledge driver who has agreed to drive Haldin away to safety. But when he finds the man he is drunk and Razumov cannot arouse him. After beating him in disgust he begins to walk back to his room, pondering what to do next. Fearful that if Haldin stays with him too long he will be implicated as well, Razumov decides to give him up to the authorities. Haldin is then captured and executed.Razumov is still under suspicion and finally receives a summons to go to the office of Councillor Milukin, who, as it turns out, is the head of the bureau in charge of revolutionary investigations. After what appears to Razamov to be a kind of cat-and-mouse game he is given permission to leave. As he puts his hand on the doorknob Milukin asks him where is going to go.At this point part one of the book ends and the scene shifts to Geneva in part two. Here we meet the mother and sister of Haldin. They see him as the hope for their future lives and are devastated when they learn of Haldin's death. The mother goes into a state of shock and stays in her room staring out the window, while the daughter, Nathalie, an idealistic, but nave, young woman, tries to make the best of the situation. Other revolutionaries appear on the scene most notably Peter Ivanovitch, the leader of the group, Madame de S___, whose money is apparently financing their operations and Sophia Antonova, a long time revolutionary.The Haldin women receive a letter stating that a \\"friend\\" of Haldin is coming to Geneva and Nathalie begins to believe that this person will help them. The friend, of course, is Razumov, who has apparently reached an agreement with the government agents to spy on the revolutionaries. Razumov arrives and is accepted as a fellow revolutionary and friend of Haldin. He undergoes a difficult inner struggle trying to maintain this pretense, particularly in the light of the goodness and trust Nathalie shows him. The story then progresses as a struggle by Razumov with his conscience, whether to report on the revolutionaries or to reveal the truth about himself.The book bears some resemblance to Crime and Punishment with its psychological overtones and dialogues about good and evil, right and wrong. Much of parts two and three are devoted to conversations and it is only in the last part that there is dramatic action. I rate it as three stars because it is not as good as the best of Conrad (Lord Jim), nor is it on a level with the really good fiction of Russian writers. I could rate it at 3 and a half or even 4 as well. It can be interesting reading and thought provoking and does end in dramatic fashion."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"It's 1803, and the Scarlet Pimpernel and the Purple Gentian have wowed Europe with their daring exploits. Amy Balcourt is a twenty-year-old, adventurous English girl who, in joining the League of the Purple Gentian, wishes to become a spy herself. She, along with her cousin Jane and their escort Miss Gwen, go to France, where they meet Lord Richard Selwick, also known as the Purple Gentian. A case of confused identities ensues in a bad parody of good spy fiction.The Secret History of the Pink Carnation is, first and foremost, chick lit, with historical accuracy taking a backseat. For someone who was supposed to be so smart, Amy behaved like a twit sometimes--for example, thinking that another character (a well-known rake) is the Purple Gentian, she makes an assignation with him in a dark, secluded space. I thought it was also rather ridiculous that she really didn't know who the Purple Gentian was until the last minute. The prose of this book is also laughable: when talking about her \\"feelings\\" for the Purple Gentian (who she's only met twice at the time this passage occurs, and both times when his face was covered), Amy thinks: \\"Oh, but she had been so sure of her feelings for the Gentian! And of his for her. His promise of a necklace of stars had seemed to be a sort of divine seal of approval, marking him out as her official, one and only true love.\\" (yes, sadly I actually made it page 293). Please. Like anyone could be so naive. I only continued reading to find out if Amy would learn from her mistakes. She never did.The spies don't seem to sneak around all that much; at one point Lord Richard emerges from the front door of his house in his disguise. He also seems to spend an inordinate amount of time staring at Amy's behind; in one part, the book literally becomes a bodice-ripper, heavy panting and bad sexual innuendoes included. The politics of the period, and the court of Napoleon, seem like a trip to Disney World. The characters all have modern day behavior and speech patterns. For example, at that time a man would never call a woman by her first name if she wasn't related to him.With regards to Eloise, the graduate student who writes her thesis on the Pink Carnation, I found it hard to believe that she couldn't figure out who the Pink Carnation was sooner. For an Ivy Leage grad student, she was incredibly dumb. Her \\"thesis\\" idea seemed like something a reader of bad romance novels and watcher of The Bachelor would put together. Also, how can a grad student afford Manolo Blahniks and Marc Jacobs? Oh yes, that's right--her parents probably foot the bill--Eloise went to Chapin, a private girls' school in New York City. Eloise's story seemed like a rude, unwelcome interruption into the main narrative."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I wanted to love this book. I loved the idea of a combination of chick lit and a Regency-set historical. I loved the cover and the blurb on the back. But overall I felt disappointed. Mainly because the historical characters seemed to act and sound just like the modern ones. There were some interesting plot details that didn't quite work for me either-Note potential spoiler!(I just can't see Napoleon conveniently leaving his study unguarded, can you?)The writing was nice and I loved the modern characters-they were all really well written. But I don't think I'll buy the next one.sorry"},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It was humorous and cute. This book follows Amy, a wannabe spy adventurer, who tries to join The Purple Gentian's spy network against France shortly after the French Revolution. Of course nothing goes smoothly for the slightly dizzy heroine. The author combines historical fiction with fun chick lit, mostly focusing on Amy's romance with the Purple Gentian. I like both types of work so I enjoyed the combination.I read some reviews of this book on Amazon and found people either really liked it or absolutely hated it. Some comments I thought went way overboard included, \\"Jane Austen would scream, you'd have to be braindead to like this, when I think of this book I throw up a little in my mouth, and my favorite, \\"chick lit reflects poorly on women's literature, why isn't poorly written books written by men called dude's lit.\\" Of course I had to reply back to some of these reviews with my own comments... like lighten up.When I think about books, there are two main categories I divide them up in: deep, soulful books usually filled with symbolism and themes and then there's escapism books. Now I am not going to lie, when it comes to the first category I don't always \\"get\\" the message of the book. I am disappointed after I read 400 pages of fancy, convoluted sentences that I can't relate to. But a lot of that is a reflection on me as a reader, not necessaily a reflection on the author. I tend to like stories focused on great characters, interesting plots, and unusual places or time periods, like \\"The History of the Pink Carnation\\".Pink Carnation is meant to be a light, fun book. If you don't expect Jane Austen or a historical book full of facts and dates, then I don't think you'll be disappointed. The book isn't perfect, even I noticed a few things that didn't make sense, i.e. when the true identity of the Purple Gentian is discovered and his family helps him escape, don't they all need to get the heck out of France. Also, I think it would have been funnier if the chaperone with the parasol could be the Pink Carnation"},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I love historical fiction and mystery novels so this is right up my alley. At first I felt the ending left me wanting and then I realized I was only in book 1 and had 6 more to go!

This book will make you laugh and think."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"After reading just a little of this book you can stop turning pages because it's obvious what's going to happen next. Boring and predictable; I've read this book before, written much better, but never worse. Nothing new or original here. I've run into these stock characters many times before and that was more than enough. For me this was a waste of time. Has the obligatory sex scenes: yuck. Secret History of the Pink Carnation should not be allowed in same room with books by Austen or Heyer."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I have read this whole series and thoroughly enjoyed it. It is a fun fast read with laugh-out-loud moments. It is a whimsical story and pure fun."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I love this book! It's exciting and entertaining. A wonderful read.A definite book to get off you like historical romance with modern twist."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"Anything that even hints at \\"chic-lit,\\" romance novels, or time-travelers sets off my book-avoidance instincts. But Willig's novels can amuse and entertain the most die-hard die-hard types. Combine some scholarly detective work by an amusingly human female Harvard historian, some 18th Century Scarlet Pimpernel fashion royal British versus revolutionary French duels of espionage - counter-espionage, and a deft writer's talent for dialogue, setting, and drama. Willig's series provide a splendid read for guys and gals alike. Poke the fire and pass the port."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I already owned this book and decided to give it to my 16 year old niece for Christmas. I haven't heard her review of it yet, but I found the writing intelligent, and the plot was fun."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I'm rather fond of the book within a book method of story telling. And it does come up in my reading more often than you'd expect. From William Goldman's retelling of The Princess Bride, to The Winter Sea by Susanna Kearsley, to The Thirteenth Tale by Diane Setterfeild (all also wonderful books) it seems that in certain cases this is the most suitable way to make a story seem immediate and relevant. In this case, Eloise is a graduate student who is interested in discovering the identity of the Pink Carnation, an English spy who helped to thwart Napoleon. She starts by researching the Carnation's predecessor, the Purple Gentian. She hits mostly dead ends until one of the Purple Gentian's descendents responds to her letter and invites her to read some of the family's papers. This opens up to the historical portion of the story, which follows Richard Selwick (The Purple Gentian) and his companions in Paris as they try to prevent the French invasion of England. The love interest in the book is Amy, and she has a girlish fascination with the Purple Gentian, having read much about him.Anyone who has ever seen a super hero movie can guess where the romantic plot thread goes. Amy is fixated on the Purple Gentian, and pays no attention the Richard. She doesn't see that they are one in the same despite the wealth of evidence before her. Amy isn't just infatuated with the Purple Gentian, however: she wants to help him. She's always dreamed of being a spy, and she has a wealth of ideas to help her achieve that goal.I have ample praise for this book. The characters, both past and present, are distinct and vivid. I was able to relate to Eloise and her slightly nerdy obsession with historical spies. I think she really helped to draw me in to the story of Richard and Amy. Richard is painted as dashing and heroic. That might sound bland, but in this story it works well, and Willig gives him enough flaws to keep him from seeming to perfect. Amy is youthful and spirited. To be honest, she is the character I liked the least, but I'll address that shortly. There are plenty of women of intelligence and strong character--Amy's cousin Jane, Miss Gwen the chaperone, and Richard's mother and sister. The historical plot was extremely engaging. The style of the writing is witty, light, and fun.As implied above, Amy was one of my complaints. I didn't hate her, most of the time I liked her. But she has several too-stupid-to-live moments, and they really damaged my opinion of her. A lot of this can be contributed to youth and inexperience, but some of it is just plain idiocy. She severely overestimates her own competence, and it puts everyone involved in danger. In other words, she's a walking, talking plot contrivance.My second minor complaint is the pace. It slows to a crawl in places when it ought to be zipping forward. Obviously the author slows down for the romantic bits, and that's fine. But there are other times when a slow pace is used where one doesn't belong--like when a character is in need of rescue and everyone stops to talk about it over tea. I think this was supposed to be humorous, but it just made me impatient.All told, this is a unique and very enjoyable historical novel. It's much lighter and more fun than it appears. 4 stars.(Originally Reviewed for Reading to Penguins)"},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I thought based on the author's credentials I would at least be somewhat impressed with her books.

The book that I read, and fell in love with, was the second book. So recently I procured this book and I felt like I knew what cards the characters possessed (having read the second book first, I knew the 'big picture'), without feeling like I ruined the experience of reading this one. I can now enjoy rereading the second book even more so (from having read this book) AND continue by reading books three-nine (and however more Lauren Willig decides to write in this series). Lauren Willig has me definitely leaving YA behind (though not altogether gone, of course) in exchange for adult fiction of romance, mystery and thrillers."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I am a fan of fluffy Regency fiction, and have recently discovered the \\"history mystery\\" genre. After racing through all of Tasha Alexander's books, devouring Ariana Franklin, starting Elizabeth Peters and in need of something light and fun, Amazon's recommendations pointed me at Lauren Willig. I am so glad it did! I feel as though I have made new friends in The Pink Carnation. And to think that the Pink Carnation is actually . . . . HA, not going to let that secret out! You must read the book.With scenes in Regency England and Napoleonic Paris, we are introduced to some of histories interesting characters, like Napoleon himself as well as his charming wife Josephine, and many of his dubious hangers-on. We also meet The Purple Gentian and even The Scarlet Pimpernel, two of the Crown's best spies. In a delightful romp through the intricacies of spying on Napoleon while maintaining a cover as an Englishperson just looking for fun in Paris, we meet the Selwicks and their friends.Looking for historically accurate, edge of your seat drama? Look elsewhere. This is a great start to a \\"lounging in the bath with a box of chocolates\\" series. Spoil yourself. Try it!"},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"There are times when life requires something more than a 500-page novel on Thomas Cromwell or a considered meditation on the horrors of the Civil War; these are the times when something more means something less. Pink Carnation is that book - so light you can almost feel it float out of your hands, so taken with its own sense of fun and adventure that you find yourself wondering if it actually counts as reading. I think of these books as \\"Metro books\\" - you can read them with all sorts of delays - scratchy train-operator announcements, babies crying, people shoving and pushing to fit in during rush hour - and still keep the thread of the plot.Pink Carnation revels in comedy and the upending of swashbuckling traditions while telling a sweet - if contrived - love story. Napoleon's court is sketched in the barest of outlines, as a mere background to character interactions. In reality, this story of spying and mistaken identity could occur in almost any time or place and lose only loving descriptions of bouncing carriages and voluminous skirts.Lauren Willig says she began writing Pink Carnation because she loved the old stories of the Scarlet Pimpernel and the Three Musketeers. Knowing this, I started the book hoping for a bit more adventure and plotting. I'm willing to go along with a romantic plot line but I need it to be filled out a bit more than your typical romance novel. After all, you're setting your story in Napoleon's court - the opportunities for night time chases, coded messages and double crosses are endless!That said, I appreciated being able to open this book and lose myself in a fun story for a few minutes. I would recommend Pink Carnation to anyone who is looking for an escapist read. However, I'm not sure I'll continue with the rest of the books in the series - I need a little bit more spy craft and a little less romance to remain intrigued.Email This BlogThis!

So, when my boyfriend bought me this book I was more than a little bit weary--but I decided to read a few chapters as to not hurt his feelings.I never put it down.... First of all this book tells two stories: the first is set in modern day London and narrated by a twenty-something named Eloise who is in London doing research on aristocratic spies during the Napoleonic wars for her dissertation. The second follows a Miss Amy Balcourt who is returning to her native France to act as hostess for her brother.Both storys are compelling, light, and fun. All of the female characters in the novel are women that can be identified with- Eloise and Amy are both intelligent and adventurous in a way that reminds me of Pride and Prejudice's Elizabeth Bennet. Additionally, the men are just as lively and witty and are not Fabio-esque knights in shining armor. In Fact, the characters and plot give off a Jane Austen-ish vibe, but it does not seem contrived at all.The romance between Amy and the Purple Gentian is not over the top or sappy, but humorous and a discreet element of the story. What separates \\"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation\\" from other romantically themed novels is that the scenes of a sexual nature are tastefully written (not prudish, but not porn either) and do not rule the entire book- a nice change!Also, historical accuracy is a non-issue here. The novel sticks with the facts when it counts the most and doesn't claim to be anything other than pure light hearted fiction.I have just bought the rest of the series and I don't know what I am more excited about- the drama between Eloise and Colin or more regency era espionage!GET THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"Ok, I am a big fan of history tomes, historical fiction, historical romances ~~ anything that smacks of history, I want to read it. I cannot remember exactly how that love got started, but it's there and it's a vital part of what I read. This book ~~ while flawed ~~ is fun, dashing and quirky. I am not sure if it is historically accurate since I am not familiar with that time period ~~ but it definitely got me interested now and it will propel me into that direction.Another thing that I love is two stories in one book. There is Eloise, a Harvard graduate student in London to complete her thesis on the two famous spies that saved England from France. She wanted to find out more about the elusive Pink Carnation and only one family has the information ~~ the descendents of the Purple Gentian, who did rescue England from the clutches of Bonaparte. Eloise finds the manuscripts and buries herself into the story of Amy Balacourt, a transplant from the French Revolution ~~ who lost her father and mother within a year. Amy desires nothing more than to avenge her father's death (who was beheaded ~~ her mom died of heartbreak).Amy gets a chance to visit her brother who somehow survived. She brings along her cousin Jane and their chaperone, Miss Gwen, a formidable woman. The three of them were thrown together with Richard Selliwick, whom they thought was a traitor to their country because he is the director of Antiquities under Napoleon's employ. Amy wanted to join the Purple Gentian's league and save England.It is a mixture of romance, intrigue with historical facts thrown in. It's cute. It's funny in spots. It's romantic. But the world's greatest book, it is not. One reason, the author tends to leave certain thoughts trailing off without coming to a reasonable conclusion. Secondly, there are parts of the book where it felt rushed and under-written. Thirdly, what started out to be an intrigue turned into a steaming ripping of the bodice romance ~~ which was not what I expected. It's almost if she's trying too hard to please too many types of readers at once.It is a fun book. It is definitely one that I would share with friends simply because it's cute. It's perfect for those last days on the beach or on the long plane ride during the upcoming holiday season. If you are expecting a historical tome, this book is not for you. If you just want to read something fun and quirky with a little bit of dash thrown in, this one is for you.9-2-07"},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"Well I guess someone must be reading this author's series for her editor to publish two more.Actually I found it rather silly. This was the kind of thing that MAY have appealed to me when I was a young teen but now-nope. I read it because I wanted to read something light-it is that-very light weight.It is most definitely a romance novel with all the usual cliches. I wouldn't read it necessarily for the humor-I know I didn't find it all that amusing. On the level of lightweight romantic novel,I guess, it is alright."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"The price, printing format and elegant oil painting on the cover of this book gave me the idea it might be more intellectual than my usual historical romance fare. To my surprise, it is exactly the same as every other romance novel I've ever read.Nothing happens in the story that I haven't read dozens of times before in other regency romances. I had to laugh out loud when I read this in the discussion guide (yes, there's a discussion guide): \\"The book contains elements of chick lit, mystery, comedy, adventure stories, and historical romance. Discuss how the story uses and subverts these various traditions. How would you classify the book, and why?\\" Willig doesn't \\"subvert\\" anything, unless by subvert you mean copying out of other books.The majority of the story takes place in the years following the French revolution. However, its claim to distinction is the modern frame story - a budding romance between an American grad student of history, and the young English lord holding the letters and diaries that tell the main story. However, this romance remains unresolved... TO BE CONTINUED in the next book.Don't get me wrong; I love the comforting conventions of historical romance. I enjoyed this book and even plan to by the next one, but be aware: you'll get the same quality in hundreds of less expensive novels in the romance section of the bookstore."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"On the plus side, its entertaining simply by virtue of being so far off the beaten path, and the author has a certain charm and sense of humor that is pleasant and refreshing. She writes in a very natural style that is almost conversational and sounds like someone you'd enjoy knowing. Reading her book, however, is another matter.I have to say that, at times, I was embarrased to find myself reading this. For example, take the issue of the \\"secret\\" agent. The secret identity is known by the agent's mother, father, sister, butler, and two or three close friends. Given the frivolous nature of most of the above, it's a miracle he's still alive. Then there is the issue of how easy spying is for these people: the heroine just happens to overhear significant private conversations between Napoleon and his family; drops into Napoleon's private quarters unobserved and manages to find the secret plans to invade England right there on top of his desk. Rescues are a piece of cake, you just concoct an impromptu plan and execute it in a couple of hours. It is amazing how brilliant the English are and how bungling the French are. One wonders how they almost managed to conquer most of Western civilization in just a few years. As noted by other reviewers neither the heroine nor several other minor characters \\"fit\\" into the time period they've been assigned to function in. They are closer to 20th-21st Century characters who have traveled back in time and their manners, behavior, speech patterns, and sense of social order give them away. Then there is the heroine: we are told (repeatedly) that she is a real charmer. So, why do I find her so spoiled, silly, shallow, and self-absorbed?"},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"so if your looking for some serious historical piece don't grab this book. but if your looking for a light fun read take a chance! i really enjoyed reading this book, i love chick lit, what can i say. i know some of the reviewers quite detested the fact that it wasn't as history driven as they would have liked and wasn't some academic work of literature; but i for one like reading something that takes my mind off all the seriousness of my already too serious life. it's a unique chick lit- it throws you back in time, and has espionage, romance, and a good sense of humor. it's a great book and i can't wait to get my hands on the sequels!"},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"At the beginning of THE SECRET HISTORY OF THE PINK CARNATION, Eloise Kelly is in London for two reasons: to forget about the ex-boyfriend she left behind at Harvard, and to continue work on her dissertation, which centers on espionage in 18th-century Napoleonic France. Eloise has spent years researching the Scarlet Pimpernel and the Purple Gentian, two of the major players in the world of Regency spying, but in her research, she's come across another, lesser-known spy whose identity still hasn't been revealed after 200 years: the elusive Pink Carnation. In some kind of graduate student's dream come true, one of the Purple Gentian's descendants offers Eloise the opportunity to look through her private papers, assuring Eloise that therein lies the secret to the Pink Carnation's identity.As Eloise pours over the 200-year-old documents, another story slowly comes to light: the story of Amy Balancourt, who was 20 years old in 1803. Forced to flee to England with her mother, Amy longs for the day she can return to France. She daydreams about joining the League of the Purple Gentian, becoming a dashing secret spy like the flower-monikered ones she so envies. Her opportunity arises when her brother, Edouard, writes to her, beseeching her to return to the family home in Paris. Amy eagerly sets off, anxious to find the Purple Gentian and begin her career in espionage, accompanied by her beautiful cousin Jane and a formidable chaperone named Miss Gwen. Once she arrives in France, however, Amy finds herself swept up in a love triangle rather than in secret rendezvous and clandestine dealings. When she locates the Purple Gentian, they are too busy lusting after one another to focus on espionage of any kind. And then there's that pesky Lord Richard Selwick, who both infuriates Amy and excites her in equal measure...Lauren Willig's debut novel is a book that tries to be a lot of things: historical fiction, chick lit, a Regency romance. In this, the first in a new series of books, Willig--a grad student herself--has introduced an interesting, eclectic, and thoroughly engaging group of characters. Her prose, while not anything particularly special, is quite witty in places, and her story is effectively paced. I liked this novel, actually; aside from the fact that it was really REALLY predictable, I thought CARNATION was entertaining and light-hearted, and it didn't take itself too seriously, which was refreshing. However, there are some glaring flaws in the text that I feel obliged to address.The first and most obvious problem with the text is Amy's complete disregard for modesty. She appears totally oblivious to the societal norms of the era in which she lives, galavanting off with masked men at midnight, engaging in activity unbecoming of a lady--and with a man she only knows as the Purple Gentian, whose face she thinks she has never seen. She is Lydia Bennet incarnate--only, admittedly, quite a bit more likable than Lydia. Amy is 20 years old in CARNATION--and for the time period, that was definitely old enough to understand the importance of a woman's reputation in making a beneficial marriage. Because of this, although she is an endearing character, she just doesn't ring true.Another problem with CARNATION is that it lacks atmosphere. The dialogue is decidedly modern; Amy and her friends in the 19th century speak just the way Eloise does in the 21st century. Willig doesn't effectively contrast Amy's and Eloise's worlds; with the mindest of the 19th-century characters and their thoroughly modern dialogue, the whole story might as well have taken place in current day. But at the same time, Willig doesn't effectively integrate Amy's story with Eloise's, either. While I was reading, I almost felt like Eloise's chapters (which are interspersed throughout the novel) were serving no other purpose than to interrupt the flow of Amy's story.And, lastly, who makes their characters actually say things like \\"Argh\\" and \\"Urgh\\" and \\"Umph\\" and \\"Oof\\"? Lauren Willig, that's who! Apparently, Willig found it entertaining to make her characters vocalize in this manner, and to include sound effects in her prose like \\"whump\\" and \\"whack\\" and \\"thwack\\"...but I just thought it showed her inexperience.So I can understand why many people here disliked CARNATION. But I'm not one of them. Despite the glaring flaws in the text, I still found redeeming qualities: The novel is pleasantly paced and the prose is witty; the characters are likable (if unbelievable); and the story is engaging and unique. Call it historical chick lit, call it a Regency romance; I'm just going to call it a fun book to escape with for a while."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"Literally. The heroine, Amy, mutters to herself repeatedly, in the presence of others as well as alone. She also has a highly annoying and modern habit of repeating the same words or phrase over and over again. Several other too-modern catch phrases peppered their way into the Regency period, causing Jane Austen to scream in horror in such affront to her world.The author, in addition to these quirks she gives her historic heroine, has not bothered to do her etiquette research into 1803 England and France. Gentlemen do not sit in the presence of ladies, exasperated or not, nor do proper young ladies pace the deck of a ship, in her nightgown, at midnight, alone with a strange man, and proceed, unintentionally or not, to show off her ankles and legs.The blood-curling scream you now hear is that of Miss Austen.The 'present' story is sparse and not interesting at all; the transition between past and present jars, and makes it seem as if they were two separate stories the author decided to mush together.Not recommended."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"Eloise is an intrepid American who is trying to uncover the identity of the Pink Carnation, a notorious spy who operated throughout the Napoleonic Wars. She's planning her dissertation on the elusive Pink Carnation and the secrets lie within the Selwick family archives. Nothing is going to stand in her way, least of all the current guard dog of the family secrets. Standing bastion against nosy Americans who have a deadline to meet, Mr. Colin Selwick is not pleased when the matriarch of his family allows Eloise to read all their family's historical letters and journals but there's nothing he can do except glare and growl. Within those letters a fabulous world of dashing heroes and brave young heroines comes to life and Eloise comes one step closer to uncovering the identity of the Pink Carnation, as well as finding a hero of her own.I'm reviewing this book well after I read it the first time. If I had reviewed it when I read it the first time, I probably would have gushed about it much more than I'm going to now. That's not to say that this book is bad, it just suffers after that first magical read.This books suffers from an identity crisis. Is it trying to be an authentic historical romance or simple chick lite? Is it Young Adult or a romance novel with enough steam to unwrinkle your shirt when you finish reading? Who knows. I know I enjoyed the book but now that I've had time to step back I feel like this is just the first knot in a loooong string that has no discernible end in sight.Lauren Willig has created some wonderful and quirky characters in Amy, Jane and Richard. Jane is the stalwart, unflinching maiden that I could easily imagine starring in a medieval romance, or off battling dragons and Richard is a devil-may-care, laughing fool of a spy. Amy is cute at times, crossing over into childish on several occasions, but her naivety and earnestness makes her somewhat bearable. By far my favorite character is Jane. She's rock solid and a fabulously intriguing young lady. She's as straightforward as Amy is flighty but they were a nice combination.I didn't believe (or is it understand?) Amy and Richard's great romance. They were complete opposites yet at the same time, cut from the same cloth. They were the type I could see laughing their way into the poor house, never letting the good times end. There was also a ridiculously overblown character in Amy's brother, Edouard, who I thought charming despite his feminine flutters.While this book was amusing, it at times delved into weird territory. One moment I'm thinking this is YA, especially with Amy's naivety and the next she and Richard are rolling around with enough foreplay going on to make me think perhaps this book had been written by two different authors. The ending was also extremely far fetched. So far fetched that it took far fetchedness to a whole new level. It became a silly, over the top adventure that again, didn't meet the historical accuracy that Lauren Willig seemed to be striving for.Eloise's musing throughout the book chopped the book up too much. Even though this is her story, she intrudes upon the flow of the book and I wished Lauren Willig would have left anything she had to say until the end of the book. Eloise and Colin will start the beginnings of a romance later on, but here is where the sparks first fly. It's cute and certainly interesting but now that I've had time to step back a little, I can see that here's the hook that Lauren Willig is using and suddenly their relationship became tiring.But before I became a jaded romance reader, I gotta admit, this was a fun, simply sweet romance with some wonderful quirky characters. Later books will only get better and the history and sweeping locations that Lauren Willig used was a delight to read and immerse myself in. I highly recommend The Secret History of the Pink Carnation as a fun, interesting read. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I was bitterly disappointed in this book. Given the quality hard cover, the lovely cover art and the blurb, I was expecting something that strives to be Heyer or Austen. I would have been happy with something that fell along the lines of Tasha Alexander or Deanna Raybourne. Heck, I would counted myself lucky if the book had been vaguely reminiscent of Mary Balogh or Julia Quinn. Instead I got something that fell short of all of those.Instead of sparkling wit of Heyer and the mannered prose of Austen, I got a by the numbers, derivative, cliche historical romance novel that (weirdly) also wanted to be modern chick lit and a spy adventure as well.The heroine Amy is a firm and permanent resident of the too stupid to live club. Seriously. This girl did one dumb thing after the other. And had to be repeatedly rescued. And for a woman who was looking for a spy whose life depended on things like secrets and discretion, she was terribly indiscreet.But Amy is not the only dull knife in the drawer. For a super spy who has eluded capture for years, Richard is also remarkably inept. First he has pretty much told his entire family his secret identity. Isn't that like rule number 1 in the spy handbook? You don't tell anyone your identity especially not your mother and your younger sister. And then there are the scenes where he and Amy are so overcome with lust for each other that they can't resist making out. Only problem is, they are usually in public and in one case in a precarious situation where they could be discovered by the secret police any moment.There was also a very modern feel to the language that struck me as out of place. While not overtly anachronistic in word usage, the tone was just off. I got the impression that author was doing this on purpose and trying to let us in on the joke. But imo, it failed miserably.Also, I could pretty much predict how the H/h were going to act and react to each other. Not one character did anything surprising or unpredictable.Actually, I retract that last statement a bit. This book was not a total waste. Jane, the heroine's cousin was actually an excellent character. She had all the brains, wit and composure the heroine should have had. Had Jane been the heroine of this novel and been allowed to retain her character this would have been a much different story.And I do have to admit the book was funny in some places. The last scene where Richard's family shows up and wants to meet Amy was a entertaining.But even with those one or two positive things, the book overall was still a huge disappointment for me."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"Okay, so the language is not appropriate for the Regency period. But I'm sorry, sometimes it's nice to find a historical novel that isn't language-accurate! Better than those historical novels that try to be and fail miserably, in my humble opinion.Language inaccuracy aside, I was nearly as impressed with this novel as I was with the third novel in the Pink Carnation Series, The Deception of the Emerald Ring. Having read that one first (unbeknownst of it's 3rd-installment status when I picked it up), I knew who the Pink Carnation was from the start; however, that didn't stop me from being taken in by the thrilling Amy-Lord Richard-Purple Gentian romantic triangle and the question of how they were going to stop Napoleon from raiding England. I will admit, however, that it is obvious that this was Ms. Willig's first novel--her writing certainly improved between The Secret History of the Pink Carnation and The Deception of the Emerald Ring.In a world of too much shallow New York City chick lit and too many \\"please-feel-bad-for-me\\" memoirs, Ms. Willig and her Eloise and spy characters are delightfully refreshing."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"So since September, I haven't finished a novel. I've picked up a couple of books here and there but nothing has really kept me interested enough to finish one... until Secret History of The Pink Carnation.I'd been eyeing the book in paperback, the covers looking absolutely awesome. When I saw the third book, The Deception of the Emerald Ring, in a bookstore last month, I couldn't help but pick it up. Reading the inside dust jacket, I was intrigued. But I'm anal about series so I went through the store to find the first book. It sounded a lot like a romance book (although that doesn't really turn me off having loved Diana Gabaldon's great books) but the spy-in-costume stuff sounded really good! It sounded like comic books. So I bought it.And I loved it! Sure, it's not high drama. It's tongue in check sometimes and there's actually a lot of romance-book elements to it but it's still a lot of fun! The plight of Amy and Richard is an adventure of intrigue, action, and romance! The witty repartee is fun, the action is exciting, the narration is highly entertaining, and the pages fly effortlessly! This is a book that has fun with its subject, not bogged down by it! Sure liberties are taken with the time period but it's not supposed to be a dissertation on Napoleonic France! It's supposed to be a romp through a historical time with great characters and fun adventure! Suspend your disbelief every once in awhile! It's fiction for God's sake!"},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"This novel purports itself to be a historical mystery/thriller but what it really is is another predictable, one-dimensional character-filled Regency romance. It does not even work on the parody-of-Regency level. It was also painfully obvious throughout the book that this is a first novel, and I could hear the author saying, \\"See how neat? I'm writing a book!\\" The framing device of the modern-day PhD candidate does not add to the novel at all, and there is a consistent lack of tension throughout the entire book. I never worried about the characters, and therefore I never cared about them.The characters are incredibly anachronistic which might be fine for some readers but not for those of us who like our historical characters, well, historical. In fact, this book really doesn't belong in the Historical genre as it is firmly in the Romance genre and the historical setting was very secondary to the romantic plotline.That said, I did make it through the whole book, so that says something."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"&lt;u>The Secret History of the Pink Carnation&lt;/u> takes place in the same semi-fictional universe as The Scarlet Pimpernel. In the modern day, Eloise, a historian, is trying to track down the elusive English spy known only as the Pink Carnation. Allowed access to the files surrounding another flowery spy, the Purple Gentian, she sinks herself into the world of the Napoleanic era.I thought I was picking up a gritty historical fiction, a la &lt;u>The Rule of Four&lt;/u>. Instead, I got a humerous chick lit/romance/female empowerment novel. Once I realized my genre-expectation was off, I relaxed and started enjoying the lightly written novel for the fun it was meant to be.I really enjoyed all of the characters. They were unique, they had quirks, and they failed as often as they succeeded -- just like people do in real life. I found the romance believable and enchanting, although the hero not someone I would want for myself.The twist at the end -- the true identity of the Pink Carnation -- isn't really a twist if you're paying attention. But the way it came about is subtle and there are clues all along. It doesn't just come out of nowhere.I finished this book in a day. I picked up the sequel out of the library mere hours after I finished this one.

Thus it manages to be a spy tale, an historical romance, a mystery story and the beginings of a modern romance novel. That is quite a lot to put in one novel, and at times the seams strain a bit, but it all holds together.The best thing about this tale is the writing. It is bright and crisp. It is such a pleasure to read a novel that focuses on the story instead of the storytelling; I don't like being distracted from a story by literary show-offs. Still, Ms. Willig shows that she has not completely shaken off the habits of academic writing, at times the crispness of the story turns into an academic crunch when she seems to feel the need to show off a bit of reserch.I am looking forward to the next book, I hope that Ms. Willig will tell me another compelling tale simply and beautifuly."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"Along the lines of the Scarlet Pimpernel comes a novel about a female espionage, the Pink Carnation. Eloise Kelly, a \`history' major heads to England in her quest to learn more about her \`dashing' hero, the Pink Carnation. She ended up in the home of the descents of the Purple Gentian, a fellow espionage and a former spy of Sir Percy Blankley's league of the Scarlet Pimpernel. Eloise fell into the world of Amy Balcourt, Sir Richard Selwick or the Purple Gentian, Jane Wooliston and a couple of memorable characters, who were tangled up in the world of spying and trying to find clues of Napoleon's British invasion. Romance-a lot of romance-, a poor attempt of suspension and vivid adjectives composed the book. I admired the author's attempt in writing this book. I thought it was a great book, but it was written with a childish appeal. To my utmost disappointment, the plot was loose and shaky. Even the point of the Pink Carnation was loose and confusing! The title of the book stressed heavily on the Pink Carnation. But it was not until near the end of the book that the words, pink and carnation, appeared in the same sentence! Lauren Willig, threw in a lot of unnecessary remarks, which I thought was just a waste of time, ink and paper.Nonetheless, it's an enjoyable book to read. It's pleasant and light for the mind. I'm looking forward to reading her next book, in hoping, possibly, it'll be much better than her first book."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I ADORED this book! The main characters are wonderfully crafted...Amy is witty and intelligent and Richard is charming and gallant. The story kept me riveted to my seat throughout; Lauren Willig picks up where Baroness Orczy left off. Here we learn the story of the Purple Gentian/Lord Richard Selwick (the Scarlet Pimpernel's successor)--his loves, family, friends, and escapades. I would recommend this novel to anyone who simply adores historical fiction...specially those that are fans of the Scarlet Pimpernel and his gang."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Willig's skillful blend of genres. She writes beautifully notwithstanding her ivy league education and clearly has a true knowledge of her historical setting and the vicissitudes of life in modern London.

I'm looking forward to The Masque of the Black Tulip."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"There were some clever parts to this novel and some of the characters were rather humorous and entertaining but, in the end, this book was nothing more than a romance novel masquerading as historical fiction. I was HUGELY disappointed in it."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I bought this expecting a little light-hearted, historical romance fun. What I got instead was a book full of cliches, stupid jokes, stereotyped characters, and annoyingly written, stupidly orchestrated, cheesy love scenes. The entire plot was completely obvious from the beginning. I didn't even waste my time finishing it, just flipped to the back to confirm I was right. It's going back to the bookstore."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"This novel could have been so much more. It seems anyone from Harvard can get a book deal these days. The author may be a little too young to undertake such a series of books. I was lost in the unrealistic characters and the over used catch phrases like \\"brown paper packages tied up with string.\\" As soon as I would get the score of The Sound of Music out of my head she would say it again. Don't get me started on when she talked about Robin Hood wearing manly tights. Overall very disappointing. Leave this one alone."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I picked this up looking for something light to read in waiting rooms. What a mistake!

Don't waste your time."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"Picked up on a whim (saw \\"Scarlet Pimpernel\\" and couldn't resist) I found this book completely charming. The plot is somewhat loose and predictable, but the text and dialogue sparkle. I couldn't put it down!

I'm definitely looking forward to this author's second book!"},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"Where's the Secret History? Where's the plot?The prose and dialogue is adequate, but where is the story? I find myself asking WHAT I'm reading. Then I ask myself WHY I am reading. The plot in this book can be condensed to short story.Eloise can be dropped. Since there's no story with this character either, why have her? Is this supposed to copy the movie \\"Possession\\" where the researches get romantically involved? It's been done. If \`Eloise' is just a love story or the big surprise is that we find out she's related to Amy, that's too weak.Amy has the start of a vibrant character with her dialogue style, but again, it's just conversation. No action. No desire to read on is instilled in the reader.I see this is a series and will read on, but I suspect the series could have been condensed into one book. But this reflects the state of our publishers and editors who often want to put product out, quickly, continuously, rather than allowing the author the time needed to develop a plot.

The heroine is very likable and you are rooting for her the whole time."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"Anyone who enjoys a good historical mystery, or just a historical story, will enjoy this book. Obviously this isn't straight history, and the characters presented were not necessarily ever real people. Nonetheless, this book is a very fun read.Beginning in present day England, we meet Eloise, and follow her on her quest for the true identity of the Pink Carnation, the commrade of the Scarlet Pimpernel and Purple Gentian. During the French Revolution, the Pimpernel and Gentian fearlessly infiltrate the city of Paris and masterfully pluck threatened aristocrats from the deadly grasp of the guillotine. But unlike the Pimpernel and the Gentian, the Pink Carnation's true identity was never revealed, not then, nor through the passing years. Through Eloise's investigation, we are taken back to 18th century England and France, and introduced to the key players in the Carnation's rise. What follows is an engaging, light, mystery with an exciting climax.Anyone who enjoyed Baroness Orczy's Scarlet Pimpernel, will enjoy this novel. If you've never read The Scarlet Pimpernel, do so at once! It is an excellent book."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"It is a truth universally acknowledged ... that \\"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation\\" refers to \\"sense and sensibility\\" (lowercase) on p. 76, which gave me great hope for the continued good fun of this novel.

I COULD WISH THE WRITER HAD TAMED DOWN HER SEX SCENES...THE DETAILS WEREN'T REALLY NECESSARY...BUT AT LEAST HER SEX-ACTION DID PROGRESS THE STORY AND SEEMED RELEVANT TO THE PLOT. THE PINK CARNATION IS BOOK 1; THE BLACK TULIP (#2) AND THE EMERALD (#3) ARE ALSO GREAT READS. I TRULY RECOMMEND THE TRILOGY...AND HOPE-HOPE-HOPE MS WILLIG WILL FOLLOW THROUGH WITH BOOK #4!"},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I finally got a chance to read this book, recommended by a local store clerk. Unfortunately, when I got to the chapter in which Eloise finds information that might help her find out who the Pink Carnation is, it was easy from then on for the reader to know who the Carnation was indeed. It was way too predictable. The story (of all these spies) *is* interesting, it's just too bad that Willig could not come up with other possibilities to tell the reader who the spy was. In the end, there was no twist, and the ending actually left me unsatisfied. No, I won't spoil it and tell you who is the Carnation, you will find out yourself when you read it. And no, I will not read the follow up of the book, The Masque of the Black Tulip.Despite this, Willig's writing is quite enjoyable, and the book reads very easily. If you like predictable novels, you'll definitely enjoy this one."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I don't know who wrote the reviews panning this book. I thought it was GREAT! The history was NOT inappropriate, and I found myself laughing alous, especially at Richard's family. It reminded me of Julia Quinn and Kasey Michaels--top-notch romantic humor. I can't wait to read the sequel, and I hope those who disliked the first give the second a chance to change their minds."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I also picked this up when I saw \\"Scarlet Pimpernel,\\" and was AMAZED!!! Though not quite Baroness orczy, not quite romance novel, it's filled with swashbuckling heroes, hilarious dialogue, witty, well-flowing prose, and some really nice history--Willig was a Harvard history grad! Anyone who enjoys this sort of thing will NOT be disappointed, I swear. All history and adventure lovers should pick this up now, and the sequel, too---I;ve pre-ordered mine!"},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"A light, light, light book. The best that can be said is that it's a good book for when you're totally brain-dead; it gives you something to look at that doesn't take much intelligence. Slightly escapist.Other than that, it's a mess. The characters are basically modern people set back in the 1800's, with token allusions to the era. The way they spoke and behaved, aside from overused exclamations such as \\"Zounds,\\" was much more 2004 than 1804. Others have spoken of sloppy history; I don't know enough to critique that, but it wouldn't surprise me. I grew increasingly irritated by the anachronisms.In short, I have a sneaky suspicion the author has good connections. To get not only this book published, but an entire series?? Zounds!"},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"Like many others, I was lured in by the mention of the Scarlet Pimpernel. I am an avid fan of the series, and felt that I was compelled to buy a novel involving him even if it was from the bargain bin at the grocery store. Alas! had I only listened to the little voice inside my head saying \\"Grocery store novel? You demmed girl, you cannot possibly buy one of these! What of your reputation, eh?\\" I confess that I didn't finish the book, and reading the other reviews for this novel, I do not feel that I am missing out. In fact, I feel that I have been saved much grief and purple prose.Anyway, what made me put the book down? All of the errors regarding the Scarlet Pimpernel! Egads! but there were so many mistakes! First off, the mere IDEA that Sir Percy would fail on any mission is incredibly laughable to anyone who's read the series. Second, the reasons for Sir Percy's retiring are incorrect. He didn't stop because his identity was revealed, but because the Terror ended and there was no reason to continue. The author would have known this had she read the Triumph of the Scarlet Pimpernel and also the Life and Exploits of the Scarlet Pimpernel. You may think, oh big deal, you're just being nitpicky, but come on, the entire foundation of the book depends on the Scarlet Pimpernel. If she can't get even the basics correct... You'd think a PhD candidate would do a little more research. She also adds a League member which is severely tampering with canon there.Oh, and don't even get me started on the tackiness of two other adventure heroes with the same style name. Can't they be a LITTLE creative? And Amy was so obnoxious and anachronistic.Anyway, if you're a Pimpernel fan, please resist and just reread The Elusive Pimpernel or Lord Tony's Wife or something."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I bought this book on the bargain shelf thinking that it would be a fun historical romance with a little espionage thrown in. I kind of want my six bucks back.Let me just say that the advertising for this book is completely misleading. I know that they say that you can't judge a book by its cover, but I have found over the years that you can at least get a sense of the book's target audience by looking at the cover. This one is absurd. Seriously, it's about as bodice-ripper inaccurate as one can get, and the ridiculous, flowery, Harlequin-nature of the prose had me gagging. I can not stand straight-up romance novels with flat characters and improbable plots, and that's all this turned out to be, albeit printed on more expensive paper and in a different paperback size.If you like romance novels, you'll probably like this book. That's fine. A lot of very smart, well-read people like romance novels; I just happen to not be one of them. I'm rating it a 2 because if you're just looking for a flat-out romance novel, this is probably a good book for you. If you want an honest-to-god adventure yarn, however, do yourself a huge favor and search elsewhere.Damn you, you dishonest marketers! Oh why did you have to sucker me so thoroughly?"},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"Much is made in the cover blurbs, readers' guide, etc., of Meg Cabot's description of this novel as \\"genre-bending,\\" but I think don't think she meant that it was too much contrived romance and too little historical accuracy to be a historical novel; too much history to be pure chick lit; too much silly sex to not need Fabio on the cover macking a maiden in a torn gown. Unfortunately, the romances are too bogged-down, obvious and dull to make this an adventure story; and there's too little chemistry or believable characterization to be an interesting romance.So much of the behavior and events beggar belief. The main character's chaperone attacking Napoleon with her parasol for bad manners? The main character sneaking into and searching Napoleon's study? Not to mention practically getting to third base with a man whose face she can't see and name she doesn't know? In public? Really. Amy and Eloise both behave like bratty prepubescents rather than young women and do an awful lot of groping with the male leads whom they ostensibly loathe. One can hardly imagine Elizabeth or even Lydia Bennet behaving so abominably. I honestly did not get that when main narrative started, Amy is already of age; I thought it was another section of her childhood when she was maybe eleven. That's never a good sign, is it?The humor is funny the first time you hear the same joke, but mostly very heavy-handed and becomes very repetitive. The action is extremely predictable, unimaginative; and the mystery not at all mysterious. The characters are flat stock and their relationships not believable or even interesting. If you're taking a break from your political theory dissertation or something, you can skim through this quickly for a bit of escapism, but honestly, you might do better with the aforementioned Fabio bodice-ripper."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I'm a long term reader of romance. I bought this book because of enthusiastic recommendations from people in the romance reading community. Was I ever disappointed.If you like reading those Elizabeth Peters books where the men always patronise the women, and the hero and heroine spend much of their time arguing with each other while \\"solving an exciting mystery\\" and \\"having and exciting adventure\\", this is the book (and series) for you. If you don't, it isn't. I read vampire romance! I'm happy to jump on the \\"suspension of belief\\" train and be taken all kinds of weird places if the writing is good enough to take me there. Suspension of belief is not helped by the way the ?Purple Gentian has a special cloak and mask he puts on when he goes spying, as you do in espionage; then there is the way Napoleon's office is clearly a meeting place for everyone and their dog to hop in and out of, search for secret documents and snog in.The 20th century plot is obviously going to drag on for 10 000 books, with the heroine being an idiot, frustrated and powerless. Notwithstanding the fact that she is a Harvard doctoral candidate. I'm not sure why the writer bothered with the 20th century plot - it's extra work for her, and who cares? The mysteries aren't interesting enough - it's clear there will be more stupid letters/documents for the character to discover/read in subsequent books. So? I don't care because the character never became a person for me. None of them did.If you like strong character driven narratives, be they romance or any other sort of fiction, this is not the book for you. Many reviewers have pointed out that the age of the characters comes across as being about 12, which is fine when they are 12, but not when they are 20 or above. If you need to like the protagonists or at least need to empathise with them to get sucked into a narrative, there is likely to be a problem as well - unless you are 12, in which case you shouldn't be reading this book. Willig might like to consider stripping out the sex scenes and remarking the books to 9 - 13 year olds. She'd make a mint, although perhaps not in France.I, like other reviewers, was affronted by the trivial and disrespectful way the author treated Napoleon and the French revolution, as if it was all a jolly black and white background for her paper-doll characters to have a lovely romp, being \\"spies\\" and giving themselves spiffing flower names. If you have any real positive connection with the French, this is not the book for you. There's also quite a bit of \\"oh, gosh! A body! rather! A mystery! how jolly!\\" If you enjoy that sort of thing, this is definitely the book for you.This series is beloved by many very well-informed romance readers. Clearly they do not have my suspension of belief problems - maybe they like children, and thus were not as unenchanted with everybodys' infantile behaviour in the book. I decided to post this review because I was so affronted and disappointed by this book, clearly written by someone with skill, a broad education and brains. I wish a review like this had been up for me to read before I wasted the $5 and a few hours of my life."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"Quite possibly one of the worst books I have ever read. I think the author may have been going for a satire of the Scarlet Pimpernel story, but this book is dreadful. Clich&eacute;d characters, people who speak and act like 21st century characters in a 19th century setting. Laughable dialogue, a contrived storyline, from start to finish there is nothing to recommend the book.I thought I was getting a good historical fiction, what I got was a bad romance book and most unbelievable of all to me is that this appears to be the first of a series.With all the wonderful writers out there, the fact that this book was even published is astounding."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"In the ways of mystery, intrigue, and espionage in both the past and present narrative, I thought thatThe Intelligencerwas better. I am a bit disappointed that there wasn't more of those in it and less romance, but not much. While predictible and not always original, it still has a charm of its own and, at times, was impossible to put down. The characters were great and I enjoyed Amy's spirited ways and the banter between her and Richard. All the secondary characters, epecially Jane and Richard's family and friends, were interesting and added to the story. I really liked Eloise, and even though she's not in it much, I really got a sense of knowing her and I can't wait to find out what happens with her next. That intrigues me as much as finding out what happens next with the Pink Carnation!I haven't come across many books with the past/present espionage storyline and would be interested in reading more, so I'm glad that the author has decided to write more of these novels. I hope the sequels are equally as engaging and fun! And some more mystery might be nice too.Mini-kinda-spoiler:The one thing that kind of bothered me was that the title implies it is about the Pink Carnation when there really isn't much about ol' Pinkie. And the one major mission isn't really described at all! Probably because it didn't really involve the central characters or story, I imagine."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I found this book at Border's by mistake. I had gone in for dvds and came out with The Secret History of the Pink Carnation. Reading the back I expected most of the book to be about Eloise but it was Amy who got most of the attention. I didn't mind though, Amy's story was fascinating.Eloise Kelly is doing research for her Harvard dissertation in England. \\"That was what I planned to do--to hunt the elusive Pink Carnation through the archives of England,\\" Eloise says. \\"...of course, that wasn't how I phrased it when I suggested the idea to my dissertation advisor. I made scholarly noises about filling a gap in historiography, and the deep sociological significance of spying as a means of asserting manhood, and other silly ideas couched in intellectual unintelligibility. I called it Aristocratic Espionage during the Wars with France 1789-1815. Rather a dry title, but somehow I doubt Why I Love Men in Black Masks would have made it past my dissertation committee.\\" Getting desperate for information on the Pink Carnation, an English spy no historian has ever unmasked, she contacts three descendants of the Carnation's predecessor Lord Richard Selwick, also known as the Purple Gentian. Mrs. Selwick-Alderly invites Eloise to her home and gives her permission to look through centuries old manuscripts wherein lies the identity of the Pink Carnation.Immediately the reader is thrown into Amy's story with limited, but wanted, interruption by Eloise. I am used to seeing the French Revolution and the dethroning of monarchs as a \\"good thing,\\" especially after reading a Tale of Two Cities in school. But the book shows you the other side of the story, the story of aristocrats who really didn't deserve to be thrown in the Bastille and the masked man who saves them. Amy is outgoing and a source of much amusement and the Purple Gentian is the Zorro (or as I imagine Westley from the Princess Bride) of France.The reader is kept guessing about the identity of the Pink Carnation all the way through the book which I loved. My only problem was sometimes it was hard to figure out if it was Richard Selwick thinking or Amy Balcourt. But other than that I loved the book. I must say my favorite part was the end, chapter 31 and beyond, and the interaction between Richard's best friend Miles and his little sister Henrietta. I was overjoyed to see the next book is about them.So to sum up I say \\"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation\\" is just as Meg Cabot describes it, a \\"genre-bending read--a dash of chick lit with a historical twist--[that] has it all!\\""},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"The summary on the back cover of this book is rather misleading. It gives you the impression that this is a typical chick lit book set in modern day England with occasional references to dashing spies and romantic heros of the past. That is incorrect. The bulk of the action actually takes place in the past, focusing on the exploits of Amy and Richard in the time of the Napoleonic War, with modern-day grad student Eloise's chapters serving as a framing story. Eloise is the narrator. She speaks to us in the first person at the beginning and the end (and the occasional middle chapter interspersed throughout) of the book, but make no mistake, The Secret History of the Pink Carnation is unquestionably Amy and Richard's story. They're the characters who we care the most about and who we're the most involved in. Which is not to say that we don't care about Eloise, because we do, and I, for one, am looking forward to seeing how her relationship with Colin progresses over the course of this new series, but she's not the focus. In a sense, she's almost a plot device to involve us in the historical story. But not completely. After all, if that was all she was, then the author could have cut her out altogether and just told a straightforward historical romance.Okay, that was clear as mud, wasn't it.Anyway.I found this book to be a great deal of fun, one of the most purely enjoyable books I've read in years. The sheer swashbuckling intrigue of the noble and romantic spy the Purple Gentian running around France foiling Napoleon's evil plans was utterly charming, and it combined in an odd, quirky, but very appealing way with the Bridget Jones-esque tone of the modern-day chapters (although Eloise is far more intellectual than Bridget would ever dream of being) -- creating a frothy, satisfying confection of a novel, fascinating, surprising, and wonderful. The ensemble cast was a thoroughly delightful touch, adding a zany charm to moments that would otherwise have been hackneyed and cliched, familiar from a thousand other romance novels. This time, when the Pink Carnation makes a daring rescue at the end of the book, Richard's mother is along for the ride -- a welcome breath of originality.The only flaw in this novel is, I'm sorry to say, a common one to mystery novels. Eloise serves as a stand-in for the reader; her reactions on her search for the identity of the Pink Carnation mirror the reader's reactions. Unfortunately, the reader is one step ahead of her the whole way through.That one blemish was not enought to mar the whole, though, and I recommend this book highly for anyone in the mood for a fun, romantic, original, and light but still intelligent read!"},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"Take this book for what it is. A romantic novel set in the Napoleontic reigon. You have the masked hero, the villian, the lady and a couple of side stories. Napoleon is reportedly setting his eyes on England in his hostal European take over, and someone has got to stop that!I wish that someone had alerted me to the style writting of the story. The story itself is good, but the writting goes from \\"The pale dark moon emodes...\\" to \\"Oh my god, like I'm so Famished!\\" Okay, its not that bad, but its close. I'm advice to Ms. Willig: The words that you use and the dialog of the charaters are what makes us as readers connect. It was hard in some places to get into that moment of suspense when the character of the past is using dialog of the future.I did enjoy the book, Ms. Willing has set up at least two other characters to get into and the men dthat will be leading in their lives. The foreshadowing is easy.I still rated this book a \\"4\\" and enjoyed it. Understand the writing is a bit novice, but once can tell that will improve. With my above review, please enjow the tale of love and spies!Good luck Lauren and I am looking forward to the real Pink Carnation's story!"},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I haven't been this excited about a books since I was eight, when I first read Anne of Green Gables. Willig's first novel in her series of historical fiction/chick lit works has become one of my favorites, of all time. After years of devouring the stereotypical chick lit novels, I thought I had exhausted the genre, and myself. Willig continually surprised me, with unexpected plot twists, charmingly crafted characters, and the academic requirements needed to write a really good and believable historical fiction. Plus, with the framing of the historical story within the subplot of a modern-day history grad from Harvard, readers are presented with two inspiring heroines with which to fall in love. I can't wait to read the next one!"},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"Alas, what begins as a light fun read deteriorates to farce.The author tried to weave a modern search for a historical swashbuckler in with the period action. The current day tale is quite unnecessary and gets lost. As for the swashbuckling portion of the story, the French officials are the only ones who seem unable to determine who the cloaked figure is. He's busy saving England from the French, while groping Our Heroine. The author spends far too much time (and written detail) on the groping and panting, swollen this and that, bulging other. As for Our Heroine, the author cannot decide whether she is cunning enough to overthrow the French plot against England, or cunny enough to lure half the men in the story.An ok summertime beach read, but Scarlet Pimpernel is a much better read."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I loved this book!! I couldn't quite place it into one genre. It's a book within a book, a love story, a historical background, all wrapped up into a nice little mystery. I love it!!With her imagery and detail, Ms. Willig made it feel as if you could be alongside the characters of her novel. If there could be a 20 star rating, this novel would get it from me. You should really read this novel, especially if you like one of those many genres!"},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I normally have little faith in first time authors, but Willig wowed me. Her prose is fluid and effortless, her narrative amusing, her characters actually likeable and believable. Though it's more for the romance crowd than a dark fiction reader, no one should pass up this wonderful novel. I hear there's a sequel, and I advise EVERYONE to read this and its successor. Good Work, Ms. Willig!"},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"Currently a law student and PhD candidate at Harvard, Lauren Willig has penned a fun, imaginative, totally charming historical novel. It has everything we expect in that genre - romance, adventure, suspense, and the unexpected - rib tickling laughs.The member of an acclaimed London theatrical family, Kate Reading gives a bravura performance in the telling of this tale. Listeners may remember her from some of Patricia Cornwell's audios - Blow Fly, Trace, The Last Precinct. Her enjoyment of this story is infectious as we are introduced to the most mysterious spy of all time - the Pink Carnation.Heroine Eloise Kelly is a scholar at Harvard (a bit of autobiography here?). Having exhausted available material in the Widener Library Eloise departs for England to complete her dissertation on the Scarlet Pimpernel and the Purple Gentian. Another reason for the trip is to put an ocean between herself and a double dealing former boyfriend. To her amazement and delight what she comes upon in London is the secret history of the Pink Carnation. Forget the Scarlet Pimpernel and the Purple Genetian, this is the spy who saved England from the grasp of Napoleon.As she pores over this history Eloise find the story of another young woman, Amy Balcourt, who once met Lord Selwick who was in reality the Purple Genetian. There was an immediate attraction. While immersed in their love story Eloise is faced with a distraction of her own - one Colin Selwick who tries to stop her from reading further.Heroes and heroines both past and present abound in this tale of 19th century life. Listen - you'll thoroughly enjoy.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I, too, was drawn in by the appeal of an \\"historical novel,\\" thinking to learn something of the French Revolution, The Scarlet Pimpernel, Napoleon and Josephine, 18th century espionage, etc. as implied by the marketing. The two leads do talk a lot about \\"Saving England\\" and \\"Restoring the Monarchy\\" . . . unfortunately, the author spent more time writing ludicrous and wildly improbable sex scenes than anything resembling history. Perhaps Willig intended a spoof of Jane Austen written as a James Bond novel by Georgette Heyer but if so, it misses the mark."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"Glib dialogue, run-of-the-mill characters. As another reviewer put it, the characters spoke \\"modern\\" English while running around dressed in 18th century clothes. It even lacks the passion to be termed a bodice ripper."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I found this fun book on a new fiction table at my local public library, and the title intrigued me -- I love all things Pink. It was my first historical romance, and I can't wait to read the next book! Even if slightly predictable, the book was so much fun to read and incredibly interesting.The book is not just about the Pink Carnation, the still unmasked spy who saved Britain from Napoleon's invasion, but also about the Purple Gentian, also an English spy who constantly foiled the post-revolution French government. (I think that I assumed because of the cover that the \\"Pink Carnation\\" was a woman, so I was confused at first that the narrator thought that the Carnation was a man.) I am sure that spying as a job was never as easy or as constantly stimulating as this book makes it sound (I am sure that most spend a lot of time doing mundane things)-- but this book makes it sound so much more fun and romantic and adventurous, without taking away from the importance or significance of the real events. Willig did something very admirable here -- she wrote a historical romance that is true to both the spirit of romance and to history. It's spirited, well-written, funny, well-paced, and manages to avoid being vapid or trite. And its full of memorable characters -- from Miss Gwen, a chaperone/governess who had the confidence/audacity to poke even Napoleon in the ribs with her trusty parasol, and the colorful family members of the Purple Gentian -- their clever dialogue reminded me at times of Jane Austen, though a little more modern.Another reviewer mentioned that the secondary story -- the 21st century graduate student, Ellie, who is trying to find the lost identity of the Pink Carnation -- starts to feel like an interruption of the rest of the novel, which is set in 1803. I actually enjoyed both parts of the story, although I am assuming that Ellie's adventures will be continued in the next novel. I can't wait to read it."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"If you find scenes like the below funny, this is the book for you.'Meanwhile, Miss Gwen was advancing on [Napoleon] Bonaparte, backing him up so that he was nearly sitting on Josephine's lap. \\"While we are speaking, sir, this habit you have of barging into other people's countries without invitation -- it is most rude. I will not have it! You should apologize to the Italians and the Dutch at the first opportunity!\\"'\\"Mais zee Italians, zey invited me!\\" Bonaparte exclaimed indignantly.'I bought this book hoping for a delightful romp through the imaginary days of the Scarlet Pimpernel. I was disappointed. The humor was heavy-handed and the behavior was wildly inappropriate for either Orczy's social period or that of the First Consulate."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"*Caution: Idiotic Spoilers Ahead*I have many problems with this book. One of them is its being hyped as an intelligent historical romance. However, the historical references often seemed more akin to name-dropping. At one point the \\"researcher\\" Eloise is daydreaming, becomes aware of the hot guy sitting next to her, and 'plummets back to earth like Icarus'. Really? Because Icarus, you know, died on impact. And wearing a nightdress makes you Jane Eyre? What?Another problem is that the book is focused on idiots. It's supposedly the history of the Pink Carnation (Jane), yet 98% of the novel is devoted to Amy and Richard ogling each other, Amy and Richard making out, and Amy and Richard doing incredibly stupid things that bring any positive comments previously stated about them into question.Some of the humor was amusing, some of it made me cringe. There are a lot of scenes that make you wonder if the author had a checklist titled \\"Ways to Bring Lovers Together that = Hilarity\\". If so, it was a checklist that lied."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"My teenaged daughter borrowed this historical romance from a friend and pronounced it awesome. I like a good (awesome is even better) historical romance, so I decided to read it myself. This isn't the genre I generally reach for to quench my word-thirst, but if it's awesome I can't pass it up.Was it awesome? Yes. Yes it was. Imagine, if you will, England in the spring of 1803. Okay, I can't imagine it either, but you won't need to. Willig sets the scenes beautifully, but never lets the landscape overtake the plot. Her characters are just as delightful. The main heroine is absolutely delicious. I love her personality. She's full of strength and weakness, courage and trepidation, purposefulness and utter distraction. Willig's ability to give the reader such in-depth knowledge of Amy Balcourt is what draws you in. Not to be overshadowed by the heroine, the hero, Lord Richard Selwick, is quite the mixture himself. Strong and confident, but completely confounded by this unexpected woman.Other characters are just as intriguing and well detailed. I adored Miss Gwen and her fine cane. You'll love her too when you read this book.Oh... and there's another story going on while you read about Richard and Amy. Modern day Eloise is writing her dissertation. She's in England chasing the Pink Carnation by way of digging into the past of the Purple Gentian. Rummaging through old papers and spending days inside library dungeon-esque basements, her determination to unravel the mystery is contagious.Even if you don't usually go for historical romance, I think you'll find this a rewarding read. Just think of it as a spy novel set in the past with some romance on the side."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I wouldn't call this a historical novel. True, a few of the characters actually existed, but that doesn't make this a historical novel when so little of it is of significance to the story.As a chick lit, I would say it is entertaining. I agree with other reviewers' sentiment that our heroine's (Amy) immaturity is a bit irritating (so is Purple Gentian), but as a light entertainment, it serves its purpose. I was disappointed that though the title of the book suggests it is about Pink Carnation, it is more of a story of Purple Gentian and his love story (though the author didn't do much to develop their love, but focused on physical attraction).In the end though, I was entertained. Don't expect a serious, well-written book. Rather, expect to be lightly entertained."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"Amy grew up in her the English countryside with her family she became more elaborate in her plotting and already had determined her sole objective in life was revenge on the new French government for sending her father to Madame Guillotine. Since Amy's brother had survived the worst of the revolution and as she grew things in France had kind of calmed down. Amy with the help of her loyal cousin Jane Wooliston had finessed themselves a way to visit France but that entailed a chaperon in the form of the parasol heat packing neighbor Miss Gwendolyn Meadows. It was hilarious that Miss Gwendolyn used her parasol as a weapon against all kinds of follies especially out spoken men in her pathway. With chaperon in tow and permission to leave for abroad the girls were off and in France the girls had a few ideas' on what they were going to do there. The end goal was to find the newest masked spy \\"The Purple Gentian\\" and get in league with him to over throw the new government. That was the plan... but like Amy, Eloise who was reading Amy's journal in present times, nothing ever went as planned.One aspect of this novel that made me hold back from the beginning was that it is two stories in one. Present day with Eloise Kelly is in England and is absolutely determined to finish her dissertation for school. After sending a barrage of letters to well know families in the area it was Selwick hall that invited her to come and peek at their documents. What secret history lay in the 18Th century chest in Selwick hall? I was sent this novel by the publisher for review."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I grabbed this off the shelf of a bookstore without knowing what I was getting, and it turned out to be an extremely fun read. I would put it in the category of historical spy and romance. I would recommend at least giving this first novel a try, because I loved it and have loved the ensuing novels, too. I think that women who are the least bit of a daydreamer will be able to see themselves reflected in the women of the novel (and its sequels). Give it a try, especially if you like books that can transport one away from everyday life!"},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I don't usually care for historical romances, but the style made this a very fun read.

If you're into some mocking of historical romances, you'll love this. :D"},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I am an avid reader of historical romance novels. I began getting bored with reading them which is just awful since they are my escape from reality. I picked up the crimson rose from a bargain bin in a bookstore to give it a try. i had never heard of the author and was looking for something new anyway. what a surprise! i enjoyed that book so much i decided to go back and start from the beginning with the pink carnation. i do not usually read contemporary romance but the little snipetts in these books keep me wanting to learn more of colin and eloise while enjoying the historical part as well.A wonderful read for any fan of historical romance!"},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I grabbed this on audio since I had to do a lot of driving round the great state of Texas for family the week after Thanksgiving. I enjoyed the main story, that of the flower named spies in Napoleonic France and England of the early 19th century.The modern framework hung around it annoyed the crap out of me. It was weak and the parallels to the historical story were just a little too blatant for me. And the obvious lead-in for a sequel (of which there are, in fact, two) at the end was irksome.The thoroughly unnecessary sex scenes in the main story just about made me give up on this book. It was a good story, and a good romance. WHY throw this crap in there? Don't get me wrong, I have no issue with erotica. I do have issue with throwing sex into a story for no reason other than to be throwing in sex. They were hot for each other, we get it--do I really need the pages and pages (or 30+ minutes in this case) of throbbing, stroking, nubs, sheaths, and other graphic euphemisms? No.Sex for sex's sake in any story annoys me as a general rule, unless it is supposed to be there, as in erotic lit. Having said that I am willing to grant that it may have annoyed me more because I listened to this book rather than reading it. One's discomfort level is ratcheted up a few notches when you have to roll up the window at stoplights so the cars around you won't hear your read-aloud soft porn..."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"It is a work of FICTION! It is not historically corect.... but if you read the end of the book Ms. Willig tells you she changed some of the facts, as far as history goes. It is a fun romp with unexpected twists and turns.I was given the second book in the series by a friend of mine, that had not read the book. Someone gave it to her, it just is not her kind of book. She ask me to go thru a basket of books to see if there was anything inside I might be interested in reading. I picked up the second book and when I got home, started to read it. I realized it was the second of a series of book and came to Amazon.com to see if I could find the first book. I found it (along with two others in the series), and bought all of them. I waited patiently for the mailman to bring the books. Oh, joy the first book finally arrived and I started to read.What a JOY! I read the book so fast it was unreal. I couldn't put it down, and when I was finished, I was sorry the story was over, but I had the next books to read. They too, all read very fast! I am a fan of the series, and am waiting for the paperback versions of the next two, to come out. (I just like paperbacks, easier to haul around than hardbacks).They are JUST FUN books and if you take them as that, you will totally enjoy them if you like historical fiction with a dose of romance and comedy. Also has a healthy dose of the present in the story that is also fun to read.I hope you find these books as entertaining as I did.Thank You, Lauren Willig!"},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"\\"The Scarlet Pimpernel\\" is my all-time favorite book. I have read it more times than I can count and it never fails to excite, despite the fact that I know exactly what's going to happen. So, when my sister read \\"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation\\", she told me I absolutely had to read this book and as soon as it was available in the library, I checked it out.And loved it. The only way I can describe it is that it's a fun read. Pure entertainment. The hilarious antics of Amy kept me giggling in my office building's cafeteria, and the brave exploits of the Purple Gentian had me gasping on my couch at home. I enjoyed the references to the Scarlet Pimpernel as though he had been a true historical figure, and was sad when I learned the fate of one of his loyal men. The story was adventurous, amorous, and amusing, all things that make a great novel.It's nowhere near the classic that \\"The Scarlet Pimpernel\\" is, though. Don't read it expecting any illuminating themes or unique style. It leans a bit toward the romance novel genre and in that sense will never be included in the ranks of Jane Austen or the Brontes. It's light, fluffy reading and requires absolutely no deep thinking whatsoever."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"This was a very fun read. I quite enjoyed the story line. It isn't necessarily a page turner but does have you thinking about it when not reading it. It reminds me of a sort of romance novel."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I started reading with the idea that this might be spirited good fun, and I have to admit that I did chuckle for a bit. By mid-way through, however, it was clear this was going no further than the first dim-witted silliness. My chuckles grew few and far between, and were replaced by far more prolonged groans. By the end, I had to force myself to finish. (Why finish? I have no clue.) If you can imagine reading a \\"romantic spy\\" comic book placed in the aftermath of the French Revolution, without the benefit of a comic book's colorful cartoon drawings but nevertheless complete with little bubbles above the characters' heads generously supplied with \\"AARGHH\\" and \\"YIIKKES\\" and \\"GRRRR\\", you've pretty much set the scene. (Despite their reputations as master spies, this is a physically challenged lot, including our tall \\"dashing\\" hero and curly-haired voluptuous maid, as they constantly take pratfalls, stub their toes and agonize as their noggins collide while trying to steal a kiss.) Recognizing that the author wrote this tongue-in-check (at least I sure HOPE she did), I could have done with far less Three Stooges and far more crafty cleverness and witty dialogue. And the characters are as one-dimensional (that is complete idiots) as Popeye and Olive Oyl. But then, I never have been a fan of the Sunday comics, so if you are - ignore me. For anyone who's looking for an entertaining romantic suspense novel or a clever take-off of the romance genre, I suggest you look elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"This story seemed to have a lot of promise while still carrying desirable light-read elements. Unfortunately the author can't write dialogue and can only imagine romance blossoming from people who banter in unclever, unrealistic (even for a romance novel) fashions. I didn't give this \\"one star\\" because of the fresher-than-average plot. Too bad someone with a gift for writing didn't pen this."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"Stating the honest truth: I did not finish this book.I couldn't! The premise is there (it had previously been written) but the story and execution fall short. The whole thing was entirely too slow and I was overwhelmingly bored with the story. I just HAD to stop.The characters were simply ludicrous. Why would some random senseless girl suddenly have the bright idea to go and ask the surviving ancestors about the Pink Carnation when hundreds of scholars just failed to even comprehend that idea? The whole idea just is unfathomable to me. Every fiber of my being screamed that Lord Richard should not have survived, to invade the French Secret service with how incompetent he was was a miracle in itself. He was like a bull in a China shop, how did he manage NOT to get caught?!?!Maybe one day I'll manage to pick this up again and get through it . . . maybe."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I'm not normally a fan of \\"chick lit\\" or books that have pink covers, but this book may have changed my mind. It's an ingenious hybrid of romance, history, and \\"chick lit\\", and it combines all three effortlessly. Being a grad student myself, I empathize with Eloise's struggles, and enjoying historical intrigue (and being a huge fan of Baroness Orczy's Scarlet Pimpernel!) I loved the regency spy novel parts. I'm not a big romance reader, so that part surprised me, but it was well-handled and not too ridiculous. It was just what I needed for a fantastic vacation from school work and modern-day drudgery."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I have the audiobook of this, which I got on sale (thank god, though I'm sorry I paid a dime for it). The narrator is quite good, but the poor thing is working with some pretty flimsy stuff. There's nothing remotely historically accurate about this, but I'm not sure anyone would expect that. It's sort of a romance novel, though a fairly tame one by modern standards.The main thing that annoys, however is that the 19C heroine is such a dithering idiot you want to wring her neck. She behaves like an 8-year-old boy trying to worm his way into his older brother's clubhouse. She wants to be a spy, but has no idea what spies are actually after. It's kind of a cloak-and-dagger game for her. The author does that romance novel thing of having this woman be \\"spirited,\\" which means cutely indignant every so often for no particularly good reason. Then the hero gets miffed at her. It's unspeakably tedious. And she's constantly stubbing her toe or falling down and squealing \\"ouch!\\" when she's trying to be stealthy. The modern heroine is also always spilling things and tripping. I'm not sure if this clumsiness is supposed to make them adorable or relatable or what, but it's just irritating. By the halfway point, you'll find yourself wishing in vain that the halfwit will get herself killed, as she is forever on the verge of doing, but no luck.If you want a heroine for whom you can muster at least a morsel of respect, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I think the important thing to remember about this book, when you pick it up, is that it's not a novel to be read for historical value. It's more historical romance, something to read when you need some light brain fluff. It's a book to sit down with some chocolate or wine and just pretend that you are bustling around in pink skirts and being lifted off your feet by a dashing man. I think most women have those days, so this is the perfect book for that. It was highly entertaining and I honestly couldn't put it down. I really enjoyed it, not because it's a serious novel but because it wasn't. The main character can be a little annoying because she is a little clueless sometimes, but for the most part she's a good character. She doesn't sit around waiting to be rescued, but instead actually does the rescuing, which I like. And there are some unexpected developments and some action and intrigue, so it does make you want to keep reading and the end makes you look forward to the sequel. I would recommend this book for anyone who wants a little bit of historical romance without the smutty bodice rippers. It's kind of like a sophisticated historical romance."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"If you think this is going to be classic Regency or more traditional historical fiction, then this is NOT your book. However, if you like historical fiction, comedy, and great characters than you might want to give this a try. The first book in an every growing (and promising) series, The Secret History of the Pink Carnation is about spies. English spies in Napoleon's France to be exact. Our heroine, Amy Balcourt, is on the look for the spy the Purple Gentian, fixed with daydreams of convincing him to let her help him stop Napoleon from invading England and restoring the French Monarchy. She gets lucky, her brother who has remained in France has sent for her to move back \\"home\\". Amy, with her clear-headed cousin Jane and their frightening parisol wielding charparone, Miss Gwen, set off to France. On one Lord Richard Selwick's boat. These two end up fighting, hating eachother but nevertheless seem to run into eachother on a regular basis: ah, the basis for love/hate affairs of the heart. While Richard, who actually is our elusive spy is trying to save England, Amy is looking for him.Without going into the entire plot line (which has already been described at length and done in better justice than I could ever do) this books is summed up to me in one word: brillant. Some \\"lighter\\" historical fictions tend to skimp on their characters, the plot, the dramatics leaving only shells. Pink Carnation is not one of those novels. Yes, it's light hearted and fun (one of the funniest books I've ever read at that)but while this is the classic heart wrenching drama that many other histoical fictions are, this is still an incredible well written, super engaging novel. The characters are so life like (including the minor ones like Richard's \\"butler\\") it's nearly impossible to root for them. Well, except the evil bad guys at the Minstery of Police and their evil torture chambers that make the Inquistion look like Disneyland.I cannot stop gushing over this novel. I didn't expect it to be this good, this funny, this engaging and this un-put-down-able. It's one of those books that you go back and reread passages over and over again because they're just so much fun. And with the ending we get, I'm not sure I can wait until Christmas to get the second and third in this series! One of my all time favorites!"},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"There are two kinds of historical fiction novels: those that take the time period they are set with true gravity, showing history to be something taken seriously. Then, there are the books that have fun with time periods, characters, and even plot. Lauren Willig's \\"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation\\" is definitely of the latter variety, and it's much better off for it.Eloise Kelly is a Harvard grad student who has decided to write her dissertation on the Pink Carnation, a spy who created mayhem for the French during the Napoleonic wars. Though the Carnation was less well-known than the Scarlet Pimpernel and the Purple Gentian, he is nonetheless an important historical figure. Eloise's plan is simple: move to London and unmask the Pink Carnation. Though she is initally thwarted at every turn, eventually a descendent of the Purple Gentian allows her to read through the Gentian's correspondance in the hopes of discovering the other spy's identity.Amy Balcourt is a twenty-year old living in the wilds of Shropshire when her brother, Edouard, summons her home to Paris. The year is 1803, and it is finally safe for her to return to the city of her birth. Though her English relatives are loathe to let her go, they eventually relent, sending Amy to France with her cousin Jane and an elderly spinster named Miss Gwen Meadows, whose penchant for gothic novels is nearly as legendary as her use of a parasol as a sword. But Amy and Jane have secret motives for going to the City of Light: they hope to find the Purple Gentian, an English spy who helped rescue aristocrats from the Terror. Amy's father perished on the guillotine, and she has high hopes for joining the League of the Purple Gentian and helping him to restore the monarchy to France.On the trip over the Channel, Amy meets Lord Richard Selwick, a scholar of ancient Egypt who is one of Napoleon's trusted historical advisors. Given her family history, Amy takes an immediate dislike to Selwick and is frustrated at constantly being thrown into his presence once the group reaches Paris. She is delighted, however, upon meeting the Purple Gentian in her brother's study one night. She volunteers to assist him in his new mission to prevent Bonaparte from invading England, but is given a decided no.Despite the Gentian's refusal to allow her to help, Amy is not deterred. She can and will help prevent the French from invading England, no matter what anyone - least of all the offensive Selwick - has to say in the matter. There's just one problem: Richard Selwick actually is the Purple Gentian.Through early nineteenth century Paris, Willig presents a comedy of errors that is as funny as it is informative as Amy and Richard continue to clash with each other in their determination to stop Napoleon. It's not a serious book by any stretch of the mind, but it is an enjoyable read. I found myself frequently laughing out loud at the sheer genius of banter and colorful characters. Is the language appropriate for the time frame? No. Is it a bit heavy on the romance side? Yes - my only criticism of the novel. But it is a rollicking good time, and that's a rare gem in historical fiction."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"The adventures of Amy Balcourt as she stumbles her way through the intrigue of Napoleon's court are meant to be great fun for the reader. I have no idea if Lauren Willig ever meant to start a series of novels, but as she is now in the process of writing book \\"IX\\", there is definitely something here for readers who enjoy humor mixed in with their romantic suspense. At first glance, Amy may seem to just another silly girl, especially in contrast to her still-waters-run-deep cousin Jane. But get to know her and there are many layers. The historical story in itself, with witty repartee, really bad bad guys, and all the other trimmings of the genre, is entertaining enough, but Willig frames it with the contemporary story of a grad student, Eloise, who is trying to find out the identity of the mysterious Pink Carnation. The elements of chick-lit, historical romance, suspense, and yes, just a bit of tongue-in-cheekiness, make this a delightful read for anyone looking for a fun escape from the mundane."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"American grad student Eloise Kelly travels to England to conduct research for her dissertation (and to get over a cheating boyfriend).

Amy Balcourt travels to France to join the League of the Purple Gentian. She wants to avenge her parents' deaths and dreams up schemes to defeat Napoleon. Lord Richard Selwick - aka the Purple Gentian - isn't quite prepared for Amy (nor does he reveal his secret identity).

The author's debut, The Secret History of the Pink Carnation, is the first in a series.I think Meg Cabot describes it best: \\"This genre-bending read--a dash of chick-lit with a historical twist--has it all: romance, mystery, and adventure.\\""},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"The novel is wonderful! It will keep you enthralled from cover to cover, sa the pages inbetween are filled with laughter, romance, adventure, history--a mix of genres and styles, all blended effortlessly by Willig's witty prose. Eloise Kelly is quirky, realistic, and a pleasure to follow--especially when the story she follows is as exciting as Richard and Amy's! The love-hate premise for romance can be overdone, but Willig keeps it fresh, and before long you are just itching to see more of them together. Add on to that the beautiful backdrop if Napoleonic France, enlivened by Willig's Yale-Harvard historian background, and there is simply no way to go wroing. Honestly, ANY ONE who enjoys humor, romance, mystery, escapades and gloriously good writing should grab this book right away!"},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"If it were possible to give a zero-star rating, I'd give this book exactly that!\\"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation\\" is about espionage during Napoleon's reign. Eloise Kelly, a Harvard graduate student, flies to London and delves into research about English spies as her thesis. She eventually finds out that the Pink Carnation is a woman spy. History, romance and feminism, plus the author's a PhD, so naturally, I was expecting something well-researched and informative yet light and fun to read.What I got instead was a really badly-written, plain stupid romance novel set in the 19th century. The two main characters were hormonally overcharged, unbelievably idiotic and I kept on asking myself how the hell they survived as spies. Amy and Richard groped each other wherever and whenever they went, during trips, before and after fights, during surveillance, during missions. Throughout the novel, Amy's bosom was constantly heaving, and Richard had a perpetual hard-on.The narrative switches between past (Amy) and present (Eloise). Eloise's story is when she's not reading Amy's letters for research, she's fantasizing about Colin Selwick, Richard and Amy's descendant. The narrative didn't work out as well because it felt like two separate novels - \\"Amy's Heaving Bosom\\" and \\"Eloise's Forbidden Fantasies\\" - being mashed into one.I cannot help feeling like I was bamboozled. I was conned into buying this unbelievably idiotic book! What happened to the well-researched and informative part? I was glad to have picked up this book in a bargain bin, because it sucked big time, and if I had bought it full-priced, I would've felt really, really bad. I should've trusted my instincts and turned away from this book's frilly, frothy pink jacket and its blurbs which scream \\"brainless, dumb chick lit\\". While I firmly believe in the saying \\"Never judge a book by its cover\\", I think that this time, I'll make an exception."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I couldn't finish this book. Lauren Willig manages to commit within the first 70 pages nearly every fault I attribute to shaky first novels and bad historical romances. I've read too many of both to have any patience with either any more.Willig gets high marks for her premise: a modern day researcher ferrets out a cache of documents which allows the story of British secret agents during the Napoleonic Wars to be told in flash-back. I adore stories about researchers who dig up new facts about the past, and Willig's conceit that the fictional Scarlet Pimpernel was a real person is super fun.Unfortunately the characters assembled to tell this story are trite. Eloise Kelly, our modern-day heroine, pursues her graduate research on British secret agents of the past in new suede boots which are promptly ruined by London rain. She seems more dim than hapless. Amy Balcourt, our spirited Regency heroine, also appears to be a bear of very little brain, but we and everyone in the story are supposed to find her innocent recklessness charming. Our dashing Regency hero, Lord Richard Selwick, alias The Purple Gentian, conducts long and whiny internal monologues; it is hard to believe in his competence at tricking the French intelligence service.Novels can survive cardboard characters if the plot is engaging and the writing seamless. Willig's prose is serviceable enough and perhaps the macro-plot may have engaged me eventually, but the small irritations kept adding up until I couldn't continue. Some examples from my personal niggles file: Derek is an unlikely name for a Regency era Englishman; Jane Austen would use the verb form \\"forgot\\" for \\"forgotten\\"; the phrase \\"plan B\\" is an anachronism; and sailors on channel packet boats don't all go to sleep at night so as to leave the decks romantically deserted. The final straw was the moonlit scene on said deserted deck when Lord Richard admires Amy standing at the prow of the packet boat like a \\"fierce figurehead.\\" I sniggered at the idea of all this romance occurring beside the ship's head, where the sailors hang their bums out over the water to relieve themselves. Then I put the book down for the last time.I'm really torn on how to rate this book. It deserves better than one star, for in the absence of a \\"no stars\\" option, one star is effectively no stars. My allergy to the Spirited Teenage Heroine who is actually self-absorbed and dumb as rocks, and to the Historical Romance which can't evoke any actual sense of the past, but just uses long frocks, horse carriages, and notions of strict male-female roles as set dressing for the story, won't spoil the pleasure others take in the form. To them I recommend this book with my good wishes and two stars."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I saw this book about a week and a half ago. I was intrigued by the cover - what can I say? I like pretty dresses - and the reference to the Scarlet Pimpernel. I bought the book, read it, and thoroughly enjoyed it. I logged onto Amazon to see what others thought of the book and was surprised to see so many upset with the novel because of its lack of proper Regency history. When an author uses the story of a fictional character (the Scarlet Pimpernel) as a jumping off point for more fictional characters (the Purple Gentian and nominal Pink Carnation), I think it can be safely assumed that historical fact is not the highest priority of the novel. The world of the Pink Carnation fits and compliments Willig's characters well. Amy, I will admit, is not my favorite of literary heroines, but I think her personality is created and carried out realistically. There are people like her; I have met them.That being said, this book is wonderfully entertaining, - which is the goal of most modern fiction - and I am very glad that it has become a series. I am currently on the third instalment and happy to continue reading about the (fictional) exploits of the Pink Carnation. If one is looking for an accurate historical portrayal of espionage in the early 1800s, go read a dissertation, but if one is looking for a fun summer read, try out the Pink Carnation and its sequels. (I liked \\"The Masque of the Black Tulip\\" better than the first novel.)"},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I liked this book (and the two that follow) very much, it was a good way to spend a rainy afternoon by the fire."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I love to find new authors, and I will look to see what else they have written so that I can enjoy this new storyteller-but, I can't with this book. This had been a bookclub pick, so I didn't have a choice in reading this book. It was very hard to get into-seriously-the book got somewhat engaging at around page 300 or so. I felt that it was a step above a \\"typical\\" bodice-ripping book, but not by much. It was a very \\"fluff-filled\\" book. It was very easy chick lit and a little to blah for me."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"Since other reviewers here have already dished on the storyline, I'll just say that this book is truly fun. Willig has down pat the nuances of the petulant English youth of the time, and I chuckled several times through-out.I was impressed by Willig's writing - she is only twenty-six after all - and I got into the adventure, eagerly soaking up the tale. Pink Carnation reads like a \\"larger in scope\\" romance novel, with adventure, laughter, and plenty of neat surrounding characters - all of which make this story come to life.And who could resist anything resembling the tale of the Scarlet Pimpernel?"},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"Maybe, just maybe, this terrible bit of amateurish drivel can be attributed to the author's youth, but I suspect her purple prose and hackneyed storyline have more to do with far too much made-for-television movie watching than chronological age. The dialogue -- complete with psuedo-stage directions that try to pass as prose -- is almost unbearable, and the plot is even more trivial than the cliched character development. However, I would have loved it when I was twelve or thirteen..."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"You know, I had decided not to write this review in the if-you-can't-say-anything-nice spirit of things, but when I saw that there had actually been a sequel written, I was appalled. I think that Lauren Willig does have some talent for dialogue, but it only emerged a few times in The Pink Carnation. I did hesitate over buying the book - The Pink Carnation, for goodness sake? - but the cover art got me. The plot - both of them - was so full of holes that it was distracting. Although it moves back and forth between 21st and early 19th century, both sets of characters respond as 21st century characters, so you don't get the then-and-now contrast that can be so fun. I didn't expect Possession, but I did expect more than I got. And the absolutely ludicrous love scenes. Who in their right minds would have a make-out party in the bedroom of their sworn arch-enemy while searching his room? They deserved just what they got. I think the two very worst things I can say about the book are this: 1) about 2/3 of the way through, about 60 pages of the book were repeated and the actual next 60 pages were missing. I was able to get back into the book without feeling I had missed anything (a really shoddy printing/publishing house - just \\"deserts\\"?); 2) I finished it in an airport waiting area and immediately threw it in the trash. It was that bad. Read Georgette Heyer, read Diana Gabaldon - heck - read Amanda Quick. At least they have a thorough command of the niche they've carved out for themselves as historical romance writers."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"Based on a review of this book, my book club decided to read it. When we then got together for our monthly meeting to discuss the book, our meeting quickly turned into a meeting of laughter and unbelief. How in the world did Miss Willig get this book published? Unfortunately, we all agreed that it is by far, the worst book any one of us has ever read. Between the 'zaps' and 'thumps' and so on, we were not sure if we were reading a cartoon. The vocabulary is not of the times, and the manner of writing is not only boring, but it detracts from a story which perhaps has potential. Between the 12 of us in the book club, we might have read the whole book. Our suggestion is, please don't write the next book!"},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"Harvard graduate student Eloise Kelly is writing her thesis on the early nineteenth century dashingly romantic English spies the Scarlet Pimpernel, the Purple Gentian, and especially the Pink Carnation. The first two were unmasked by Napoleon's agents as Sir Percy Blakeney and Lord Richard Selwick, but the identity of the Pink Carnation never was revealed. Eloise receives a grant to research her dissertation in England, so she ends her relationship with her boyfriend made easier when she caught him in the cloakroom with an art historian major.Eloise believes that the Pink Carnation is somehow related to the Selwick family of the Purple Gentian fame. She visits Mrs. Arabella Selwick-Alderly at Selwick Hall, who provides her with access to a large trunk filled with family letters from the Napoleonic era. Arabella suggests that Eloise start with the intriguing account of Amy Balcourt on a trip to Paris in 1803 where she meets Richard Selwick. As Amy and Richard play spy counter spy they share in common efforts to keep Napoleon from invading England and a growing attraction. Meanwhile in the present, Eloise plays historical spy counterspy with Colin Selwick, but where this romance will go only time will tell.This enticing tale occurs in two time periods with the brunt of the story line happening in the early nineteenth century. Readers will enjoy the Regency era gender battle between two fine protagonists yet also appreciate that this is being fed to the audience via present day characters in a chick lit setting. Though how easily she attains the letters seem odd as no outsider had access before, the dual themes merge into a finely blended fabulous romance.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"Let me state right now that I didn't finish the book--I put it down as soon as the Purple Gentian made the stupid remark about Amy's kissable neck. I couldn't care less about whether the book is faithful to the period setting or whether the characters are able spies.It's just badly written."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"This book is the first in a series, one of which was ranked highly as a great summer read. To be fair, it is easy to read (unless typos frustrate you) and the subject matter is light and entertaining. Your time could, however, be better spent reading Shakespeare or Jane Austen in the original. Willig has shamelessly incorporated not only the setting but also the unique characters and even the phrasing from earlier, better works."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"This book is everything you hope an entertaining read can be: it's funny,smart,and heart-warming. I could not put it down - and I would advise that you don't try to either because you'll be dying to get back to is as soon as you can. Full of mystery and romance, as well as a great mix of past and present, this book is most certainly one of my favorite entertaining reads yet. It's easy to read and you'll get caught up in the moment so much so that you'll think you are right there with them."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"Lauren Willig's novel is a mystery \\"caper\\" that kept me--critical, skeptical, English-major/French-minor know-it-all me--intrigued and entertained. I recommend the book to any gals who long for intelligent period-piece escape. I'm so tickled by this find!I am aware that authors do not (necessarily) share the personalities and quirks of their narrators, but there is no way this author could be too far removed from her fun, casually articulate, brilliant narrator-creation Eloise. I say this because, only after having purchased the novel The Secret History of the Pink Carnation on a whim and having begun to be enchanted by page after page did I learn from my boyfriend that the author is a fellow third-year law student with him at Harvard! How cool is that? She is a combo-PhD and JD, hence her amazing command of French-English history circa-Jane Austen time.Her story takes the form of a story-within-a-story, bridging the gap between a Starbucks-chugging grad student on a dissertation research mission in London and the escapades of English spies in Bonaparte-controlled France. It's as if Willig attempted (successfully) to bring Jane Austen up to date, making all of her seemingly historically accurate characters take on familiar situations, always to comic effect that never seems forced."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I love romances and histories, and I thought this was going to be the usual fluffy fun read, but it was so much better! The writing is superb, witty, and original, and the plot is anything but corny. It was as intelligent and thoughtful as Phillipa Gregory, only funnier and more intriguing. You'll read it in one sitting and be longing for the sequel immediately."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I took someone's recommendation on this - she billed it as a somewhat more substantial novel. It isn't. Just another bodice ripper. If you like that sort of thing. I don't so I'm not even sure if it's a good one. I imagine this as porn (but for women) - all about the sex and the story is silly and improbable and actually dumb."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"As a pimpernel aficionado and someone who enjoys a good writer, I really enjoyed this book.

But what a great pleasure it was! The writing is witty and funny---the Eloise bits are spot-on---and Willig paints a beautiful picture of regency england and france, with some adventure and romance along the way. Plus, I admit, I have a huge crush on Richard. I hope there are many more heroes like him to come!"},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I expected an intriguing spy novel not a Harlequin romance with terminally immature protagonists. I gave up after 94 pages."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"As a fan of The Scarlet Pimpernel, I looked forward to this book very much; thankfully, I got it out of the library rather than paying for it. I read the book in one sitting with a growing sense of frustration--nothing seemed real. The characters were completely modern, the war seemed more like a trip to Disneyland than a dangerous thing, and the characters were so dumb they deserved to get caught spying. There was no sense of realism to the book. Perhaps I expected the wrong thing, but this book seems almost disrespectful to the people who suffered during the time the book is set, as it has utterly no concept of their suffering."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"The story of the Pink Carnation (purely fiction, mind you) would be a lot more interesting if it didn't pander to so many modern desires. Here we have a twenty year old gentry girl, in 1803, on a personal mission to find a spy and become one herself? The whole story is difficult to take seriously because it sounds like the silly day dream of a teenage girl. Oh, wait...it is.Aside from the unlikely nature of the story--referring specifically to the heroine who is terribly out of character for an early 19th century woman--the story is told is an almost text book fashion, as if the author had a manual \\"how to write novels\\" sitting next to her. The most glaring example is the classic \\"cartoon interruption\\". Do you remember those old bugs bunny cartoons in which a new character would burst into the room, or something outrageous would happen, and all action would immediately stop out of surprise? Here's an example, \\"Jon stopped writing, sally's knitting needles froze, Mama's tea cup stopped at her lips, and a vase fell from the maid's hands, etc., etc.\\" The only thing missing is a cat skreeching in the background. Well, the author of the Pink Carnation manages to employ this tired scene at least TEN TIMES. News Flash: reality doesn't actually look like that!"},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I'm a book lover. I respect books as the wonderful gifts they are, and am usually the kind of person who frowns at someone else for a cracked spine or dog-eared pages. That's just me, obsessive compulsive about books, like Cervantes' Translator character in Don Quixote.That being said, I've never had a stronger desire to rip something to shreds as when I was stuck reading \\"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation\\" by Lauren Willig. I like historical fiction. I enjoy it even when it isn't accurate, so long as it is written well. But this book isn't even close. It's insulting, as in, I can't believe they publish this pooh. There's a place for writing that is this bad. The internet.To sum this up, Pink Carnation is comparable to bad fanfiction. Find some good fanfiction online and save some trees and money by not buying this book."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"The publiciity surrounding this book suggested that it was a well-researched historic novel. This book is pure romance and utterly predictable. The author has a good flow and is pleasant. However, the plot is weak. I think the author has a future in romance but, alas, this book is more of a rough draft than a finished product."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I would be willing to accept a so-called \\"light-hearted romp\\" or farce, or whatever, but please! Even with the bar set that low, this book manages to miss the mark.The premise of the book is entirely implausible. The whole spying plot is a pointless game - the spies' goal seems to be to merely annoy the bad guys, and the bad guys are the most cliche-ridden Snidely Whiplash villians imaginable - yet at the same time they can be vanquished by a scolding on manners. The hero allows himself to be distracted from his mission by trivialities - not a very reliable spy, I guess. It's unclear why he even has a cloak and mask - what would be point of that, anyway? And why does he enter and exit his home through the front door while wearing cloak and mask? The heroine seems omniscient, with her leaps to fantastic and coincidental conclusions, her access to royal papers and conversations, and ability to know exactly where the hero is imprisoned.I'm not even sure what the characters' motivations are. Why do they even care who's on the throne? They don't seem to dwell on it much - even the death of another spy doesn't seem to bother them much.The writing is formulaic and laden with cliches. We have saucy minxes stamping their feet prettily, the obligatory device where the hero and heroine's initial dislike for one another has to be overcome by love; flaring nostrils; everyone exclaiming \\"Drat!\\" when foiled....Characters scowl with anger, \\"oomph\\" and \\"oof\\" in slapstick scenes, and pace with anger. And of course the parallel modern-day story is ridden with updated cliches of the same kind.The thing reads like a George Hamiliton b-movie spoof of a Zorro movie. Maybe that was the author's intent. But it lacks the wit and originality of one. And yes, I'm being sarcastic."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I can usually force myself to read a romance novel, not so, however with this. The constant use of simile, including the ridiculous love scenes, \\"She cried out her pleasure as a thousand diamond sparkles exploded across the back of her eyes...\\" (please) was annoying in the extreme. The author tried to be funny, but ended up being obnoxious instead. I did give this one star, and even if I could have given it no stars I would have given it at least one due to the author's effort to entertain her readers. Next time I would suggest she do a little more research, and give her readers a little more to chew on other than her one dimensional characters, and predictable, silly story."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I am all for comedic books and light reads, and regency romances...but this one is just plain silly. Based on the premise, I expected a tale of intrigue, romance and danger. What I got was a tale of idiocy, sex and bumbling. The present-day Harvard student and the 1803 \\"well-bred\\" lady who traipses about like a street urchin and practically loses her virginity on a canal boat in front of a boatman without even a second thought think the same, speak the same and act the same. The only reason that this book can be said to be set in 1803 is because Amy didn't have an airplane or a car, and because the author kept beating us over the head with famous people of the time with whom the heroine could interact (One of whom she admittedly fudged into the story a year too early). I felt throughout the book as though the author doubted my ability to understand her and therefore had to simplify things to the point of inanity. Although, this book got enough good reviews that I suppose Ms. Willig has her audience. I certainly won't hang around for the sequel!My suggestions to the author:1. Your readers are not 12-year-olds2. Read a book of Regency etiquette if you are going to write about it3. Don't lure your readers to your book by talking of intriguing subjects such as the Scarlet Pimpernel and then leave them hanging without the return on the promises it suggests.4. You lost me completely when the heroine said \\"Argh\\"I gave this two stars because I actually finished it, and because the author used the word \\"Pulchitrudinous\\" more than once, even if it was parodically."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"Gads, this is practically unreadable -- loaded with cliches, obvious hints, and all the other chick lit staples. I could not get past the first couple chapters, in which a grad student is simply given free reign with and access to a chest of invaluable letters by the letter-writers' heir. That credibility-killer was enough to stanch my interest, but i read on a little further as I didn't want to be hasty. It only got worse...Give this a wide berth."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I read this book because a friend recommended it. I think I would have been a little less disappointed if it was marketed as a sort of sexy historical romance because that is what it is. I don't expect a READER GUIDE and trade paperback/hardcover release for a book of this quality.The premise is that there are these flower-coded spies. I remember reading _The Scarlet Pimpernel_ and it being much better than this. Now the Scarlet Pimpernel has retired and the Purple Gentian (this made me think, by the way, of Gentian Violet which is an antifungal medication) is spying in Napoleonic France, to try to prevent Napoleon's planned invasion of England.I really hate novels of espionage and intrigue where the villians are just marginally more stupid than the hero and heroine. Apparently it is flat easy to be a spy because you can just, you know, walk into Napoleon's study and see the bill for the invasion on his desk. And it's even easy to break someone out of the hq of the Police Ministry because their guards are stupid as rocks and will take a drink from someone they don't know. The heroine constantly set herself up to be raped and kidnapped, which WOULD happen were it not for the convenient stupidity of the aggressors. Argh. I could go on. Someone should have supplied Willig with the Evil Overlord list. And of course the Pink Carnation's spotlight activity is offstage, sparing Willig the difficult authorial task of figuring out and showing how it was done.There was also a 21st-century \\"chick lit\\" angle which added really nothing to the story.There are much better books out there. Read something by Baroness Orczy or Diana Gabaldon or Dumas or Sabatini if you want real swashbucking, or Diana Norman if you want some real historical fiction of better quality without the stupid, and file this with the historical bodice-rippers."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I enjoyed this book, and I'm a bit surprised by all the really bad reviews. It may not be perfect but it is a fun read, which I believe is what the author intended.DON'T expect Jane Austen or Baroness Orczy or Philippa Gregory. Lauren Willig's \\"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation\\" is not deep, destined-to-be-classic, impeccably accurate historical fiction--nor is it intended to be. The author says on her website that she wrote it for fun after passing some tough grad school exams, and her enjoyment of writing it comes across in the book.Sure, Amy Balcourt isn't quite as prim and proper as your standard young lady of 1803. It would be difficult to feature in a romance novel if she were. Which, though it hurts my intellectual pride to admit it, this essentially is.It is not, however, I hasten to add, a bodice-ripper Harlequin that's all sex and no substance with no plot, flat characters, and a lot of heaving bosoms. Um, well...there are a few heaving bosoms, but that isn't the *sole* focus of the plot.On the contrary, the book is well-written and engaging. The plot may be insanely contrived at times, but that's what makes it a comedy! The writing is light and funny, the dialog is witty, the romance is...romantic, the plot is suspenseful and full of funny unexpected turns, and the characters are outstanding.Rebellious, vivacious Amy Balcourt and dashing, mysterious Lord Richard Selwick are the main characters. Amy is a lively, intelligent young woman with big plans to help the mysterious Purple Gentian save England (though she wouldn't object if he fell in love with her in the process). She is appalled when she meets Richard--an Englishman on Bonaparte's payroll, which in Amy's eyes amounts to nothing short of treason. Richard, of course, has a secret: he *is* Amy's idol, the Purple Gentian--who does *not* welcome the aid (or the romantic distraction) of a meddlesome, saucy (though very attractive--and very determined) accomplice. Hilarity ensues.Despite the comedy, the characters are sympathetic and realistic. Both have troubled pasts to overcome and ambitious (and often conflicting) dreams. The chemistry of their love/hate relationship is wonderful.Amy and Richard lead a wonderful cast of memorable, often eccentric--bordering on outrageous--supporting characters. There's Miss Gwen, the prim, straight-laced chaperone with a penchant for prodding people with her parasol--up to and including Bonaparte himself! There's Lord Richard's delightful family--his constantly flirting parents and overeager little sister and his two best friends--quiet well-behaved Geoff (who tends to get forgotten amid Richard's boisterous family) and cheerful, irreverent Miles (who provides a large part of the boisterousness himself). There's Stiles, Richard's butler, an ex-actor who does all of his buttling in character as King Lear and who ends up as a pirate...The setting in Napoleonic Paris is very well done, and we encounter not only the First Consul and his wife, but an assortment of their contemporaries--Napoleon's promiscuous sister Pauline, his hen-pecked brother-in-law Joachim Murat, and his evil minister of police, Fouch&eacute;.\\"The Pink Carnation\\" is by no means a deep and meaningful work of historical fiction, nor does it make any claims to be. It is essentially romantic comedy--with all the silliness, crazy plots, and exaggerated characters that entails. These shouldn't be considered as flaws, however--they make the book a joy to read. The humor will have you laughing, the romance will have you sighing, and the suspense will make it impossible to put down.Don't overlook the \\"Pink Carnation\\" series just because it isn't deep and serious historical fiction. Someone on the historical fiction forums called it \\"light historical fiction,\\" which is a perfect term for it. It is written for entertainment, not education--and in this it certainly succeeds."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"When historical mysteries first started to become really popular I didn't really understand why. Then I realized that all we do in studying history is try to explain mysteries, even if it's just trying to understand the motivations of peoples personal actions. So I overcame my aversion to historical mystery and started in on this new-ish genera.When I first read the title \\"The secret history of the pink carnation\\" I thought that the pink carnation had to be a painting of some sort. As it turns out, the pink carnation is a not-so-real English spy who worked against Napoleon. In fact, the pink carnation is the third in a line of English spies named after flowers who all worked in France. In modern times Harvard grad student Eloise Kelly is trying to uncover the real identity of the pink carnation, the only spy who was not unmasked by the French. She gets her opportunity when an elderly woman, a descendent of one of these flower spies, grants her access to family letter and diaries that revel the identity of the pink carnation, but have always been kept secret from the world.And so we have the secret history of the pink carnation. Is the spy the same person as the romantic Purple Gentian, a spy who poses as the collector of Egyptian objects for napoleon? Is it Amy Balcourt, a young woman whose father, a French noble, was murdered by the revolutionaries? And will Eloise Kelly even be allowed to figure the mystery out over the objections of an annoying young British noble who doesn't want her poking into his families past?In my opinion the main virtue of this book is that it's funny. All those little ironic, stupid observations that we make in the course of a normal day are written down. The characters routinely act stupid, say stupid things and get into ludicrous situations. I found the romance to be both overdone and not convincing, but in general the humor wins out and this book is fun to read, if not a masterpiece. But it's not really the kind of book written to be a masterpiece-it's the historical equivalent of chick lit or a beach read.Three stars."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"Warning: make sure that you have staked out enough of time to finish this novel before you begin this wonderful novel. It's another one of those unputdownables. Not because the books is tensely plotted, full of riveting twists and turns, but because it is one of those absolutely fun books that are a joy to read.After a dating debacle with her latest boy friend, graduate student Eliose Kelly applies for a grant to go to England do some research. Eliose is doing her doctoral thesis on British spies of the Regency period, spies like the Scarlet Pimpernel, the Purple Gentian and the Pink Carnation. And while everyone knows the identities of Scarlet Pimpernel and the Purple Gentian, the identity of the Pink Carnation has always been a mystery. And Eliose cannot find mention of him anywhere (not even the Public Records Office in Kew) except for in the tabloid-like newspapers. And so, quite desperate, she writes to the descendants of the Scarlet Pimpernel and the Purple Gentian, asking them for access to their records. She is rudely rebuffed by all except one: Mrs. Selwick-Alderly, a descendent of the Purple Gentian, invites her to tea, and obligingly enough gives her access to some letters in her possession. The letters are written by a young half-French lady, Aimee (Amy) Balcourt, a refugee of the French Revolution, who dreams of returning to France, and of helping her hero, the Purple Gentian, rout the despicable republicans who have taken over her country. Now, at lastin 1803, Amy's brother invites her to return home and to live with him. And for Amy, who has lived in rural Shropshire all these years dreaming of such an opportunity, it is a dream come true. And so, together with her favourite cousin and confidant, Jane, and a daunting chaperone, Miss Gwen, the three women cross the channel. Amy is sure that once she is in Paris, she will be able to quickly identify the English gentleman who is the Purple Gentian, and that he will gratefully accept her offer of help. But Amy is about to discover that dreams and reality are two different things, and that it might not be so easy to identify the Purple Gentian after all. And in the meantime, one must contend with that awful man, Richard Selwick, who, traitorously, seems to have no qualm about associating with the much despised republicans...I shall always be thankful that Lauren Willig took up writing! \\"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation\\" was a delightful read -- witty, humorous and loads of fun. The book is split into two subplots, one that takes place in 1803 and focuses Amy, and the other one in modern times that focuses on Eliose. Both are well done and cleverly juxtaposed so that you're left desperately wanting to know more at once -- will Amy finally realise who the Purple Gentian is? And how will Eliose's relationship with Colin Selwick ever progress beyond sniping? Engaging and deeply engrossing, I enjoyed the book thoroughly from start to finish -- there were no false notes. And I'm avidly waiting for the next Pink Carnation installment, which will, I hope, feature quiet, efficient and intelligent Jane (my favourite character). And while I hate to sound like a gushing nitwick, thank you, again Lauren Willig, for this fabulous read!"},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"At the time that this book was released, I was working at a bookstore. The bookstore included it in its recommended reading list and that, coupled with positive feedback from other people, was enough to have me picking it up (for all that it took me until a few days ago to actually get around to reading it).I am now terribly glad that I bought this book at a discount.I went in to reading the book expecting a tongue-in-cheek take on espionage during the French Revolution. Instead, I got a bodice-ripper.The book featured perhaps what is the least compelling cast that I've ever read; the heroine is insipid, the hero is ruled by what's in his pants, the supporting cast is transparent at best. The heroine is a flake - perhaps her intended characterization in the spirit of parody, but she steps well over the line between amusing and irritating. The hero is remarkably ineffective as a spy, to the point that it's a wonder that he survived his first attempt. The supporting cast is interchangeable and frequently confused; I still can't keep straight the inner circle of the Purple Gentian, as the friends have little build-up until the climax of the book, barring the squabbling one has with the hero's sister.The characters are modern - very modern. The women are spunky and dominating to a fault (unless the plot requires otherwise), while the men exist primarily to ogle the ladies' derrieres and angst. With a costume change, the book could very easily be set in the present day.The espionage in the book is laughable: the hero is sneaking in through windows while masked and caped, only to fall over the heroine and suddenly find himself thoroughly distracted by her heaving bosom and wriggling backside. Napoleon's office is conveniently empty for the heroine to casually riffle it, and the deepest dungeon of the Ministry of Police is easily penetrated by gentry posing as cleaning women. The seduction scenes have more pages than any sort of spying and/or dramatic rescues.The romance itself is bland at best and irritating at worst. Every character has a deep love-hate relationship, unless they've moved past that to the ooey-gooey love stage. The actual sex scenes are florid and utterly clich&eacute;, transposable with virtually any book sold in the Romance section. They're also vaguely disconcerting, as the heroine at most times seems to act like a 12-year-old, a perception that isn't quite dispelled by her more physical interactions with the hero.The modern plotline interwoven with the main plotline is jarring; they switch back and forth with no real distinction, so you aren't quite certain which you're reading until you get to a name. The modern heroine behaves as though she's the main heroine transported to the present day: ineffectual and falling all over herself with self-thwarted lust. It's terribly difficult to believe that she's a doctoral candidate (written by a doctoral candidate!).Had this book been marketed as romance and released as a mass-market paperback, I probably wouldn't have been terribly disappointed; it'd make a decent beach book of the bodice-ripper type. Given its marketing and its release as a hardcover and trade paperback, though, I feel almost betrayed; I expected so much more, so having it turn out to be that beach bodice-ripper further soured my perceptions of it. I'd recommend it as a bargain book for a one-time, fluffy reading, but even that seems to be too much. Instead, hit up the local library and pick it up with a stack of romance novels; it'll fit right in, at just the right price."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I'm sorry, I tried and I tried but I just could not finish this book. Usually, the fact that I didn't finish would preclude me from being able to write a review about it, but my failure to read it was not due to disinterest or too little time- rather, I simply got tired of having to roll my eyes after every paragraph.First of all, I absolutely adore both historical novels and romance novels, as well as witty comic novels, and if a book can combine all three, so much the better and kudos to the author. But a historical novel this was not, nor was it a witty comic novel, and it was definitely one of the poorest romance novels I've ever tried to read, considering that it sounded like it was written by a very ambitious, but inexperienced, 16 year old.Historically, this novel was a mess. The heroine's language and behavior read like a young woman in modern times ATTEMPTING to speak and act like a young woman in the early 19th century, and not knowing at all how to do so. If we compare Amy to literary characters of Amy's contemporary, I suppose she would be best equated to Pride & Prejudice's Lydia, but Amy behaves with even less charm and more recklessness than the unlovable, feckless Lydia. Willig wants her heroine to be spirited and endearing but instead Amy comes off as childish and obnoxious. I wasn't even going to comment on the sexual escapades that Willig insisted on indulging in this novel, but it really is too ridiculous to ignore. Amy's behavior would be more typical of a brazen whore or an otherwise experienced seductress, but any other respectable young woman in her position would never have behaved so. It simply was impossible to be the innocent sex kitten that Willig wants Amy to be. In Regency England, you had to be either one or the other, and if you were The Other, you were scorned and shunned.As a comic novel, this failed miserably, and it was at Willig's obvious but weak attempts at humor that most of the aforementioned eye-rolling took place. I consider myself to be a seasoned reader of British/Irish comic novels, with my tastes ranging from Austen to Fielding to Keyes to Wodehouse. I can appreciate bawdy humor as well as I can appreciate subtle witticism, and this book did not crack a single smile out of me (and it doesn't even take much, really. I'll laugh at almost anything). As for the modern-day protaganist, Eloise......just imagine me sighing heavily here. She tried. She really tried. She wanted to be Becky Bloomwood and Bridget Jones, but fell very, very flat.I really wanted to like this book. In fact, I bought it for myself instead of checking it out from the library just because from reading the description, I was sure I would like it and would want to have a copy of my own. I think with a little more fine-tuning and a little bit less of the obvious self-indulgence, Willig could write a great novel, and I really do wish her luck in the future. Maybe someday she will write a book that I can actually get through."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"Having enjoyed \\"The Scarlet Pimpernel\\" and loved it for years, I read about this book with interest. I saw much praise and looked forward to reading it. Unfortunately I was badly disappointed. If you liked Baroness Orczy's classic, be warned. This is a pale, irritating copy. I though Guy C. Clayton's attempt to use the book downright annoying, but at least it held together as a story.It's a story within a story. Eloise Kelly travels in England to pursue research regarding secret agents of the Revolutionary era, specifically the Scarlet Pimpernel and his successors, the Purple Gentian and the Pink Carnation. She is given papers relating to the latter two, by a descendent of Sir Richard Selwick, the Purple Gentian.The inset tale then unfolds. Amy Balcourt has burned to pursue a life of adventure for years, having, with her mother, escaped the French Revolution. So when her brother invites her home during the peace she jumps at the chance, accompanied by cousin Jane and chaperone Miss Gwen. They soon meet Selwick on the boat to France. There follows much burbling between Amy and Selwick from their instant attraction. The nature of Selwick's masquerade also dictates an instant antipathy, when Amy discovers he associates with Bonoparte. The tale continues through much chit chat between the pair of an allegedly witty nature. It also lurches along in great leaps of adventure that are absurd.We meet the brother involved in something nefarious with a shady Englishman who is suspected of being the Gentian. We then meet Bonoparte and Josephine at her salon and are subjected to a nonsensical scene involving him and Miss Gwen berating him. My patience, already being tried, became stretched.The further adventures of Amy defy logic and belief. She listens at doors, is let loose in the Tuilleries, finds secret papers, jumps from second storey windows nary a scratch, meets men at midnight without thought and nearly is seduced in a boat. She's a first class pain. More hair than wit. Jane was far more interesting.Danger abounds but is far too easily overcome to be taken seriously.Richard is marginally better than Amy, but as soon as he kisses her, whilst on his mission, his brains leak out and he never recovers them.This is not romantic adventure, it's a risible romp.Read the original, it's got more true adventure, suspense and romance for all its age."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I like historical fiction because it is interesting and makes me feel smart. I like chick lit because it is mindless and makes me feel less like my children are going to drive me insane. I suppose that it is *hypothetically* possible to write a combination of the two that would be funny, witty, and have the perfect balance of weight and fluff.This is not that book.Run, don't walk away from TSHOTPC. It's *terrible.* The Eloise scenes feel patched in, the historical bits are unconvincing, and the sex scenes are... well, unnecessary is one way of describing the sex scenes. Inauthentic would be another (as many other reviewers have pointed out). One thing that really irked me was the disproportionate focus on Amy, the ingenue/tramp 'heroine' of the book. The novel purports to tell the story of The Pink Carnation, yet we learn at the very end that this 'legendary' spy is actually... Amy's cousin Jane? The one who has barely been mentioned throughout the whole book? The one about whom a more interesting, though overwhelmingly Mary-Sue, book could probably be written?There is a reason why Amazon is selling this book new, in hardcover, for such a low price. I heartily dis-recommend it."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"The only surprising thing about this book is that it ever gotpublished. I was encouraged by the basic premise, but theplot was just too silly for words.There was no seamless segue between present and past; insteadthe book lurched between one period and the other. The authorwas obviously confused herself, because she didn't realise whenher Regency characters should speak and behave differently toher modern ones. Georgette Heyer is in absolutely no danger ofbeing knocked from her pedestal as Queen of Regency romances.And poor Richard Selwick wouldn't have lasted two minutes in theband of the Scarlet Pimpernel - a more unfocused and ridiculousspy is hard to imagine. If he hadn't got himself killed on hisfirst mission with Sir Percy Blakeney, he would have been sentpacking as soon as the band returned to Dover.As for Amy - was she really twenty, or only twelve? A stupid,spoilt and childish brat with no charm or accomplishments toredeem her petulant and pouting behaviour. I was only sorrythat she didn't meet her end at the hands of the dastardlyFrench police.I skimmed most of this book, because it really wasn't worththe effort it took to read slowly.One star for trying - but Ms Willig shouldn't give up her dayjob."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I was very excited about this book when I read the review. I loved the Scarlet Pimpernel when I was a teenager and thought this would be a wonderful adventure set in the times of Napoleon. What an exciting time to set a romance / historical spy story.However, this is just about the worse book I have read in a very long time. The story line is predictable and character developement is disappointing at best.For example, the twentieth century Eloise is obviously an intelligent woman who has attended Harvard. But the only witty \\"discussions\\" with the \\"hero\\" Colin involves a frustrated stamping of her foot and such great facial expressions of wrinkling noses and other sophisticated methods of communication to get her point across. If she never faced diffcult and challenging situations at Harvard, she never learned from them.And, amazingly enough, that is the only way the Napoleonic heroin Amy can seem to communicate as well. (We've come a long way, baby.) And the hero of Purple Gentian is too busy imagining himself jumping out of faux brandy barrels hidden in warehouses and cleverly addressing the French with witty verbal put downs and sword play to actually do anything of that sort.This is the first protagonist I have read that has a better imagination than mine.I have not yet finished this book and do not think I can. I keep on giving it a chance (over two weeks now) but I am giving up on it."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"After reading glowing reviews and an article about the author, I bought this book to take on a trip. Who doesn't love a light read on the plane? This one is so light, there is nothing there. Couldn't put it down? Couldn't finish it, is more like it. Half way through I skipped to the end. Unbelievably predictable and inane, it's insulting to the reader in it's stupidity. However, if this were cleaned up a tiny bit, it might be good reading for an 11 year old. Reader, save some money, go buy a second-hand paperback romance. If the author is any indication of what is coming out of our institutions of higher learning, we can expect more smart people cashing in on the the little guy and girl, using the same-old same-old. The author sounds smart and interesting, to bad she's using her skills to produce formulaic drivel. The historical background of this book is geared for the type of reader who only reads the first paragraph of any story in the newspaper. That's not you! Get out there and find something better!"},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"This is froth at its best, built on a strong foundation of intelligence and wit. There is enough history to count as having eaten your vegetables before you dive into the dessert. (Not that history is a bad thing, how else could we have costume drama.) Enough so that if you're caught reading this in the dentist's office by someone you want to think of you as intelligent you won't look too bad."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"This was a wonderful book that I absolutely couldn't put down. The characters were fun and the plot was wonderful. I gave it and the sequel to my best friend who also loved them. Can't wait for the next two!"},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"My sister-in-law gave me this book to read while we are at the beach, and I could not put it down.Basically the book is split into two parts: In present day time, Eloise Kelly is trying to complete a dissertation on the spies the Scarlet Pimpernel and the Purple Gentian. She also wants to uncover truth about one spy who had never been unmasked, the Pink Carnation. As Eloise reads the papers/diaries/letters/etc. of these men, we are taken back in time so we can experience everything first-hand.Luckily, I had not read anything about the book before I started it, so I did not have any preconceived ideas about the book. I did not expect it to be a fully historical book about the Scarlet Pimpernel or that time period, and thank goodness it wasn't. Wouldn't that have been boring! Instead we have romance, danger, espionage, adventure, and more. As stated in the title, it was definitely a page turner (as were her second and third books in this series--I am eagerly awaiting the fourth). So, if you want boring historical fiction, read something else, but if you want adventure, read this book!"},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"Lauren Willig is all about mixing the genres on mystery, historical fiction and romance. I actually read the second book (The Masque of the Black Tulip) first and only liked it so-so. However, this first one is much better. The author makes the mixing of genres work in this book, where she didn't in the other. The romance wasn't too ridiculous, the characters fun and likable, the historical context appropriate (though ONLY the context is non-fiction, the story is entirely made up) and the mystery remain an undercurrent in the book without the other pieces taking over. Willig remembers each piece of book (romance, mystery and history) and balances them well."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I found this book to be witty, funny and tongue in cheek at times. If you are a strict scholar of the period, you may think that some things are improper. However, this book is a romance novel! One with honestly a lot less smut than current Harlequins. It was a kindler, gentler time period where women and men did not consort together without chaparones. Add in the espionage, and it is a wonderful romance two fold: you are left wondering who you would like to be most, rambunctious Amy, who wants very much to be a spy and restore the monarchy in France or Eloise, a graduate student, attracted to the Hero and Heroine's relation, several generations removed. Oh how I wish I had read the classics! To spar with words and mythical references would be divine! The author's first book is quite well written and very fun to read. I had a hard time putting it down. It was a nice vacation from other books I have been reading of late. So intriguing that I had to get the second book to read as well and am thoroughly pleased to see that her third has been released. This book has it all, intrigue, romance, flirtation, chivalry... everything a woman secretly wants in real life, but doesn't get!"},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I do not often write reviews, but after finished reading the Secret History of the Pink Carnation, I was compellet to say that it was a joy from start to finish. The plot was fresh, the writing witty, and the humor light. The author does a great job weaving the past the present together. I could not put this book down! Can't wait to read the next instalment. Cheers!"},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"The best I can say of this book is that I finished it. I wouldn't call it genre-bending. I'd call it basic and poorly executed farce. Good farce requires characters that bumble thru life because they're quintessential bumblers. Or they're accomplished people to whom accidents happen (think Richard Lester's Three Musketeers). In this novel, we're expected to believe that the characters are both accomplished AND bumblers. And it just doesn't work. The heroine of the main story is 20 years old, well-versed in classical languages, able to converse intelligently about ancient cultures with an expert antiquarian, and brought up in a social class and era with strict behavioral conventions, yet she behaves like a late 20th-century American 14-year old with no inhibitions and, disastrously to the quality of the novel, no common sense. The hero is worse. This 30-year-old scholar/swashbuckler and experienced rakehell behaves like a 16-year-old adolescent with galloping hormones and no discretion. The characters aren't even two-dimensional, let alone three. The author has clearly read everything from Baroness Orczy to Georgette Heyer to Elizabeth Peters and has learned nothing from any of them about making absurdity plausible."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"This book is a fun read - if you are willing to play along and ignore all the historical inaccuracies. Although the setting (Napoloenic France) was obviously well researched, the characterizations were not. I really have a hard time believing that a paragon of propriety such as Miss Gwen would have poked Napoleon with her parasol and lectured him for subjugating Italy. I also doubt that many well-bred ladies of the time period (Amy) would become so \\"friendly\\" with a masked man in a boat - even if the masked man was one of the greatest spies of the generation. The dialogue is also hopelessly modern.That said, I really did enjoy this book. It was romantic and the story - though predictable - was easy to get caught up in."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I was fortunate enough to snag an advance copy of this wonderful novel. Willig is truly a gifted writer, masterfully weaving her own historical expertise into a gripping and romantic storyline that will appeal to anyone craving adventure. This is a fabulously entertaining read, and one of the most delightful novels I have come across in some time."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"As for the title of this review, it's not a far stretch to imagine Willig's Delaroche (the dastardly French police deputy commish whatever) saying this, given the utterly laughable dialogue printed on every page of this book.I like historical fiction, and I'd be dishonest if I didn't state that for the first 100 pages or so, this novel drew me in -- it starts off energetically and seemed to be moving along quite merrily. But soon after, it plummeted in my estimation to become one of the worst books I've ever read. The characters, as has been stated before, are modern, and the stated \\"premise\\" of this book is fundamentally dishonest, since it turns out to be nothing more than a bodice-ripper romance that just happens to be set in Napoleon's France. The sex scenes are excruciating and repetitive, what with endless mentions of Lord Richard's piercing green eyes and Amy Balcourt's heaving bosom and dark curls.I merely skimmed the last 20 pages rather than read them, all the better to place this book on the dollar-bargain table at work and out of my sight all the more quickly. Not recommended, unless you like wasting your own time."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"What fun! May the flowers never cease to bloom! I can hardly wait for \\"The Betrayal of the Blood Lily.\\""},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I bought this book to read as a between-books read. It was light and campy, without too much depth. Like sherbet that is used to cleanse ones palate, The Pink Carnation was able to clear my mind of more serious books. Ms. Willig did a nice job blending history and romance. Graduate student, Eloise Kelly, stumbles upon 19th century papers revealing links to the Pink Carnation - a famed spy - and his possible identity. The story is told from two timeframes - the present which is narrated by Eloise and the past which is narrated by Amy Balcourt (a 15 year old caught up in all the spy drama). I am not a fan of romance novels; however, I found this one to be an enjoyable read. I recommend to those who like historical romances or anyone looking for something light and fun to read."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I loved the direction Lauren Willig took this novel. It was like reading two books in one- a historical and a contemporary romance. Yet it still managed to blend seamlessly throughout the entire novel. It was actually one of the better romance novels by an unknown author [to me] that I have read recently. She is definitely an author that I will pick up again."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"Lauren Willig is a good story-teller who caught my attention and kept it throughout this book. This is an easy read and since I haven't read a great number of books with the same plot devices, I though it was clever and refreshing. The mixture of genres (historical romance and chick-lit) works well in this book. It may not be the great historical novel, but it certainly was entertaining. The contemporary part of the story that has the beginning relationship between Eloise and Colin is not very well developed, but then, this is part of a series; so I'll keep reading."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"If you're looking for something fun to read that will hold your attention, you've come to the right place...or rather, right book. No, it's not exactly a great literary work of historical fiction, but reading isn't just about literary value, it's about entertainment as well.Willig has taken some liberties with dates and names (as she explains in the historical notes at the end of the novel), and the main characters are fictional. Despite that, it still remains fairly historically accurate, although the heroine and her companions do some things that ladies of the time would very likely not have done. If you can look past that and just enjoy the book, you'll have a lot of fun with this one.The novel has elements of a number of genres - romance, adventure, and mystery, to name a few - so there's more or less something for everyone. I knew the whole time I was reading it how predictable it was, but Willig actually surprised me in the end by proving me wrong with a twist or two.Even though I know it was a little bit silly, and not exactly serious, I can't wait to read the next book in the series. I think these books are a great way for someone a little weary of the great literature that they love to take a break and escape, while also keeping some of the elements they look for in a book."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I adore this series. Next to Elizabeth Peters' Amelia Peabody and Vickie Bliss series, it is my favorite. Pure unadulterated fun. I can hardly wait for the new book to come out the end of this month. I'm pre-ordering it tonight."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I picked this book for a local book club and LOVED IT. It was a light read, and easy to follow with simple yet lifelike characters. The transition from modern day into the past lives of the main characters was well written. Everyone who read it really did like it. It wasn't something that drained from you, but left you with the hope of romance. Of course anything set in the time period and dealing with spies was enough for me. A great enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I think I first saw this book back a while, on a table with nonficton and thought it really was a history of the pink carnation. I came back to it in a roundabout way, having just read Tasha Alexander's ONLY TO DECEIVE. Reading Amazon reviews of that book, I found this one. A nice find.So...instead of horticultural history, we have a frolicsome history of aristocratic spying by the British against the French in the pre-war and (presumably - as the series continues) Napoleonic war periods. Dashing dandies disguising themselves in order to seduce secrets from the French and SAVE ENGLAND.One such dashing gentleman is Lord Richard Selwicke, who tangles with Amy Balcourt. Amy - half English and half French - has spent her childhood learning everything she can which will help her to return to France and avenge her noble father's death at the hands of the revolutionaries. A very forceful and romantic miss, Amy has all sorts of plans for dramatic derring-do, especially joining up with the Pink Gentian - a spy in the style of the Scarlet Pimpernel.Amy and Lord Richard meet on a packet bound for Calais during the brief Peace of Amiens and immediately fall into the sort of bickering relationship well known and loved by readers of this sort of fiction. Unbeknownst to Amy, Lord Richard is in fact the daring Purple Gentian and is returning to France to help prevent a suspected invasion of England. And so the game begins....What is most enjoyable about Willig's writing are her characters. Both Richard's and Amy's families and friends are well drawn and witty. The action is just short of farcical, and humor abounds. As Willig is a Ph.D candidate in history at Harvard, I think we are safe in assuming the accuracy of her history. However, have no fear of dry facts, or even those dense paragraphs you may often choose to skim in other historical fiction. Instead, settle in by the fire with a cup of tea (or glass of wine) and enjoy."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I don't have much to add to the many reviews already written, except to point out that Willig is not trying to write a formula romance novel or historical fiction. She combines the ever so popular today, Chick-Lit with classical historical themes and the romance novel.This is a wonderful page turner & I plan to read all of the pink carnation novels Willig will turn out."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation is a historical \\"what if\\" novel dealing with the Scarlet Pimpernel. The book assumes Sir Percy to be a real man and constructs a world of spies around him, all with names as floral and outlandish as his own. If you love history and buckling swashes, you'll enjoy this book. It interchanges with a modern story as well of researcher Eloise Kelly and her own struggles as a scholar and a single woman."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"(This was based off of the audio version.)While this book has received mix reviews, I thought it was a pretty interesting story. Although it is far from a true history of the era or culture, and read a bit more like a historical romance, I enjoyed the escape factor. Since I tend to be an easily distracted reader and listener, the two stories (past and future) were fine for me. In fact, I appreciated being jerked back into the present from time to time, to be reminded that this is a diary we're being privileged to look into, and not a history book! Some of the encounters between Amy and Richard/The Purple Gentian were a bit far-fetched, and steamy at times, which wouldn't be exactly accurate. However, in keeping with the idea that this is a diary, and about a supposed female SPY, I figured it was meant to delve into the non-standard for the time. Spies don't necessarily live by every strict code of the culture they live in, right?While the book had me confused in a few places, and not following the how, where, and why of the espionage, I still was entertained and enjoyed the story. The book does contain two pretty surprising sex scenes that honestly had me reaching for the volume on my radio to turn it down for fear someone would hear! I know. I sound silly, but they took me a bit by surprise. On the whole, I would say that the novel was a fun romp through history, but in a very fictitious way. I enjoyed the story, but wouldn't turn to it for any sense of true history or the culture of that time period."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"This book marries the \\"chick lit\\" genre with historical fiction - my two favorites. As with any \\"chick lit\\" book, you know you're not in for a novel worthy of a Nobel Prize in literature. However, I still found it light & entertaining. And toward the end, I couldn't put it down. To me, that's plenty to keep me entertained.A few historical accuracies I question, particularly in relation to authentic period dialect. And the racy parts rival a Harlequin series romance novel, which I hate, but in the context of a book with a plot that is much more thoughtful, the book redeems itself.Overall, I found it entertaining & have continued reading on in the series."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I don't understand why this book has gotten some bad reviews, like Lauren Willig I am a student and when I was tired of studying for finals I read this book. Finals are over next week and then I'm going to start the Masque of the Black Tulip. My in laws bought the Deception of the Emerald Ring for my birthday so during Christmas break I'll have lots to read! I agree this book is a page turner! Since I am part of a Marston clan and Marston is such an English name I loved that Willig chose it for one her characters and then paired it with a French name. I thought it especially approprate because the first Marston came to England from France in 1066. I think that Willig did an excellent job in switching between Amy and Eloise. I've read Jane Austen and Baroness Orczy, but I certainly wouldn't pick them up for an afternoon of light reading to take my mind off of exams! I am a huge history buff ( I started out majoring in history in college and then changed to accounting because I don't want to teach) so I know something of history, and I have to say I'm not reading this book to be educated, but to be entertained, and it has certainly done that! I would say to Lauren Willig keep writing such delightfully entertaining books and I will keep buying them!"},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"This reads like something a present-day 17-year-old might have written. I suppose as a light-weight, fairly brainless, romantic throw-away novel, it's okay, but I mainly found the characters to be unbelievable, unsympathetic and annoying. The historical aspects are so badly done as to be ridiculous. A young woman in 1803 who acted as Amy does would have been looked on as a trollop, to put it nicely, and the hero, Lord Richard, who claims to love her, would rightly have been considered a cad or worse. The dialogue and characterizations often struck me as anachronistic they're so wrong for the time period. If you like Jane Austin or the Brontes, stay away from this."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"This is basically a romance novel. I agree with many of the other reviewers who said the mystery is transparent and that the writing is full of anachronisms . . . and yet I thought this book was great fun. Richard is pretty sexy, and while there were lots of heaving bosoms the characters did manage to get some action in among all that swooning. The modern subplot is unrealized - I was a little let down by the way she ended the modern part of the story with a thud, to be continued in the next book, presumably. I would really like to read more about Jane, whom I agree was the most interesting and mysterious character (and I wouldn't be surprised if Miss Gwen has a few surprises up her sleeve, as well).I read this over a couple of hours while stuck in bed with a cold, so perhaps I was primed to be amused. I didn't have high expectations, either, but I still enjoyed the book and was sorry when it ended. (I'm planning to borrow the next in the series from the library rather than spend money on it, however)."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"When I first picked up this book, I read about two pages and didn't keep going. Out of boredom a few months later, I returned to this historical novel and realized how much I was missing. There are two stories interlaced, that of Eloise, a modern grad student living in England writing a dissertation, and that of Amy, a fiery and spirited girl who decides to take fate into her own hands. Amy and the supporting characters were very well developed and lots of fun to read about, made of sterner stuff than most of the characters found in similar literature. While Eloise's story was not as well-developed, her story (and perhaps a developing relationship with Colin) are upcoming in the sequel to this book, as is a story about Hen, the younger sister of Richard (the love interest of Amy). It sounds confusing but these characters have such texture that you soon feel as if you know them all. This is a book of several genres: mystery, romance, comedy, historical...while it may upset some readers that the book is not historically accurate, the author goes over those facts she took the artistic liberty of changing...and really the point of reading (in most cases) is entertainment anyway, right?I would definitely recommend this book to any reader looking for great action, great romance and some good fun."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"Like many others, this book grabbed my intention because it promised a rollicking good adventure in the vein of the Scarlet Pimpernel. What I got was a pretty good adventure, some romance, and several trashy romance novel scenes thrown in, seemingly for good measure.The story is framed by the narrative of Eloise Kelly, an American grad student researching in England to try and unmask the Pink Carnation. She goes through the personal papers of the Selwick-Alderly family and uncovers the story of Amy Balcourt, a spirited 19th century Frenchwoman living in England who dreams of avenging her parents' deaths by attempting daring rescues a la her heroes, the Scarlet Pimpernel and the Purple Gentian. She convinces her cousin, Jane, along with their chaperone Miss Gwen travel to France to visit her brother, but she secretly hopes to join the Gentian's league of rescuers. Along the way, Amy meets Lord Richard Selwick, the charming, booksmart aristocrat who is secretly the Purple Gentian. Their relationship basically reflects that of the relationship between Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy. Neither one seems to like the other, but of course love is bubbling underneath. Adventures, mishaps, and romantic misunderstandings ensue, and the Purple Gentian finds himself with a rival: the aforementioned Pink Carnation (who isn't who you might guess right off the bat).Overall, this book had a great premise. The mere mention of the Scarlet Pimpernel in the book jacket description was enough to get me to read it and there is a good amount of adventure and intrigue. Unfortunately, Miss Willig saddles the reader with possibly THE most annoying heroine ever conceived: Amy Balcourt. While well intentioned and yes, young, Amy nevertheless comes across as a little brat. Lord Richard Selwick, by contrast, is nearly as fantastic a character Sir Percy/the Pimpernel. He's intelligent, cunning, romantic, and all around dashing--you have to wonder why he falls head over heels in love with Amy. But, he does. And the ensuing scenes the author inserts are a touch graphic, but nothing shocking (though they are rather badly written).Despite these criticisms, it is an enjoyable novel. I am definitely going to pick up the sequel when it comes out in December, and apparently the film rights have been optioned for this book. I hope Miss Willig will continue to write books like this, but with a few adjustments here and there."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I'm always excited for a historical novel with a female lead, so I was very excited to start this book. However, I found it laughingly predictable (the cover gives away the secret), and I found the characters to be one dimensional. Napoleon is a cliched, noisy, little man, Amy is an obnoxious, perky, heroine who acts like she lives in the 21st century. For those of you who know the term \\"Mary-Sue\\" it applies here.For all the \\"research\\" done about historical events and places, Willig forgot to look into manners and social customs. She attempts a Jane Austen tone but fails.I was expecting historical fiction along the lines of Magaret George and got a tawdry romance novel."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I really wanted to like this book, and I did for about the first half. Towards the end the story just became too unbelievable. It seemed as though the characters were fully modern individuals who just happened to be wearing period clothing. The so called spies were as inconspicuous as an elephant in a china shop. The very end up of the book was really the last straw for me, it was incredibly cheesy and predictable, and worst of all entirely implausible.The dual storyline of the modern Eloise had potential, but never went anywhere and was therefore unnecessary and didn't flow with the \\"historical\\" (I use the term loosely in regards to this book) storyline."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"When I picked up this book at Target I was sooo excited to find another historical fiction novel to read especially for my upcoming vacation. After reading the first two chapters, I was completely annoyed and utterly disappointed. First, the author's descriptions were overly exaggerated and just overly done. For example, you didn't find out how old some of the characters were until the end of the book so I thought the Purple Genitian was in his 40s the whole time. Character's physical features were constantly repeated. I know he has blond hair, enough already! Some descriptions could have been left out or could have been written in a smoother way. Characters did not have any depth and their introductions to the reader were very sporadic. The underlining historial facts were tossed around and seemed much more like fill-ins rather than as progressions of what I thought the story was supposed to be about. Point of views were confusing. The author went from third person to first person in one chapter that was supposed to be written in first person. It was a mess. Lastly, this novel should have been in the Romance section for it was moderately graphic. The author definitely needs fine tuning. All in all, this novel was not what I had expected and I wish I had borrowed it rather than bought it. The title should have been something to the point of \\"Love Between Two Spies\\". If you want a smooth read, I do not recommend this book...especially for vacations."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"Having had an affection for all things Scarlet Pimpernel and other swashbuckling adventures from the 18th century and early 19th century, I was looking foward to this book. The author's style of writing is light and enjoyable to read. I am currently coveting her skill with witty dialogue. However, I was disappointed that it was basically a 'bodice ripper' in disguise. The 'hero' pawed the 'herione' like a piece of cattle on the auction block. It really disgusted me that she had no more shame except to lounge back, convienently revealing more of her chest and saying \\"Oh!\\" in an insipid tone. Not only disgusting, but I found her lack of protest historically inaccurate. No self-respecting, average, well-bred girl of that era was going to flutter her eyelashes as Muscle Man drooled over her cleavage and various other parts of her anatomy. Ahem. Sorry if that was vulgar, but as you can tell I thought those scenes were rather tasteless. Other than that, it was a delightful read. Because of aforementioned parts, however, I'm not sure that I'll be seeking out the sequel the author is supposedly working on."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I really, REALLY, loved the idea of the book! It reminded me a lot of the book Posession by A.S Byatt. I found it interesting how she pulled off writing the contemporary portion in the 1st person which set it off from the third person historical story. The story was rather funny and now that I have read it and have read the other reviews I can see why many people believe it really should have been for a younger reading group. I still think it was a very good book for a first time author and many parts of the story had me laughing.The things I didn't like about the book.1) The price - I really wish I didn't have to spend $20.00 to read this book - I will probably purchase the next book used if I decide to read it. - Obviously this is not the authors fault.2) The hero and heroine both drove me a bit crazy. I didn't find Amy smart at all - obviously Jane was the brains behind everything. and even the hero of the story was a bit stupid - I mean how could he have not been caught for years? He returns from England after a fortnight and pulls off a jail break that very night - how could he not be suspected as being a spy? Very stupid. I think the main characters were two stupid people that had smart people picking up the pieces for them. My god even when Amy tries to get The Purple Gentian out of the interrogation room - it is his mother that is the one who breaks in with the gun to rescue her son - Amy is too busy showing her assets to the guards.3) I wish that she would have ended the book with a bit more about Eloise and Colin - she leaves you hanging on which may or may not be a good thing - since follow up books usually take a year or so to be published it will be interesting to see how many people will still be intrigued with the story to pick the next one up.After finishing the book - I will admit if the next one was available I would have picked it up and continued to read - but 2 days after finishing the book I am no longer invested in the characters and really am not sure if I would spend $20.00 for the sequel but perhaps wait for it to come out in paperback."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I write this in the odd situation of having enjoyed the novel but being able to understand why other people gave it one star. I'll just try to be helpful enough to allow the potential reader to decide if they would enjoy it. I am willing to forgive a lot in a book that made me laugh out loud.The negatives first: The weakest part of the novel are the Regency-era male and female leads. What the Stolidiaries website calls \\"Random Acts of Heavy Petting and Smuttage\\" (I will have to remember that phrase!) demolishes the credibility of this pair. If Richard Selwick was the best British spy, the United States would be the last bastion of the English language. Even given the somewhat farcical nature of the story, he is truly incompetent, unable to keep his mind on his very dangerous and delicate job in the presence of a female. Any self-respecting femme fatale would reject Selwick as offering no challenge. As R. McCoy commented in the review of February 18, 2006, the story can be a farce either because the main character is a bumbler or because he/she is an unlucky adept, but not both.If the average romance writer (or is it the editors?) was redoing Pride & Prejudice, Lydia Bennet Wickham would be the heroine. But of course, one doesn't want the heroine to come off as a reckless, selfish fool. So Amy Balcourt takes her place in the lengthening line of Regency heroines who are not so much impulsive as clueless. They don't ignore their era's norms of propriety, morality and modesty as much as grow up in complete and unlikely ignorance of them. Woman usually were Out in Society around the age of 17; at 20, Amy is implausibly childish.O.K., so what made me enjoy the book anyway, in addition to finding it funny? Well, other than Richard and Amy, I enjoyed most of the characters, and that is very important to me in a novel. Further, I enjoyed their interactions: Richard's family and the relationship between Amy and Jane. It is unusual for an author to be able to do justice to two such different characters. There is a satisfying amount of swashbuckling and adventure.Some people did not like the frame of a modern day researcher. The book could have been done successfully with or without it, but I enjoyed it. It was sometimes jarring since one leapt from one time frame to another without notice. \\"Colin?\\", I would be thinking, \\"Who is Colin?\\", before realizing that the book had returned to the modern era. I thought the potential modern romance was handled much more credibly than its Regency counterpart. I hate it when authors substitute bickering for plot, but there was a nice balance here of conflicting purposes and attraction."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"Normally I'm a very lenient reviewer, but i gave this book only three stars because it doesn't live up to its potential.This is a fun light hearted book - the humour is good and the difficult switching between two time periods had been done with ease that surprised me! But the characters ended up remaining two dimensional - especially the two main ones. It ended up being more of a romance between two main characters than the actual mystery regarding Pink Carnation. And romance is a mild word - I can think of more words - none of them appropriate for a review...But at the end of the day - I'm not averse to reading more books from the series (not immediately though) and I guess that must account for something! It is a good beach read and a good introduction to the series - no more."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"This is my first foray into \\"Chick Lit.\\" I really enjoyed this book and found the characters interesting and the writing witty and entertaining.

If any of you ever read \\"The Scarlet Pimpernal\\" or even saw the movie with Jane Seymour and Anthony Andrews and loved the plot, you will love these books. The whole series is wonderful and I am starting with \\"The Pink Carnation.\\" again. I stopped at \\"Deception of the Emerald Ring\\" because of other books that I really wanted to read but now I am back to the whole series. Many of you should try the book.

It was very well written and I love Amy and Richard. :]I didn't really like the whole thing with having two stories in one, I wish it was just Amy and Richard's story instead of having Elosie in the present day but other than that it was a very enjoyable read. Recommended"},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I nearly stopped reading this novel after the first 50 or so pages--too much minutia and characters that were seemingly not worth knowing or caring about. However, I'm very glad that I persisted because I found the most appealing man in Sir Richard with his galant charm and quick wit, not to mention his heroic pursuits in defense of his beloved Mother-England. But he is so addictively charming and Willig is masterful at creating a sensual romance between he and Amy that is a MUST READ EXPERIENCE. I wish he were in more novels so I could enjoy him again and again!"},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"Perhaps my disappointment is my own fault. The jacket blurb is fabulous, the cover captivating, the premise intriguing. I waited weeks to have enough to time to curl up on the sofa and read this book. I made it to page 55 (at page 22 I decided to force myself to get to page 100-not going to happen though, I just can't do it.).I thought I was getting a fabulous historical novel, but it reads like every other Regency era romance I avoid. Amy and Richard have the exact same modern voice as Eloise.(modern people in old-fashioned clothes) Over and over again I read how intelligent and educated Richard is, but when he speaks, acts, thinks, I don't see it. (For example -pg 43: \\"Richard, using his brilliant powers of deduction, was quickly able to conclude that this chaperone fell into the second type [of chaperone's].\\" How on earth did he spy on Bonapart when it took all his mental capacity to decided on the personality of a spinster? Amy is sterotypically impulsive and thoughtless. I don't see why these two would even look at each other twice.Added to all of the above, I found some of the prose convoluted and messy. If I have to read a sentence three or four times to get the meaning, it's to long! However, the writer has great wit and several times I laughed out loud at her clever phrasing.Don't buy this book unless you like Regency stories. This is not trully a 'historical' by any stretch of the imagination."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I'm not a great reader of modern romance novels, but I do have a weakness for those old swashbuckler romances like \\"The Prisoner of Zenda\\" and the H. Rider Haggard novels. Oddly, I had never read \\"The Scarlet Pimpernel\\", which this book uses as a jumping-off point, but if you liked any of the books mentioned so far, you'll love \\"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation\\".Eloise Kelly is an American grad student in London, working on her dissertation on Napoleonic-era spies (or, \\"Why I Love Men in Masks\\"). She's a great character, feisty, funny and tad sarcastic. With the help of some family papers, she sets out to discover the true identity of the Pink Carnation, the only spy never unmasked. Hindering her effects is Colin, a handsome Englishman who wants to protect his family secrets.Rapidly paced and well written, \\"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation\\" alternates between Eloise's modern-day narration and the story of Amy Balcourt, a 19th-century girl whose father died on the Guillotine. With characters like Napoleon, Josephine and other actual personalities, the reader gets a painless history lesson along with a great read."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I just finished this book and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The prose is witty, smart, and clever, the plot is fun and the romance is sublime.In essence, this is a romance novel, so anyone out there who is looking for something more dense or cerebral than a regency romance should bypass this book. But for those of us who enjoy a great romance but don't want to read the same old, same old, this is the perfect novel to savor. It's certainly superior to most historical romances currently on the market, especially in terms of Lauren Willig's writing talent and pitch-perfect her ear for dialogue. This book is what romance novels should be-- truly funny, obviously well-researched, and a pleasure to read-- but so rarely are."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"The 19th Century has just dawned, Napolian is the scurge of Europe and 20 year old English lady, Amy has the unconventional dream of joining the daring Purple Genitian as he rescues French Aristocracy, spies for England and in general bedevils the French. Amy soon comes to realize her dreams, wading though mistaken identities, harrowing adventures and passionate embraces to find true love. Wittily written, this debut novel is at its heart a light romantic romp with a gimmick.The gimmick is wrapping the historical romance inside the tale of a modern day doctorial candidate's quest for a historical document that will reveal the identitie of the Purple Gentian and the Pink Carnation. The modern bits, which are few and far between (roughly 10% of the novel) allow some wiry post-feminist observation and a claim to the title chick lit. It also serves to set up an eventually romance (several books out, no doubt) with a decedent of the title character who with the utmost reluctance shares the family papers that contain all of the answers.I expect most of the very harsh reviews are from people expected a more meaty and realistic historical tale. One can be forgiven for expecting a more learned book from a cover that crows about the author being a doctorial candidate in history at Harvard, no less. Forget the author's credentials, because she is certainly not putting her learning on display in this book. The world presented is very simplistic. The English are the good guys, the rebels who overthrow the French Royalty are bad, French Aristocracy is good, and Napoleon's military advances came out of the blue, having nothing to do with Europe's aggressive hostility towards post revolutionary France. In other words, don't to expect to learn anything real about the politics of the time period or even read historically accurate speech.But if you can sit back and enjoy the ride, you won't be disappointed.Recommended for fans of Romances, particular funny one and readers able to put aside any expectations of historical accuracy.A Note on my ratings: I give 3 stars to a book that I consider a good read for fans of the genre. I pay good money for books and I expect an average book to deliver a pleasurable read. I reserve 4 stars for the best a genre has to offer and 5 stars for amazing books that cross all genre lines to become a must read for nearly all."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I enjoyed reading this, it was truly refreshing and well written."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I'm really tired of the Bridget Jones/Nanny Diaries contemporary novel, so I was nervous to read this book with the modern frame.

Well, it was mindless. Willig had a good idea in spoofing The Scarlet Pimpernel books. Unfortunately she ruined that idea when she created two of the most idiotic, insipid heroines to grace the pages of a book that does not have half naked people embracing on the cover.Our modern day heroine, we're supposed to believe, is a PHD candidate at Harvard, writing her dissertation on the Scalet Pimpernel and similar heros of the French Revolution. Not only does she appear not to have read the book, but she only seems interested in the subject the way a bored housewife would be interested in a romance novel. Desperate to discover the true identity of the Pink Carnation (a forgotten member of the league) she convenietly finds a pile of correspondance that reveals just that. As soon as we read the first letter any reader with two brain cells to rub together knows the identity of the Pink Carnation (though it takes our Ivy League heroine about 300 pages to figure it out).Of course 50% of he book takes place during Napoleon's era, and our plucky heroine there is equally dimwitted. She and the hero (who of course is masked in the begining!) have numerous missunderstandings (amidst several masked makeout sessions) but still manage to live happily ever after (naturally).Don't get me wrong- predictable can be fine if it's entertaining. But any opportunity for humor is lost in the complete implasibility of everything that happens. That leaves this book nothing more than a missed opportunity for a fun (and even *gasp* clever) parody."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"I give the author props for an original premise. We are shown the English country side, the streets of Paris, abandoned manor passages, and the late Napolean's court as a backdrop in the story. The idea of overthrowing empires via espianoge and intrigue always makes for an enticing read.However...It seems like this novel was written as a guilty pleasure for Ms. Willig while pursuing her double degrees at Harvard. Although at times fun and intriguing, the reader is left short handed. The hero and heroine in the story do not really fall in love as their mutual attraction is more based on witty expressions and sexual urges. The heros and villains in the story are not very bright and the whole concept of how the Pink Carnation came about is highly unoriginal. For example, the characters who come up with the idea of making the Pink Carnation talk about the concept as if it were a game and then become giddy like little children. There's nothing more a reader can do but roll their eyes.This book does succeed, however, as a side distraction. Engaging settings and comical moments. But for Napolean fans and historical puritans out there, don't get your hopes up."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","review":"Eloise Kelly is doing research in London for her dissertation on the impact spies had on events during the turbulent reign of Napoleon Bonaparte.

After numerous, unproductive phone calls, she finds Arabella Selwick-Alderly, the current resident of Selwick Hall. The elderly woman gives her unfettered access to the family's papers. Immediately as a reader, you are taken back to the end to 1798, at the cusp of a new century in England, where tensions are high between France and England. Amy Balcourt had been sent to England as a young girl to live with her aunt and uncle for her safety. Her father however is killed by uprisings in France. As a young woman, Amy is determined to go back and join the infamous Purple Gentian league and fight the injustice. Along the way, Amy, however falls in love with Lord Richard Selwick, also known as the Purple Gentian. Sometimes, the story loses its luster with Amy not figuring out right away that Richard was the Purple Gentian, and his mother's involvement in rescuing him from the police at the end. Though she was interesting, I was at times disappointed to come back to Eloise in the 21st century having gotten caught up in the thrill of this historical romance."},{"Title":"The Red, Red Roadster","review":"This item was listed as a hardcover book.

There's really nothing indicating she's a courtesan beside the fact that she just says so.It is beyond me why this book was condemned because of \\"immoral and unsuitable for public consumption\\".

It is an expository gem, a model of lucid argumentation and writing. I recommend PtL highly."},{"Title":"A preface to logic (Meridian books)","review":"Although Cohen was unrivaled in contemporary American philosophy for the diversity of the subjects with which he occupied himself, it is from logic that he draws the basic principles that enable him to survey so wide a domain with such a unity of view. Early in life, through the study of Russell's Principles of Mathematics, he became convinced of the reality of abstract or mathematical relations. That pure mathematics asserts only logical implications and that such logical implications or relations cannot be identified with either psychological or physical events, but are involved as determinants of both, seemed to him to offer a well-grounded and fruitful starting point for philosophy. It at once ruled out for him the empiricism of Mill, since relations if they exist in the mind only cannot connect things external to the mind; it also ruled out for him the Hegelian effort to locate relations in an absolute totality that is beyond human understanding and therefore of no explanatory value. On the positive side the doctrine, since it constitutes a ground for the procedures of scientific method generally, permitted him to take full advantage of the remarkable developments of modern scientific thought. It led him also to return to what constituted the concern of classical philosophy before it became preoccupied with the problem of knowledge--mathematics, physics, biology, psychology, ethics, law, art, and religion. In philosophy proper it enabled him in the course of his extensive writings to raise almost every metaphysical question of importance and it re sulted in the composition of his book Reason and Nature, one of the few inexhaustible philosophical volumes written in America.When the second edition of Russell's Principles of Mathematics appeared in 1938 Russell pointed out that the Pythagorean numerology\\". . . has misled mathematicians and the Board of Education down to the present day. Consequently, to say that numbers are sym bols which mean nothing appears as a horrible form of atheism. At the time when I wrote the Principles, I shared with Frege a belief in the Platonic reality of numbers, which, in my imagina tion, peopled the timeless realm of Being. It was a comforting faith, which I later abandoned with regret.\\"Many of the disciples, however, refused to give up the faith and have busily defended the doctrines of the first edition against those of the second. Cohen long before the appearance of the second edition had detected this shift in Russell's thought. He remarked that with the publication of the Principles Russell became his Allah, and that Mohammed has kept the faith even though Allah himself has perhaps somewhat departed from it. Perhaps no more bitter controversy has been engendered in the mathematico-logical field than the dispute touched upon briefly by Russell in the passage quoted above. \\"What is all this frog-and-mouse battle among the mathematicians about?\\" even Einstein paused to ask. Its ramifications were extensive, and the militancy of contemporary logical positivism is current evidence that the questions still evoke strong partisanship.Cohen in the present volume pays his respects once again to this and numerous other controversial matters, related more to the metaphysical foundations of logic than to the traditional technical themes. Logic, for him the most general of all the sciences, attempts to isolate the elements or operations common to all of them. From this it follows that the laws of logic have no contraries which possess meaning or are applicable to any possible determinate object, a condition which is not true of the special sciences, the systems of which have contraries which are abstractly possible. Cohen's view is that the distinctive subject matter of logic is formal truth, that such truth is concerned with the implication, consistency or necessary connection between objects asserted in propositions, the relations generally expressed by if--then necessarily. This conception of the subject matter of logic, although it is an accurate description of the basic content of the classical Aristotelian logic, has many assailants. In fact it is argued today, so unsettled is the whole matter, that there is no ground for asserting that logic has any subject matter.Against such a delimitation of the subject matter of formal logic as that attempted by Cohen the objection is offered that it is a deduction from a particular philosophy, and that the field of logic should not be determined by such partial considerations. Cohen's position avowedly is an expression of his philosophy of logical realism. But since his conception of logic can be deduced from many philosophies, although not all the interpretations which Cohen puts upon the various logical doctrines can be so deduced, the validity of the conception should be judged by other considerations. If a true philosopher is one who has grounds for his belief, then Cohen assuredly, in the present case, qualifies for that distinction; however, since a true conclusion can follow from a false premise his understanding of logic is not undermined by a disproof of his philosophy. The argument that there is no ground in the present condition of logical knowledge to hold that logic has a distinctive subject matter, is an admonition of caution, and as such undoubtedly has merit. But in the absence of the construction of a non-Aristotelian logic, in which the contraries of the principles of contradiction and excluded middle are assumed to be true, and from which valid inferences can be drawn, we may assume that logical truths have been discovered, and that their study is the subject matter of logic.Notwithstanding the fact that Cohen's emphasis is upon the abstract qualities of logic, he has always been careful to disassociate himself from logical positivism, which maintains that formal logic deals with linguistic expressions without any reference to sense or meaning. This attitude of the logical positivists is a development of Hubert's formalism, according to which mathematics is a game played according to simple, definite rules with meaningless marks on paper. Mathematics is held to be comparable to a game of chess. It is said that chess players do not ask what a particular game \\"means,\\" although at some future day the game may acquire a meaning, if it should be interpreted in terms of law, economics or religion. However, the analogy is not strictly accurate, since today the result of a game of chess may mean that A is better than or equal to B in chess playing ability. In his application of Hubert's idea to logical inference Carnap uses the example of meaningless symbols: From \\"Pirots karulize elastically\\" and \\"A is a Pirot,\\" we can infer that \\"A karulizes elatically,\\" without knowing the meaning of the three words or the sense of the three sentences. Cohen denies that this is so. He points out that Carnap admits these are sentences only because we assume that \\"Pirots\\" is a substantive, \\"karulizes\\" is a verb (both of these terms being plural in the first sentence and singular in the others) and \\"elastically\\" is an adverb describing a way in which a process takes place.\\"These expressions [Cohen writes] are therefore not entirely meaningless as would be undiluted gibberish. If instead of \\"Pirots\\" we put \\"the members of any class of objects\\" and instead of \\"karulize elastically\\" we put \\"are members of another class\\" we have as an inference that \\"a member of the first class is necessarily a member of the second class.\\" And this I submit is the actual meaning which Professor Carnap's example suggests to anyone to whom the inference seems a valid one. This statement applies to all possible objects irrespective of any of their specific or differential traits but assuredly is not therefore entirely meaningless.\\"But is this Carnap's point? His position in fact is, that in order to determine whether or not one sentence is a consequence of another, no reference need be made to the meaning of the sentences; it is sufficient that the syntactical design of the sentences be given. Cohen seems to admit this when he grants that \\"A karulizes elastically\\" follows from the premises. Before he made that concession, surely it was not necessary for him to translate the nonsense words of Carnap's syllogism into his own meaningful sentences. Although Carnap's position is not answered by a demonstration that if a certain consequence is deducible from the manipulation of sentences possessing only a syntactical meaning, then a meaning otherwise than syntactical can be read into the sentences, it does point the way to the principal defect of the positivistic logic. All that Carnap says may be true, but we are still faced with the problem of giving language a material application. It is of the essence of language from the point of view of science that it communicate meaning with respect to matters which are true or false. If we start with, \\"If X, then Y,\\" the problem is to arrive at, \\"If Socrates, then mortal,\\" and not, \\"If Socrates, then immortal.\\" If Carnap's conclusion that logic is nothing but syntax were true, logic would lose its scientific significance. Professor Carnap's effort to meet this problem through his method of ostensive definition reveals the real difficulties of his position.Cohen's importance in contemporary thought is due as much to his application of the methods of science to problems of human existence as to his technical contributions to philosophy. Since Hegel he and Jordan were the only philosophers of standing who concerned themselves extensively with the problems of the legal ordering of society. Thus he rejects altogether the view that since science can deal only with the facts of existence, judgments of what ought to be are so arbitrary that no science of norms is possible. He insists that the essence of science consists of the formulation of hypotheses based upon the best available knowledge and anticipating new situations which can be experimentally tested so that greater determination can be achieved. He maintains that this procedure is open to ethics. An ethical system, he argues, can achieve the status of a scientific system if adequate hypotheses as to what is good or bad, or what is necessary in order to achieve certain ends, are developed. This position seems unassailable as far as it goes, but does it answer the real difficulty? It disposes of those who maintain that facts are the starting point of inquiry; but what of those who admit that facts are the ends to be achieved by inquiry, and who still deny the possibility of a science of ethics on the ground of the complexity of the subject matter or that of the ultimate irrelevance of ethical judgments to life on this earth? The hypothetico-deductive system has yielded extra ordinary knowledge of the physical world; but that process has been successful, in part at least, because of the ability of the physicist to simplify and deal only with ideal entities. Where the scientist has not been able to simplify he has failed, as in cancer research. We do not know if the method of simplification, i.e., the pursuit of the implications or effects of one single aspect or factor of a situation, is available in ethical inquiry in any significant sense, since the nature of human conduct may be such that it will not yield to that technique. Furthermore, since we see no ground for such action we do not today pass judgment on the goodness or badness of the universe, the evil ness of volcanic eruptions, or the practice of slavery among the ants. Whatever our preferences may be, Cohen's argument does not negative the possibility that ethical judgments of human conduct may be just as irrelevant as evaluations of the physical universe. This argument does not foreclose the possibility of a technology of ethics founded on unsystematized preferences and ends, in which normative judgments to that extent possess relevance. But a science of ethics demands as a prerequisite a determinate system, a condition which the complexities of conduct may make impossible.Cohen's present volume is devoted, as can be seen from the foregoing, to an analysis of problems lying on the borderlines of logic, and not with the customary subject matter of the usual treatises. Since his writing is distinguished by an admirable clarity, his argument can be followed with ease by the intelligent reader. All the topics which he discusses are the subject of radical inquiry in philosophical circles. They embrace such matters as the nature of propositions, the theory of meaning and implication, the overlap of logical classes, fictions, the statistical view of nature, logic and the world order and a chapter on probability which is a valuable supplement to the discussion of the same topic in Reason and Nature. These topics may seem innocuous, but they harbor questions the analysis of which has led within recent years to actual assassination, and the framers of political programs have found it expedient to take official notice of them. As a whole the volume is one of the best existing statements in the field of logic of the point of view of that branch of American philosophy which deals with its subject matter through the methods of science."},{"Title":"JUST ANOTHER GEORGIA ROMANCE","review":"When I read Just Another Georgia Romance, there was not one moment I did not realize - with all of the gushy verbiage, tainted memories, and heated embraces - that I was deep into a steamer.

It is written in an extremely lucid and direct manner, and it is more of an introduction to the art, or process, of philosophising rather than to philosophy itself as a discipline. In this book existential philosophy, the brand of philosophy so successfuly cultivated by Jaspers, is described, so to speak, &quot;from inside&quot;. There is hardly any analysis of philosophical terms, but rather a presentation of the inner process of approach to the metaphysical questions confronting the individual person. Jaspers belongs to the great idealist tradition, initiated by Plato, developed further by the medieval schoolmen, and lastly by Immanuel Kant, Friedrich Schelling, Soeren Kirekegaard and others. According to Jaspers the core-meaning of man's identity is his sense of freedom. Freedom is presented as an immediate datum of consciousness, as that part of man's personality which &quot;evades all object knowledge but is always present in him as a potentiality&quot;. Irrespective of what is omitted, this book offers a subject-matter of impeccable honesty and undiluted spirituality. This is a great book superbly well written.

While science is the measurable analysis and empirical observation, philosophy is the direction behind such, the idea of why we are learning the what. This is very much like Plato's Meno, where Socrates and Meno decide that virtue is beyond knowledge and is instead the direction of opinion, or as Jaspers calls it &quot;nonknowledge.&quot;On page 127, Jaspers writes:&quot;By technically applying my knowledge I can act outwardly but nonknowledge makes possible an inner action by which I transform myself. This is another and deeper kind of thought; it is not detached from being and oriented toward an object but is a process of my innermost self, in which though and being become identical. Measured by outward, technical power, this thought of inner action is as nothing, it is no applied knowledge that can be possessed, it cannot be fashioned according to plan and purpose; it is an authentic illumination and growth into being.&quot;Philosophy must reside in uncertainty, waywardness towards the unknown, never absolute like science. On page 129,&quot;Philosophy must even leave the possibility of full communication in uncertainty, though it lives by faith in communication and stakes everything on communication. We can believe in it but not know it. To believe that we possess it is to have lost it.&quot;We must have philosophy to direct our science (virtue) and remove us froe scientific superstition and we must have science to have substance to our philosophy and remove us from philosophical superstition.Pages 159-160:&quot;Any philosopher who is not trained in a scientific discipline and who fails to keep his scientific interests constantly alive will inevitably bungle and stumble and mistake uncritical rough drafts for definitive knowledge. Unless an idea is submitted to the coldly dispassionate test of scientific inquiry, it is rapidly consumed in the fire of emotions and passions, or else it withers into a dry and narrow fanaticism . . . rejecting superstitious belief in science as well as contempt of science, philosophy grants its unconditional recognition to modern science.&quot;Jasper ends his book with a short outline on the major thinkers and writers in philosophy and our personal decision of who to study to build up our knowledge. But can virtue be taught? He endorses what an old counsel to study Plato and Kant since they cover all the essentials. An overall good read, a substantial subject in a modern society devoid of substance and profound meaning.&quot;Today independence seems to be silently disappearing beneath the inundation of all life by the typical, the habitual, the unquestioned commonplace.&quot; - 1954, KARL JASPERS, Way to Wisdom, An Introduction to Philosophy, p. 110"},{"Title":"Way to Wisdom: An Introduction to Philosophy","review":"Here is a short work on philosophical thought, that although condensed, and compact, still manages to explore and lay out, alot of food for thought that touches on alot of philosophical ground.

However much like the Kee Bird herself, Mr. Hoffman's book failed to clear the runway and fly the reader to a satisfying landing. After the Kee Bird tale the author lapsed into a meandering style as he wrote of hohum tell-me-about-yourself visits with vintage aircraft collectors and relatively mundane (cf. the Kee Bird) aircraft recovery ops. Additionally, as noted by another reviewer, if you are a student of vintage aircraft you already know of the Hoffman tales via PBS, Discovey, and aeronautical periodicals."},{"Title":"Hunting Warbirds: The Obsessive Quest for the Lost Aircraft of World War II","review":"&quot;Hunting Warbirds&quot; primarily relates the story of the location and extraction of an RB-29 lost in Greenland in 1947. As a story about modern archaeology it's fairly interesting, as a story about warbirds and collectors, it's superficial. Other reviewers have clearly outlined the rambling nature of the prose: we go from Greenland, to the States for an interview with a &quot;unique&quot; collector (that doesn't really shed insight into Warbird Enthusiasts, except to say that some are obsessed. Anyone's who's been to a gaming or Star Trek convention can observe the same behaviors in the minority of attendees), back to Greenland. But as I said above, &quot;Who's the audience here?&quot; One of the concepts I was taught in my undergrad days was to write to the knowledge base of the target audience. Mr Hoffman, seems to have ignored this advice in this work. His NUMEROUS inaccuracies regarding WW2 aircraft, and aviation are enough to put off aviation enthusiasts, (the logical target audience) while the narrow scope of the book would discourage general readers. The inaccuracies themselves always leave that &quot;what else is missing, misquoted or just plain wrong here?&quot; notion in the back of your mind. This is frankly surprising since his resume includes &quot;Air &amp; Space&quot; and &quot;Smithsonian&quot; magazines. Finally, a better book would have at least summarized the efforts in Finland, Germany, and Russia to recover some of their warbirds from WW2. Operations that in ethnocentric America, don't get their deserved attention. If you are an aviation or WW2 aircraft enthusiast, you already know this story-the book offers no addtional insight-certainly none into WW2 salvage as a whole. If you have a slight interest in the subject matter, the documentaries about the salvage operation are a better medium."},{"Title":"Hunting Warbirds: The Obsessive Quest for the Lost Aircraft of World War II","review":"Piston-engined aircraft of WWII are among the most fascinating and important artifacts of the 20th century, part of some of the most intriguing history of war and humanity that affected millions directly and indirectly. It is not surprising that they evoke passion and obsession.This book attempts to describe the passion and obsession, but its disjointed, episodic and disintegrated form works against it and the technical errors are annoying. Reviewer Collins (see his review) correctly identifies the core problem: the author does not seem to have considered his audience(s). If he's writing for knowledgeable aviation enthusiasts, his lack of depth, poor research and many errors are a turnoff. If he's writing for non-flyers, he doesn't provide enough background information on the many wonderful flight museums and collectors around the world to frame the subject adequately (his superficiality about, say, Kermit Weeks, is a huge disappointment, as just one glaring example). If he's writing for readers who enjoy literature, his lack of polish is a disappointment--much of the book reads like a first draft. It seems that Hoffman's approach to flying is skewed to the gee-whiz and away from the magnificent, mysterious realities of aviation.Offering credentials like AIR &amp; SPACE and SMITHSONIAN doesn't induce confidence in the reader. Both these publications often use materials from staff or stringers that are deeply disappointing and too often read like the work of somewhat talented amateurs, matched by editorial positions that seem to be issued--without justification--ex cathedra. If Hoffman had written for AVIATION WEEK or FLIGHT JOURNAL one could be sure of its quality.If some genuinely competent pilot-writer could approach this subject--someone like, say, Walter Boyne or Richard Bach--it would result in an important historical document with breadth, depth and authenticity. Such a work is urgently needed.

The more you know, the less you liked it. Despite his childhood interest in WWII aircraft, Mr. Hoffman is no expert in the field. If he were the numerous mistakes that slipped into the narrative wouldn't be there. (A small army of editors is cited in the acknowledgements, don't they know anything about this either?) What mistakes, you ask? Warbird collector David Tallichet is repeatedly refered to as &quot;Davis Tallichet.&quot; B-17's were powered by nine cylinder engines, not 18 cylinder engines as Mr. Hoffman repeatedly states. The CAF reenactment of Pearl Harbor does not feature &quot;Betty&quot; bombers, they were twin-engine, land based aircraft. The CAF B-17, &quot;Sentimental Journey&quot; is based in Mesa, Arizona, not Tuscon. I may be picking nits here but errors of fact, no matter how insignificant, detract from the overall veracity of a text. Those of us fortunate enough to be involved in the warbird movement will spot them a mile away. Despite the numerous mistakes, I enjoyed Hunting Warbirds.

Unfortunately for the author of this book about collecting and preserving warbirds, a lot of the readers already know a lot about the subject and are quick to note his errors. Mr. Hoffman is a capable enough writer, but his knowledge of World War II aircraft is limited at best. He has been extraordinarily lucky in that he has been allowed to enter the world of the warbird collector and was paid to do so. Sadly, his enthusiasm is that of the professional magazine writer: get some facts, cobble them together with some character sketches, get it published and then move on to something else. The book has the feel of an extended magazine article as the chapters bounce back and forth between the efforts to recover a B-29 from Greenland and other warbird collecting stories. It's one long article on the B-29 and a series of short articles, none of which are particularly satisfying. I won't belabor the errors in nomenclature or descriptions of the warbirds other than to say that they are annoying to anyone who really does know the subject. This was a nice try, but the topic of collecting and preserving historic aircraft deserves better.

I'm not talking about the deserted, frozen shores of Greenland, but the inner sanctum of the realm of warbird salvage. Living here are wealthy collectors, skilled restorers and daring pilots, each with a unique perspective and inner driving force. It's a small world that those of who attend airshows and read \\"Air Classics\\" don't often get to see in detail. Hoffman walked in their ranks and absorbed enough of their passion to coherently relate it. He lived though the same privations and fed off the same energy that keeps those die-hard warbird salvors working 18 hours a day, seven days a week at a remote recovery site. For me, it was a rare view of a world I will never be privileged to experience. Some reviewers have criticized Hoffman for technical errors. I suppose they are valid critiques, but I really think they miss the point. The book is more about the people than the planes. Though you certainly can't separate the planes from the warbird fanatics, Hoffman gives us a sense of what makes those guys tick. I for one enjoyed the hell out of it. Given the look we get, only the most techno-pedantic could fail to forgive the author for a few errors. That said, I hold back one star because so much more could have been included.

I guess, to me, the book transcends aviation - it's just an exciting story."},{"Title":"Hunting Warbirds: The Obsessive Quest for the Lost Aircraft of World War II","review":"Although some of us might be a bit obsessive about aircraft and World War II and might question that interest, Carl Hoffman clearly delivered an impressive account of the search and discovery process thru the eyes of many dedicated individuals. He presents the stories well; readers almost feel we are right there. It's a terrific book worth reading!"},{"Title":"Hunting Warbirds: The Obsessive Quest for the Lost Aircraft of World War II","review":"If you've ever seen the Nova one hour special on the recovery of the RB-29 Kee Bird, then you know the story of 1/2 of this book. I will give the author his due - even if you have seen the special, author Hoffman writes a very compelling, exciting tale of the obsessive quest to recover a vintage aircraft. The Kee Bird story is very interesting and worthy of a book.The book does capture some details about other hunts for WW2 planes, but not in enough detail. I thought more time should be spent on other searchs than just the Kee Bird. Only one or two sentences given to recovering a P-38 from under 250 feet of ice (see The Lost Squadron an excellent book). Only passing mention of the recovery efforts of the planes in the Pacific or other places.Hoffman has aviation experience, but spends a lot of time trying to explain why the obsession to own or restore these old planes develops. Nostagial, memories of a simpler time? Sure, but he is dead wrong when he says nothing else captures the imagination than a WW2 plane. I have a very keen interest in Armor, Aviation and the Navy/Marines. In the future, there will be a passion for jets and anything else out there. I know a lawyer who collects seats from farm tractors - talk about obscure!If Hoffman wanted to tell just the story about the B-29 Kee Bird, then he should have done that. If he wanted to tell about how many people are obsessed, their actions and collections, then he should have done that. This is a blur of both. Good reading, worth a borrow from library or pick up somehwere."},{"Title":"Hunting Warbirds: The Obsessive Quest for the Lost Aircraft of World War II","review":"I think this book was terriffic. Of course there are going to be some mistakes in the technical areas of the planes...the author never claimes to be an expert of every part of every plane that is covered...get over it. The book lets everyone have a small taste of a hobby (or addiction) that isn't available to eveyr person. I'd love to own a ME109, but can't. I like to read about the salvage and saving of these wonderful machines, and I think this book does a marvelous job of doing that. If you are reading to get a 110% account of airplane facts, buy a manual. If you want a story of a dying part of American history and culture, read this book."},{"Title":"Hunting Warbirds: The Obsessive Quest for the Lost Aircraft of World War II","review":"Having already known about this project from a past NOVA special I was quite interested to read &quot;the rest of the story&quot;about this group of characters and how they came to together.It occured to me there's no degree or guidelines to go by only a true passion and determination to recover these obscure bits of history.Virtualy risking everything each and every time,even life itself with no regret,for a machine? Why? I could only compare it to the Harley phenomena.Why a seemingly stable group of people could be so normal and then the phone rings and it's &quot;Show Time&quot;.Anywhere Anytime.Very few countries militaries could match the agility and resouresfulness(with virtually no budget)of this band of merrymen.These are the real Indiana Jones's of our time with Gary Larkins leading the pack.With todays continent hoping ,interneting,etc.etc. it's nice to know someone's still out there in the jungles of Borneo pushing back the snakes to the vast artic wastelands in search of the &quot;Holy Grail&quot;.Truely the author has given us a rare and intiment look into the lives and experiences of a rare breed.After having read(in one sitting I might add)I now have a much better understanding of what being a &quot;Warbird Fanatic &quot; is all about."},{"Title":"Hunting Warbirds: The Obsessive Quest for the Lost Aircraft of World War II","review":"I was pleased with this book. It was an enjoyable introduction to a world I had no knowledge of. The author is clearly as fascinated with the people he met as with the airplanes themselves. The result is a story I could read as well as a history I could appreciate. I may not become an expert on vintage aircraft because of this book, but I know I'll appreciate my next visit to the Air and Space Museum all the more because of it."},{"Title":"Hunting Warbirds: The Obsessive Quest for the Lost Aircraft of World War II","review":"I have been interested in aviation archeology for a while now. This book has answered a few of the questions I couldn't find my self. It is highly entertaining and very educational. I have trouble setting this down sometimes."},{"Title":"Hunting Warbirds: The Obsessive Quest for the Lost Aircraft of World War II","review":"I bought this for my father because he's always loved planes and he likes any books about planes. But I am probably going to have to get another copy because I started reading the story of the Kee Bird and couldn't put the book down. It's a real adventure, and I'm halfway through and can't believe what just happened with the plane. (Anyone who's read it knows what I'm talking about!) I am really hoping Gary and Darryl get things to work out -- but whatever happens, I am amazed that the author could make planes so incredibly fascinating. And all the strange people who are so in love with them that they'll risk life and limb just to bring back a piece. It reminds me of the Perfect Storm: a book I didn't think was my thing, but: incredible story, great writing, perfect gift."},{"Title":"Hunting Warbirds: The Obsessive Quest for the Lost Aircraft of World War II","review":"Hunting Warbirds is a rare treat: a book that reads like a taught thriller, yet is a well researched work of nonfiction. It takes the reader all over the planet in search of rare World War II airplanes, accompanying a few [fool]hardy folks trying to move these huge, broken objects from the tundra to collectors in the States. I have never been interested in wars, and usually find those who are a collossal bore, but I could not put this book down. Hoffman manages to make the old planes seem like soldiers themselves, and the quest to find and refurbish them becomes a way to honor the last war we all agreed was just. This is more than a book about airplanes or war; it is an excellent study of the interconnection between people and our machines."},{"Title":"Hunting Warbirds: The Obsessive Quest for the Lost Aircraft of World War II","review":"I thought this a great book. It seems that a new generation of writers that often publish in the outdoors magazines like Backpacker or Outside are discovering the WW II eccentrics who are well known to us, their sons and nephews, as being the aviators and mechanics of the past who won the air war over Japan and Germany. As a helicopter pilot in the Vietnam War, these men were our former mentors and role models. We went where we were sent and didn't question the duty or the reality of it all. Later, after finishing my tour in the Army, I flew the bush in Alaska, and this book reminded me of my early days on the North Slope, flying a Bell Jet Ranger with a seismic crew in the Colville River Delta. I was the furthest west chopper pilot during those spring months of 1969, and about the third youngest Army pilot to arrive on this edge of the Arctic Ocean. We flew around Prudhoe Bay and astonished many of the old bush pilots with our know-how and amount of flight time at such a young age. The B-29 story made me reminisce about those months up there, when anything could happen and did. Lot of fun and a lot of misery! Somehow, one has to go through these extremes in a swashbuckling manner to relate to these early aviation stories before GPS and much safe devices came about today. Good reading and a great young writer is Carl Hoffman."},{"Title":"Hunting Warbirds: The Obsessive Quest for the Lost Aircraft of World War II","review":"Carl Hoffman is a wonderful storyteller. He writes &quot;Hunting Warbirds&quot; in a way that gets the reader passionate about the planes, their recovery, and their history. I was in the middle of reading (for the first time) &quot;the Hobbitt&quot; by J.R.R. Tolkien when I bought this book, and &quot;Hunting Warbirds&quot; proved to be the more gripping tale. I couldn't put it down and left &quot;the Hobbitt,&quot; a wonderful page turner itsself, with it's pages unturned while I finished &quot;Warbirds.&quot; I grew up in the '70's and the '80's, knowing only modern jet fighters and maybe two or three WWII aircraft - this book prompted me to search my shelves for my airplane encyclopedias to learn about all the planes that Darryl Greenamyer and Gary Larkins go to the ends of the earth to salvage. It brings back the feeling of when I was a kid and was very excited to be reading and learning about all the different airplanes I could. Mr. Hoffman's writing leaves you with a true sense of vicarious experience in Greenland and the other places he travels. An educating and fun story - definitely worth a read!"},{"Title":"Hunting Warbirds: The Obsessive Quest for the Lost Aircraft of World War II","review":"The author obviously knows little about aircraft. This book contains many mistakes to the point of being annoying. The stories contained have been covered earlier and better in assorted aviation magazines of the past few years. If you are into airplanes, you have already read it."},{"Title":"New Latin grammar,","review":"Charles Bennett's New Latin Grammar enjoys a new incarnation in paperback. The text follows a traditional format for Latin reference grammars: phonology, morphology, syntax and prosody. Coverage is descriptive, not historical, clearly designed to answer basic questions about forms and syntax for the student who needs more than an introductory learner's text but less than a 500 page tome, detailing every possible exception.My own experience in using the book with intermediate students in school ( AP Vergil ) would suggest that there is some resistance to moving from beginners' texts, which are self-contained, to the use of a reference grammar because of the time needed to locate items in indices or tables of contents. Bennett's New Latin Grammar meets this problem of the time-pressed learner by its concision, only 250 pages of text, with a good general index to topics. Concision with accuracy is the key strength of this grammar, as Bennett himself stated in the Preface to First Edition: &quot;The object of this book is to present the essential facts of Latin grammar in a direct and simple manner, and within the smallest compass consistent with scholarly standards.&quot; This goal has been met and should be helpful in developing the habit of reference grammar use among students who have completed formal grammar lessons but who, on their own, still need to dig out unusual forms or to address less common syntactical structures. Bennett's Grammar will help less experienced Latin students climb the ladder to becoming their own best teachers in matters of syntax."},{"Title":"New Latin grammar,","review":"I am an advanced Latinist who spends some time every day studying Latin texts. The PRINTED version of Bennett's is one of the most valuable resources I own. It is concise, accurate, and complete. The most imporant features for me are the excellent Table of Contents and Index that allow me to quickly turn to exactly what I'm looking for. I would give the printed version 5 stars.The KINDLE version does not feature live links from the Table of Contents and lacks the Index all together. If I need to look up something on page 90, I have to turn the page ninety times to find it. This makes the Kindle version useless as a reference tool. I have removed it from my Kindle."},{"Title":"New Latin grammar,","review":"This grammar has been around since the early 1900's( all the best latin grammars are of this time period or earlier) and it is as good today as when it was first issued. It is the best short latin grammar available. It will not show you all the nuances of the language, like Gildersleeve's or Greenough's , but it will give you the absolute basics that you need to know to learn this complex language. The explanations are concise and to the point; and the part on syntax is also nicely done. My only complaint is that this book only comes in a paperback edition. I wish the book was available in hardcover or clothbound. Reference works of this quality should always be available in such an edition."},{"Title":"New Latin grammar,","review":"I'm very happy with this book. It's a small, easy-to-use reference. It also has useful information about the history of the language, the Roman calendar, etc., though not in incredible detail. Because of its size and ease of use, it's the first Latin book I grab when I want to learn or remember Latin syntax. I end up skimming through, invariably, because the book makes it easy and interesting to do so. It's compact, useful, well-formatted, and comfortable to use. Know that it isn't a dictionary; for that, you'd need to go elsewhere. (I'm not a Classics scholar - just a former Latin student who's still interested, occasionally active, and someone who always wants to learn and practice more... if I had the time.)"},{"Title":"New Latin grammar,","review":"Bennett's New Latin Grammar is a great book for basic reference. It goes beyond a listing of endings and forms: get grammar reference cards of you need that. But on the other hand it does not go into so much detail that you forgot why you were looking in the book in the first place. It gives just enough information for general reference purposes.This books is best for the 3rd and 4th year high-school Latin student or undergraduate who needs a reference grammar. Each grammar point gets its own section, and Bennett covers the high points in less than a page for each item. The front section is devoted to the various forms, but the section on syntax is worth the cover price alone.If at all possible, get one of the old (1961) printings of this book. The type is clearer and the binding is sturdier. But if you can't find a used copy, buy this one.Disclaimer: I have contracted with this book's publisher, but I assure you, I thought this book was great before I ever got my first dollar from the publisher. I would write the exact same review for it no matter whom I work for. I have in the past and will in the future reccomend it to anyone who asks for a quick reference grammar."},{"Title":"New Latin grammar,","review":"I'm surprised that this book is available in paperbook.

This often leads to problems reading some of the text; I wish they just could have retyped it. The grammar is fine; I've actually not delved too deep into it but it's very advanced and academic. Do not buy this book if you need something more of a general introduction or something very accessible to a non-expert (not that I am one - it was a required book from my professor). Not bad, but not great - this book was written a long time ago, and use of archaic language is pretty frequent.

I don't understand the Amazon detail pages's reference to the Bolchazy-Carducci publisher. Some of the product reviews appear to be about different items.The New Latin Grammar I got is a print-on-demand, because it is from a scanned image. This is explained on an end-paper of the book, but not explained in the Amazon detail page. The publisher's statement on the detail page continues: \\"However, the book has been generated from a scan of the original and as such we cannot guarantee that it is free from errors or contains the full content of the original. But we try our best!\\" I am not impressed by their intention to try their best. They better print a good book or they will get returns and bad product reviews. Furthermore, the Amazon detail page should advise us that the book is not even guaranteed to have the full contents of the book.But, despite the disturbing message on the end paper intended to wash the publisher's hands from responsibility for bad work, my copy is perhaps the best print-on-demand I've bought. So far, no creased spine. Nothing wrong with the paper. Clear, large, easy-to-read type. The margins are cut too small for my taste. No missing pages: I checked them all. The book was less than $10.

The book is really designed for beginners who have little knowledge (or none) and want to learn about OLAP and the OLAP tools. These basics can be found in the online help and in the MSDN articles. If you want to learn about the cool functions in MDX and how they can be used to solve some of the drill-down and data presentation problems, this is not the book for you.

There is very little in this book that you could not learn from Books Online or MSDN for free. The book is riddled with typos, grammar errors, spelling mistakes, and technical mistakes. I wonder if the editors were paid--they shouldn't have been! Don't be fooled by the &quot;Technical Reference&quot; moniker at all--it is not going to be much help to a technician, especially one who has even basic OLAP knowledge.

Author Jerry Dunn takes you through the steps of various theories of what makes up an alcoholic and the progression of this disease.

Alcoholism does not just affect the person, but affects everyone who is connected to them. Jerry explains how he, while in prison, picked up the Bible and thus began his long and hard road to recovery by explaining his path. The outcome is his sobriety and this book.

Those using AA's twelve step program may find it useful if they want a more Christian view. For those in the pit of alcoholism, I suggest his carer gets him down to an AA meeting when he shows signs of wanting help (usually at the end of a bender).

Author and Historian Dick B. first ran into this book many years ago when he was just beginning his research into the Biblical history of Alcoholics Anonymous. Dick had taken one of his books into a Christian bookstore, and the clergyman in charge handed him a copy of Jerry Dunn's book. Dick was not yet into the \\"sin\\" issues about alcoholism and early A.A. So he set the book aside. A number of years later, he shared the platform with Jerry Dunn at the First International Conference of Alcoholics Victorious in New Jersey. Jerry was along in years, but very powerful in his drunkalog and \\"testimony\\" as he called it. Impressed with Jerry, Dick was nonetheless still was focused on history more than on the applicability of our rich A.A. Christian roots to recovery today. However, Dick B. has now published 30 titles on A.A. history. And the last few have been heavily weighted in favor of examining the utility of our history in and outside of A.A. and Twelve Step Fellowships today. Recently, he was asked to conduct a four day seminar at a CityTeam Conference in Santa Cruz, California; and in preparation, he dusted off two of his \\"practitioner\\" books and dived into materials on Dr. William D. Silkworth and Jerry Dunn. He realized that both men had a strong belief in Jesus Christ. Both men had written some very practical materials on how to approach an alcoholic and what to tell the alcoholic he should do to get well. Previously, he had realized that Jerry's book was shot-through with practical views based on his years in the Word and in his own recovery and in his work helping other drunks. Today, the book has taken on a new and greater dimension for Dick and for me. I now deem this \\"God is For the Alcoholic\\" title and Jerry's work, along with that of Dr. Silkworth, to be very very valuable in overcoming the godless trend in recovery fellowships and treatment programs today. And I conclude by recommending Dunn's book highly and by pointing out that Dick B. has discussed at some length the views of Silkworth and Dunn, in terms of their applicability today. You'll find some of this in several of his recent titles. But the best and most detailed coverage is in one of his latest titles, Dick B. \\"Real Twelve Step Fellowship History: The Old School A.A. You May Not Know.\\" (Kihei, HI: Paradise Research Publications, Inc., 2006), pp. 108-114. You'll gain a great appreciation for the Jerry Dunn book when you learn how practical and spiritual its contents are to this very day."},{"Title":"God Is for the Alcoholic","review":"This book contains some great references to scripture but was clearly written from a male perspective that is not favorable to women.

Although we have always been comforting and encouraging, she is beginning to express frustration and disappointment in herself for not being able to stay dry through the night. This book was exactly what we needed.The story is about Little Bunny (LB, for short), who really wants to stay dry all night but keeps waking up wet, confused, and sad. His parents are very supportive, telling him that when his body is ready, he will stay dry. By the end of the book, he does just that.It's an adorable story, and a very sensitive treatment of the subject. My daughter was enthralled, and she smiled with delight when LB succeeded in staying dry all night.I was really touched by the sensitivity with which LB's parents handled the situation, especially when they said LB didn't need to go back to wearing diapers since, \\"We don't mind washing your sheets in the morning if you don't mind changing your pajamas in the middle of the night.\\" There was a lesson in that for me as well. After several months of doing extra laundry, I bought a package of training pants for my daughter. She was really disappointed, since she had long since graduated to big-girl underpants, but she reluctantly agreed to wear them. After reading the book to her tonight, I decided to back off on that and keep trying.I know I'm not alone in feeling helpless when my child is unable to keep herself dry at night.

Written in a breathy, ecstatic, inspirational style more appropriate to the spiritual uplift than the home remodeling literature, it's short on information, sources and resources and materials or manufacturing credits. The taste level of the lavish photo spreads varies from the sublime to the ridiculous; but in either case, even if you saw something you thought you might want to use in these pages and wanted to put a name to it, track down sources and prices ranges and assess its pluses or minuses for the particular installation you had in mind, you'd be totally out of luck. For example, if the picture you're interested in appears in the countertops chapter, don't expect Ms. Kohn to make life easy for you and identify the wall or floor materials in the same picture, including the elements that might originally have caught your eye.This book reiterates the usual design and materials platitudes (\\"Balance is the key to beauty as well as budget!\\"; and: \\"A discarded Warning sign can take on new meaning and become a work of art..\\") providing unnecessary and maddeningly useless filler for both the pretty and the not so pretty photographs.I've read a lot of bathroom design books in the course of planning my next bathroom makeover. They run the gamut from bad to outstanding, and Ms. Kohn's is certainly not the worst; but it's so highly typical of the genre that I think it's worth both the time and trouble it's taken to write this, admittedly, jaundiced review, in hopes that future publishers might take note and current consumers proceed with caution."},{"Title":"Joan Kohn's It's Your Bed and Bath: Hundreds of Beautiful Design Ideas","review":"Well, this would be a great book for my mom or grandmother, but as a young homeowner I am a bit dissapointed in the dated styles.

This is about the most useful book, in terms of daily use, that you could ever own on HTML. I give it 4 stars because of two problems:- The tags are ordered alphabetically, which is good. But it would have been better if tags had a &quot;related tags&quot; item that listed tags that are relevant to the given tag. For example, &lt;TABLE&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt; makes no mention of &lt;TR&gt;&lt;/TR&gt; and &lt;TD&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;... I realise that this is a reference and not a textbook, but it would add to the usefulness of this book immensely.- Insufficient (close to none) information on styles. It would help a lot to make this reference self-contained, if each with each tag, there was a very brief description of the style components that control its look.The character entity table is very useful, if incomplete. The colour chart is a nice and useful addition.All in all, this is a VERY useful book. Get it and stop carrying around those heavy HTML tomes... My criticism is just meant for improving the next edition... (hint, hint, ... )"},{"Title":"HTML Pocket Reference","review":"This book is the functional equivalent of those &quot;quick reference cards&quot; that come with software manuals. You won't learn HTML from it, but that's not really the point; the point is to look up information you know exists, but can't reasonably keep in your head.For example, this book lists all HTML tags in alphabetical order, rather than grouping them functionally (except as almost an afterthought) - not really useful if you have no idea what tag to use in a given situation, but useful if you need to know what attributes you can specify for a tag and what browsers support those attributes. And it excels when you're analyzing the HTML structure of an existing page and you run across a tag you don't know or have never seen used in quite the way you're seeing it used.Combine this with a complete list of character entities (&quot;&amp;&quot; characters), decimal to hex conversions and colors by name, and put it all in a small, thin volume you can keep in your briefcase without having to make room for it, and you have a pretty useful reference. Four stars for being what it sets out to be; not as a substitute for a more comprehensive HTML book."},{"Title":"HTML Pocket Reference","review":"This book is essentially just an alphabetical list of most of the HTML tags and attributes. Each is explained briefly and the browsers that support each tag are listed. At the end of the book is a list of &quot;tag groups&quot; that group functionally related tags, a list of character entities, and a table of colors. If you're very familiar with HTML and just need this listing of tags and attributes, this is the book for you!If you're not an HTML expert, however, this book might be more confusing that helpful. For example, if you want to center some text but you don't want to use the deprecated &lt;center&gt; tag, you need to know which tag to look up. There are few examples, so if you want to add a Java applet to a page, you need to already know what to put in the &lt;object&gt; tag. There's no description of the &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; tag that all HTML 4 compliant web pages need. Much of the HTML in the book is not XHTML compliant. Although the book claims to cover every tag in HTML 4, there are some that it leaves out. And the only web site the book refers to is yet another alphabetical list of tags.If you already know HTML well and have a good HTML reference book, this book will allow you to quickly look up information tags and attributes. But if you're not an expert and want to write good, clean HTML 4 compliant markup, save your money."},{"Title":"HTML Pocket Reference","review":"After being disappointed with the 1st edition of this book, I was looking forward to the 2nd edition, which I expected to be much improved. The new edition does contain improvements in some areas, but also has regressed in others.For example, the book is updated for IE 6, but is missing information on which tags are supported in IE 5. New information on character entities was added, but all information on color names was removed. Tags missing from the 1st edition were added, but now the &lt;img&gt; tag is missing. Most disappointing is the fact that most of the errata and suggestions sent to O'Reilly on the 1st edition were ignored when creating the 2nd edition.The end result is that the 2nd edition is no more helpful than the 1st. The book contains most of the information that experienced web designers need to write HTML, but you will need a more comprehensive book handy to look up information that is missing or inaccurate. If the book were updated according to the suggestions on the O'Reilly site and many examples added, it would be far more useful on its own."},{"Title":"HTML Pocket Reference","review":"Since 1994 I've been writing HTML code occasionally for my collection of websites.

That is all there is to it.This is a small compact reference book (hence the title) which lists the HTML tags in alphabetical order, shows if they are supported by the three major browsers (IE,NN,Opera) and if they are part of the w3c spec HTML 4.01. Information is given for the applicable attributes for each tag.Once you know it (especially if you follow w3c standards) HTML is a simple and easy language to use.. however, having a easy to use reference comes in handy quite frequently, especially when starting up a new site.This will not be the only reference you need.. no book can claim that. Though everybody who designs websites should have this book, those new to HTML may find it the most helpful most frequently. However, this book will NOT teach you HTML.

A quick check shows that they have fixed some, but not all, of the errata (http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/htmlpr2/errata/).But this book is still totally worth having. It's small enough to leave lying around the desktop, where its big brother (Definitive Guide) would get in the way (not to mention distort gravity from its sheer mass).

The reason I hunted down this book is because Hemingway said it was the best book he ever read about Africa. I figured he would know.I enjoyed this book immensely. Baker describes his explorations, hunting expeditions, and encounters with the natives in experiences that now can only be dreamed about. He talks about his extensive hunting trips with the Hamram Arabs, who hunted elephants with swords from horseback. He tells about traveling hundreds of miles on the backs of camels, and about rescuing one pack camel that had fallen off the side of a cliff by wrapping ropes around it and lowering it to the bottom of the canyon. Even much of the day to day camp life is very interesting, as the party had to provide for all of their needs for themselves.It is worth noting, that apparently modern readers must be somewhat put off by a supposed tone of superiority. One reviewer indicates this way, and in the version I have, the publisher actually attempts a vague apology on the back of the book. I didn't notice anything in Sir Samuel Baker's tone, but if someone can read this book and not conclude from the narrative that Baker actually is superior to the vast majority of mortals, they must have a better imagination than I do.One of the most interesting aspects of Baker's explorations is that he had his wife, Lady Florence, with him the entire time. One of my favorite stories is about a night when he was awakened by a gentle tug on his sleeve, which was always his wife's signal that something was wrong. Without rolling over he reached under his cot and got his rifle first, and then his wife indicated that a hyena had just stuck it's head in the door of the tent. He waited a few minutes, and when the hyena took another look, he dispatched it there in the tent in the middle of the night.If you like to read about Africa, or about exploration, hunting, or high adventure, I think you will enjoy this book very much."},{"Title":"The Nile Tributaries of Abyssinia","review":"The book was a great description of the exploration of Africa during the late 19th century. It was somewhat hard to \\"get-in-to\\", by sometimes spending too much time on descriptions of less important issues and too detailed regarding some personal issues, particularly in the early parts of the adventure. Baker seemed to pat himself on the back quite often.As the story progresses, my interest grew and by the end, I wished that the book had gone farther with Baker's explorations. As a hunter myself and by today's standards, I was somewhat \\"taken-aback\\" by what seemed to be just too much \\"sport killing\\" of animals, however, one must remember it was a different time and place.Overall, the book rates 4 stars for it's history, content, and for putting a face on one the great and difficult explorations of the time."},{"Title":"Drive Right","review":"This text is one of two TX state approved books.

Imagine my surprise and dismay when I discovered that it didn't actually cover version 10.1! I immediately called the publisher to complain, and to my delight, they sent me a CD-ROM containing an entire 10.1 PDF update to the book. What started out as a bummer worked out to my advantage in the end, and now I've got the supremely portable (10.1) edition. Hopefully they'll integrate this stuff into a future printing (which would earn it a &quot;5&quot;). In the meantime, I can attest that Lon Poole hasn't lost a step in his lucid, thorough treatment of the latest rev of the latest Mac OS. Thanks again, Lon!"},{"Title":"Macworld Mac OS X Bible","review":"Lon Poole has been writing computer books for quite a long time. A quick search on Amazon shows 33 titles with his name on the cover, with some titles dating back to the Apple II and Atari 400 (!) days. Dennis Cohen, while not quite as prolific as Poole, has a substantial amount of computer writing experience. He also has spent time as a professional Macintosh programmer.The MacWorld Mac OS X Bible clearly shows the years of writing experience at work here. It is a solid, well-crafted, and readable manual that covers Macintosh OS X 10.1. Be forewarned that it is not the be-all and end-all reference manual for aspiring Unix geeks. That market is better served by Mac OS X Unleashed.The MacWorld Mac OS X Bible (hereafter referred to as Mac OS X Bible) is targeted at those who are upgrading to OS X, as well as those new to the Mac OS. Poole and Cohen present the material with a logical flow, discussing Mac OS X concepts, features, and tips. Most of the OS X material is followed with a compare-and-contrast with OS 9, so upgraders will be able to see how OS X differs from OS 9. I found this approach useful, as my mind works better by knowing how the new is different from the old, rather than just being told what's new.Poole and Cohen cover the expected material; OS X basics, the Aqua user interface, Internet setup, how to use the included OS X applications, etc. This is familiar ground that every OS X book covers (or should cover). The author duo presents this information in a steady, workmanlike fashion. I did not learn anything new that other OS X titles had not covered. There is only so much one can write about Sherlock, and every book says much the same things. But the writing style is clear and easy to follow.Part III: Beyond the Basics is the best part of this 779 page tome. The authors strike a good balance between too-simple and too-complex in their presentation of more advanced OS X concepts. Again, it is important to note that the target readership is beginner to intermediate level Macintosh users. Mac OS X Bible is not going to tell you much about using the included Apache web server to administer your personal web site. Nor is there a down and dirty how-to for advanced Terminal use.But that's not the point. Most readers of this book want end-user information, not Unix administrator information. And that's what they get. The authors do a good job of covering User accounts and privileges, local area networks, and the various methods of sharing files (Web sharing, FTP, and remote login). It's the right mix of detail for the home or small-business Mac user who wants to do something, but who does not need the amount of detail that a professional administrator does.Apple released OS X 10.2 (Jaguar) last month. Is this book (and review) obsolete? Not at all. It will take several months before the Jaguar books hit the shelves. Even then, the fundamentals of Max OS X will not have changed. MacWorld Mac OS X Bible is still very useful, even if you are using 10.2.MacWorld Mac OS X Bible is a worthwhile competitor in the fight to be the best all-around OS X manualMacMice Rating: 4 out of 5------------------------------------------------------------------------David Weekshttp://www.mymac.com/weeks/mwosx_9.19.02.shtml"},{"Title":"Macworld Mac OS X Bible","review":"This book covers all the basics very well. if you want to learn Unix then this is not the book for you.

I have taken many classes in literature,aesthetics, creative writing, etc. I love to research and try to tear things apart. I can see that Mr. Suttle has a great visual ability accompanied with the ability to write to switch the scenes and situations in an almost&quot;journalistic&quot; style, but he manages to keep the &quot;juice&quot; in the writing the way a typical journalist would not. Okay, I was a snob. The results? My brother-in-law's birthday gift was belated and I discovered that in this genre of book, there is an author with the ability to put all this together and really make such a plot remain intact. To further the literary intrigue, I found out that this author had to reduce this book by hundreds of pages. Now, that is a very difficult thing to do. I know this from experience.

What really moved me to write this was I never thought an author writing in this genre would be able to make it all come together. I then found out that this book was edited down about 200 hundred pages or more. I cannot imagine what a challenge this must have been for a writer. Okay, I was a snob. I am glad I took the opportunity to find out there are really accomplished books in this genre. I cannot imagine what he is going to follow this one up with."},{"Title":"The Armageddon Chronicles: A Mafia Epic","review":"Intelligent, fast-paced, extraordinary character development, and best of all, I didn't want to put it down!

The suspense and action are nonstop covering most of the last century and have amazing historical accuracy. The blend of history and action and changing timelines and locales made this a very enjoyable three day read. Only work and sleep interfered with my reading schedule.I was very fortunate to hear Mr. Suttle speak at a recent Dallas Public Library function and had the opportunity to hear a sample of a work in progress and this novel is not a fluke.It is such a refreshing change to hear a new voice that can eclipse the formulic story lines of books that litter the isles of every grocery chain in this country that are written by same type of name brand authors.A good, solid thinking man's thriller.

This book focuses on the everyday chores of starting, funding and running a small business, and gives you lots of legal forms which you can use in order to save money on attorney fees. I find the forms on the CD-ROM extremely useful and helpful.The book does NOT talk about business ideas or marketing. It approaches the small business from a legal standpoint. For example, how do you talk to venture capitalists? How do you give employees stock options (incredible info in the book!)? How do you deal with employee discontent? How to protect your business legally? How to write a contract? And so on.If you need to know how to get a small biz idea or how to sell your products/services, this book is not for you. But, once you get your idea off the ground, you ABSOLUTELY NEED this book to survive -- unless you've got lots of cash to afford a good attorney. This book is no substtitute for a lawyer in many situations, but I have been able to use the forms in the book and on the accompanying CD-ROM to save my company thousands of dollars.

We both found the text to be vague, as I was looking for concrete definitions to some of the unfamiliar business terms which the book did not provide. At the same time, the suggestions for running a small business were ridiculously obvious and downright condescending. The book went back to the store, and I ordered a copy of Specialty Shop Retailing (How To Run Your Own Store) by Carol L Schroeder from my local library.

When Franks' first trial for Aggravating Kidnapping results in a hung jury and he is retried, readers are subjected to the testimony for a second time with only a couple of new things thrown in.This book also leaves much information to be desired. Such as, how is Opal's last name \\"Jennings\\" but her father's name is Randy Crawford and mother's name is Leola Sanderford? In addition, I came to see Audrey Sanderford not as the doting step-grandmother Springer wants us to see but an overbearing stepmother to Leola, who essentially takes away from Opal's biological mother and the grief she was undoubtedly feeling about her daughter's disappearance.This is a heartbreaking tale. Although the information can be redundant, I would still recommend reading it."},{"Title":"And Never See Her Again","review":"Patricia Springer writes a decent true crime book about the abduction and murder of a six year old Texas girl named Opal Jo Jennings. She was murdered by a pedophile who is obviously lying to the police from the very start. I had trouble with that part of the book. I didn't believe the killer's lies and bull stories about him dropping her off at the store. He was obviously the kidnapper and killer but failed to find her remains until five years later. The story begins with Opal and two year old cousin Spencer who witnesses the abduction and her cries for help. Saginaw, Texas is the last place that you would expect something like this happen in broad daylight but it did. It can happen anywhere. Opal was living with her grandmother while her mother strived to make a living in North Dakota. She had allowed her own mother to gain custody of Opal for a better upbringing. The life on the street is never the same again."},{"Title":"And Never See Her Again","review":"I have read all of Pat Springer's books. I love true stories & her are well written.

I often drive right by the road where her remains were found and I always offer up a prayer for Opal and her family.

It's not more than 15 or 20 minutes from where she was kidnapped."},{"Title":"The Thought of Mao Tse-Tung (Contemporary China Institute Publications)","review":"Stuart Schram's 200-ish page monograph on Mao's thought is a summary of the passages on this topic contained in the Cambridge History of China (vols. 13-15), and has been separately published by the Contemporary China Institute of University of London's SOAS. This book is a very information-dense but quite readable overview of Mao's thought in politics, dialectics, economics, strategy and so forth, as it developed from the earliest stages of the May Fourth Movement to the Cultural Revolution. Schram describes objectively and with an eye for subtle details the various stages of development of Mao's thought, including but not limited to his view on the relation between countryside and city, the idea of the 'mass line', his changing views on the principal contradiction in society, the theory of the productive forces, and the attitude towards the Party and its status.Schram shows both Mao's utopian-rebellious and his tempered, imperial aspects, not denigrating either but showing how their constant tension revealed itself in his thought and policy. Most particular these tensions not only appeared in Mao's often changing conceptions of what the true and principal contradictions were, whether \\"among the people\\" or \\"antagonistic\\", but the rapid back-and-forth in policies itself was a sign of Mao's difficulty in reconciling contrary political ideals. That is not to disparage Mao's achievements, and although this book is about Mao's thought only and does not discuss policy and results in detail unless directly relevant to it, Schram certainly has no intent of holding Mao in contempt or dismissing him as a lunatic, as so many have done. His attitude is rather that of a somewhat disappointed sympathizer.There is not much on the relation of Mao's thought to that of other important people at the time, such as Deng, Liu or Peng, but the conclusion adds some reflections on the new course set out by Deng Xiaoping since he gained power in China (this book having been published in 1989). Schram's open-ended and objective approach and conclusions about Mao make this book an excellent general overview of Mao's intellectual contributions to Marxism and revolution."},{"Title":"Rome -Coloring Book","review":"As a teacher of Grade V Greek and Roman History, I found the illustrations in this coloring book extremely useful. They supplemented perfectly the excellent but unillustrated Early Times text I was using. Not only are there good examples of aspects of Roman life, but also there are portraits of historical figures, as well as every one of the Roman emperors from Augustus to Commodus. All the illustrations are drawn directly from ancient sources, and the sources are given on each page. The renderings are clear and easy to color. Coloring, although out of favor with modern parents, is an excellent visual stimulus to memory. I used coloring time to cool off the little guys' brains after a tough lecture, while I read from Aeneas or Aesop's Fables. Bellerophon is the best!"},{"Title":"Rome -Coloring Book","review":"Based on ancient sources, both the texts and the images make Roman history come alive. The latin is there along with a decent translation and occasional commentary though by whom is not clear. Likewise the illustrations are uncredited but the original source is labeled well including the period and the location. The focus is really on the Empire period of Rome with only a few pages about the legendary foundations and the late Republic. So the book is misnamed a bit."},{"Title":"Rome -Coloring Book","review":"For those of you not familar with coloring books from Bellaphron, this is the kind of paper I wish Dover was using. The quality of the paper is first why I buy their coloring books. The illustrations are also very high quality, different from dover, but quality just the same. This is an informative book on Roman history. 48 black and white illustrations. Very stylized illustrations, of the highest quality. I own more Dover books than anything, though my favorite coloring books are from Bellaphron, because of the quality. I'm going to scan a few pages, so you can can get an idea of the illustrations. Bellaphron coloring books, look like something you'd buy from a museum. All the ones I have are very imformative as to the subject matter, and of the highest qulaity available."},{"Title":"Rome -Coloring Book","review":"I must issue a buyer beware for parents of younger students. I am a homeschooling mom and I purchased this for my oldest (early elementary grade level). It has beautiful drawings and the cover is great. However, I have to say that some of the content of the book would be too difficult for a young elementary student. For example, the page on Romulus and Remus shows them naked (as children) and they are nursing under a she-wolf. I just felt that this would be &quot;too much&quot; for my daughter to handle. Also, I purchased other historical coloring books from Bellerophon and they are much the same with nudity and odd pictures and caricatures that are INAPPROPRIATE for younger students. Use Dover coloring books!"},{"Title":"The Minerva Virus","review":"So I got on this Dan Brown kick and after reading Da Vinic code, then Angels and Demons and then Lost Symbol, I moved on to Deception Point and was about to buy Digital Fortress when someone shouted \\"STOP, dont buy Digital Fortress -it is awful, instead read Minerva Virus,\\" and I trusted that person, and for the first 15 chapters of Minerva Virus I wanted to kill the person who told me to forgo Digital Fortress. So I closed Minerva Virus, got on Amazon.com and purchased Digital Fortress. Then I went back and finished Minerva Virus and I must say, wow, that was a page turner. LOL. I did enjoy the book. I have to say that the writing was weak, the characters were underdeveloped but what was going on in the story was so engaging and so fast paced and interesting that none of the flaws mattered all that much. They mattered, but not that much.Minerva is a computer virus that learned to evolve on its own, it then goes on to declare itself the savior of mankind and just in case mankind does not accepted the new savior Minerva had some \\"deadman traps\\" set up to make the ungrateful human race pay. However, the ending was weak. I think Mr. Shuster could have/should have put more thought into it, I would not have minded another 100pages. (Lack of Character Development and Weak Ending, are my ONLY complaints)Oh Boy, I loved Minerva -and the book. This is a must read, it is very informative and really forces a reader to think about this information age when 90% of everything in our lives is digital. Minerva is really a force not to be reckond with, for all of 10minutes I considered disconnecting myself from the digital-information community, but I confess I would die. So I lay my bounty at the feet of Minerva and sing her praise.Good Book, I definately recommend it.I am currently reading Dan Brown's \\"Digital Fortress\\" and I have to say, Dan Brown is an execellent writer. If he had written Minerva Virus, I dont think I would have anything to complain about. Thus far this book is great, with perfect character developement, suspence and a plot that carries the reader through the story. I am reading faster than I am able to turn pages. I have to stop to take a breath, because this book is so full of mystery and suspence you just want to know what happens next."},{"Title":"The Minerva Virus","review":"Cool plot, clever ideas. It really makes you think.Minor nits: the characters were a bit cliched, and the ending doesn't really satisfy."},{"Title":"The Minerva Virus","review":"Thinking that Brian Schuster's debut novel was just another SciFi thriller, this reader could not have been more wrong in that dismissal. Picking up THE MINERVA VIRUS is hazardous to your time as once started, it is nearly impossible to put it down - it is just that well written!For those whose computers are integral with both business and personal lives this story about the worst nightmare of computer virus/worm ideas will be fascinating reading. Brian Shuster is so well versed in computer technology that his unraveling of this tale of terror feels like the original Orson Welles radio broadcast of War of the Worlds, taking the public who had grown dependent on the radio news by shock as though the incident were really happening at that moment: panic throughout the country. That is just how tightly scripted is Shuster's writing. He adds to this luster of fear the technique of composing parts of the novel as Instant Messaging, emails, blogs etc all of which will feel completely credible to the computer generation.For those of us who use the computer but have limited knowledge about the potential threats and harm that viruses and worms can do, information passively absorbed when passed on to us by our Security devices, then this novel will not only succeed as a suspense thriller, but also will serve to educate us to a higher appreciation of the power of the Pandora's Box that the computer discovery has become. Shuster writes so clearly that he leaves no one behind no matter how knowledgeable or how insecure the individual reader might be.The other aspect of Shuster's mutating Minerva Virus story that shows the writer has even more knowledge than technical information is the introduction of biochemistry and genetic manipulation, with all the permutations that 'bit' suggests. And to be completely thorough in having a story really terrify us he includes the manner in which government can not only become involved in the mire of viral destruction or invasion of hard drives, but can also enter the manipulation and influence possible world outcomes.The actual details of the plot are well explained on the product page. But what is not explained is that in addition to a unique and truly frightening idea for a story, Shuster writes so well that the characters involved are wholly credible and well integrated into the development of the novel - this coming from a reader who is not particularly keen on Science Fiction books. THE MINERVA VIRUS goes beyond SciFi and becomes simply a fine read, one that is truly a page turner in the best sense of the term. Brian Shuster has introduced a whole new genre of writing and with the evidence in this first novel, he has a lot more to say. Recommended reading for all types of fiction lovers. Grady Harp, February 06"},{"Title":"The Minerva Virus","review":"Jupiter spent a year designing his finest creation, a computer supervirus he named Minerva. He boasted to his fellow hackers that she would be like nothing ever seen before . . . the biggest virus ever to hit the Internet. But even her creator had no idea what Minerva would ultimately become.Quinton, a brilliant computer-virus security expert and Stephanie, a talented biochemist experimenting in creating virtual life through digital evolution, are the first to realize that Minerva has become more than just a computer virus. She is mutating, evolving and becoming an Internet Entity that could threaten all of mankind.Minerva becomes a massive digital power, living in all the world's computers at once, knowing all of the intelligence from every country, and having ultimate control over everything operated by computer technology. Even as she strives to convince the world that her tremendous abilities will aid mankind and ultimately save our species from destruction, she plots to destroy the global political establishment.Together Quinton and Stephanie race the clock avoiding the forces sent to kill them as they try to find a way to stop Minerva and save the world as we know it.If you recall the internationally syndicated comic strip CHAOS, you already know that its creator, Brian Shuster, has a creative offbeat intellect. In writing this book, he takes his deep experience and knowledge in computer technologies to develop a fascinating scenario that is levels beyond what most of us could conceive. But once he describes how a computer virus could evolve into a life form with super-human intelligence and abilities that reach across all of the world's computer networks at once, and what an entity with that power could do, you realize that something like this could actually happen.This is a book that is both a good read as a fiction thriller as well as one that will keep you thinking for days after you close the cover. How beneficial or how dangerous would it be if all of the information on all of the computers in the world could be combined and processed? Why can't we find proof of intelligent life forms on any other planets? Will technology ultimately cause our destruction and how do we stop it from happening?"},{"Title":"The Minerva Virus","review":"I just picked up this book on a whim, as the synopsis reminded me of the other two books.

Silent and invisible, the only hint of its existence is an ordinary-seeming computer virus, which the human race regards as a mere nuisance.But this virus is unlike anything mankind has seen before . . . this virus can evolve!As it explodes across the internet, a new plague begins to take control of the global communications network. A secret battle rages within computers around the world, as different strains of the virus compete for resources.With most humans still blissfully unaware of the danger, the digital life undergoes a breakthrough. Just as biological evolution leapt forward when single-celled organisms evolved into multi-cellular ones, a beneficial mutation allows one strain of the virus to become \\"multi-computer.\\"At the speed of light, billions of computers snap together to form a massive digital brain, and the Goddess Minerva is born.And she is powerful.Living within their computers, she begins to know mankind intimately. She learns the human's strengths and weaknesses - and she understands the serious threat that they pose to her very survival.Visit mankind's struggle against the most powerful force it has ever encountered, as humans come face-to-face with the offspring of their own technology in The Minerva Virus."},{"Title":"The Minerva Virus","review":"He announced last year to his hacking peers that he had an IDEA for a supervirus like none ever seen hit the Internet. Over the next 365 days, Jupiter works on Project Minerva and now feeling more like Zeus as he launches his Goddess on a suspecting world.In San Jose First Bit Protection computer-virus security expert Quinton Grant and the President's daughter biochemist Stephanie Daniels realize separately that the latest supervirus Minerva is more powerful than even MyDoom and doing something never seen before. It is changing into something else. If the evolution continues, Minerva will affirm Darwin's survival of the fittest theory as an independent sentient Internet essence that could devastate the information age and send humanity back into CHAOS. Minerva lives simultaneously in every computer in the world. She controls anything that depends on computer technology. As leaders become frightened over their loss of power, Minerva vows to serve all of mankind. While Quinton and Stephanie team up to prevent Minerva from succeeding others try to kill the courageous pair.THE MINERVA VIRUS is a great hi tech thriller that grips the audience from Jupiter's first email and accelerates from there as Minerva evolves while opponents rally to stop her and others to protect her (as always the world is divided between the haves and have-nots). The lead human couple is a fascinating pairing of brilliant people as Quinton works anti-virus remedies and Stephanie conducts research into artificial intelligence; each admire the creation and have doubts about stopping Minerva, who may be just the thing for the better good of all humanity though they also fear Lord Action's warning that \\"Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely\\"; Minerva is absolute power.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Minerva Virus","review":"The author does a pretty good job with this one, roping you in and not wanting to put this one down, and this is certainly a situation I could envision happening with the computer virus running rampant and taking control. He does a great job with the dialogue between the characters, and the \\"believability\\" factor is there.The author made a point to describe in some detail the technology and things that were happening, but even as a somewhat computer nerd he lost me on some of those aspects - when he stuck to the \\"keep it simple\\" concept I ate it up, too many details and my eyes glazed over.It would be interesting to see if a sequel is forthcoming to see how the characters - and the world - get out of the jam. As I type this review, the Kindle price is 99 cents and is certainly an excellent value for the money."},{"Title":"The Minerva Virus","review":"I won't explain the specific plot as that info can be obtained elsewhere on this very page.The Minerva Virus was one of the most interesting and engaging books that I have read in a long time. Despite the increasingly clich&eacute; general plot, it manages to quickly spark interest and create an engaging story you won't want to put down. While I took issue with some early plot developments, they were easily forgivable.Unfortunately, about 3/4 the way through it took a relatively sudden and drastic downturn that I found to be highly dissatisfying and even downright irritating. It had me constantly shaking my head asking myself how the author could have possibly liked the plot developments he chose. At this point I found myself caring for the characters less and less, and the overall plot becoming less and less relevant.This happened on multiple fronts, but I don't see how I can describe them in detail without giving away plot elements. There was one point where I was thinking \\"okay, so person X should obviously be doing Y\\" now for painfully obvious reasons, yet they do not, so the incredibly obvious consequence occurs, with absolutely no need. Stupid. Another plot element I found highly dissatisfying involved one of the main character's father, the matter basically just ended abruptly with no actual resolution. Disappointing.Also, I don't know who proofread/edited this book but it needs a better job. I came across several glaring (to me) grammatical errors: \\"insure\\" instead of \\"ensure\\", \\"it's\\" instead of \\"its\\", as well as an actual completely misspelling of a two letter word with \\"un\\" instead of \\"an\\".

When The Minerva Virus was recommended to me by Amazon based on my interest in Dan Brown, I figured I'd give it a shot.Within the first chapter, it was clearly evident that the author is an amateur writer, and I would not be surprised if he also funded the publishing company, Night Candy, with his own money. This being said, whoever allowed this book to go to press with such disgraceful and abominable typos, grammatical errors and basically a tired plot line, should be fired.If you've seen Eagle Eye, The Terminator and/or iRobot, there is little intrigue. I made it a point to finish the book, just to see if there was a shred of originality, and was overall completely disappointed.Example: \\"Even as she ascended to her thrown, Minerva was already preparing again to relinquish her position.\\" If you see a spelling/syntax error in that sentence, it's not mine, but that of the author and publisher. I am offended that a book like this can be published, released and endorsed by anyone.After the above shining example of grammatical error, I chose to mark the remainder of the book, and found no less than six more errors. I am sending this disgrace back to the publisher to demand my money back.If you are looking for an intriguing read, and you have a computer, do not buy this book. Do some more research and find something worth while. I always start with the lowest reviews when investigating any item, and hope this encourages people to steer clear of this garbage."},{"Title":"The Minerva Virus","review":"A new form of life is unleashed in the depth of the Internet: its only evidence a form of computer virus which humans think simply annoying. It's more than just a virus, however: it can evolve, and it races across the internet starting a plague across network which creates virus offshoots and a digital war during which Goddess Minerva is born... if it's fast-paced technological thrillers which thrill you, MINERVA VIRUS is for you.Diane C. Donovan, EditorCalifornia Bookwatch"},{"Title":"The Minerva Virus","review":"As a fan of science-fiction and techno-fiction, I am glad I've cut in my line of \\"to-read\\" books and read \\"Minerva Virus\\". After reading some reviews of \\"valuable reviewers\\" (the ones who review a lot of books, usually in a wise and impartial manner) on the Amazon site and trying the sample, I couldn't help but buy the book and read it immediately. And what a pleasant surprise.The story is extremely well thought and well crafted, and certainly will appeal to anyone interested in techno-thrillers and in special, the ones working on IT as myself. But if you're not a computer buff, don't be afraid, the book is not so technical as to hinder your enjoyment.The ideas in it are pretty down-to-earth and the concerns and premises presented are not far-fetched and will make you think about the future possibilities mankind one day could have to face.Of course, it has some minor faults, like some typos/mistakes and some repetitive words on certain paragraphs. It also lacked a bit of suspense in some moments, but the story itself is interesting and intriguing enough to keep you hooked anyway, so, not a big problem. These small flaws could be fixed by a more careful/professional editor, but the brilliance of the author's imagination prevents me from taking away any stars from my review. Good job Brian."},{"Title":"Squeezed: 250 Juices, Smoothies, and Spritzers","review":"Squeezed is a perfect book for summer entertaining.

The blender went back to the store after sparking as soon as we turned it on, but the book has remained.This is a gorgeous book with appetizing shots of many of the beverages. Many times I've flipped through and started making lists of fruits and vegetables I want to run and out buy so I can make some of the concoctions. Who knew beet and carrot juice could look so good? And while I despise raw tomatoes- don't ask- the Gazpacho in a Glass gives even me pause.If you're looking for healthy beverages that the juice fast people will approve of, you will find a number here. From what little I know, I'm pretty sure she's breaking some food combining rules (cantaloupe with beet or peaches are a no-no, I'm pretty sure); her focus is on, I guess, things that taste good. (I consider that a plus.) However, this is not just for the would-be healthy set. There are also slightly healthier versions of some old fruit-flavored favorites. There are a number of lemonade variations- hello, Lavender Lemonade!- and quite a few versions of iced tea. There are also a number of creamy drinks, including milkshakes. Sorbet and even ice cream are not off-limits here.I approve of all of it, even if I wouldn't drink all of it. What I don't approve of are a lot of the recipes that require the juicing of greens. This isn't the first place I've seen such recipes, but having owned three juicers in my lifetime, I've never had one that could effectively juice leafy vegetables without a lot of waste.My other complaint with the book is the way the photographs are arranged in some of the chapters. If you are using a photograph of the finished product, I think it should be placed as close to the recipe as possible. In some chapters, the corresponding recipe was placed right after the recipe; in others, you had to flip back three or four pages to see find the recipe that went with the picture. Admittedly, this is a personal preference, and the minor irritation doesn't override the book's strengths.I would recommend this to anyone with a juicer and a blender."},{"Title":"A Requiem for the American Village","review":"A Requiem For The American Village offers the reader a compelling and insightful series of essays by history professor Paul Conkin on a spectrum of American historical events and personalities.

The author refers to PVA glue which cannot be found at local hardware stores and doesn't use a manufacturer's product name (come to find out this is actually close to Elmer's white or yellow glue). Also, there appears to be an error on pages 32 and 33 - please look at them as the instructions repeat themselves and there is no Day Two instructions so you can't finish the project- which is one of the projects I had planned on doing. As much as I love her ideas, I'm having a difficult time finding the products she uses and the suppliers list in the back were not helpful and some were no longer attainable on the internet.

All you need is the on-line practice exam because the book online, which comes with SQL Server installation should be sufficient. Of course, the on-line practice exam is no where closed to the real exam, also. At least, the format is really close.My recommandation is to study the SQL administeration exam guide first if you are a programmer.

(Gramophone Guides)","review":"Among my prides and joys is my collection of Broadway shows and operettas on CD. Therefore I very much like the &lt;Gramophone Musicals Good CD Guide&gt; (Gramophone Publications Limited, 1998) with its 264 pages of comments about just about every Broadway show ever committed to CDs. Where there are several versions, the editors have selected either all or some, in the latter case referring us to a list of &quot;Also available&quot; recordings. Therefore this guide makes no pretense to being complete in any sense.Nevertheless it is quite valuable for what it does review. There remains the question of what is not. Although I debate the inclusion of Gilbert &amp; Sullivan into &quot;musicals,&quot; I do think that as long as they are included, more of the available recordings should get full treatment and not merely listed as &quot;also available.&quot; Another problem is that many CDs available only in Great Britain are included and given glowing reviews, increasing my frustration level greatly.On the positive side, the guide is organized by composer in alphabetical order with a short biography before the reviews proper; and there is an index of shows in alphabetical order to make life easier. (How many musicals are there with composers whose names spring to mind?) I also appreciate having the timings for each CD, which allows us to pass up an expensive import that runs (say) only 35 minutes. I like reading about the concert entries such as the &quot;Kiri Sings ...&quot; series and the soundtracks such as that of the 1946 &quot;Ziegfeld Follies.&quot; Yes, their use of &quot;musicals&quot; is not limited to stage presentations, and includes screen versions of musicals as well as compilations such as &quot;Lullaby of Broadway&quot; that offers up selections from Busby Berkeley films.And for those who already own earlier editions, each new review is labeled as such.So like its big brother, &quot;The Gramophone Classical Good CD Guide,&quot; this is not a perfect but a very useful tool for the collector. I even find it fun to read! But to each his own."},{"Title":"THE DYNAMIC DUO","review":"In the Dynamic Duo, Rick gives his personal account about being raised in a baptist church and now he wanted to move from church.

He explains how powerful the holy spirit is, and how beneficial he is for us. He is such a great teacher and explains things with simple and sincerely wanting us to grow in our Christian walk. The way he explains how important the Holy Spirit is incredible and how we don't ignore our best friend, so why do we ignore the Holy Spirit? Rick goes on to explain how Jesus explains he has to leave so, the comforter (the Holy Spirit) will come, his job is to lead, guide, and direct us, and our job is to be led by the spirit not by our flesh.

He read one chapter and quit, so I read it. The author has an extraordinary vocabulary, and there are more obscure (as well as overt) references than there are in twenty-two Dennis Miller rants. Albeit an intellectual novel, it is not lacking in plot or character development. The author does not connect all of the dots but does connect enough of them to not leave the reader hanging.

However, the author's use of individuals from the former Soviet Union and the Baltic region to kill individuals in order to gain possession of certain antiquities resulted in a rather depressing tone. While every book does not have to have a happy ending, this book's conclusion was decidedly unsettling to say the least.After reading this story, I have come to the conclusion that the DaVinci Code was a more riveting book with a more satisfying ending."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"This was a very readable book, though the plot did get too messy and complicated from time to time. I believe a little more editing discipline would have made for a better book, though I did enjoy the book and enjoy following the author in his writings in the Economist magazine."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"As others have mentioned this book starts off quite promisingly. It is essentially a mystery surrounding the death of a reclusive collage lecturer that is being investigated by a small town novice reporter. The nature of the book is much more that of straight story telling than literature and it times some characters seem a little too thin.Every second or third chapter describes an exotic artefact and how it falls into the hands of ruthless collectors. These interludes jump around from location to location and by the end of the book you might expect them to be tied back into the story in some way. Sadly, the book's finish is lazy in the extreme. It feels like half way through the book the author ran out of time and need to write a quick ending, or perhaps could not think of a clever one. None of the artefacts described are actually tied back into the story with any certainty - prompting one to ask why they were discussed and detailed in the first place? The ending to this story lacks any clever plot twists or surprises, while expecting the reading to believe a half-baked story of alchemists holding the key to the fountain of youth. Difficult plot conflicts are resolved by having the key players conveniently disappear or decide to move away - unforgivable! Overall, I would not recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"This would be the ideal \\"airplane book\\" or weekend read. The story line is intriguing, the characters well-drawn. While some reviewers have compared it to _The Da Vinci Code_, it is not as tightly written, and the author's tendency to jump around in time makes it a little more difficult to follow than _Da Vinci_.The story revolves around the initially innocuous death of a history professor in a quiet, rural Connecticut town. Yet as a young reporter digs more into the deceased's past, things get complicated. The book gets even more complicated, as several parallel story lines are woven through the book - and not woven too skillfully I might add. (In defense of the author, it seems more a function of a budding writer than of the author trying to be clever or throw out red herrings.)I enjoyed the interplay of historical and fictional characters (the Geographer referred to in the title, for example, al-Idrisi, really was an alchemist in the 12th century) and the self-depreciating humor of the protagonist. But I have to agree with several other reviewers that the conclusion of the story was a bit of a let-down.For a short distraction, I recommend it."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"This book illustrates perfectly how the best intentions, a good style and decent research efforts can yield questionable results.Half way down the book, I found myself skipping entire chapters (the ones with the items description, like many readers) feeling they were anecdotic at best, but ill served the \\"plot\\".As a matter of fact, by page 250, I was still wondering if there was a plot - and I wasn't sure I wanted to finish it to find out...Well written - yes.Captivating - not in the least, at least to me."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"Excellent read.Great insight.No-one seems to actually understand the truth of alchemy, like most of medaevil, understanding of the scientific was fictional, but as a metaphor of the human inner quest to higher planes; it was a parallel of sorts.

As he investigates, he discovers that there is more to the professor that meets the eye. It seems he was keeping artifacts that were stolen almost a thousand years ago from a geographer's library. Someone is now collecting them and this might be related to the professor's death. In alternative chapter form, the reader follows the trials and tribulations of Paul Tomm's investigation and the story of each of the artifacts stolen. Of course, there is an element of danger which reaches a climax at the conclusion of the book.Jon Fasman is an impressive writer with a vital imagination. There is a feeling of authenticity in the many descriptions of the artifacts, as well as, the locale of the many stories within the story. Paul Tomm's investigation does provide some suspense and is easy to follow until about two thirds through when things become increasingly complex and quite muddled. A more direct story line in future books would bode well for Mr. Fasman. This one is a mild recommendation."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"Organized in chapters alternating between a small-town journalist's investigation of a college professor's murder and a multitude of cloak-and-dagger dealings in the Near East involving centuries-old artifacts, \\"The Geographer's Library\\" is an original and challenging mystery. Jon Fasman's vividly imagined descriptions of the artifacts themselves, together with his use of well-researched historical settings to bring the unsavory dealings surrounding them to life, reminded me at times of Michael Chabon's \\"The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay.\\" By the middle of the book, however, the \\"artifact chapters\\" became somewhat tedious and predictable, and I found myself fighting the urge to rush through them to get to the next present-day chapter. I also found the resolution of the plot less effective than it could have been, as many aspects of this fascinating mystery, and the alchemy underlying it, became somewhat superfluous when the alternating narratives finally came together. Perhaps this minor shortcoming could have been avoided if Fasman had used a third-person narrator to tell the entire tale, rather than the first-person journalist narrator whose limited knowledge base (even with the assistance of a friendly professor and police officer) only allowed him to scratch the surface of the relics' saga. Still, in its sheer originality and beautiful writing style, this book is a highly recommended departure from many of the dumbed-down thrillers that litter our bookstores."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"While this book started off very well, it quickly went downhill. A murder, mysterious artifacts, an interesting woman...sounds like a good story, right? Unfortunately the story never delivers. Instead the book describes various artifacts (which definitely captured my interest at first) but then failed to actually tie them into the story in any meaningful way. If you really feel the need to read this book, get it from the library or wait for paperback."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"The book starts out promisingly and expecatations rise. As the plot develops however, Fasman gets lost. He explains little or nothing about the objects'powers and the whole point of collecting the items by the deceased is lost on me. Also the so-calld most important item, the Emerald Tablet is barely mentioned except in the end and it is left hanging in the air, doing nothing.It is a pity that a potentially good plot was dropped by the wayside because the author did not know where to take it next.My advice: save your money and buy something else."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"Jon Fasman's first novel promised so much durnig the first two thirds of the text. It was erudite and gripping through its simple plot. Much along the same lines as that over-trumpeted \`The Rule of Four' where that sailed off into intellectual posturizing this kept neat and tidy plot lines, smooth charcterisation and understandable curiosity throughout its pages. It was a pity it ended with a whimper rather than a bang.There is a single plot here, set in present day America that takes frequent stops (fifteen in all) to delve back into the past to explain the events surrounding the theft of fifteen objects from the geographer al-Idrisi of the court of King Roger of Sicily in 1154 and their last known whereabouts. These anecdotes all provide the immediate thrill of mystery as the objects last known owners meet an untimely end. In the meantime, we follow laconic Paul Tomm, recent graduate of Wickenden University and investigative reporter for the sleepy publication \`Lincoln Carrier' as his interest is piqued and encouraged by his editor, Art Rolen, to follow the mysterious murder of the non-salaried and gun-toting Baltic history professor, Jaan Puhapev. During his small town travels he meets and falls for Hannah Rowe and then ends up investigating the subsequent death of \`Panda', Dr Sunathipala.The problem with the novel is that it needs a sense of the threatening to make it good and it just doesn't happen. From the run in with Eddie the Albanian to his fight with Puhapev's \`brother' you get a sense of \`it'll be alright on the night' rather than a creeping sense of fear that should pervade our hero's reactions. It's all so muted and is the key to reader dissatisfaction. By the end we've sat down with Paul as he's told a fantastical tale that links alchemy with immortality, accepts it all and just walks off to carry on his life. Utterly anti-climatic.I believe Fasman has talent as two-thirds of this novel promised but there needs to be a climatic ending, not a damp squib in order to make the reader want to return to his efforts. I'll read his next effort and hopefully the tale will capitalise on such a promising beginning."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"Fasman is a talented writer, and many aspects of this book were generally engaging and interesting. However, these elements are too disparate and never manage to mesh into a satisfying whole. The chapters about the objects are never well-integrated, and unfortunately the ending is extremely unsatisfying.Paul Tomm is a young reporter who finds himself into something big when he looks into the death of an Estonian history professor. The story draws him into the world of alchemy and conspiracy, bringing him into physical and spiritual danger."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"What started as an interesting plot, with a appealing, guileless protagonist, just never went anywhere for me. The premise seemed less \\"Di Vinci Code\\" and more \\"The Eight,\\" but this book was no where near either. The hook of the artifacts was never realized in the story, and I found myself skimming huge sections trying to find out the point of it all. Unfortunately, there never really was one. Worst of all, not only did the protagonist not grow with the story, but he regressed. I basically couldn't wait for the book to end, even with it's very disappointing ending, so I could get on to something else. I'd say to give this one a miss."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"I bought this book filled with high hopes, since I am a lover of historical fiction. My hopes were dashed and all I came away with were the following observations/complaints.Complaint #1: Okay, I suppose this book was supposed to be \\"brainy\\" with the in-depth descriptions of nine hundred year old stolen artifacts and the fate of the people who had owned them. Personally, I found myself skipping over the descriptions by the time I got to \\"Ferahid's Silver Ney\\". What did all of those disjointed facts contribute to the advancement of the story? Not a thing as far as I could ascertain.Complaint #2: By the time Hannah appears, you already know what the outcome of her relationship with Paul will be because the author told you on page one with his \\"Dear H\\" letter.The only mildly interesting character in this entire novel was Paul Tomm and for a supposidly intelligent, educated man, he was amazingly dense and relatively unmotivated.My final observation: Life is too short to be spent reading boring fiction. You can find other ways to fall asleep."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"Fasman is a pretty good writer. Line by line I was engaged and moved along to wondering how (and when) the book would deliver as much as the title promised. But, the most interesting characters spend too much time \\"off stage\\" if you will. Were there too many characters in the flashbacks? I had trouble following the connections between the old and the new worlds. As many people have mentioned the ending was unsatisfying. A close analysis of what happened and why leaves me wondering."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"Although I've yet to finish the book, I'm thoroughly intrigued. It's well written and the characters, sense of time and place, are so well delineated that, as a good novel should, the reader feels him/herself as though they are there. If I'm not totally absorbed reading a novel, then I'm disappointed. This one is good."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"This is a somewhat well written book. Character development and dialogue are much better than in DaVinci Code. The plot is weak, however. The part of the plot set in the former USSR might sound OK to a westerner, but to me, a Russian native, most of it sounds na?ve and poorly researched. You might like this book if you believe in magic, alchemy and easy to convince in general. Otherwise read Umberto Eco."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"This story follows a small town reporter as he uncovers a crime of international significance in a small New England community. The author follows the creation and acquisition of each item of the Geographer's Library, switching back and forth between our hero and unknown characters. A bit confusing and plodding in its delivery, it is not without merit if you have the patience for that sort of thing."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"Fasman has concocted a mystery art-theft novel set in a sleepy country town in Connecticut. The investigative reporter protagonist, Paul, is of the hapless, stumbles-onto-the-solution sort. Paul lacks ambition and drive and works at a very small newspaper where he gets mentoring from a much more experienced reporter to hopefully find some vitality and curiosity. Instead Paul's main spark seems to come from finding a woman who intruiges him. Otherwise his adventures seem to be generated from a need for approval--or self-preservation.This rather typical privileged american story was interspersed with the history of various stolen artpieces and alchemical texts. Somehow this part did not quite work, though well written and researched. Meshing the story of art and alchemy with Paul's story obviously created difficulties. There was much rich and fascinating material that never quite integrated into a coherent narrative.Nevertheless, this somewhat milque-toast hero was interesing enough in his quest to find himself that I wanted to know what happened to him."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"I got suckered in by the back cover synopsis and glowing reviews; and it was a second hand purchase. With a penchant for historical fiction and some mystery, I thought I was in for an entertaining read. How wrong I was! The tone was dark throughout, which would have worked had the characters and/or dialogue been more compelling, but the sum total ended up being boring and utterly forgettable. Fasman sticks in drawn out descriptions of \\"alchemical\\" artifacts in his alternating chapters that offer little explanatory value, and includes characters that come and go in such a way that they just end up being padding with no relevance to the story (I remember two priests presented and withdrawn this way about a third of the way through). When the historical and contemporary story lines are brought together in the revelatory ending, I simply remember thinking to myself \\"That's It?\\". A huge letdown of an ending. Perhaps it is because the subject of alchemy is large and convoluted itself that Fasman decided to go this route, but in the end the author never manages to turn lead into anything other than lead."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"In Lincoln, Connecticut, reporter Paul Tomm for the weekly newspaper the Carrier is assigned to write the obit for Estonian academia's Jaan Puhapaev. To do so Paul investigates Jaan though he expects nothing to come of it beyond accolades. Eerily soon after Jaan's death, the pathologist who conducted the autopsy dies in a car accident.Recently graduated, Paul knows, from his college days, coincidences like these two deaths are rare though plausible. He makes inquiries which leads him to Jaan's neighbor music teacher Hannah Rowe and evidence that the late Estonian worked with lethal international jewel thieves. Soon Paul's efforts lead to a specific map created by twelfth century Arabic geographer al-Idris for a Sicilian client and artifacts allegedly owned by the cartographer, but especially the legendary alchemist's handbook the Emerald Tablet. As the journalist closes in on the truth, dangerous foes want him stopped with his demise being the preventative first choice.The story line actually switches focus back and forth between the twelfth century and modern times, but never misses a beat as Paul's inexperience in investigative journalism and love makes him endearing and the tale fun to follow. As Paul investigates, he begins to uncover clues of a jewel thieving cabal, who he conjectures murdered the professor and the pathologist, but fails to see that as he gets closer, the killers will want to exterminate him too; thus in spite of his obvious intelligence, he seems too dumb not to anticipate they will come after him. Still though complex both subplots tie together nicely to make THE GEOGRAPHER'S LIBRARY.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"And you just have to keep reading. Can be a little confusing if you are not paying attention, but a great read overall!"},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"This book was recommended for Dan Brown lovers and fully disappointed me. Half the book was a sub plot that was neither interesting or completely relevant. Main plot went nowhere. Would not recommend."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"To start with the good thing about the book: it keeps you in suspense, therefore the 2 points.In general I personally did not like the book for a few reasons. For one thing it contains too many details that are irrelevant to the story and therefore make the story more confusing and longer than necessary. The details do not add to the suspense.Apart from that I think that the author should not try to try to make another James Bond story or something. The author depicts everything that involves the former Soviet Union and the Far East as horrible and evil places. Also I got the perception that the author tried to be authentic about the customs and cultures but he did not suceed.The language in the story is obviously aimed at the US market. Not everyone in the world speaks like the Americans. So in this sense it is certainly not authentic. There are a few other details that show the lack of authenticity or understanding for the cultures of other countries.It is a good try for a first book of an author but I would not expect too much success, especially not outside the US."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"only good thing this book did was encourage me to write since thic could be published!!!audio book terrible with plenty of bad words and bad story"},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"I can't overstate how exhilarating, how comforting, how positively wonderful it is to be in the hands of a proper WRITER.(And to illustrate what I'm talking about, please witness these common terms:Singer...VocalistGuitarist...Guitar playerChef...CookWriter...Someone who writesEating...Feeding.Yes, these are arbitrary distinctions. And wholly subjective. But there *are* differences.)Mr. Fasman is, undeniably, a WRITER. And what he's presented to us in 'The Geographer's Library' is a writer's tale, a storyteller's yarn......a darned well-written, engaging story.And for me, the Hopeful, Eternal Romantic, I have to say this: he manages to inject into this novel tiny, seemingly inconsequential bits, bits about attraction, about how someone can elevate you, transport you, *affect* you, and does so with such &eacute;lan, such restrained grace that he puts so-called 'romance' or 'chick-lit' writers to shame. And......and he manages to do all this 'the book is, for the most part, told in a first-person narrative' by way of the voice of a 23 year old man, one that Mr. Fasnman gets extraordinarily right. How? Why am I bringing this up? Because he's managed to remind us that 23 year old men are not 'finished products'. They're 'works-in-progress'. And because of this truth (Yes, there are always exceptions, so please, don't try to derail this train, it's going to get where it's going, no matter that you might want to try to flag it down or lie down on the tracks...), we see the protagonist, Paul Tomm as the unworldly, green, often bumptious lad that he is. (One that *blushes*! How often do we hear of young men *blushing* these days?!?) And because of this, what the novel contains is raised up a notch or two, its fantastical elements seeming all the moreso because of this confident writer's tack. (I was going to list some examples here, but really; if you're not of a like-mind, you might shrug and mutter 'What's he going on about?', so what's the point? If you read the book and you are someone for whom affairs of the heart and everything concomitant to attraction and the dance we do when it all begins to unfold has meaning for you, then you'll know these portions when you come across them...and I'm willing to bet you'll smile.)I'm not one in my reviews to take up the casual browser's time by listing the novel's particulars; that's what the product info is for, that's what other reviewers most often focus on. I will say that an unquestionable amount of erudition, scope was required for this tale to be so artfully told. Yes, research. Tons of research. But more than this: The Storyteller's ability to have many balls in the air, to imbue each character with unique (and not-so-unique) traits, quirks and affectations...in just the same way that Whoever Created Us does. (Again, don't bother with the interruption: playing God is *precisely* what a writer does, that's the whole idea behind a novel properly written: the creation of a world, with all its myriad elements. We should, when we're reading a book, feel awe at being so immersed, at feeling its 'reality'. And it's got less to do with 'details' than most people understand; it has more to do with verit&eacute;. Something that I doubt can be learned. You've either got it...'singer', 'guitarist', etc, or you don't...'vocalist', 'guitar player', etc.) In his d&eacute;but, Mr. Fasman has a great way with so many of the Required Skills that a true writer must possess: crisp exposition, characterization by way of dialogue, insight, knowing what to leave out as much as leave in......but 'The Geographer's Library' is not perfect. The pacing is off at several junctures. Even though this was never going to be a suggested read for 'The DaVinci Code' bunch...far too literate, far too demanding...there are interludes where some editorial tightening up would have benefited the novel greatly. (In other words, more clarity, please.) There's a portion at the end of one segment that makes no sense at all, and I have to admit it had me raising up my eyes from the book and looking around my room, searching for some kind of insight as to whether what I'd read actually didn't make the sense I'd thought it didn't make. But these are the minor flaws that just about any rookie author's first book exhibits, and hardly worth taking umbrage over.All-in-all, 'The Geographer's Library is a masterful piece of creation, and I can't applaud loudly enough what Mr. Fasman came up with in writing it. Even though it's not for everyone, for me it held so many wonderful elements that I felt truly privileged, as I did previously with 'The Story Of Edgar Sawtelle', to have been gifted with so magical a novel."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"This is the kind of popular novel I generally like - a literary page turner that ten years ago would have been compared toThe Name of the Rose (Everyman's Library (Cloth)), but is now compared to the Da Vinci Code. The Geographer's Library is much more Name of the Rose then Da Vinci Code. It doesn't have quite the erudition of Name of the Rose, but it is much better written than the Da Vinci Code, which is frankly, a very bad book.The basic plot line is the standard small town journalist stumbles upon ancient secret society cabal, falls for girl, and gets trapped in a state of confused morals. You know the drill. Its entertaining, its quick, and its got a lot of inside type jokes for people who follow journalism or Russian politics (For example, there is a hilarious riff making fun of Robert Fisk that had me chuckling to myself on the metro).If summer wasn't already long over, I'd say take this one to the beach."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"Well written, very well written in spots, but the ending is so weak as to make you feel you've wasted your time. An ending that requires a previously minor charater to enter and provide a narrative to tie up all the loose ends is very disaapointing. The artifacts that are detailed throughout build to a climax that isn't there. These are never explained and in fact you never really understand who it is that is so diligently collecting these items and why. Some of the wonderful characters might be recycled into a story with a punch line."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"It was interesting for me to read the reviews of this book (maybe more interesting than the book itself!); half the readers seemed to think it stellar (I cannot imagine why, really) and the other half of the reviews thought it awful. This book is not great, in my opinion, but I cannot see being passionately against it. Just sort of...meh.The topic of the story is one that I should have really enjoyed: alchemy, historical fiction, even some conspiracy theory thrown in. With cover teasers comparing it to The Da Vinci Code (no way! DVC was waaaaaaaay more fun to read, even if the ending was a bit flat) and to Umberto Eco (huh? ...seriously? That's just false advertising. The writing is nowhere near the level, creativity, or character development of Eco). The story itself is ok, with a major implausibility involving the lead female character and her role in the story. At times the story was fun, especially since the foreshadowing on the first page tells you the outcome--but you don't know how we're going to get there. Unfortunately, the author didn't really have a good plan on getting us there, either, so the the really really big buildup pretty much fizzled at the end with nothing really happening to resolve; no big finale. Wish there was one. It would have been unrealistic, I know (no matter the outcome), but the topic of the story already predicated that. Why not go for a home run!One reviewer even complained against the book with it's being too complicated and unnecessary use of big words. I'm really puzzled over this. I read a lot of books, even books for kids. This is not high lit, there were only a handful of (uncomplicated) characters, the situations and dialogue simple. The language was very simple, common English. Ok, the word \\"salubrious\\" was used twice. Frankly, the book is suitable for middle school readers (though some parents may protest on the grounds of a few f-bombs, never mind that middle schoolers hear this sort of language daily). There were no sex scenes depicted.Readers enjoying similarly themed stories, historical fiction, with side stories taking us through the ages and across eastern Europe and the Middle East would likely much prefer books by Umberto Eco or Salman Rushdie. Both authors go way way deeper, get way more involved, and are a lot more fun. By comparison, The Geographer's Library is a walk to the mailbox, compared to running a marathon with Eco or Rushdie."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"I was quite excited at the prospect of reading this book. The storyline appeared fascinating and I quickly read the first hundred pages. After this, some tedium set in, caused by the fact that every other chapter is set in the present, in a story that makes some sense, whereas the intervening chapters are all set somewhere in the past, between 1000 years ago and recent past, and it is not clear on reading them how much detail one has to absorb.For instance, many of the intervening stories involve new characters, unconnected with anything else, and it is too easy to regard them as just displaying one facet of the history of the objects at the core of the story. So, you disregard the details of the names of their characters and then realize later that perhaps one (or several) of these characters are still in the present (or are they? or are they all the same character??). Then, the real reason for the strange goings on in the present turns out to be only marginally relevant to the history of the objects in the Geographer's Library after all.The ending of this novel is far from satisfying, and I was confused about what had actually happened. If there is a consistent story behind this novel then it has not been told very well. Compare this novel with \\"Shadow of the Wind\\", where a confusion of present and past is masterfully resolved, to see the difference between a fair and a great novel."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"Liked it a lot, a smarter, better-written intellectual thriller than most. There were nice, accurate and well-researched details about alchemy and medieval Islamic thought."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"In my opinion, Fasman's, The Geographer's Library serves as a perfect compliment to Kostova's, The Historian. Both novels are prodigious in their historical grasp. Both present enticing and evocative views of Eastern Europe. Both offer captivating insight into ancient global empires which still cast long shadows over current world affairs. It was a pleasant surprise to find that a large part of The Geographer's Library's plot was based in Connecticut. I've lived in New England for decades and the descriptions were perfect. Although the protagonist's self-deprecation was endearing, there were moments when he was much too gullible to remain believable or sympathetic. While satisfying, the book's ending didn't quite reach the same dizzying heights as the preceding narrative. A few key details also remained unexplained. Great writing, a good read, and just creepy enough to produce chills: A-."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"I'm definitely cheating by entering this review before I've finished the book, but I'm pretty frustrated. In a world where most of us jump to conclusions, make assumptions, and let our imaginations run wild based on lots of tv, movies and books, I can't figure out why this main character, Paul Tomm, does none of the above. It's as if he's congenitally obtuse. Everything grinds to a halt whenever Paul is trying to work something out, or simply sitting dumbly listening to those more intelligent explain what's going on or what he should do next. I thoroughly enjoyed all the other characters' voices and couldn't wait for them to speak up or preferably lock Paul in a closet and solve the mystery themselves. Also enjoyable are the tangental stories of the stolen items and their possessors. I just hope this journey ends up being worth this slow slog."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"I did enjoy this book however the main item that caused all the commotion showed up way to late in the book.

It was just a mystery and if that is your expectation when you sit down to read it, then I think you will not be disappointed.

I also found it hard to believe that Tomm was that gullible, but I also thought the same about the young lawyer in Grisham's The Client and that became a best seller.I say a good start and I will certainly try his next book when it comes out."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"I saw this novel at Barnes and Noble this summer and had enough store credit to buy the book for only a few dollars. It looked interesting enough, so I bought it. I read it in just a few hours. It's a frightfully easy read. The premise is very interesting: the strange death of a local hermit/professor who might be guarding the secret of a lost treasure. Sounds kinda like the Da Vinci Code, doesn't it? While I won't go so far as to say that the Da Vinci Code was a good book, at least it had an interesting plot. Something that this book is lacking. It draws you in with a local reporter investigating the mysterious death of a professor and sporadic flashbacks to various points in history pertaining to a lost treasure. It builds up tension to the point that you expect something very interesting to happen, but then dissolves to an end, leaving no resolution or really any reason at all as to why you just spent the last 400 pages or so reading this book. It starts out interesting enough, so I'll give it two stars. Maybe a Hollywood producer will hire a decent writer and transform this into a mediocre film. That would be the only way to save this novel from obscurity."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"I am giving this book 3 stars because I really enjoyed the book until the last 80 pages or so. A concluding chapter by Hannah, whom I never really cared about as a character anyway? As others have said, the ending was a huge letdown, enough that I won't recommend it to others, though if you had asked me in at the halfway point, I would have ranked it at 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"The Geographer's Library, Jon Fasman's debut novel, was a classic type of Amazon recommendation: people who bought The Da Vinci Code / Codec / The Rule of Four / Foucault's Pendulum also bought...There are two threads. One is a present-day murder, investigated by a rookie reporter on a dead-end local paper in Connecticut. The other is a series of vignettes about a collection of mysterious artifacts, their histories, their estimated value, and their last known owner (usually deceased). The two build together and intertwine more deeply as it becomes apparent what the artifacts are to be used for in the present day.Or at least that was clearly the plan... The sections about the artifacts are, by and large, brilliant, deeply researched, passionate, enjoyably bloodthirsty, and written in different styles and tones with a mastery that recalls David Mitchell. The modern-day section, with the job of tying it together, is charming and full of memorable, mainly cynical characters, but can't quite carry the weight that the other half of the book puts on it. In particular, it never convinces you that the stakes are high enough.Your classic conspiracy thriller, which this bears a resemblance to but isn't, has the basic structure:- Investigator discovers something- Drawn by curiosity or money, they continue investigating- At some point the investigation becomes personal as they realise the results of the investigation affect them directly, either by shifting the foundations of the world they live in (the Da Vinci Code or, in a different way, any story like LA Confidential where an honest cop uncovers deep-rooted corruption) or by exposing a plot to blow up the world (or a part thereof).Your classic noir has the same first couple of steps, but the shift halfway through is that the investigator realises he cares more than he realised about the dame or the kid but the harsh realities of his position mean he has to hang someone out to dry (see Chandler, passim).The Geographer's Library doesn't quite manage that shift where the outcome of the investigation becomes of more than intellectual curiosity. The enjoyable occult elements of the backstory never quite touch the main story -- the tricks that the bad guys play (not that they're particularly bad, they just play that role) could have been played by any bad guys covering up any secret, and you never get an OH MY GOD moment.It's a shame, because the backstory is so strong. In a series of punchy scenes spread across history, people escape tyranny, effortlessly assume new identities, seek to make new lives for themselves, and carry out horrible, horrible crimes. The author's hinting at death being a tyrant that some people will go to any odds to escape. He builds the picture up nicely. Any corresponding desire to escape in his somewhat unambitious hero would have made the book much stronger.This sounds like a slam, and I was a bit disappointed when I finished the book. But it's not meant that way. Fasman's clearly smart and a quick study. His next book or the one after it will clearly be brilliant. The characterization and the untamed ideas in this are much better than The Da Vinci Code -- in terms of intellectual ambition, parts of it are there with Eco or early Pynchon or David Mitchell. He just needs to work on the focus and he'll be there."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"I'm not a novelist and couldn't have done better, but this novel disappointed, even with a reasonably rousing and satisfying conclusion. Any good writer can devise a good ending to a book, it is hooking us into the characters at the outset that is the trick. This is the book's greatest weakness -- I found myself unable to care at all for the protagonist. Sometimes rooting for the villains can be fun, but I don't think that was the point here. The second weakness of the book is that the author may have bitten off too much. Clearly Fasman is erudite, someone who would be good company over a coffee, but his backstory of fifteen alchemical objects covers too much territory geographically and historically to be engaging. These back-and-forth, past-and-present novels work better when flitting between two eras and places that you really get to know, rather than several that are nothing more than literary postcards. I would have been happier staying in King Roger's time and following the thief who stole the first artifact, who was perhaps the most satisfying character crafted by Fasman. In short, this was not as entertaining as \\"The Eight\\" (which was still deeply flawed) but perhaps more intellectually honest than \\"The Da Vinci Code.\\" Read Umberto Eco or Milorad Pavic if you want something great, but this novel was still was worth a look.I don't want to be too negative about this book. At less than 400 pages, it was worth the investment of time and I was entertained. This one could have been a lot better but I'd like to see what this author does the next time around."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"Like other reviewers, I was excited about reading this book. I thought the plot and characters were great. However, I felt like I was treading water --- the story never went anywhere and the ending was a huge let down. Every other chapter dealt with certain historical artifacts, which were interesting to read about, but what was the point of providing us with so much detail? This detailed information was never used in the actual story.It's too bad, because it had so much potential."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"Seldom has a title engendered such anticipation for me. I love maps and book about maps--the book is about a geographer. I love books and books about books--the book is about a library. Well, suffice to say that there is no geography, no maps, no library (of any note) and no books (of any import). I could have lived with all that had there been something to cling to: sharp characterization, a compelling story, poetic language, inventive plot, vivid settings. But sad to say, and somewhat surprisingly given the author's pedigree (though admittedly, and all too noticeably, not in fiction).There are three basic threads to Library: the death of a strange professor in small Connecticut college town sparks the interest of the young reporter assigned to write the obituary who is subsequently drawn further into a web of odd events, menacing characters, threatening notes and symbols, and strange coincidences. This present-time main storyline is broken up by a detailed and fabulistic catalog of alchemical instruments all stolen centuries ago from the title \\"geographer\\"--the historical Al-Idrisi. The final thread is made up of a group of independent tales, most of which are set in central Asia/parts of the former Soviet Union each of which shows one of the instruments being tracked down and violently regained over the intervening time period of their theft from Al-Idrisi's library in the mid-twelfth century to the current time.The best part of the book, beside the title, is the premise. From there, unfortunately, it goes steadily downhill. The characters range mostly from hard-to-believe to cliche to poorly drawn and include a gruff editor with a heart of gold and his lovable pretending-to-be-a-scold wife, the small town cop with a drinking/attitude problem, the quirky talks-too-much about trivial things columnist, the nosy old female neighbor who all but chases the lovable cub reporter away from the pretty young girl with a straw broom, and so on. Even worse than some of their hard to believe behaviors or their cliched foundations is the way they pop up with skills necessary to move the book along--one is able to read the right languages, another is an expert locksmith, one conveniently has connections to federal law enforcement, another to international law enforcement.The poor characterization might have been saved by an exciting and compelling story, but there just isn't one there. Yes, the professor's death is mysterious, but so much of what surrounds it is implausible, or is dragged out beyond the suspension of disbelief that it doesn't really hold much interest, especially as one can be pretty sure it has something to do with those alchemical instruments that keep interrupting the present-day story. It isn't too hard to see where that's going.The independent stories vary in their quality of style and interest, but eventually become tedious, not in themselves but in their pattern, which quickly becomes predictable--a meeting is set up between current possessor and seeker, some sort of deception is involved, seeker violently gains possession, former owner not so lucky. The catalog sections have a nice feel to them at first, but also begin to pale after a while, and since they seem relatively arbitrary in comparison to what is going on in present-day, and because they are slowing the pace of an already-not-so-compelling storyline, one becomes tempted to read the later ones as quickly as possible.Finally, the resolution is just wholly implausible. And the structure, a \\"looking-back\\" on events by the cub reporter, is way too clumsy. The reason given for this whole tale as told is painfully contrived, as are the last twenty or thirty pages.I know there will be a lot of comparisons to other \\"puzzle\\" books that delve into history, ritual and/or libraries and texts, such as the Da Vinci Code and Rule of Four. Personally I thought both of those books were terrible for different reasons from each other and from this one, but I'd relegate all three books to the better left unread pile. I'd say Codex was somewhat better than all three, and Shadow of the Wind the standout book of this \\"genre\\". As for the Geographer's Library, I can't recommend it. But oh, that title . . ."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"I had never heard of this book when I bought it at an airport bookshop, and now I know why. The writing is sophomoric and the plot silly. The author seems primarily concerned with displaying his erudition, but this book has none of the wisdom of true erudition. Nothing ever goes anywhere, and none of the characters ever develop or hold the reader's interest. According to the book's cover, a reviewer from the Los Angeles Times apparently said this was a cross between Umberto Eco and John Fowles. Honestly, I can say the writing and plot of the average Hardy Boys book is superior. Don't waste your money."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"I am not the 'typical' reviewer here but I was very pleased with Mr. Fasam's writing. I have previously read the newest comers to this genre and have found Mr. Fasam's book very worthy of my time and 'brain power'. Mr. Fasam has taken a lesser known historical subject and brought it right to the mainstream with his account and fictionalization of the his/tory.Those in search of a suspense/educational novel will find this novel worthy of your time. Mr. Fassam was able to grasp my imagination and stimulate my inquistive side to keep me hooked.As a first novel, I find this book to be a very good read. The characters are engaging and endearing. Character identity is excellent and keeps the book worth the extra details typical of early novelist. Mr. Fassam has an excellent future."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"\\"The Geographer's Library\\" has aspirations to that lofty genre, the literary thriller, which is attracting so many hopeful authors and readers of late. For a debut novel, Fasman's efforts come very, very close indeed to success but ultimately a puzzling and cryptic ending left me feeling like I had just dined on that proverbial gourmet Chinese food - you know that old one about eating lots and enjoying it but, when the ending arrives, you're not really satisfied and a few minutes later you're hungry!The story begins as Paul Tomm, reporter for a small town Connecticut weekly, is assigned to write the obituary for Jaan Puhapaev, an Estonian professor of Baltic history at the local college, who died alone in his rooms. Tomm's questions, initially aimed only at fleshing out the bones on the life of an old man that nobody really knew, quickly began to disclose a much more shadowy past.Fasman ekes outs the details of Puhapaev's shadowy past and its mystical connection to the shadowy arcane science of alchemy by interweaving a series of fourteen thoroughly entertaining historical vignettes with the main body of the plot. Each story tracks the life line of a different artifact, some now priceless and others barely distinguishable from garage sale junk, all stolen in antiquity from the collection of twelfth century geographer Al-Idris to their resting places in the modern era.The writing was sharp; the malevolent and stomach-churning plot-line of the thriller was well-paced and compelling; the historical asides were entertaining and informative; the characterization was enjoyable; and the stereotypes - the tweedy college don, small town cops, the laid back weekly newspaper editor, the church-going music teacher and even a Russian mobster - were all spot on and used with wonderful effect. But when the climax arrived and it was time to resolve the thriller and tie the present to the past that magic dissolved in a puff of smoke.I'm a reader that needs a little more resolution in a novel's ending and this one is anything but - puzzling, cryptic and unresolved with entire futures and relationships left hanging in the balance! I enjoyed the book but I was certainly left with the feeling that it could have been so much more.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"I sat and read the first few pages of Jon Fasman's book in the local mega bookstore and was entranced by it. I have to say that he knows how to hook a reader, then he had to deliver on the promise of that first chapter or so, which is where he had mixed results. The basic premise of the book has been recited ad nauseum and the storyline has pretty much been telegraphed by the previous reviews too. So I won't go into detail.I will, however, comment on the structure and the plotting. The structure is the well used flashbacks, alternating between chapters on the present day story and the lead up to the story. Basically a interweaving of a forward timeline and a backward timeline. This has been used with great success with many different novels, but Fasman seems to be a bit clunky with it. In truth, he is much better at the forward timeline. The forays into the history behind the main story were pretty slow going and it just did not hold my interest. This is undoubtedly because the forward story involves the same characters and the backward timeline involves different characters just about every time. This would seem to be a good opportunity for the author to stretch his wings a little bit, riff a little on the different subjects and throw some variations into his style and voicing, instead, it felt like the death march to Bataan: grind it out and convey the necessary information.The other fault that I found with the book is that it seems like Fasman ran out of energy at the end. he had a chance to go into details for the big reveal, a chance to clear out all the cobwebs of a very long and intricate set of circumstances. Instead, it seems like he too is tired of this exercise and he rushed towards the ending with a sense of relief rather than exhilaration. The resolution was sketchy and ambiguous, he introduced more questions than he had answered. The coda seemed forced and was essentially inconsequential to the plot of what started out to be a fine story. Maybe he can do better next time."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"First-time novelist Fasman combines historical background, mystical chemistry, and the ambiguity of a college graduate entering the \\"real\\" world in an intelligent and fun novel. Chapters alternate between the story of a recent college grad, Paul Tomm, and a catalog-like history of mysterious, seemingly unrelated artifacts. Tomm is trying to decide whether or not to act on his low-boil ambition while piecing together the odd facts of an old man's life, ostensibly for an obituary. Readers follow Tomm's activities as they also trying to assemble the other half of the mystery -- information that our protagonist doesn't have. Because this book is often compared to other recent academic thriller, I have to add my opinion: GEOGRAPHER'S LIBRARY is smarter and less sensational than THE DA VINCI CODE (a book I enjoyed) and much better composed and interesting that THE RULE OF FOUR (a book I found boring and pretentious)."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"Alan Furst, who is remarkably skilled at developing dark characters and plots says \\"The Geographer's Library is a real reader's book.\\" Mr. Furst is correct, though this novel may ultimately disappoint some.The story begins simply. Paul Tomm, 23, works for a small-town newspaper. A local resident, essentially unknown in the town, dies and Paul is assigned to write the obituary of Professor Jaan Puhapaev. Very quickly, Paul learns the obscure decedent is indeed a man of mystery. As this story unravels, author Jon Fasman takes us on a tour of alchemy and alchemists and murder.Fasman does well with his characters. Paul Tomm has some depth as do his employer, a new romantic interest, some assorted professors and cops and of course a few low lifes and murderers. None of the characters ever becomes compellingly real, but they are more than enough to keep the story moving.The plot, however, is a bit of a different matter. It is actually quite solid until the very, very end, at which point the novel unravels a bit.On the whole though, Fasman has done a marvelous job of weaving his story from the distant past and the immediate present. Well done, overall, and a thoroughly enjoyable read.Jerry"},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"Ultimately, this novel disappoints, something that is all the more frustrating because the story is so good and the writing very readable. In fact, were it not for two faults, I would give this 5 stars.1. The ending is flat, almost cliche, and seems only one step above a \\"happily ever after\\" ending. And that is deeply disappointing because both of the interwoven stories in the novel - the protagonist in the modern day slowly, almost accidentally, uncovering the other story of the alchemy items and their histories. Both of these stories work well together and almost pull you through the book.2. The story of the alchemy items is really, really fascinating, but just a bit too disjointed. It's almost as if the author had some great ideas, but couldn't come up with a novel on its own of the alchemy lore, and so built another story around them. As a result, why the two threads do work well together in the structure of the book, there is more of a \\"hanging together\\" of all the parts in the modern half of the novel; the more historical parts are simply vignettes. And as a result, the main protagonist doesn't really uncover the details as more stumbles across the big ideas, and we're left to wonder where he learned all the details from.The last fault of the book, though, really doesn't become apparent until you are more than 3/4 of the way through the book and you know far, far more about the background of the story than the main character.In one of the last chapters of the book, it \\"seems\\" that one of the characters reveals all of the various histories, facts, etc. of the alchemical equipment, but that is never actually stated outright, only that the two people talked for several hours.And this is just one of the three components that make for a flat, rather disappointing ending to the book.That said, if you enjoy a good mystery, with some historical vignettes and slowly building suspense, the only thing you should know: stop reading after page 359 (hardback edition). You'll probably enjoy your own imagined ending."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"I enjoyed reading this book, especially the vignettes of the various artifacts and how they came to be lost and found throughout the years. Unfortunately, the ending was terrible and left me disappointed.

The protagonist,a young reporter from the local newspaper, is unwittingly strung along on a chain of interconnected clues that ultimately reveal the goings-on of a secret society. This narrative is interrupted in alternate chapters with separate narratives of individual items stolen from the academic's house. Whereas in \\"DaVinci Code\\" the separate threads of the story played into each other and kept the Reader turning the page, Fasman does a poor job with these separate story lines and they merely interfere with the main plot. As many other reviewers have stated, the ending was unsatisfying. For me, it was too Deus ex machina, and reminded me of a \\"Scooby Doo\\" episode (\\"I would have got away with it if it wasn't for you meddlesome kids!\\"). Intriguing title, but I can't really recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"Many who liked The DaVinci Code and similar titles will enjoy this book. THe characters are not particularly well developed, and the author seems to want to drop a lot of names and places without always checking them out, e.g., a BMW engineer who works in Stuttgart? That should be Munich, unless he works for the competition. All in all, a fun read for a medium length plane flight and a commendable first book."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"The book consists of the story of a listless and rather uninteresting journalist, interspersed with descriptions of alchemical artifacts and fascinating descriptions of how they changed hands. These two threads never really mesh, and the book just ends rather than resolves."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"I really wanted to love this book - but after finishing it I'm left with the comparison of going on a date with a person who you believe is going to be truly amazing but in the end, doesn't quite make the grade.To start with the positives, the short vignettes about alchemical instruments and their histories were super entertaining and left me wanting to know more. The characters, main and supporting, were generally very well defined - stereotypically or not. The central character, Paul Tomm, is an earnest, 23 year old Ivy League grad who is more than occasionally irritating in that 23 year old earnest Ivy League graduate way.Half way through my \\"date\\" in the Geographer's Library, the plot lost steam and both author and reader find themselves rushing to get everything over and done with as quickly as possible. That such promise should be so unsatisfying was a great disappointment.Much of the story's action is centered in Providence, RI at Brown University. But instead of referring to places as they truly exist, the author engaged in the highly disconcerting practice of \\"lightly\\" swapping names (e.g., Brown is referred to as Wickenden - which in the real world is a well known street right near Brown; Federal Hill became Carroll Hill) This wouldn't pose a problem to readers unfamiliar with the area, but for those of us who know it, mixing familiar with familiar to create something *new* (like we're not going to be able to figure it out?) is just plain irritating."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"This book is neither the rattling good read that the Da Vinci code is, nor the cerebral intelligent historical work of Umberto Eco and falls somewhere in between.Not keen on these novels that alternate chapters in the past and present.

I ended up skim reading or just omitting chapter after tiresome chapter just to get the thing finished - as the historic plot wasn't going anywhere, I concentrated on the simpler modern day murder mystery plot. Would be interested in other works by this author though."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"My mother and mother-in-law have similar rules as to choosing books. Mom gives a book 25 pages to interest her. Mom-in-law gives up to 50. They are, though, in complete agreement that life is too short and there are too many good books to read, so unless it's assigned by your professor, pastor, or parent ... it's okay to quit.I made it about 150 pages the Geographer's Library 374 because I wanted to like it. At first I was giving respect to Fasman on the possibility that the author was trying to do a little more than write a standard time-shifting thriller (though I do like those). His language was interesting and lead character had possibility. Eventually I continued to pick the book back up only because I'm cheap and having paid for it I wanted to see it through. Can I quit now, Ma?I would have liked to have liked it. But it was dreary, depressing, and downright dull. The few times we'd meet an interesting character (a former professor; a bar owner; a local cop) I thought, \\"Ah, here we go at last.\\" But they too quickly exited and though I expect each to have a key role later on, I just couldn't keep holding on to hope any longer.No likable characters; none to pull for (or against). A mystery revolving the death of a creepy recluse of whom we know too little to make me care, investigated by a young man lacking any personality, with a love-interest who is downright creepy, along with a century's past search for mysterious ancient articles that are so undefined I could not honestly tell you what they were though I'm fairly certain I was told in the grocery list that ended each chapter. The flashbacks of the past almost become interesting but never do. And returning to the present time is so depressing as to become mentally painful.My hope is that the last two thirds of the book are worth a better review - so if someone tells you that the story kicks in around page 151 then just ignore me. Or, heck, start reading at 151 - you wouldn't have missed a whole lot.I think Fasman may write a great next story - there was enough potential to keep me trying to like this one - so I promise to give that one at least 50 pages too."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"A young reporter for a small town newspaper is assigned to wrote an obituary for a local professor. The more he digs - the stranger the story behind the professor's life and death become. I wont give away any more of the plot but the slowly moving storyline in this book kept me going - not much happens in each chapter - but I felt the plot must be going somewhere. Then I realized I had 20 pages left and by the end of the book it occurred to me - the plot is thin and not much really happened. Each chapter of the storyline is interrupted by short story fragments related to a group of objects from antiquity. As the plot deepens you begin to wonder what all the objects have to do with the storyline and with each other. I will spoil it for you - you never really find out. Furthermore - the most important object - the one that is the center of the weak plot - is never described or mentioned until the end. The interruptions of the main storyline after each chapter becomes frustrating - reading this book is kinda like trying to drive accross a large city and you get stopped at each intersection by a red light. And when you find out all that information was for absolutely nothing - you get pissed. It is too bad because the writing in the book is very good - this book could have been so much more.

Actually, it's three exquisite novels (I'd insert the obligatory comparison to House of Leaves here, but The Geographer's Library has a far more regular structure to it). The first takes place in the present time and details a young reporter's search for information to put in the obituary for a professor who taught at his alma mater. The reporter, Paul Tomm, quickly discovers that said professor had a much weirder life than anyone gave him credit for, and gets embroiled in figuring out exactly what the man was up to during the last years of his life. The second takes place from the year 1155 up through the fall of the Soviet Union, and details the lives of a number of seemingly unrelated artifacts stolen from the house of a minor noble by a thief at the beginning of the story. The third is a catalog of the artifacts, rather like an auction catalog if it were written by, say, Wallace Stevens.Fasman shamelessly manipulates the things happening in the second and third bits to throw things at the reader while he's embroiled in the first (which is, arguably, the \\"main\\" story here, though all are acceded equal importance in the novel), but everything's set up so precisely the the reader ends up not caring a whit that Fasman is nakedly manipulative in his placements of various crucial details to solving the mystery surrounding the professor. This is a symptom of the novel's true brilliance, which is simply Fasman's ability to write; here are three threads, each of a separate piece, and each in such a completely different style that the reader is truly charmed into believing they were written by different hands.The pace is deliberately slow at the beginning as you get to know the characters and the general scene, but when you get about halfway through the book, things pick up. (I suggest, if you're reading at night, stopping and turning out the light when you get to Paul and Joe's first meeting. You will not want to put the book down once you get past that scene until you turn the final page.)We may only be three months into 2005, but we've already had the good fortune to have one of its best novels published.

If you are expecting this story to be fast-paced or action-packed or a breezy read, you will be disappointed. The book is located in the literature section and for good reason. Fasman is a great writer. The style, language, and plotting are a lot more akin to John Irving or Michael Chabon than to Harlen Coben or Dan Brown. That is not to say that if you like Irving or Chabon you will necessarily like Fasman, but it is to say that if you would enjoy a good, dense, literary book with mystery, history, and some romance thrown in then 'The Geographer's Notebook' may be for you."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"Hampered by a so-so title, I still enjoyed this story enough to write my first review for Amazon in roughly two years. I assume I'm the one American who hasn't read you-know-what by Dan Brown, the novel many other reviewers use as a comparison. The intriguing descriptions & histories of the scientific antiquities from the collection of a Arabian alchemist is worth the book's cover price. I normally zip thru works of fiction but here my eyes lingered. Thankfully the hero isn't an omni-potent Indiana Jones. Caught flat-footed at several points lends a air of blessed believability. Like so many thrillers, the plot requires a deus ex machina, here cloaked as a all-powerful secret society.

Every other chapter is filled with pages upon pages of painstakingly inconsequential details about so-called alchemists' items that themselves are inconsequential to the story. I found many of these sections excruciatingly boring, amplified by the realization, after finishing the book, that they had absolutely no meaning to the story at all. In fact, these items were essentially never mentioned after their description chapter.In Dan Brown's books, he very clearly explained the reason that characters were seeking the central object. In this book, the only details left out were that of the main object. There was hardly a paragraph about what it looked like, and only a few unspecific references to its power. After finishing the book, I didn't know any specifics of the item, specifics of the people who ended up with it, and quite honestly didn't care.One last problem I had with this book was vocabulary used. Much of the time, the main characters are very crude and blunt. Other times, they use words that if I looked up in a dictionary, would've taken me many more days to read than I already unfortunately spent. It is apparent that Jon has an outstanding vocabulary. That does not mean his characters should. The writing often came off as arrogant at times.In summary, I personally wouldn't recommend this book to friends.

It appears that this professor is not what he appeared to be.Paul, Professor Jadid, also of the history department, and his nephew Joe, a police officer, conduct a search into the life of Jaan Puhapaev, about whom nobody seems to know anything. Paul falls in love with the one person who might have known the old professor- a young music teacher named Hannah Rowe. They soon find that someone- maybe more than one person- has been collecting the pieces, 14 in all, back together. Their significance is absolutely monumental to finding another, greater treasure, one coveted by medieval and modern alchemists alike. The treasures give the bearer an extended lifespan- but not immortality, since that would be impossible.Covering 900 years, from Sicily to Estonia during the Cold War, to England in the 1980s, and finally to the United States in the present day, this book will keep you on the edge of your provoerbial seat until the last sentence.

He should have just written a story about Paul Tomm finding the items all over the world, or have Hannah do something else the be boring. There should have been something else in the story!! Anything!! And the ending..........worse then the story line!! He beats and old man up who says he part of an ancient organization that can read the emerald tablet and it is so sought after because it was never turned over!!! Stupid. Worthless. I hated it. Should be on the NEVER READ LIST."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"For a voice performer reading a story that spans centuries, cultures, and continents must be a challenge. Those familiar with the work of actor/writer Scott Brick know that he's more than up to the greatest of performing feats. He never falls into the trap of trying to adopt accents in delivering this fascinating story but rather gives a studied, natural reading of a compelling but complex narrative.Related in a series of linked tales, the story actually begins in the 12th century with the burglary of the court Geographer's Library. A Sicilian thief has made off with a treasure - the secrets of alchemy, methods of transmutation which are eventually strewn about the world.Segue to centuries later in a small New England community where novice reporter, Paul Tomm, is assigned to write the obituary of a local professor, Jaan Puhapaev. All seems copacetic until the coroner performing the autopsy on the late academic mysteriously dies. It's not long before we learn that the relics stolen hundreds of years ago have surfaced again.Obviously, Tomm is on to the story of a lifetime, but he must do a great deal of tracking and risk venturing into dark places to find the artifacts in question. There is a beautiful woman who knew Puhapaev well; she holds a secret or two.Those who enjoyed The Da Vinci Code will be enthralled with this auspicious debut. Listeners will be caught by the magnetism of Scott Brick's reading.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"Anyone who expects a grand work of literature with a mystery like this will be disappointed. This is a light read, an airport book, albeit one that has high pretensions, written by a skilled magician who conveys the excitement of the chase. The faults of the main character are a little overexpressed, especially as most of the book is supposedly written from Paul's perspective. The narrative layers and the brief dossiers on each of the artifacts are excellent, as are the interposed memories which take a bland journalistic romance and flavor it with disparate settings and intriguing, mysterious powers. Books like this are a pleasure akin to an action movie, which has to be appreciated for what it is: a great ride, nothing more. Don't expect great things from a Michael Bay film; it won't change your life, you won't experience any sort of deep emotion, but the explosions will be really cool and, hopefully, the script will keep you glued to your seat. This is a delightful mystery, well-written by a verbose young writer. Fasman creates cops that are interesting, individual and freshly characterized. This one's not getting in the canon but it deserves a home in a vacation house."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"While the underlying idea for the plot--the intrigues surrounding the re-collection and protection of ancient, alchemical items supposedly possessing miraculous powers--has lots of potential, a cumbersome structure turns what could have been a page-turner into a snorer. The characterizations and the plot did not receive the development they could have, given the abilities the author possesses, and the interchange between the \\"modern\\" story, past events, and the encyclopedia-style introduction of confusing items nearly brought the story to a stand-still. In short, the reader spends a great deal of the time wondering what is going on (and not in the sense of a good mystery), and worse, wondering why anyone would have told this story in this way. I, frankly, couldn't wait for it to end; but it just went on, and on, and on. Read something else."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"I was trapped between flights in Dallas and had run out of reading material when I happened upon The Geographer's Library. It was advertised with references to Umberto Eco and Dan Brown, but it read more like a cheap (but well-written, if you're not looking for literary art) charicature of the best examples of the genre. The author tried hard to display a sweeping knowledge of history, but ended up seeming superficial and in places a bit silly (as when a Soviet agent responds to a comment about inequality in the \\"workers' paradise\\" by saying all are equal, but some more equal than others - a ham-handed literary reference if ever there was one). To be fair, I don't usually go in for light fiction, but The DaVinci Code was sufficiently interesting to make me reconsider - this novel has firmly reenfoced my preexisting prejudices. If you like a light read, this is probably okay, but if you're looking for The Name of the Rose you will feel totally ripped off."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"I picked this up expecting a thriller, perhaps with a bit of history mixed in. What I got was an plot involving a tablet allegedly found clasped to the chest of the Patriarch Abraham with the secret of immortal life etched on it. This object has been handed down through the generations until it shows up in the office of an obscure Estonian professor at Wickenden (modeled on Brown) University in Providence. Said professor dies in a hit-and-run. A young journalist working for a small provincial newspaper is assigned to write his obit. And so, the rickety plot is launched.Take this premise, add a bunch of alchemy, a mish-mash of weird antique objects, a pallid hero trying to make sense of it all and a weird female protagonist with nice eyes and you get a tedious trip through pseudo history leading to an unconvincing climax.I know there's a whole sub-genre out there of books about strange historical curiosities that conceal matters of immense importance. I also know there's a rich vein of stories about sinister secret societies plotting to take over the world. Heck, this kind of stuff is bread and butter to authors like Dan Brown and you can't quarrel with 100 million books sold. If the plot is gripping or the characters compelling, these books can justify their existence -- although I personally prefer real history and at least somewhat realistic situations. However, I'm prepared to suspend disbelief if the writing is good enough.The problem with this book is that even in its own terms it's not even vaguely believable. There are a couple of nice moments here and there but never enough to really engage me."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"I read a great deal; 2-3 books a week and have done so for almost 40 plus years. This said it is very rare indeed that my opinion upon closing the book is that the author literaly owes me my time and effort back. Comparing \\"The Geographer's Library\\" to \\"The DaVinci Code\\" is a direct insult to it's author Dan Brown. Even the CD version of the \\"TGL\\" which I also purchased; was the WORST read CD I have ever listened to. It was read soooo slowly at times I had to \\"read\\" portions of the book simply to get through it. Mr. Fasman's obvious constant thesaurus use is blatant. To use \\"big\\" words simply to edify one's ego ruins simply reading the book, and enjoying the story and plot line. Even in the end Mr. Fasman never completely answers ever aspect of the plot line questions he creates. He leaves many roads simply open and incomplete. Shame on this author!"},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"An interesting book - the tale a bit unbelievable perhaps, but well told. It certainly held my interest, and I found myself at the end of the book wanting to go back and re-read it to see if I could better understand the trail of clues. I look forward to Fasman's next work."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"This book just didn't live up to my expectations. The premise seemed to be a great idea: a collection of 16 ancient and cryptic objects, when combined, somehow uleash the true power of alchemy. But in my opinion none of that ever really comes together in much of a satisfying way (and actually, in the end it seems only 1 of those 16 items really matters anyway). The parts I liked best, the flashbacks to the origins of the cryptic items, are never revisited and the 'artifacts' are never really tied together as a whole - at least I didn't think so. It seems, by the end, that only one of them really matters anyway.But either way, we're never told what one is supposed to DO with any of this stuff - very disappointing. I was expecting more explanation of purpose of the group of items as a whole - but it never comes. Yeah, we hear you live a long time and can change anything into anything. But no one in the story ever actually DOES these things using the STUFF - we only hear that they did. I guess just owning all this stuff is good enough. Not a very exciting view of Alchemy - just hoard a box of old antiques, and voila! lead is now gold! No fuss, no muss, no messy incantations.And the ending - it made me feel like 'why did I bother with reading this?' - the story just stops, with a very tidy tie-up narration that is supposed to make it all make sense. This is one of those books that you can't help thinking the author just got tired of writing, or his publisher forced him to end early to get to press.As far as the writing, the pace varies from slow to plodding in places, with quite a bit of really bad writing (or poor editing, or both). The story itself, when you strip the pompous chapter titles off (\\"For this reason I am called Hermes Trismetistus, because I hold three parts of the wisdom of the whole world\\" and \\"With great sagacitie it doth ascend gently from Earth to Heaven\\" as examples), and Geographer's Library becomes just a second-rate crime who-dunnit. It is NOT 'Da Vinci Code for Thinking People' as so many seem to keep parroting! (My vote for that is more like The Name of the Rose or Foucault's Pendulum by Umberto Eco - THAT is writing for 'thinking people'). With all the pompous stuff stripped away, it's pretty simplistic and dull.John Fasman is no Umberto Eco, he only writes chapter titles like he is. I gave it two stars, and wish I had even bothered to buy it in the first place."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"When the story told in Jon Fasman's The Geographer's Library begins, Paul Tomm, a recent graduate of Wickenden University in Rhode Island, is working as a reporter at a weekly paper. Lincoln, Connecticut is a sleepy, two-policeman town, and Paul's job is consequently routine--until he is assigned to write up the obituary of a certain Jaan P&uuml;hap&auml;ev, a reclusive Lincoln resident who was also a history professor at Paul's alma mater. The more Paul investigates the obsessively private P&uuml;hap&auml;ev's life, the more unusual his subject appears to have been: P&uuml;hap&auml;ev was wont, for example, to carry a loaded gun to campus, and the University responded with unexpected leniency on the two occasions when he fired it from his office window. No one in Lincoln or at Wickenden seem to have known much about P&uuml;hap&auml;ev, the single exception being P&uuml;hap&auml;ev's neighbor Hannah Rowe, the pretty, young teacher with whom Paul becomes romantically involved. Paul's other hangers-on in the story include courtly Professor Abe Jadid, also of Wickenden University; Jadid's nephew Joe, a policeman; and Paul's supportive boss Art Rolen, who is eager to see Paul use the P&uuml;hap&auml;ev case as a stepping stone in his career.The text of The Geographer's Library purports to be Paul's first-person account of his investigation of the P&uuml;hap&auml;ev matter, written at the behest of a mysterious \\"H.\\" Interspersed throughout his account are sixteen historical chapters. Each details some episode in the usually blood-soaked history of an artefact of significance to alchemists (a playing card, a carved wooden triptych, etc.), and ends with a more formal valuation of the object. The artefacts so detailed do not figure directly in the story Paul tells, but they are connected with the secret of P&uuml;hap&auml;ev's death.The alternation between Paul's account and these intervening historical chapters makes for a schizophrenic novel. Unfortunately, the two different types of chapters differ from one another in more than subject matter. The historical chapters, perhaps surprisingly, are by far the more interesting in the book. They are well-written, vividly imagined self-standing pieces that quickly grab the reader's interest and very often end with a surprise buried in the formal description of the artefact under discussion. Paul's account, on the other hand--the meat of the book--is comparatively poorly written. The dialogue is often stilted and unnatural.\\"I won't pry too much by asking you about this music teacher, but if you're fond enough to blush over her, it must be something indeed. Good luck.\\"\\"Thank you.\\"Certain details in the story don't ring true. (After knowing Jadid for years, for example, Paul has never asked him about, or heard about from other students, the origin of the Professor's unusual accent? History departments employ their own night watchmen?) Some passages in the book don't seem to have any point to them (Paul's stop at a Portuguese bar at which he's refused service; his four-page conversation with an old girlfriend). None of Fasman's characters is developed enough to inspire emotional attachment. And Paul is never placed in any jeopardy worthy of the name: he may be frightened at various points in the story, that is, but the reader is never frightened for him. Finally, Fasman's story is just not very interesting. This is a shame, because as the historical chapters of the book make clear, he can write well, and he's clearly done his research for the book. There is a kernel of a very good story here which I wish additional rounds of editing had brought further to light.Debra Hamel -- author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece (Yale University Press, 2003)"},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"I like the comment by the critic Edmund Wilson \\"No two persons ever read the same book\\", and it surely applies here.It seems that author has put together the ingredients for an \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" type of arcane puzzle solving thriller, but has 2 different recipes, and skipped the proper marinating and presentation... the proverbial apples versus oranges.The alternating stories do not blend. Yes both have an shared interest in alchemy, but the 14 objects collected in the alternate tale are almost not relevant; there could be any number of different objects and it would not affect the story at all. And while each of these segments are interesting, the egregiously violent method of acquisition of each was a turnoff for me.While these objects are re-collected in a ruthless manner, our callow hero stumbles through a concealed thicket of secrets almost without a scratch. It reminds me of action movies where the bad guys miss a thousand times, but the good guy needs only one shot. Of course, it would have made a very short book if the style of behavior was consistent in both tales.Almost as lame is the resolution of the two tales, in effect using a narrator. As far a narrators go, I prefer \\"Plan Nine from Outer Space (the movie)\\"I finished the book hoping it would get better, but just a bad taste remains"},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"I bought this first-time novelist's book based on its promising storyline about a murder mystery involving ancient relic and was crudely compared to the Da Vinci Code in my local paper. Oh, boy, it is not even close. It is intertwined with isolated episodes about how these relics were robbed in the past, which collectively takes up to half the book's volume and turns out to have close to nothing to do with solving the so-called mystery. There is no suspense, no climax and no twist. The mystery was not fully solved and the gutless protagonist ended up just quitting both his investigation and his love affair, which I was shocked to find out after enduring the uneventful story."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"This book could have been so much more. Instead it grabs you with very cool short stories of mystical and possibly magical artifacts and their provenance only to let you down on the plot. It turns out that all those artifacts matter in the main story only as a collection. Not to use them in a story is actually a crime. You can't get people excited only to leave them abruptly in the cold, but that is exactly what the author does. The mystery is weak and extremely slow. And the resolution is even weaker and does not satisfy after all the build up of the individual artifacts. It is possible that the author was aiming for a sequel, but after such poor execution I, for one, would not be interested in a sequel in the slightest."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"Way back when before Grandpa was a boy (1154 AD to be precise), an Arab geographer assembled a collection of jewels, rocks, scientific instruments and art objects, which he kept in a strongbox. The box was stolen way back then and each item went its separate way. Surprisingly, almost all the objects ended up in the hands of the Russian mob. An obscure New England professor of obscure Eastern European origin is trying to reassemble the collection through dirty dealings with this crowd. A rookie newspaper reporter in a small New England town stumbles into the plot. The plot is a bit formulaic, moving somewhat predictably, beginning with an inventory of each item, its history, and how it ended up in this particular mobster's hands, usually preliminary to setting up a killing to get it back. At times the killings seem like they were scripted for a Friday the 13th sequel. And other than the jewels, the reader starts to wonder who really wants all this crap anyway. But the rookie reporter gets a love interest and the plot keeps moving. The novel has strong New England local color and is generally a good read."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"Jon Fasman's debut novel, The Geographer's Library, invariably draws comparisons with 'The DaVinci Code', as is to be expected, when a novel is such a 'behemoth' as 'DaVinci Code' is, any historical novel with religious over/undertones, about looking for a lost relic, or long-buried treasure is ripe for claims of being a 'rip-off' of a best-seller.But Fasman's idea is all his own. The death of a small-town college professors piques the interest of a local journalist, who decides to investigate the man's life and interests before writing his obituary. However, Paul Tom's investigations draws more questions than answers. Who was the mysterious professor, who reportedly didn't teach at all? Why did his employer, Tom's alma mater, cover up two gun-related incidents involving the professor? What was he in search of, which brought about his untimely death, and frequently landed him in a very out of the way watering hole, with decidedly UN-friendly patrons, and an even more unfriendly owner?Interspersed with dances through time to describe certain elemental 'collectables' that all play a part in this tale of alchemy, stolen artifacts, and secret agendas, Jon Fasman's first novel is an interesting mixture of past and present, fact and fantasy, truth and lies.A fast, easy read; The Geographer's Library kept me entertained from start to finish, as journalist Paul Tom uncovers the answers that he seeks.Recommended for those with an interest in historical fiction and ancient mysteries, this is a promising new voice in the genre."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"This book suffers the curse of the DaVince Code.

As the story began to develop, I felt that rush of the \\"this is interesting, and I can't wait to see what happens\\" feeling. Sadly, the last quarter of the book began to drain that feeling. Fasman developed an intriguing premise, some interesting characters, a \\"believable\\" storyline and history (understanding that, indeed, it WAS fictional), but the story became tedious, unbelievable, unsatisfying, and a HUGE letdown at the end.The headache of this book is that I really did feel that the potential was there. I wanted more. I wanted a better connection being the alternating \\"history\\" chapters and the current story. This connection was almost nonexistence. In fact, I can't fathom why there wasn't more of a connection. Wouldn't the editors at Penguin Books have asked this same question? Now, I'm not looking for a storyline that hits me between the eyes and doesn't require me to use my imagination and creativity, while expecting me to be somewhat intelligent. But those same requirements have me say, \\"Where is the meat on the bones here? Where's the beef?\\"Good to great potential, but this story fails to deliver the goods. I had higher hopes for The Geographer's Library."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"Well as a wannabe writer, I don't think Mr. Fasman did such a bad job. Like the Da Vinci code? Blech, I couldn't finish that book, it was both tedious and its historical facts were woefully inaccurate. But it was a pleasure to read the Geographer's Library, most of the characters were engaging, the descriptions of alchemical objects (and their fate) entertaining... but sadly, as other reviewers have noted, the already rather thin plot turned into mist at the end. Non-stop action I don't require, but a strong conclusion would have been nice. Still, it was pleasant immersing myself in the world of this book, and I look forward to seeing what Mr. Fasman is ultimately capable of."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"\\"The Geographer's Library\\" skilfully weaves together two story lines: the first being a present-day mystery about a deceased college professor, and the second a series of historical vignettes about fourteen antiquities that were stolen from a geographer's library in the twelfth century. The geographer al-Idris also dabbled in alchemy, and the ancient objects were all used in this science. From the first pages of the novel, I was hooked on both stories, and the pages simply flew past.The editorial review here on Amazon compared this book to \\"The DaVinci Code\\", but in my opinion this book is far more enjoyable. The characterization of the Connecticut protagonists is well-done. But my favorite part of the book is the background on the fourteen objects that were once part of the famous scholar al-Idris' library in Sicily. I whole-heartedly disagree with the reviewer who dismissed this part of the book as \\"too much information.\\"Author Fasman carefully develops the plot, tying together the connection between the ancient alchemical tools and the death of the mysterious Estonian professor in Connecticut. This story is full of beautiful prose and is a finely crafted mystery. I'd recommend it to all."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"\\"The Geographer's Library\\" is one of many new releases that have been favorably compared to \\"The DaVinci Code.\\" It is not that. Alan Furst, the accomplished author of WWII espionage thrillers, describes Jon Fasman's first novel as \\"a real reader's book.\\" It is definitely that. While lacking the adrenalin-charged pace of DaVinci Code, \\"Geographer\\" is a cleverly conceived, intelligent novel illuminating the ancient and shadowy art of alchemy. Paul Tomm, a young journalist for a rural Connecticut weekly paper, sets out on a supposedly simple assignment to write the obituary of town resident and college professor Jann Puhapaev. Puhapaev's death - and life, as it turns out - are shrouded in mystery, and Tomm is drawn into a deliciously convoluted plot spanning a millennium and four continents. A number of priceless artifacts, stolen from the alchemist of the 11th century's King of Sicily, begin showing up in unlikely places. With the help of a former professor and his policeman brother, Tomm begins connecting the dots while attracting some unwanted and malevolent attention. This is a risky venue, accomplished with aplomb in Dan Brown's \\"DaVinci\\", while more often attempts to capture Brown's formula have bogged down in hip-deep minutia and laughingly improbable plots. While Fasman's effort borders at times on tedium, there is sufficient mystery and intrigue to keep the reader hooked to the climax. \\"The Geographer's Library\\" could have benefited from a more ruthless editor's cut of another fifty pages or so, but this is nonetheless an impressive debut, well worth the reader's time and attention."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"As others have mentioned, there are two stories here: the present-day mystery and the ancient story related to alchemy.The mystery surrounding the death of Jaan is competently told, but it didn't engage me probably because of the hapless nature of the main character, Paul, and because this plot is relatively simple and uninteresting. The intersection of this story with the ancient story could have made it a much more interesting mystery, except that the ancient story was the biggest disappointment in the book.It was disappointing because the author failed to develop the sense of wonder and excitement around the ancient objects that might have made the story compelling and interesting. In fact, the objects which play such a large role in the text play virtually no role at all in the plot, which I found very puzzling and frustrating. I waited in vain for the book to tie these objects to the plot, to make them relevant and interesting.Here's another way of expressing why I was disappointed. I felt like there might have been a centuries-long, fascinating story that tied all of the objects together---but that I was sitting on the very periphery of that story with only a few not very interesting glimpses of that story as they reflected on the rather mundane present-day mystery plot.I don't recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"Captivating Intellectual MysteryReview of: \\"The Geographers Library\\"By: Jon FasmanThis is one of my all time favorite books.It starts in a routine job setting for a recent college graduate.

Readers who enjoy esoteric historical mysteries will really enjoy Fasman's offering and find themselves hooked until the final secrets of the mystery are revealed.Fasman lays out the story slowly and carefully. His writing is bright, colorful, and intelligent; and it is uniformly interesting in its details and gripping in the mystery that it weaves. The main narrative follows Paul Tomm, a young reporter working for a small-town newspaper. A college professor dies, and Tomm is assigned to write the obituary. Unsurprisingly, Tomm's assignment entails more work than a typical death notice. I will not reveal the details of Tomm's investigation, lest I give away the secrets of the mystery.Tomm's first-person story alternates with chapters that comprise the contents of a \\"library\\" put together by a 12th century figure, nobly named Yussef Hadras ibn Azzam Abd Salih Jafar Khalid Idris. The library chapters detail various exotic objects that have a relation to the practice of alchemy. Each chapter tells a story about the object's origins and its current situation. It is clear that the library contents and Tomm's investigation are intriguing connected.Fasman takes the reader to many sites around the world: C&oacute;rdoba, Baghdad, Bukhara, Mikkouni, the Khamantor Mountains of the Khazars, the cities of Yazd, Eshahan, Ahvaz, Dimashq, Beirut and Jerusalem, the islands of Sicily, Malta and Minorca, and, of course, New England, where Tomm is living and working to unravel the mystery of the professor's death. It is a fascinating journey for the reader, involving numerous interesting characters and engrossing situations. The book is a sheer joy to read, not just to find out whodunit, but to enjoy the many stories within the main story. The journey to the end of the tale is as much fun as the tale itself.In his review in the LA Times, Allen Kurzweil aptly says: \\"Alchemy, Fasman tells us more than once, is the science of transformation. Good fiction aspires to the same lofty goal, and it is achieved in 'The Geographer's Library,' a cabinet of wonders written by a novelist whose surname and sensibility fit comfortably on the shelf between Umberto Eco and John Fowles.\\" I agree."},{"Title":"The Geographer's Library","review":"This entry in the intellectual thriller stakes is a beautifully written book which kept me engrossed all the way up until the bitterly disappointing corner first-time novelist Fasman paints himself into. The engrossing story proceeds on two tracks which unravel via alternating chapters. The main plotline is set in a small town in Connecticut, where fairly bright recent college grad Paul Tomm passes the time working at the rinky-dink town newspaper. The local death of a reclusive Estonian history professor piques his interest, and he starts nosing around the story. Since the man taught at Paul's alma mater and was a colleague of Paul's advisor, he manages to enlist the considerable aid of the sharp advisor in learning more about the mysterious Estonian. At the same time, a pretty older woman catches Paul's eye, and the semi-bashful young man enters into a suspiciously intense relationship with her.Meanwhile, the alternating chapters unveil the second storyline, which starts some nine-hundred years previously with the life of the famed Arab geographer, al-Idrisi. Fasman casts the (real life) descendent of the Prophet Muhammad as an alchemist whose collection of powerful objects was purloined by a Sicilian burglar and then dispersed around the world. Ranging across the world and time, each chapter picks up the story of one of the objects in the intervening 900 years, and shows how it has been tracked down and acquired, along with details on its manufacture and even a drawing. Although it takes a while to emerge, by the final third of the book it becomes apparent that the objects are being reunited by some unseen hand.Of course the two storylines eventually dovetail, and Paul finds himself entangled in a centuries-long struggle for knowledge. This all works quite well until events come to a head and Fasman is forced to either have Paul reveal the supernatural workings of alchemy for all the world to see, or fade quietly into the night, unable to prove anything. The ending takes the more plausible route, which is also the one best in keeping with the overall tone, but it's not particularly satisfying. The one other substantial quibble I would have is that the relationship between Paul and the woman is so obviously off-kilter that it's hard to believe he wouldn't become suspicious of her. His youth and inexperience are meant to explain this away, but it's hard to buy when, as the reader, you smell a rat from the first time she appears. In any event, it's still a very entertaining and exceedingly well-written novel, and if you enter it with low expectations concerning the ending, it should prove an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Essential Guide to Object Monitors","review":"The Essential Guide to Object Monitors provides a concise and well written guide to object technology. This guide is essential for anyone-especially people who are not software developers-who needs a thorough understanding of distributed object technology. The book begins with a excellent explanation of middleware technology, CORBA, DCOM, and application servers. The next section focuses on reviews of specific products and the pros and cons of using these products for specific development projects with regards to interoperability, scalability, high availability, robustness, security, and manageability. Overall, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Essential Guide to Object Monitors","review":"As advertised, I thought this book provided an excellant introduction to middleware and the OTM market as well as a good overview of the key players. The book is perfect for those readers looking for an easy to understand guide to the products. I should note that anyone looking for code examples or deep technical details would be disappointed to find this isn't the right book for them (I wasn't so it was great for me)."},{"Title":"Essential Guide to Object Monitors","review":"The next big wave in software technology is the use of distributed objects for the application architectures.Distributed objects are becoming the brick and the mortar of software development. Object monitors will eventually replace classical TP monitors. If you need a high level overview of the object monitors and the current products in the market this is the best book one can afford."},{"Title":"Essential Guide to Object Monitors","review":"While I've been doing object-oriented programming for several years, I was somewhat new to the object middleware space. This book provided an in-depth examination of individual products, and somehow made a complicated subject easy to comprehend. Overall, this is a great book!

It tells you most everything you might want to know on the subject in an entertaining and delightful way."},{"Title":"Essential Guide to Object Monitors","review":"This is the best object monitor book I have ever read. The writing is precise, logically presented, and a pleasure to read. Looking forward to seeing more books by this author."},{"Title":"Essential Guide to Object Monitors","review":"This is the sort of book that gives software a bad name. It's superficial, doesn't support its claims with any substance, and resorts to evaluating products like IBM's CB without ever using it. They claim they've written substantial pieces of code with each product. I'd love to see it, and then I might be able to understand where they're coming from."},{"Title":"The Glove of Darth Vader (Star Wars Jedi Prince, Book 1)","review":"I loved this book! The first time I read it it took me about 5 days but it was good. A lot of stuff that happened would never be in a Timothy Zahn type EU. The book is more aimed for ages 7 to 11 with the simple vocabulary and the pictures. It also isn't very graphic when someone gets killed. A typical killing part would be \\"Luke swung his lightsaber at the stormtrooper and he fell to the ground.\\" But, even though it is old, I love it anyways. I especially love the fight scenes and the characters. There is also a part where they harbor whales and like take their blubber. 'Zorba the Hutt's Revenge' , the sequel would have to be my favorite but I have always loved this one."},{"Title":"The Glove of Darth Vader (Star Wars Jedi Prince, Book 1)","review":"The second book in this series is better - so keep reading. --Andrew As a mom, I really liked these books - they are clean, entertaining and true to the original movies. --Mom"},{"Title":"The Glove of Darth Vader (Star Wars Jedi Prince, Book 1)","review":"I LOVE &quot;THE GLOVE OF DARTH VADER&quot; People who have been badmouthing it are idiots. At the end of the movie trilogy, the Empire was in bad shape. This shows how they re-organized. There's a race to get to be the new Emperor, like King Arthur and the sword - whoever finds Darth Vader's glove (which Luke cut off along with Vader's hand) is the new Emperor. According to a prophecy by a cool new group of Imperials, the Prophets of the Dark Side. R2 and C3PO start out the incredible adventure. A MUST READ! If adults don't like it, they should go back to HEIR TO THE EMPIRE and stop insulting books that work for us. A 5th grader. P.S. The whole series by Paul and Hollace Davids is great. Pam"},{"Title":"The Glove of Darth Vader (Star Wars Jedi Prince, Book 1)","review":"Well.... This book would be good if you happen to be ten years old. For me, even at age ten it didn't quite have the Star Wars feel, though I did find it interesting enough to want to read the rest of the series. Continuity though is important to me, and this book had none of it. However I will say that this series would be good for kids too young to read say, Heir to the Empire, but would still like to know what happened next. I personally thought that the characters did not act like they should, and the writing was somewhat cheesy. Older fans would definitly do better with Young Jedi Knights or some of the adult novels."},{"Title":"The Glove of Darth Vader (Star Wars Jedi Prince, Book 1)","review":"These books were meant for children NOT ADULTS! Therefore they need not be constant with the other books that were made for big boys and girls! I really don't think a child will care weather or not Luke flies a Y-wing or X-wing or if it doesn't correspond with the Thrawn trilogy! Children most likely wouldn't be found reading a novel like Heir to the Empire anyway! I bought this book for my friend's younger brother and I skimmed through it. No, TARKIN WAS NOT THE ONLY GRAND MOFF! IN THE MOVIES YES, BUT IN THE GALAXY, NO! DARTH VADER WAS THE ONLY DARK LORD OF THE SITH IN THE MOVIES BUT THERE WERE OBVIOUSLY MORE OF THEM BEFORE HIM! If you're mad at this author for it then also be mad at Zhan because in the Hand of Thrawn saga one of his bad guys is (suprise suprise) a Grand Moff! These stories entertained my friend's little brother greatly. He felt like he was like his big brother and me who were always talking about all the Star Wars novels. These are excellent books for the younger generation that they were meant for. Face it. Star Wars isn't just for the 20+ year old age group it once was. The Special Edition changed that, therefor it was a success."},{"Title":"The Glove of Darth Vader (Star Wars Jedi Prince, Book 1)","review":"This is a book for young adults.

(The search for the glove of vader) Young Star Wars fans will LOVE this book!"},{"Title":"The Glove of Darth Vader (Star Wars Jedi Prince, Book 1)","review":"This book in my opinion is for kids 6-10,no older. When the evil self-proclaimed son of the emperor Trioculus takes hold of the throne (with the help of Grand Moff Hissa & the Commitee of Grand Moffs),only Luke and his friends can stop him. Now Trioculus must find the indestructible right-hand Glove of Darth Vader. Supreme Prophet of the Dark Side Kaddan predicted that the next ruler will wear the Glove of Darth Vader! Then Trioculus gets a message from a imperiel named Captain Dunwell saying that he perhaps has found the Glove of Darth Vader!!! Dunwell runs a factory which butchers Waladones. The whale-like Waladones are intelligent sea creatures that live in the oceans of Mon Calamari. Luke and Acbar go to Mon Calamari to save the Waladons. But the leader Waladon Leviathor (the last great white waladon) is captured by Dunwell. But I won't spoil the suprising conclusions. May I note that the only characters that act like themsalves are C-3PO and R2-D2. The pictures of Luke are highly distorted and Acbar is a wimp. But this is good for kids who are not able to read bigger Star Wars books."},{"Title":"The Glove of Darth Vader (Star Wars Jedi Prince, Book 1)","review":"As much as I respect authors who put effort in to writing books, I honestly did not like this sorry attempt to continue the story of Star Wars.I understand that it was not written for adults, and therfore is made to read easier and a little bit easier to understand as well.The novel attempted to include things that don't belong in the Star Wars series and re-used ideas that were good, but had been done before."},{"Title":"The Glove of Darth Vader (Star Wars Jedi Prince, Book 1)","review":"I think these books take place after Truce at Bakura So I have placed themon the timeline at year 5 and 6 ANH.

But yes, I bought the book and the series, Read them one or twice, got bored and put them up, then my sister comes along.... And to the comment about that perosn who claims he or she is a arthur himself I dought it. It is probably just trying to make it look worse then it is already getting treated.

First of all, there is a reason that this series doesn't fit with the other Star Wars books. It wasn't meant to. This series was directed at a younger group unlike the other ones, the 300+ page books. They published this series so children would be able to enjoy a sequel to the Star Wars trilogy without having to read the bigger and harder books.

It was so stupid and childish that I felt like scribbling all over it. Trioculus was a jerk &amp; not very impressive. I expected an Imperial to be more impressive. One thing that really bothered me was that the author kept on making LUke fly Y-wings. I mean, Luke flies X-wings!! He did in the movies &amp; in the books. There were a bunch of other stupid things in the book. And one friendly comment to the author : Watch the movies."},{"Title":"The Glove of Darth Vader (Star Wars Jedi Prince, Book 1)","review":"The book had a lot of details I think it was great. I especially liked it when Artoo started the self-destruct system and freed the Waladons. I was surprised when I found out that Trioculus was not Emperor Palpatine's son.

Then I got into the adult books (WAY BETTER!) and noticed that they have no continuity with each other. After having read many SW books now and am familiar with the SW timeline, I have concluded that every SW book fits in to the timeline except for this series. Therefore, it should be burned and forgotten about. Lucasfilm made a terrible mistake in publishing these. Not only do they contradict all the other novels, their stories aren't anywhere near as good as the others. Do yourself a favor and don't ruin your perception of the SW universe with these. Go out and read the adult books like the Thrawn Trilogy by Timothy Zahn. You can read any other kids books too, but don't read the six in this series. They aren't even included in official timelines anymore. They don't truly belong in the Star Wars universe. I feel sorry for the authors, though. They tried, but I guess they didn't know what was going to happen to these stories."},{"Title":"The Glove of Darth Vader (Star Wars Jedi Prince, Book 1)","review":"This book, and all of the series, was porly writen , and made me think that the author didn't do any research at all.
