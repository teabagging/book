In one-on-ones, I've been told that the process was both enlightening and useful on a daily basis.If you're looking for pure DiSC, look elsewhere.

This is a great book about kids rooms. I like that the style isn't all focused on TV characters or really childish themes. Instead it shows rooms that leaves room for individual creativity. If you are a parent like me who spends time in your child's room and want to make it a space that you also like being in this book will inspire you. There isn't any how-tos in this book just descriptions and the resource guide in the back of the book won't help you to create these rooms since most of the objects in them have been lovingly created.

I was looking for a book that showed childrens' rooms with bright colors and a simplistic look and how to decorate on a budget. This book does not fit that bill. As soon as I opened the book and paged through the images I got such a sad feeling. The rooms are all very dull and cluttered. Stuff sitting on shelves and bookcases haphazardly. No true color scheme. Most of the items pictured were vintage style - very 1970's. While I appreciate the message behind the designs - focusing on children's artwork, keeping with an eclectic theme, etc. - the rooms just depressed me. They have some great toys pictured (Keith Haring rocker, Kapla Blocks) - and a few of the rooms are cute. But I would truly hate for my children to have bedrooms like these. If you are looking for clean lines, bright colors - think Haba, Pottery Barn kids, Ikea - this is not the book for you. If you are into thrift shops, vintage toys and a hodgepodge/nothing really matches look - then you may love this book.Rooms to grow In - Little Folk Art's great rooms for babies, kids, and teens by Susan Salzman and Daryn Eller is a much better representation of vintage style/decorate with what you already have kind of book. The rooms pictured in this book are much more pleasing to the eye - they have a happier feel - and a much more aesthetically pleasing look."},{"Title":"Cool Kid's Room","review":"I thought just about all the rooms were just so-so.

My bird is just not warm. I mean he doesn't need any humans for anything, so training him is going to take me YEARS. He trys to bite my hands any time he sees them, even if I'm 2 feet away. This book just gives lip service to this problem (and advises not to buy from a pet store- not always an option). I just wish some of these experts would listen to their own advice (she admits over and over how individual each bird's personality is), and cover some of the worst personality problems.Having said that, I have no other complaints. It's a good read, reinforcing many of the little things you eventually find out as a bird \\"owner\\". I especially recommend this book for those who think they want a parrot. Please read this front to back first. It actually gets a lot of the impending headaches (and heartaches) out in the open. So when problems (other than mine) do come up, you will be well-armed. I learned how to towel a bird after 25 years, and the first time, my cockatiel turned into a little nursling. I would never have thought it would work, but it went great, and now I can at least grooom his feathers and nails when needed.So if your on your fist avian adventure, get this now.

More than HALF of this book is dedicated, not to training, but to generic parrot ownership. Finally, on page 109, you get to the Step Up chapter. PAGE ONE-OH-NINE! In fact, I would say that only 4 chapters out of 12 are actually devoted to training. NONE of this book is as devoted to training, or as in depth, as I would like and never once talks about the recall trick I want to learn.I do have some very serious issues with this book:The entire chapter on hand feeding is horrible. Hand feeding is a technique that should be taught in person by a trained professional and never attempted by a novice. It can lead to life long emotional problems, malnutrition, burns, and bacterial infections. Most times it ends in tragedy with a dead baby. How this woman could dare put an entire chapter in a book supposedly about TRAINING! makes me angry.On top of that, whether to clip the wings is a highly contested subject. There's no consensus. So why she keeps insisting, very rudely, that you have to clip is beyond me. She should tell the pros and cons and WHAT THE HECK DOES IT HAVE TO DO IN A BOOK ABOUT TRAINING.Sure, if you've never owned a parrot, never read a book about parrots, and are ready to give this woman and her cute little drawings a chance... well... don't.

I was greatly disappointed. Aside from a passing reference that budgies are hardier than some parrot species and that they can indeed learn to talk (both painfully obvious to any budgie owner), there is nothing at all. It is pretty obvious that she has never owned one. The author makes the assumption that, because budgies are parrots, they must be the same as every other kind of parrot that she has owned. And that they are not! This book is filled with misinformation that is thoroughly and completely refuted in other books written specifically for these little birds. For the budgie owner there is no reason at all to buy this book.For owners of other times of parrots, I would consider looking elsewhere. The book is filled to the brim with preachy, top-of-the-soapbox lectures that are uninteresting, redundant, and obnoxious. If you actually made it through the first few chapters, which outlined in detail what a bad person you are for wanting to own a parrot in the first place, to the chapter where training is actually addressed, you might be disappointed to learn that it consists of only getting your bird to come to your hand from the t-stand, from inside and from on top of the cage (my budgie could do that after about a day!). Want to know the secret of getting your bird to talk?

If you don't have a parrot and are planning on it, read the book to get a reality check. Don't buy a parrot on a whim and have a 30 or 40 year potential nightmare on your hands.

Follow the drinking gourd\\" So cute!"},{"Title":"Follow The Drinking Gourd (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Dragonfly Books)","review":"Follow the Drinking Gourd, written and illustrated by Jeanette Winter, is a fictionalized story about the famous Underground Railroad conductor, Peg Leg Joe. In this book, Jeanette Winter tells the story of a group of slaves who, with the help of Peg Leg Joe, escape from slavery. When Peg Leg Joe teaches the slaves a song about following the drinking gourd, five slaves, Molly, James, Isaiah, old Hattie, and George, follow the directions in the song to escape to freedom. The story describes their flee to freedom and the trials that they had to face, such as hiding in trees, crossing rivers, and withstanding the weather. Eventually, this group of slaves meets up again with Peg Leg Joe, and he helps them find the Underground Railroad that takes them to Canada.Along with the wonderful story, this book provides many different aspects that could be integrated into the Social Studies lesson. At the beginning of the book, there is a note about the story that gives further information to the book. It is a great reference for teachers to use before they read, as well as for older students who would want to know more about the story. At the end of the story, there is sheet music for the drinking gourd song that is sung throughout the book. This would be a great way to incorporate fine arts into a Social Studies Lesson. Along with this great story, Jeanette Winter provides excellent folk art illustrations that bring the story to life. The illustrations are easy to understand and really depict what this story is about.This book is a great book to use when teaching a Social Studies unit on slavery and the Civil War to elementary students, kindergarten and older. The book shows the hardships that slaves had to endure, while staying appropriate for elementary students. When comparing this book to the NCSS (National Council for the Social Studies) standards, I found that it met several of the standards. For the Culture standard, this book teaches students about cultural diversity. Students can look at how our culture has developed from a segregated community, to one that embraces equality among different races. This book also meets the Time, Continuity, and Change standard. Students are able to learn about the beliefs of the past and how different events, such as the Underground Railroad, shaped our country's development. Lastly, the standard about civic ideals and practices focuses on teaching students about what it means to be a good citizen. The teacher could teach this by discussing how Peg Leg Joe was being a good citizen by helping the slaves escape from slavery.I think that this is a great book that should be incorporated into any elementary classroom. I recommend it to all readers and teachers."},{"Title":"Follow The Drinking Gourd (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Dragonfly Books)","review":"We bought this book for my 4yr old when we visited an underground railroad museum in Upstate New York. This books enlightens young children in a digestible manner on the topic of slavery and the underground railroad. Facts are laid out in a story manner with characters the children can connect with and follow. The illustrations are fantastic, bright, and clear. The songs in the book are also educational and interesting. My son was very intrigued when read this book and he had many, many questions on the topic. I highly recommend this book if you are looking to begin discussions on American slavery with your child. I have also used it since with my first grade classroom with the same wonderful results. Children were all very interested and engaged in the learning process. In short, this is a great book for a home or classroom library."},{"Title":"Follow The Drinking Gourd (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Dragonfly Books)","review":"Excellent book for a child that is needing information for the time of slavery.

We listen to this song, and they try to decode what it is about. I read this book to them to \\"crack the code.\\" I like how it personalizes he story to be about specific people. The songs itself has been changed over the years, and the legends about it have grown, so this is a good book for the classroom."},{"Title":"Follow The Drinking Gourd (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Dragonfly Books)","review":"During the time of slavery in the United States, many slaves were able to escape and find their way north to freedom by following the Drinking Gourd--Big Dipper. As the note at the beginning of this historical children's book tells, slaves learned a folk song entitled \\"Follow the Drinking Gourd\\". Masters and overseers thought the song harmless, though nonsensical. The song actually embedded directions on how to escape from the South into freedom in the North. I had known all of this before reading FOLLOW THE DRINKING GOURD. What I didn't know was about legendary Underground Railroad conductor, Peg Leg Joe.Using the lyrics of the song \\"Follow the Drinking Gourd\\" and the legend of Peg Leg Joe, Winter crafts a short tale about a slave family that follows the directions of the song that Joe teaches them to escape to freedom next spring. Accompanying the text are Winter's earth-toned illustrations displaying the family's escape and the dangers they endure on their journey.The last page of the book contains the lyrics and music to the folk song \\"Following the Drinking Gourd.\\"FOLLOW THE DRINKING GOURD is an excellent tool in introducing children to the Underground Railroad. It's also a good story in teaching astronomy classes to illustrate how the stars have been used for different purposes throughout time."},{"Title":"Follow The Drinking Gourd (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Dragonfly Books)","review":"I used this book to help fulfill a story project requirement for my Children's Literature class at Kent State University. A partner and I read this book to two second-grade classes, who listened attentively. This version of the story has less text than Bernardine Connelly's version (same title), which made it appropriate for reading aloud within a limited time. The students seemed to enjoy the repetition of the song lyrics throughout. The illustrations are striking, with interesting and unusual color choices. The skin tones of the African-American characters are quite lovely, ranging from mahogany to very dark brown. Bright purples and oranges in the illustrations also stand out. The characters are depicted in a wide range of ages, from &quot;Old Hattie&quot; to &quot;Little Isaiah.&quot; We used this book in conjunction with explanations of the Underground Railroad and another book, Barefoot by Pamela Duncan Edwards, as well as poems by African-American poet Langston Hughes. The difficult topics of selling slaves at auction, running away, and the fears the runaways had are sensitively treated. At the end of the book, when freedom is reached and Old Hattie exclaims, &quot;'Five more souls are safe!'&quot; I heard a collective gasp of emotion from the children. These students really seemed to enjoy learning about the Underground Railroad and how slaves escaped their bondage. The fact that we usually call the Drinking Gourd constellation the Big Dipper did take some repeated explanation on the part of the storytellers."},{"Title":"Follow The Drinking Gourd (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Dragonfly Books)","review":"My daughter read this book in her kindergarten class during Black history month and we loved it so much we bought a copy.

I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Follow The Drinking Gourd (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Dragonfly Books)","review":"This fine story teaches even the smallest of children about the evil of slavery in pre-Civil War America. It shows a desire for freedom so strong that men, women and children risked their lives to escape on the Underground Railroad, following the largest star in the Drinking Gourd of the title (The Big Dipper).The book introduces the idea of slavery, the separation of families, the sale of human beings at auctions, and the difficulties that people endured to escape--hiding in trees to avoid hounds, sleeping by day, sometimes on empty stomachs, and walking at night, sometimes without stars to guide them. Sometimes people along the way were kind, providing bacon and corn bread to share, helping them across the Ohio River, and hiding them in the attics and barns of safe houses.The story's dramatic simplicity grasps and holds children. They fasten to it, eager to learn about the bonds that once tied African-Americans and the freedom for which they naturally yearned.The book is a song of freedom. Alyssa A.

I assumed the information to be true as published. Further study, however, showed me that the story behind Follow the Drinking Gourd is most likely not fact, but an American Folk Tale used as a \\"representation\\" of how escaping to freedom might have happened. I could not find proof that Peg Leg Joe was a real Underground Railroad agent or conductor, and I also came to find that the lyrics to Follow the Drinking Gourd (as printed in the book) were rewritten by another folk artist to include the chorus, \\"The old man is a-waitin' for to carry you to freedom if you follow the drinking gourd\\" some 80+ years after the song was originally written or communicated.All-in-all, great literature, illustrations that capture the intensity of escaping to freedom, and a \\"secret code.\\" What more can a kid (or big kid, in my case) ask for?"},{"Title":"Follow The Drinking Gourd (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Dragonfly Books)","review":"A wonderful story about a family escaping slavery using astronomy and song.

The book introduces the legendary figure Peg-Leg Joe, a white carpenter who works as a day laborer on different southern plantations, where he teaches enslaved workers how to escape north via a song titled \\"Follow the Drinking Gourd\\" (a reference to the Big Dipper and its position in the spring sky).

The author gives a view of simple life (albeit a boy's tough life growing up in poverty and trying to make his own way in the world back in the 40's and 50's). I believe he reaffirms that life's simple pleasures(i.e., biking, fishing and camping on the river, playing w/ toy soilders and &quot;exploding them&quot; in the back yard, sharing a first kiss, etc.) are what life as a kid is all about.The reason for Ken's book is to share his memoirs w/ his grandchildren. Little does he realize he's sharing more of himself to his now grown children and the rest of the world who &quot;thought&quot; they knew who he really was. We can appreciate this man for how well he has turned out dispite almost dying at the tender age of two, being left by his father at four, and raised by a single mother while in living in poverty.It's a nice read if you're looking for a &quot;feel good&quot; book. I thoroughly enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Scott's Addition","review":"This is more than a coming of age book. It is a growing into adult book where the &quot;hero&quot; is led into maturity by a caring community around him. In poverty, but never poor, this neighborhood stood as one family in post WWII Richmond.Being from Richmond, Scott's Addition brought back fond memories to me of Tobacco Bowl parades, Elvis' concerts and loved eating places. It is funny, it is sad. It faces the issues of prejudice and bigotry in the light of the 40's &amp; 50's. I found the book easy to read and easy to relate to.

This is one, and Pierre Berton is almost the only author whose works made that list more than once. The War of 1812 is a generally neglected subject in America, except perhaps for the New Orleans campaign of 1815. Berton writes from a distinctly Canadian viewpoint, although he writes so wonderfully that even the most chauvinistic American will hardly notice and won't care. Any time I begin to write something that I hope readers will enjoy beyond simple information, I try to look back over a little of Berton's work in vain hopes of picking up something of his incomparable style."},{"Title":"Flames Across the Border, 1813-1814","review":"It is a pity that Americans do not understand nor have any knowledge of the War of 1812.

Richard Lederer's Get Thee to a Punnery: An Anthology of Intentional Assaults Upon the English Language is neither a footnote-heavy treatise on literary puns through the ages (although he quotes a few from Shakespeare). Neither is it a collection of groan-inducing puns (although it has a few of those as well).Instead, Lederer takes a middle ground of sorts and breaks puns down into a number of categories. Strange, but I had never thought of puns as being anything but a low form of humor before. It's like finding out your crazy old uncle who was forever trying to get you to \\"pull my finger\\" had once been the Royal Court Jester.I could have probably done without some of the exercises in the book which seemed like unnecessary padding. But that's just my preference. The rest of the book made for an enjoyable and fairly quick read."},{"Title":"Get Thee to a Punnery","review":"This book was not nearly as good as Anguished English. For people who get a kick out of puns, it's great, but otherwise, don't bother. It is mostly a list of &#34;complete the pun.&#34; If you don't like that kind of thing, it is a waste of money.

They had energetic discussions about the issues Hochschild raises and the people he portrays: &quot;Fishhooks and Chickens&quot; led to some strong opinions on U.S. foreign policy, &quot;Summer of Violence&quot; prompted them to discuss their own civil-rights heroes, and the piece on ex-racist Floyd Cochran elicited opinions on reform and forgiveness.

The spelling is inconsistent and doesn't provide help with pronunciation, definitions are often incomplete or inaccurate, no information is provided on ablaut and other features of the words, example sentences and collocations are scarce and their translations inaccurate.Buechel's dictionary is a typical example of lexicographical work done by the early missionaries among native people; it is a mixture of very careful and very careless work. There is much valuable data in this dictionary, collected by Buechel from fluent speakers, but there is also equally as much, or even more, data that is highly problematic and in fact incorrect. Unless you are a native speaker of the language you won't be able to tell the valuable data from the inaccurate text. During the 20 years of our work on the New Lakota Dictionary (New Lakota Dictionary) over 300 fluent native speaker were involved in checking words from the Buechel dictionary (apart from other sources) and this work revealed that a large percentage of the Buechel dictionary entries are highly problematic, for one reason or another.Most of the words in this dictionary were actually borrowed from the Dakota dictionary published by Riggs in 1852. The Riggs dictionary contains some 21,000 word entries and Buechel's around 24,000 entries. The two dictionaries overlap in approximately 18,000 entries, and in about 15,500 of them Buechel's definitions are identical to those given by Riggs. Although Dakota and Lakota are very closely related, their significant lexical differences do not always allow Lakota words to be generated by applying Lakota phonetics to Dakota words. This, however, is precisely what Buechel did in a large number of cases.The Reverend Paul Manhart S.J. who edited the manuscript after Buechel's death, made highly controversial editorial decisions, in particular he changed Buechel's accurate spelling system with a very complex system of diacritical marks. Yet, to make it worse, the conversion was done inconsistently resulting in completely unreliable spelling. In the first edition of the Buechel dictionary, published by the Red Cloud School, the diacritics that Manhart didn't manage to omit were at least legible. In this edition by Nebraska Press they are hardly so and the whole spelling problem is made so much worse.This Lakota dictionary is unreliable for a number of reasons, some of which are mentioned above.

Until last year, this dictionary was the only comprehensive one out there, so we used it but there were obvious flaws. The pronunciation was not clearly indicated and the verbs, especially, were missing a great deal of important information.In addition, this dictionary assumed a certain amount of knowledge from the user and therefore is not very user-friendly or clear, especially to the beginner or early intermediate.The Buechel dictionary is over 50 years old and it is outdated no matter how many new printings it undergoes. Some of the words in it are obsolete, in fact, and are not used by speakers today.If you wish to buy a Lakota dictionary with sterling example sentences, user-friendly orthographics for pronunciation and complete, up-to-date information on grammar (especially on verbs, which are arguably the most difficult part of the language), I strongly recommend that you consider the \\"New Lakota Dictionary\\" by the Lakota Language Consortium (LLC) instead and not waste your hard-earned money on an obsolete, inferior dictionary like Buechel. I know it was considered good for a long time, but that time has passed.The \\"New Lakota Dictionary\\" is so far superior in every way to Buechel that I and my entire class completely changed over our spelling system to match the NLD and I have not touched my Buechel dictionary since buying this one.The NLD also has an excellent grammar section in the center with clear, concise explanations of various aspects of the Lakota language so, once you have purchased it, you don't need other textbooks for grammar. This one dictionary has it all.If you truly wish to buy the best Lakota dictionary currently available, I strongly urge you to buy the New Lakota Dictionary and forgo the outdated, more difficult-to-use Buechel dictionary. Why not get the best for your money?I should mention that I have no ulterior motives at all in recommending the LLC or their dictionary; this is just the truth as I see it from being a long-time student and teacher of the Lakota language.You deserve the best, so please buy the \\"New Lakota Dictionary\\" and forget Buechel!"},{"Title":"Lakota Dictionary: Lakota-English / English-Lakota, New Comprehensive Edition","review":"This is a good dictionary with lots of specific detail and sample sentences under each entry.

The original edition of Buechel's dictionary had lots of problems of its own. This new edition prepared by Manhart not only does not improve the old problems, but makes them worse and creates new ones.Manhart ruined the spelling in the original version already, but at least it was possible to read what he typed. In this version the font is so small and the diacritics marking contrasting sounds so similar that it is almost impossible to distinguish them. Plain unaspirated stops (k, p, t) are marked with a superscript dot and aspirated stops (well, some of them) with a superscript diacritic just a tiny bit larger than a dot. No wonder that the editor himself was unable to apply the two diacritics consistently. For instance the p in the word sinkpe 'muskrat' is marked as plain (which is incorrect because it is supposed to be aspirated) while the four derivatives of the word oscillate between plain and aspirated. The \\"t\\" in sinte 'tail' is correctly marked as plain but in sintehla 'rattlesnake (rattling tail)' it is unmarked (which in the chosen orthography means aspirated). Such errors are pervasive throughout the dictionary.The small size of the diacritics and their inconsistent usage make the dictionary completely unreliable because the ability to distinguish plain stops from aspirated is essential to Lakota sound system as they frequently contrast meaning. The spelling is unreliable in other respects as well.In the original edition most of the example sentences were not translated. This edition provides the translations but they are written in un-idiomatic English and in the most part are incorrect interpretations of the original Lakota sentences. For instance: \\"Kinyekiyapi wan tima tokel kagapi kin wanyankin na iwacingnuniyan ayuta\\" - 'He looked upon with wonder and saw how the inside of an airplane was made. (page 132) The better translation should be: \\"He saw how they were building an airplane inside and marveled at it.\\"A large percentage of the entries in the original edition of the Buechel dictionary is problematic, words that are incorrectly spelled, inadequately defined or representing words that are not part of the language at all. There was obviously no field work or research done to fix these problems in this new edition. If you want to know more about why the Buechel dictionary is unreliable in many respects, read the introduction to the New Lakota Dictionary where it is all described in much detail. Since the publication of the New Lakota Dictionary the Buechel dictionary can no longer be considered the standard Lakota dictionary or the most comprehensive Lakota dictionary. In fact, it is clear now that it is fundamentally flawed. If you want to have a reliable reference on the language buy theNew Lakota DictionaryIt is the first dictionary of the language that uses consistent spelling and in which all words were checked with fluent speakers."},{"Title":"Lakota Dictionary: Lakota-English / English-Lakota, New Comprehensive Edition","review":"I have been studying the Lakhota language for years, as a child and an adult. Unfortunately it has been self study, with the help of resources such as the Buechel dictionary. At one time I was very grateful for the Buechel dictionary, and I do not mean to disrespect the value of Buechel's work. However, it was very frustrating to work with.I recommend instead the New Lakota Dictionary, which renders all others obsolete!New Lakota DictionaryThe orthography allows learners to \\"read\\" the correct pronunciation, and all entries are checked by actual speakers of the language! (You might assume that all dictionaries are, but you would be wrong!) It also includes information on all four Dakota dialects (Yankton-Yanktonai (Western Dakota), and Santee-Sisseton (Eastern Dakota)) by each applicable entry.The many example sentences, notes on how often words are used and in what way (if they are still common or if they are archaic), and the surprisingly approachable (and long) grammar section also make the New Dictionary an excellent resource for beginners. The Lakota Language Consortium's language forum is another invaluable resource. This forum, and the New Lakota Dictionary, have advance my rate of learning exponentially (and significantly decreased learning frustration!!) With this dictionary I finally feel I can put sentences together with confidence.Just when you thought it couldn't get any better, the Lakota Language Consortium is a non-profit organization, so your money actually goes to the revitalization of the Lakhota language when buying the New Lakota Dictionary (I assume it goes towards the Nebraska Press with this one ...)I feel I should reassure you that I am a real person and am in no way affiliated with the Lakota Language Consortium or the New Lakota Dictionary, other than that I am a big fan.

I didn't like it at first because it has different spelling, but she has been reading words from it and I recognize a lot of words that my parents used to use and I haven't heard them for a long time. It feels good to hear them again. Now I see that my grandchildren can read this new spelling better than the one in the Buchel dictionary. That is good, because they want to learn the language.

She is four years old and hasn't been exposed much to the langauge. I plan to teach her when I go home for the summer, I am a college student. I was hoping that this book would help for the items I forgot but I'm worried about trusting it. I found that the book contradicts its own definitions. For example, I looked up a word in the english section then checked it in the Lakota section and found it to have a completely different definition. This worried me so I checked on words that I know for sure and found the book to have conflicting definitions for some of those as well.Also, in the back of the book they list THE SIOUX NATION, Seven Council Fires but the way it is listed is innacurate.It says that under TETON(LAKOTA) there is only Oglala, Sicangu, Mnikowoju.Under Saones,(Yankton/Nakota) there is Hunkpapa (Unkpapa), Sihasapa(Blackfeet), Itazipco, Yankton, and Yanktonais.And under Santee(DAKOTA) is Mdewakanton, Wahpeton, Wahpekute, Sisseton.

Then I learned that Buechel borrowed most of the lexicon and definitions from Riggs Dakota dictionary, simply used it as a starting point, changing all \\"d\\" and \\"md\\" into \\"l\\" and \\"bl\\" etc.It is not easy to learn the language using the \\"Beegle\\". Spelling is inconsistent, not all aspirations are shown, not all changeable -A's are shown by examples, the definitions are not always adequate and accurate.The Second edition is generally a step back. The spelling turned into \\"traditional\\" one and trascription enclosed in slashes is even less consistent. Aspirations of [c^h] as opposted to [c^] are altogether dropped this time.Most word entries don't have examples, the ablaut (changing word-final -a to -e or -iN) can be checked only IF examples are present - unless the examples are incorrect, as it is for \\"agla, v.coll.pl\\": 'mis eya wakiyagla na...' - should be actually 'mis eya wakiyagni na..'For decades this was the only Lakota dictionary of a decent size available and so it was a must-have for the students of the language. But now theNew Lakota Dictionaryhas taken the position of the standard reference dictionary on Lakota. It has all the necessary features of a modern dictionary, reliable spelling based on a standard orthography, conjugations, sentence examples and other things that Buechel's dictionary lacks. The introduction in the new dictionary explains in much detail the history of Lakota lexicography including why the Buechel material is unreliable."},{"Title":"Lakota Dictionary: Lakota-English / English-Lakota, New Comprehensive Edition","review":"It is really surprising that anyone would buy this dictionary, now that the New Lakota Dictionary exists. Many years ago I was interested in Lakota, read through this dictionary and found the orthography so confusing I did not even try to learn it seriously. It cannot be blamed on the author Buechel, who made an important contribution to the description of Lakota during the first half of the twentieth century. The editor, Manhart, is really responsible for the sorry state of this dictionary. Not only is the orthography confusing and illegible, many words are wrongly transcribed and were never rechecked with native speakers. Whatever your interest in the Lakota language may be, do not buy this dictionary !"},{"Title":"Lakota Dictionary: Lakota-English / English-Lakota, New Comprehensive Edition","review":"I bought both this one and the new one and I have to agree with the reviewers above who say that the new dictionary is far more reliable, user friendly and comprehensive. If nothing else you will never be able to pronounce the words correctly with this one."},{"Title":"GLADIATOR","review":"A dark work of prescient genius! Philip Wylie, THE most socially astute author of the Twentieth Century, co-founder and Editor of The New Yorker magazine, created in his protagonist Hugo Danner (often mis-spelled in the pages of the book as BANNER, which no doubt, and not-so-subliminally influenced the creators of The Hulk's alter-ego Dr. Banner in Marvel Comics' series and the movies derived therefrom; royalties owed, anyone?) the original 'Super-man' as the result of his scientist father's in-vitro meddlings. Hugo's life is a tale of brooding angst and social subterfuge, as he must dwell amongst the lesser mortals and hide his abilities from their jealousy and ignorant, dirt-farmer mentalities. Searching for a way to fulfill himself, Danner examines and acts upon various unsatisfactory self-initiated programs of personal growth (and destruction), but only at the end - when it is emotionally too late for him to change and see his true potential through to its logical apex and conclusion, does he even come close to the ideal he represents for all of us. The scenes in which Danner stands atop the trenches of the armies he has single-handedly (and covertly) defeated, clothes blown off by the shrapnel, and covered in the blood and gore of his enemies, is reminiscent of The Terminator movies. The deus-ex-machina ending is more of a lesson for the reader to ponder upon than the world-changeing alternative would - and could - have been. A brilliant work, re-issued by BlackMask online (purveyors of expired copyrights? If so: Kudos in regards to your perceptive choice of subject materials). A word of advice on the Publishers' choice of company icon: FOSI may sue you! LOL!"},{"Title":"GLADIATOR","review":"Excellent book. It's not written like science fiction at all, more like a work of \\"mainstream\\" fiction... and it was very moving to me.I think it was well ahead of its time for more than one reason.1) The superman concept.2) The smooth incorporation of the science fiction into a regular world, where it's played entirely straight (rather than for camp) reminds me a whole lot of the TV shows that are on TV the last few years. I think HEROES, SMALLVILLE, many shows incorporate this style today.I got teary eyed reading parts. I think it's excellently written and plotted."},{"Title":"GLADIATOR","review":"This book should not be classified as science fiction. The science fiction aspect is only the means to teach the painful lesson that possessing exceptional skills -- even of superhuman proportions -- is not enough to bring the owner a successful life. Without direction on how to use them to the best advantage, the skills can not only be nonproductive, but counterproductive. In this book, the protaganist's superhuman strength brings him only humiliation and villification. So much good he can do for himself and the world. But how? I'm sure there are many talented people who can relate to this tragic hero. Philip Wylie's Gladiator has receive too few accolades."},{"Title":"GLADIATOR","review":"This is the prelude to all of the super hero stories and it is written in the beautiful early 20th century style of writing.A fun read for sure!"},{"Title":"GLADIATOR","review":"Imagine for just a moment that you have strength beyond anything human.

People would be frightened to death. You would have to hide your strength or be rejected as a menace, weapon, or something worse.Remember, they burned witches.Gladiator tells the story of such a man. It was written in 1930, but reads like a more modern story. It is a story filled with tragedy because of the realities such physical power would bring.

From my perspective, I found that the delivery was prompt and the well packaged..and the price was right."},{"Title":"GLADIATOR","review":"What if I told you that there was a superhero who could go toe to toe with the man of steel? Or that this hero's teenage years were filled with enough angst to make Spider-Man's adolescence appear well-adjusted? What if this hero possessed the speed of the Flash, the Hulk's rage, Batman's fortune and grim vision, could stride the battlefield like Captain America, master the denizens of the deep like Aquaman and be feared and mistrusted by society like the X-Men?You would be intrigued. You'd wonder where this hero came from and risk several dozen paper cuts flipping through your Overstreet trying to track him down.And if I told you this hero was named Hugo Danner, odds are you never heard of him.And his creator? Siegel and Shuster? Stan Lee? Bob Kane? Will Eisner?Philip Wylie.Who?Exactly.In 1930, one year before The Shadow, three years before Doc Savage, six years prior to The Phantom, eight before Superman, the superhero was created by one man, author Philip Wylie. His creation, Hugo Danner, did not blast across the pages of a comic book but rather a novel (and not a graphic novel) called Gladiator, which tells the story of Danner's journey as the strongest man alive.Danner grows up in rural farm country. Sound familiar?He can bend steel, leap forty feet in the air, is impervious to all harm except an artillery shell, fights as WWI's first and only super soldier. Sound familiar?Danner must hide his strength from a mistrustful society. Sound familiar?Has his teenage years marred by a tragedy he caused. Sound familiar?And dedicates himself to fighting for truth and justice. Sound familiar?Gladiator is all of these things and so much more. This novel, which should be required reading for anyone who has thrilled to the exploits of caped crusaders, not only single-handedly creates the superhero, it somehow manages to encapsulate the themes and motifs of just about every comic ever printed since. All in one slim novel with no costumes and no eye-catching artwork. This is a staggering achievement. Gladiator is the mythical nutshell.Listen to Danner's inner musings, years before comics' Golden Age, and see the creation of an industry:\\"What would you do if you were the strongest man in the world, the strongest thing in the world, mightier than the machine?\\" He made himself guess answers to that rhetorical query. \\"I would -- I would have won the war. But I did not. I would run the universe single-handed. Literally single-handed. I would scorn the universe and turn it to my own ends. I would be a criminal. I would rip open banks and gut them. I would kill and destroy. I would be a secret and invisible blight. I would set out to stamp crime off the earth; I would be a super-detective, following and summarily punishing every criminal until no one dared to commit a felony. What would I do? What would I do?\\"And there it is, the blueprint of a genre, springing from the mind of one man. The birth of the superhero and the supervillain. Siegel and Shuster have claimed that Gladiator was the inspiration for Superman and, reading Wylie's masterpiece, it is not hard to see the truth of that claim.Gladiator has never been adapted to comics, has never appeared on the silver screen in a multi-million dollar movie franchise, nor on television in an animated series or prime time. There are no merchandising lines or theme parks. And I can't help but wonder if this is because Wylie's vision became a self-fulfilling prophecy, so uncannily predicting everything that followed that comic creators shied away from it lest the be considered plagiarists.What Edgar Allan Poe did for the mystery story and H.G. Wells for science-fiction, Wylie did for superheroes. Gladiator reads like a comic book, a great comic book, on par with the original Superman, Batman, Stan Lee's best, Watchmen, Sin City, Dark Knight and League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.It has all the drama, daring, heartbreak and adventure comic readers could ever want. The novel's place in the history of the genre is unquestionable, but it is important to note that the story stands on its own as one heck of a superhero ride.The novel is currently available from University of Nebraska Press and simply must not be missed. The writing is edgy, crisp and fast-paced, with surprising disregard for the conventions and morals of the '30's. Hugo Danner is no squaky-clean Superman but rather comes across as gritty as Frank Miller with a world view that would make The Punisher smile, coupled with a compulsion to do the right thing that would put Peter Parker to shame.As an exciting superhero story, Gladiator delivers. As a piece of history, the novel rises above and beyond all expectation.Here is another excerpt from the latter part of the novel when Danner is still agonizing over how to best use his gifts for the betterment of mankind. His newfound mentor offers a suggestion, the clarity of which sends chills up and down the reader's spine:Hugo gasped -- \\"You mean -- other men like me?\\" \\"Exactly. Not one or two. Scores, hundreds. And women. Perfect bodies, intellectual minds, your strength. Don't you see? You are not the reformer of the old world. You are the beginning of the new. The New Titans! Then -- slowly -- you dominate the world. Conquer and stamp all these things to which you and I and all men of intelligence object. In the end -- you are alone and supreme.\\"In the end, Gladiator stands alone and supreme as an unparalleled work of speculative fiction and Hugo Danner and Philip Wylie deserve a place of honour in the great pantheon of those who came after."},{"Title":"GLADIATOR","review":"Rejoice!! Gladiator is back in print!!!Certainly as many people have observed this novel is the gestation of Superman and all that came after. The similarities are striking. The original Superman origin story read \\"Nothing less than a bursting shell could penetrate his skin\\" -- unlike the invulnerable hero he became later. Hugo Danner's adventures follow that description literally. At one point Wylie describes his hair as \\"so black it was almost blue\\". Anyone who has seen the early Superman comics knows that his hair has always had dark blue highlights. The original Superman had no super-senses either -- x-ray vision, super-hearing, and the like came later.So here is the character in his raw-est original form. Yet (as other reviewers have noted) here he is a tragic figure. He does heroic things from time to time, but he never receives the accolades of his successors. More often the opposite.This novel is worth reading for more than the origin of Superman. It is a fascinating look at the usual and the unusual. It is a tragedy about a man who is not a man, but with human flaws and a human need to belong. People's reaction to him -- disbelief, jealousy, fear, hatred -- show the way human beings always respond to anyone who is different. The ending of the book has gotten mixed reviews since it was first published. But truth be told there wasn't any other way to end it. Unless, of course, you are Hollywood and you want to make 45 sequels.Wylie is a fascinating author. He takes unusual circumstances and examines what humans are as a species. Many people have lamented his apparent sexism -- especially in his early novels. Yet he must be judged by his peers -- peers of 75 years ago. And all of his characters -- women and men -- are more open than those created by most of his contemporaries.So read it. Enjoy. And contemplate."},{"Title":"GLADIATOR","review":"\\"Gladiator\\" by Philip Wylie is thought to be the book from which Superman was derived. Hugo Danner is the strongest man on earth. His father, Professor Abednego Danner, attempts to duplicate the strength displayed by small insects. He tests a solution he creates on tadpoles, and a kitten, before finally drugging his pregnant wife, Matilda, and injecting it into her abdomen. The result is a bullet-proof, super strong, super fast baby boy.Aside from similarities in abilities between Hugo and Superman, the stories are very different. \\"Gladiator\\" is the story of a man blessed with super abilities, and cursed because he has them. As he goes through life, he always must try to hide just how strong and fast he is. Time and time again, he feels he is forced to flee from his current situation when those around him learn of his abilities. He spends time as a Sports hero in college, a strongman in a sideshow on Coney Island, a war hero, and many others. Each time he thinks he has found a place, but each time he is disappointed.This book was tied for 9th on the Arkham Survey of \`Basic SF Titles' in 1949. It is not without flaws, but I found it to be entertaining. It is certainly not a great book, but just as certain it is worth reading. If the legacy of \\"Gladiator\\" is the Superman comics, then that alone would make it noteworthy. As an early SF novel, it is also of interest."},{"Title":"GLADIATOR","review":"This is one of my favorite novels of all time. It was the first super human story written in the 20th century and it triggered the cultural phenomenon of four-color comics. But it is not a super hero story. Main character, Hugo Danner, is 100 percent human being. Although Wylie had mythological characters like Achielles and Hercules to draw from, there was no such thing as a costumed hero flying around doing good for the world (published 1930). He is working from scratch.The book deals with the realistic struggle of a man who is beyond Man. It is a picturesque journey of an individual who has choices to make, a super man who is seeking his place in a world of prejudice, politics, greed, war, and love. There are no super villains. There are no capes or costumes. It is raw and solid. The ending has been criticized by many over the decades, but for me, it fit into the structure and theme of the story perfectly.Want a little more dimension out of your super heroes? Buy this book.Matt Hiebert"},{"Title":"GLADIATOR","review":"I've pondered whether I would've found this book so affecting if I had read it at the time of first publication. It's unfortunate that I can't consider it on its own merits-- it is inextricably connected to the Superman mythology in my mind. Which means it's connected to the way Americans see America and her place in the world. Our culture is entwined with a nearly 70-year-old comic book character.In a way, Superman embodies the spirit (however well or ill-founded) of American intervention for good. (Which is ALL tied up with Puritanism and Jeffersonian philanthropy... but this is a book review, so I'll get back to it-- sorry.) Superman is our sometimes delusional view of ourselves as the continual liberators of the oppressed-- always doing right, and never making a wrong decision.The question is... if you had enough power, couldn't you solve everything? Wouldn't you? According to Siegel and Schuster, you could and would.But Philip Wylie was a grown man, not a teenager drawing comic books. Superman doesn't show up here, except as a passing impulse of the protagonist. In fact, \\"Gladiator\\" reads like a modern deconstruction of Superman. It's amazing.Any person raised in the comic-book culture would find this book very interesting. It's all here: bouncing bullets, a fortress of solitude, leaping over buildings... and alienation.\\"Gladiator\\" feels like the missing piece you never knew about, and when it falls into place, it's almost...haunting."},{"Title":"GLADIATOR","review":"This was the first book I read from this author . It was a realistic account of what would really happen to a superhuman ( Someone capable of easily lifting 4000 lbs ) if he were placed among us mortals . Thoughtfully written - typical of Wylie's style , it took you through the life and events of such a person - mainly how other people would react to him and his difficulty to blend in with the human race (everyone was inferior to him). Philip Wylie also showed , in his own philosophical style , how nature dealt with something that was not natural or belonged here . It is a book I will never forget and I felt for the main character . After reading this I realized that Philip Wylie was no ordinary author and I discovered this through his other books . It is a shame that many of them are out of print . Most of the stuff he writes is profound - not like today's pulp fuction best sellers ."},{"Title":"GLADIATOR","review":"My first reading of this book was prompted by my love of comic books after Marvel Comics adapted it in one of their black and white &quot;Adult Comics&quot;(the predecessor of the &quot;Graphic Novel&quot;). I enjoyed the book and have kept it in my library since (believe it or not, it is the old LANCER edition). A recent re-reading helped me to enjoy it's irony. The lead character sees that, in all his perfection, he is just as flawed as the rest of the world. Considering the story's purpose, relating the pitfalls of the life of a TITAN in a world of fragile humans, it is not so long that it becomes boring(unlike this review)."},{"Title":"GLADIATOR","review":"This book was great! The only thing that surprised me was how short it was and how fast the story went by!

Don't get it if you want a long book you can read for days its a one or two day book if you are an avid reader."},{"Title":"GLADIATOR","review":"I recently read Wylie's Triump which was published in the early 1960's. It was from that book's flap that I was made aware of Gladiator published in 1930 prior to the famous comics his book may have inspired. It quite amazing to see the range of his material and the length of his writing career. Though no official confirmation exists that Gladiator was an influence on Superman, one can certainly draw some conclusions to that end. Also the angst and discomfort felt and experienced by the main character may have impacted Peter Parker and Spiderman.Without giving the book away or re-treading the ground of fellow Amazon reviewers (who have done a great job), I only wish to add how fascinating the parts were covering Hugo Danner's experience in fighting World War One. Basically, how he fought a tactical war rather than a strategic one that could have changed history. The author does a laudable job overall of balancing the \\"wouldn't it be great\\" sentiment of having super powers with the fact that differences in people, more often than not, alienate rather than celebrate. And just one more short observation. I enjoyed Wylie's use of New York as a location for parts of the story and how he brought the people and setting to life.

As in most Donna Hill novels, both characters have deep issues in their pasts to overcome. They find that if they work together, things may just work out. The characters don't always remember this and it leads to some interesting plot twists. Clint is a truly &quot;heroic&quot; character.

I like Ms. Hill's style she's a real story-teller, but after a while I was truly annoyed with the lack of realism. No cell phones? And not being able to trust each other, they (Clint & Terri) professed their love for one another, and yet because they lived in the world of this is too good to be true they believed the worst in each other--that for me was the hardest part to get over.

Her advice on how to pick a &quot;hot quote&quot; or how to end a hard news story are worth the price of admission."},{"Title":"The Copy Editing And Headline Handbook","review":"This book is better than most of the books out there, but that isn't saying a whole lot. Virtues: 1) The book isn't too dogmatic. It recognizes that different copy desks have different policies. The most important style rule of all is that, &quot;If your boss has a rule that's different from the AP rule, your boss is right.&quot; 2) Ellis talks a fair amount about the politics of editing. 3) Many of the revised examples are better than the originals. My experience with other copy editing books is that the edited versions tend to be as bad as the originals. Gripe: The book just isn't detailed enough to answer the questions you actually have when it's you against encroaching barbarism. The book is better than books like the Strunk and White book that focus solely on what literate people already know, but it doesn't, for example, discuss the word &quot;like&quot; the way I just used like. Yes, Winston cigarettes should taste good, *as* good cigarettes should, but is it really OK in semi-formal English to write &quot;books like the Strunk and White book,&quot; or do I have to write &quot;such as&quot; in place of like? Another example is the hyphens in compound modifiers. Why does the Wall Street Journal hyphenate &quot;real estate&quot; and AP not hyphenate it, even though AP is the one promoting the use of hyphens in compound modifiers? What do you do about those horrible companies that capitalize their entire names, or insist on starting their names with strange symbols? I guess the lack of detail isn't really Ellis's fault. She's only one person and can only do so much. The problem is that doing a guide that answers all the questions needs to be a team effort. In theory, of course, the AP style book is supposed to be the bible, but the version available to the public is miserably incomplete. In a perfect world, the AP style committee would get together with all the other major style organizations, hire some top editors, linguists, etc., and come up with a really good style and usage encyclopedia. But, of course, they're all up against that encroaching barbarism problem, so I guess this is never going to happen."},{"Title":"The Copy Editing And Headline Handbook","review":"I realize that anyone who writes a book about editing is practically drawing a bull's-eye on his or her back.

Frankly some of these men had it coming with their inattentive or controlling behaviors -- but other men did not, as life's many challenges (kids, money pressures, illnesses) got into both partner's ways. Some women paid a price for their infidelity - others did not.The book is a quick read but it will set you thinking on the state of your own relationship. The book should be read by couples together, married or not. The reader is referred to \\"Uncoupling\\" by Frances Vaughan or any of family therapist Frank Pittman's writings on infidelity (especially \\"Private Lies\\") for further reading."},{"Title":"Undressing Infidelity: Why More Wives are Unfaithful","review":"Just when it no longer seemed possible for our culture to plunge any further into the black hole of dishonor, a book entitled, Undressing Infidelity: Why More Wives are Unfaithful , got released. Its author, Diane Shader Smith, embarked on a mission to record the stories of various adulterous women in the hopes of explaining why it is they cheat. She never fulfills her goal, however, as the work fails at every level.Infidelity is supposed to be pretty hot stuff, but this book fails to titillate. Certainly these tales are rife with deception, but sexy they are not. The wives are excellent examples of individuals who have gotten \\"heavily into me.\\" They seem to know nothing about the world around them or society in general. Yet, for some reason, our author regards these clueless, self-destructive creatures as being \\"amazing.\\" Amazing, no; banal and infantile, yes.As I just recently noted in another review, society showers women with accolades merely for having the right kind of gonads. With such low expectations for personal achievement, one can anticipate future book titles like: I Don't Know How She's Able to Wake Up Breathing, and The Twelve Part Tale of a Heroic Woman Who Defied the Patriarchy by Learning How to Drive Stick Shift. If people really cared about equality, why wouldn't they expect the same levels of accomplishment from women that they do from men? Basically, as it is so non-judgmental, this book is merely a continuation of the forty years worth of applause women have received for simply being alive.In reality, Undressing Infidelity is more boring than anything else. There is no allure within these stories. These women, like the Pac-Man character on the Atari game I played as a child, are never satisfied with what they have been given, and will chew and digest whatever one dangles before them. Relationships and men are consumed like entrees at trendy restaurants or vacation offers for the Caribbean. Many of these adulterous women discovered that marriage wasn't all about them, so they procreated elsewhere, but guess what, they still weren't happy. To corrupt Horace, they can change insertions, but cannot alter their natures.I suppose that some may confuse these adulterous behaviors as being representations of Woman Power. That infidelity increases female potency is about as rational as thinking a bout of cancer makes one stronger. However, here again, like with so many other cultural and political issues, arises The Law of Unintended Consequence. Should female infidelity increase, then the eventual outcome will be that fewer and fewer men will submit to getting married which will exacerbate the already present societal trend.What many of these women do not understand is that bragging about their \\"conquests\\" violates an essential law of hustling which is that no con artist should allow their marks to know they are marks. The increased coverage the media has given to philandering wives will allow those men foolish or lonely enough to have once put up with them to realize that they are suckers and laughingstocks. This may give them the courage they need to walk away from their own personal Love Canals. In America, we determine our own fate, and, of course, women have the right to do as they please. Yet, regarding those females with a mercenary bent, men should preserve their own right to choose by electing to have nothing to do with them-at least as far as permanent relations are concerned. Ultimately, even if books like these make for torturous reading, we should be pleased they exist as they yield soul preserving intelligence concerning radiation with which we might otherwise be exposed."},{"Title":"Undressing Infidelity: Why More Wives are Unfaithful","review":"I am not sure whether I am more disappointed by the lack of analysis into why the women cheat, especially the ones where they said they loved their husbands and felt their husbands were trying to meet their needs, or the fact the author is so flippant about her own affair. It is good that she eventually told her husband, but the only thing she seemed to truly felt any remorse for was that her sister called her right before she consumated the affair sexually. She already did the emotional affair, but even in her own story, though she expresses relief about not taking that final step, it does not seem that she would not do it in the future or truly understood why she did it in the first place. I would like to see a book where not only the juicy details were shared, but also some analysis into the psychological and emotional aspects, even if there is no moral judgment made. Especially in light of the fact that many of these women acknolwedge that the affairs hurt their relationships with everyone. It seems to me that it would be helpful to explore that aspect of fantasy world meeting reality in deeper way."},{"Title":"Undressing Infidelity: Why More Wives are Unfaithful","review":"The subtitle may be \\"Why More Wives are Unfaithful\\", but don't be fooled -- this book offers no real insight whatsoever, just a parade of stupid, sad, sordid tales of selfish, oblivious women with no moral center. Turns out women cheat for exactly the same reasons men do -- they're a--holes. Forget about buying this book -- it was barely worth the effort to check it out of the library for free."},{"Title":"Undressing Infidelity: Why More Wives are Unfaithful","review":"In order to better understand the reasons women cheat in relationships, my husband and I read this book together. It was really interesting to get the different points of view in a non-judgmental format. Enjoyable and easy to read."},{"Title":"Undressing Infidelity: Why More Wives are Unfaithful","review":"Okay, so you might dismiss these women as sluts. But still, one of them might be your neighbor, your kid's teacher ... or your wife! Infidelity as a cultural phenomenon is on the rise, as evidenced by movies like \\"Unfaithful\\" and \\"Closer,\\" and TV shows like \\"Desperate Housewives.\\" We owe it to ourselves to try to understand what's going on ... not in the movies and on TV, but in real life ... and Diane Shader Smith's new book, \\"Undressing Infidelity,\\" is a step in the right diretion. Without judging, she presents the stories of wives who have cheated, and manages to do it in their own voices. Woven into the fabric of the book is Smith's own inspiring story of heartbreak, temptation and reconciliation. Witty and steamy, this light summer read is a must-have for any man or woman involved in a relationship or contemplating one."},{"Title":"Undressing Infidelity: Why More Wives are Unfaithful","review":"This book helped me understand that women are a lot more stealthy than men give credit. A wife can be unfaithful even if she has a great husband, boredom is enough reason. And oftentimes the husband has not a single clue great book."},{"Title":"Undressing Infidelity: Why More Wives are Unfaithful","review":"I was looking for more of an analytical approach to infidelity. This book was based on anecdotal evidence. Women gossiping about their sexual indiscretions. Written in the style of a cheap erotica I feel this book will attract a more feminine audience. I was hoping for the author to dissect each interview in an anthropological fashion. This book has nothing to do with with undressing infidelity. Making a book out of interviews with no research or commentaries makes it hard to believe the author put any effort into writing this book. This book belongs in the soft erotica section at best."},{"Title":"Undressing Infidelity: Why More Wives are Unfaithful","review":"I found this book insightful and inspiring. I'm a woman in my 40s and married to the 1st man I fell in love with 25 years ago. Lately, I've been wondering what it would be like to have an affair. I have never crossed that physical boundary, though I know that I have had one emotional affair. What was insightful to me is that what I feel is what most women have felt or feel, normal and alive!"},{"Title":"Undressing Infidelity: Why More Wives are Unfaithful","review":"Diane Smith gives a frank and fasinating look into the minds of women at a turning point in their lives. I still don't understand women but they appear to have more in common with men than I ever thought!! Great read."},{"Title":"Undressing Infidelity: Why More Wives are Unfaithful","review":"Men, if you're getting married, you'll want to read this! (No lie, it's scarier than anything written by Stephen King.) You'll want to have a pre-nup, separate finances and paternity testing lined-up before you say \\"I do.\\" Why? Because, nowadays, she'll likely get bored with the security and be unfulfilled, cheat on you to feel alive, and develop feelings for the other guy then dump you. And then him too for someone else. Marriage never was constant \\"romance\\" forever (passion and fluttery feelings like the first time do wear off), but today everyone expects all \\"highs\\" forever and dissatified trouble abounds when that doesn't happen. Be prepared!"},{"Title":"Undressing Infidelity: Why More Wives are Unfaithful","review":"This is a great book. It takes a realistic look at what is happening in our society today with women and relationships. It is not a collection of sex stories, but rather of different women searching for something that they have not found with their spouses. Anyone, male or female, thinking about having an affair, should read this book."},{"Title":"Undressing Infidelity: Why More Wives are Unfaithful","review":"\\"Undressing Infidelity\\" is a refreshing, honest examination of fifteen wives and their unique sexual journeys. It provides readers with a front row seat to forbidden sexual dramas, individual motivations and various end-results.This book is not the opinion of one woman, but real-life stories from personal interviews conducted in confidence with many women. From a bored soccer mom to a Yale PhD to the author herself, the affairs and their outcomes vary in so many ways that the book leaves you wanting more.From the reasoning behind each affair, to the final impact of their choices, \\"Undressing...\\" provides an in depth look at why more wives cheat, how they go about it and the plethora of life-altering consequences that result from their choice to stray. From a bored soccer mom to a Yale PhD to the author herself, the affairs and their outcomes vary in so many ways that the book leaves you wanting more.A wonderful and insightful read for women and men!"},{"Title":"Undressing Infidelity: Why More Wives are Unfaithful","review":"just for fun and, ok I will admit it, a little information gathering...this book is fantastic!!! It is not just for cheating spouses, I am single and I thought it was relative to my relationships as well. It is one of those books you zoom through on a few train rides, tell a friend to buy and next thing you know .....a bunch of you are out discussing it all over wine. Women need to read this - but men should also. My guy friend said he thought it was an eye opener in some ways. These type of book that are actual stories where you hear the different voices (which Ms. Shader Smith does wonderfully) seem rare. Buy it - you will NOT be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Undressing Infidelity: Why More Wives are Unfaithful","review":"This book is wonderfully written and it shows \\"non-traditional\\" ways inwhich women are having affairs. It also shows how family systems, overlooked patterns and lessions learned for ones mother has some bearing into these relationships. The book also reveals that just because the home looks good from the outside doesn't mean that it is a perfect picture! This book is a must have for understanding the psychological picture that is often left out in examining infidelity."},{"Title":"Undressing Infidelity: Why More Wives are Unfaithful","review":"MRS SMITH, Did a very good job in documenting her interviews with the women sharing thier stories.I read it from cover to cover the first day i got it."},{"Title":"Undressing Infidelity: Why More Wives are Unfaithful","review":"Since time began, women have taken social heat for affairs, of their creation, or not. The legacy of our patriarchal society is that women are not permitted the same privileges of rights of association, as granted by the Constitution, as are men. Emerging from the relious based social stigma of Scarlet Letters, women are coming to realize that as \\"first class\\" citizens, they need not bear either the stigma of being homewreckers or unreasonably virtuous given the fact that men do not hold themselves to the same standards. Why should social expectation apply to one and not the other? If this is difficult for men to bear, then they might meet women halfway, to recognize the validity and the seriousness of choices associated with marriage as well as the expected commitment. If men are unwilling to restrain themselves, why should women carry the marital banner of loyalty alone? Long trained to shoulder that burden, women are right to expect that society treat them with the same degree of nondiscrimination that men are treated with, even unto the prevailing privileges that society confers upon men, or that men choose to adopt by themselves. Constitutionality of rights of association, one of the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Bill of Rights has rarely extended to women in this regard but might be, were women willing to accept and endure the reprisal of society that such freedom conveys. Far too many women try to hold marriages together incurring the criticism of society regardless of whether it stays intact, or disintegrates. Either way, they receive the blame and the shame, unfairly. Whether married or not, women tend to receive the only marital standards of virtuous fidelity that society encourages. If equal rights is to be meaningful and not mere words, women need to recognize the value (as well as the problems) that arise from exerting those rights. For men to condemn women for doing so is the height of hypocrisy with which women are long familiar, but unnecessary to place guilt."},{"Title":"Black Wind","review":"I read this book many years ago, it was passed around between family members. To this day, I have not read a book that has so powerfully depicted the tumultuous events involving Americans and Japanese during World War II. In fact, I was so dismayed that the book was out of print! This beautifully written historical epic is riveting, the kind that makes you cry and gets you all choked up, and the characters are admirable and true to life. F. Paul Wilson brilliantly weaves in historical details, native superstition and cultural differences around an unforgettable love triangle, and gives some very lasting (not to mention haunting) images of the war. Steven Spielberg should have made a movie out of it!"},{"Title":"Black Wind","review":"Fantastic! I want to give it 5++ stars! F. Paul Wilson has truly created a novel to capture the intricate dynamics of loyalty between friends, between lovers, between brothers, between family and child, between love and hate...inter-twined without gaps, fast moving...a tightly woven tale that held me spell-bound, anxious to keep on reading well late into the night. Excellent work, sir..."},{"Title":"Black Wind","review":"This book touched me from the first time I read it, 10 years ago. Since then I have read it once a year. It gives a stunning depiction of cultures that were never discussed in history books. Whether fiction or not the author makes you believe because of what we do know as fact from history. It also displays World War II in a way I had never realized. I have told everyone I know to read this book. The first thing I did on Christmas Eve after receiving and setting up my Kindle was to order this book. I began reading it on Christmas night and it was as always,an eye-opening pleasure."},{"Title":"Black Wind","review":"\\"Black Wind\\" is one of only two novels that are part of the \\"Secret History of the World\\" but that are not part of either the Adversary Cycle or the Repairman Jack Series (the other is \\"Sibs\\"). Even though I have been an avid fan of all 21 novels comprising the two series just referred to, plus several other novels and anthologies and written by FP Wilson, somehow I never read Black Wind until this week, immediately after reading the last RJ entry, \\"The Dark at the End\\". I was immediately sucked into this rich tapestry of life in the early part of the 20th century in the US and Japan. While the novel does contain the FPW trademarks of horror/fantasy (the titular Black Wind), even discounting these, it is wonderfully complex with several unexpected plot twists and not one but two bona fide love stories. The main characters are richly drawn and the interpersonal relations between Japanese brothers, Matsuo and Hiroki, the beautiful Meiko, and Matsuo's American friend Frankie are deeply intertwined.This is historical fiction at its best. The setting flips back and forth between Japan and California from the 1920s through the end of WWII. FPW really did his homework on this one and it shows clearly. There is some really good authentic Japanese thrown in and used in a way so as to define it in context (a l&aacute; Shogun), and great examples, in deeds and discussion, of traditional Japanese cultural values of honor, obligation (several different kinds) and debt. The conspiracy theory concerning what we knew about the attack on Pearl Harbor, and when, has been treated in fact and fiction before, but this is as good a fictional treatment as I have read anywhere, and is used to great advantage by FPW. There are a number of historical figures depicted much as I know them to be from my reading of history, but the main characters are FPW's creations. The tie-in with the \\"Secret History of the World\\" is, as most FPW fans could have predicted, through an ancient katana sword that is bequeathed to Matsuo, the main character, early in the novel. The sword is an important player in the novel, but here is simply an excellent katana, albeit of somewhat ancient and unusual construction. For RJ fans, the 2008 novel, \\"By the Sword\\" is, in many respects, virtually a sequel to Black Wind, as well as an integral part of the beginning of the end-game of the Secret History of the World.This might be the best example of pure mainstream fiction writing by FPW, especially if you are not particularly into SF and/or fantasy. Make no mistake, there are some pretty horrific scenes in this one too, it's just that they are the icing rather than the cake itself, in contrast to much of the Adversary Cycle and Repairman Jack in which the fantasy and horror aspects tend to take center stage. I can't say enough good things about Dark Wind. It has quickly jumped right to the A-list of my all-time FPW favorites. The novel is completely stand-alone - one doesn't have to have read anything else by FPW for full appreciation, but for fans of RJ and the Adversary Cycle, it does fill in a few blanks, and as I mentioned, fans of Black Wind will probably want to read the sequel, By the Sword.Very Highly Recommended.JM Tepper"},{"Title":"Black Wind","review":"Centered around the time prior to, and during WWII this is an interesting mash of several genres and is hard to classify. It pulls together historical-based fiction, a loved and lost and maybe found again story, pitfalls of friendship, clashes of culture and a touch of the supernatural.It's an interesting enough storyline but I found that the characters were very one-dimensional and stereotypical. You like them, but at the end of the story you're quite happy to put the book down, move onto another story and leave them behind.I found that the story didn't really make a lot of impact expect for some complete revulsion generated by the supernatural aspect of the story as it relates to the manner in which this element is released.Really, it's a good story, but it's a nice, light read."},{"Title":"Black Wind","review":"I must say that this was quite possibly the best novel I have ever read! I was captured by the plot from the very first day that I started reading Black Wind. The way that F. Paul Wilson describes the way of life for the Japanese at the most crucial of times during the Second World War was truly inspiring and enlightenning. I even noticed myself crying at several spots in the book, which was an incredibly awesome experience. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read, no matter what type of book they prefer. Black Wind has it all. F. Paul Wilson had truly delivered an epic story in its truest form."},{"Title":"Black Wind","review":"I avoided reading Black Wind for several years. Having read the Adversary Cycle and the Repairman Jack series this didn't seem to be in my standard grouping of novels, but after running low on books one day I finally caved and gave it a chance.No insult to Mr. Wilson's other work (I love it), but his other books are of course pulp action/thriller novels. Black Wind actually felt like true higher literature. I think it was the first instance in a very long time - I read roughly fifteen novels per month - that I was really moved by a book. The relationship between the main characters, the broken love, it was very moving and the betrayals were shocking and actually hurt.This book is now my favorite among all of his publications, even above the \\"fun\\" action novels. I highly recommend this book to any fans of his (there are some small ties to RMJ) and to anyone who enjoys a great period-piece."},{"Title":"Black Wind","review":"Although this novel has some super natural elements, it is more about the relationship between two men and the woman they love amidst the turmoil of WWII. I'm not one for romance in literature, but I was not put off by it here. A great mix of love and war, fantasy and reality."},{"Title":"Black Wind","review":"This book by Wilson is one of his best. Also, it has one advantage for those who don't enjoy following a series (like Repairman Jack): it bengins and ends in itself. So, if you wanna know the above-average quality of F. Paul Wilson, I suggest you to begin with this book."},{"Title":"Black Wind","review":"This book has ambitious scope and it fully carries it. It is well written, touching, and fascinating."},{"Title":"Black Wind","review":"Actually read this a little over a year ago, but thought it pretty good. The idea of a literal \\"divine wind\\" (if 'divine' is the the actual right word for it...; I would say decidedly NOT) ishorrifying, as is the idea of a sword \\"turned bad\\" (shall we say) that invariably causes the bearer to kill whoever is nearby. I found it interesting, the idea of it having absorbed the \\"aura\\" (for lack of a better word) or collective spirit of the Hiroshima bomb explosion as a reason for it having \\"gone bad\\". And, personally, I found that cult downright hideous, atrocious and ethically & morally repugnant (the ancient Japanese one). YECCCHHH! If I found out about them in real life, I'd be reporting 'em to the police ASAP! But yes, I would recommend this, it *is* exciting. I've been an RJ fan for a *long* time."},{"Title":"Black Wind","review":"F. Paul Wilson has written a chick-lit World War II novel that details the interweaving storylines of:1) An American boy whose father's suicide is foretold pages and pages in advance due to his love of the stockmarket in the late 1920s2) The American boy's boyhood friend, who is from Japan, who just happens to be under the guardianship of the gardener at the American boy's estate because his father was afraid that this Japanese son, like his older brother before him, will be taken in by a mystical sect of Japanese monks that likes to eliminate body parts of its members3) That Japanese brother's older brother, who was taken in by a mystical sect of Japanese monks that likes to eliminate body parts...4) A Japanese girl whose marriage has been arranged to the older Japanese brother, but who the younger Japanese brother falls in love with prior to knowing she is engaged to his older brother, but who is assigned to guard the girl when she travels to America, where she just happens to meet boy #1, who is looking for boy #2 after they had a fall out caused by a misunderstanding...This book is long, and richly detailed. There are many historical figures and events intertwined with the fictional ones, and if someone isn't familiar with World War II history, they might find it interesting to read about the events. My problem was the soap opera with all the characters, and how, in a world of millions of people, their lives just kept happening to come togetherNot Mr. Wilson's best, and certainly not the best WWII novel ever written.

Saw a copy of this in the bookstore the other day and was tempted but put it back because it's printed with very VERY small type. It looks like 6 or 7 point type. Way to small for me for a novel of this length. Maybe the next edition will have larger type."},{"Title":"Black Wind","review":"I read this book several years ago and the images it gave me as well as the new knowledge I gained from it have hung with me ever since. I came to Amazon to buy it and read it again only to find it out of print. I agree with what others have said here - if I could give it more stars than 5 it would get it and it should be made into a movie. This book gave me insight into the Japanese culture that I would never have otherwise had. It made me live the pains of prejudice, respect tradition, helped me understand the difference between irony and coincidence, and gave me insight into the soul of the samurai. Twin brothers separated because of a seers prophecy and the inability to alter fate -- A MUST read."},{"Title":"Black Wind","review":"I'm not sure how Wilson did it, but \\"Black Wind\\" combines history, romance, Japanese and American culture AND a little supernatural all in the same book.It's a mixed bag, for sure! I almost didn't read it because it falls under science fiction....but somehow, it doesn't feel like sci-fi. It's MUCH more historical and cultural, so please don't let the idea of some (very believable) supernatural happenings be off-putting.The novel begins in 1920s California and instantly involves us with the friendship of two young men, one Japanese and one American. It jumps back and forth from America to Japan, leading the reader through the events of upcoming WWII from both Asian and American perspectives. History and culture abounds here, and I learned SO much about the precursors to war--from BOTH sides.The only thing that bothered me at all about Black Wind was how Wilson took a great historical fiction novel and went just a little....hmmmm...'Lifetime movie?'...with the romance. Not SO much that the guy readers will put it down, though!Right now, the Kindle version is really affordable. If you're interested in WWII, from the Japanese AND American viewpoint...Grab this book!"},{"Title":"Black Wind","review":"Arguably the best yet from F.

Twenty plus years later, I happy to say that I wish I hadn't waited. Not Wilson's best book, but possibly one of the finest books about the underlying personalities of the Pacific war I have ever read. The political machinations behind events leading up to the war maybe made up, but they interweave so much historical fact into them that the line between the two is non-existent. The plot horrifying yet still believable to the point that you don't question its plausibility. I hate comparing books to other works, but on this one I think I have to. Fifteen years ago I read through Herman Wouk's WWII Saga, The Winds of War and War and Remembrance. This book while not quiet as epic in scope of character's a places, is the Pacific version of that tale. It's also just as good.For fan's of Repairman Jack(like me) while this isn't a must read, it will provide background for a story in the later books in the series."},{"Title":"Black Wind","review":"So i bought the book and waited to read it. I was reading many books at the time but wanted to save a longer one for my deployment to Afghanistan. Glad I did. This book grabbed me from the beggining and didnt let go.

It was given to her for this novel, \\"Die Waffen nieder!\\" (\\"Lay Down Your Arms!\\") originally published in 1889, and for her work in organizing an international peace movement. As our nation is about to enter its 10th year of foreign wars, and politicians are clamoring for another, I felt a needed to read this book.Leo Tolstoy compared the effect Harriet Beecher Stowe's \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" had on the abolition of slavery to the effect \\"Lay Down Your Arms\\" was having towards the abolition of war. Martin Gregor-Dellin in 1988 wrote \\"Bertha von Suttner belongs without doubt along with George Sand, Cosima Wagner, Marie Curie, Florence Nightingale, and the Duse, to the great women of a century which still made it difficult for women to be great.\\" Suttner died only weeks before the outbreak of World War I which she struggled so hard to prevent.This popular novel introduced thousands of readers of her time to the arguments of pacifism. Written in an autobiographic style this book tells the story of a woman raised in a military family who becomes opposed to war and sets out to document rational arguments against the patriotic reasons nations put forward to justify their wars. Set in the second half of the 19th century, the story begins when she is a young woman in Austria who falls in love with a young officer in the army.Suttner uses the actual European conflicts of the time as a backdrop for her heroine's disillusionment and growing arguments against war. As the politicians of Austria, Prussia and France lead them into one senseless war after another, she relates the horrors suffered by the the people of Europe. The main drawback of the book is that few today will have much knowledge of the political problems and figures she writes about.However, the arguments used to start wars in 19th century Europe sound just like those used by modern politicians to justify invasions like those of Iraq and Afghanistan. Listening to her hope for find a rational way to end armed conflict, especially when we have the United Nations and the International Court of Justice, is so inspiring.

The other reviews tell you what the story was about so I won't elaborate on that. The second half of the book goes down hill fast. It read like it was written by a 12 year old boy with ADD (Attention Deficit Syndrome). The final battles involve many \\"something-headed\\" people. For example, I think there were some Aardvark-headed people, some Antelope-headed people ect. It was really stupid and after I was finished reading it I threw it away and wanted the time that I had wasted on it back."},{"Title":"The Lucifer Wars","review":"a truly inspired story that begins in the north of England wher a virulent plague has almost wiped out the population. The survivors band together to fight of packs of maruading dogs; these are under the command of cerberus. The survivors must also do battle with the four horsemen of the apocalypse in a no punches pulled story of Pestilence Famine War and death. Without a doubt this is the best book that i have read for years; the author creates scenes that would make stephen king shiver and invokes images thast would make jackie collins blush. The plot is fast paced and characters such as Death and Lucifer are brought to life with startling realism. once i started reading i simply could not put it down. If you only read one book this year make sure that it is this one."},{"Title":"The Lucifer Wars","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this book. I ordered it, and received it shortly afterwards. Look, this book has more spelling errors and grammar structure problems than a second grader's homework. I counted 32 instances of spelling errors and grammar on the first chapter alone. How this book passed an editor's desk is beyond me. This book is VERY hard to read because almost every sentence is messed up with errors. I'm not fluffing this at all, I'm serious. When they use words like \\"SEA\\" to describe viewing something at a distance, as opposed to ..oh I don't know... \\"SEE\\", you know you've picked a winner!This book is not worth it. There are so many errors, it makes it very hard to read, because you catch all the spelling errors and it just distracts from the story. Speaking of the story, it wasn't \\"too\\" bad. I liked the story itself, but then again first person view stories don't do so well, especially when the author writes like it's his first time telling a story. I'm clearly not impressed with having to use four letter words every page just to keep your reader hooked. Authors attempt to use violence, language, and strong sexual content to hook the reader. Of course this becomes hard to believe when the author can't even spell right.Stay away, or else your soul will surely be damned."},{"Title":"The Lucifer Wars","review":"Clearly a book that you will either love or hate. I confess that when i first read it I was appalled at the aparent blasphemy and i picked many faults. My husband read it and said that it was the best book ever, so i read it again and wa surprised to find that my opinion had changed. I looked past the blasphemy and the other faults and read the book for what it was. A riveting horror story. If you can get past the religious content then you will love it. If religion is your life and you are easily offended then give it a miss or read it with an open mind. There are enough reveiws that give the basic outline of the story, but they leave out so many of the supporting characters. Death for example was brilliant as was Judas Iscariot (escaped from hell and looking for redemption). Other characters like Lazarus were also worked in brilliantly. Lazarus was brought back from the dead according to the bible, but what if this was a curse rather than a blessing? Simple genius. The raw gritty violence, and graphic scenes ofdepravity will no doubt appeal to many readers. But I enjoyed it for the underlying message of hope and nobility that shone through and the clear desire of the author to allow us to truly beleive in life after death. I can only hope and pray for more."},{"Title":"The Lucifer Wars","review":"This one is a real page turner. Topical as humanity has been almost entirely wiped out by a plague spread by birds (di the author have a premonition or what?) and controvercial due to the evidence that Jesus was possibly the second messiah after Mithras born 1400 years before christ. Forget Dan Brown this book was riveting and the horror is simply unparraleled in anything i have ever read before.

Relationship counselors Joyce and Barry Vissell had a similar vision when they collected dozens of true love stories for their heart-warming book, MEANT TO BE.The Vissells begin this book with the assertion that &quot;there is a miraculous love story within each person&quot;, and describe that their greatest hope for readers of this book is &quot;to inspire you to live more fully every moment, to love and appreciate now the ones with whom you are in relationship, rather than putting it off into the uncertain future.&quot; MEANT TO BE succeeds brilliantly at both showing us the way love orchestrates our lives, and also pointing out the value of being fully present in our relationships right now.I found myself feeling uplifted and amazed by the synchronicities and astonishing ways that peoples' lives in these stories arranged themselves so that they would take note of someone special -- even when they were not trying or even feeling like meeting anyone new. The common thread in all these stories was the desire of those involved to deeply love another, and yet each story is completely unique. I was deeply touched that the authors themselves participated in sharing the ups and downs of their love stories... each from their own point of view.This would be a wonderful book if it only contained stories of how people met, but it goes far beyond that to share stories of how lovers can help each other grow and heal, and how love never ends... even when our lovers die. If you are ready to read a book that will break your heart open with a feeling of love so great it cannot be contained, MEANT TO BE is meant for you."},{"Title":"Meant to Be: Miraculous Stories to Inspire a Lifetime of Love","review":"This book is filled with firsthand accounts from people who found love and hope in their lives even in the face of trials and pain.

From the heart, 38 people from various walks of life share their stories of love and loss, healing and redemption. &quot;Meant to Be&quot; provides a sense of hope for those who despair of not finding their Soul Mate. Take heart; he or she is out there! Reading the book gave me a sense of being a witness to the relationships of the authors, as if they had welcomed me into a most private corner of their lives, willing to expose their vulnerabilities and celebrate their triumphs.

In an age where people spend and invest so much time in dating industry events .... it's touching and sweet that the best loves happen by an act of fate.I know in my own life that the best loves that came were by serendipity. Either an alumni event with a friend of a friend from New York just after college. Then a few years later at an outing with a mutual friend. What was interesting was that in both cases I didn't think I would see either persons afterwards. But fate had other plans (despite how controlling I was with my set plans) with random introductions over time.So ... the old cliche is true ... if you love something set it free and if it doesn't come back it wasn't meant to be.

Over the years I have read plenty of Wilde's works, but for some reason or another, missed this one over and over. I recently sat down, and decided that it was time to give this a read. To be honest, I knew very little about this actual book prior to reading it, other than it involved a picture that aged rather than he in the painting.I expected to have difficulty reading this book, since it had been such a long time since I had read anything from the Victorian era, however the language was surprisingly simple, and Wilde's wit is as sharp as ever. Almost sharp enough to harm the reader should they not be forewarned or guided through the readings. Should someone of a weaker mind read this book, it would be easy to fall into the trap of Dorian, who himself was poisoned by a book and the words of his friend.Summary without giving too much away: Dorian Gray is an Adonis-like beauty, young and full of life and innocence at the beginning of our story. His beauty has attracted the obsession of a painter who paints picture after picture of him. Basil (the painter) tries to keep young Dorian pure and in love with life. Henry, a friend of Basil's comes to the studio as Basil paints his master work - a portrait of Doran. Henry fascinates young Dorian in his vile manner of speaking and sarcastic wit. His talk instills in Dorian both a fear of losing his beauty and a lust for all that is selfish and vile in life. Dorian's notable debauchery follows in exquisite detail with Henry always along for the ride to prod young Dorian down the wrong road. Several suicides and a murder or two later, complete madness begins to make its appearance.Wilde was brilliant in his writing of this book, he captures the time perfectly... the lust of it, the sexuality of it, the debauchery of it... all in the name of truth. In their words they say things that their hearts dare not to believe and their smiles are masks hiding the truth. And what if someone believed in these lies? What if they lived their life according to what they had been told? Then they would be Dorian Gray... and we will see what happens to him. This is a brilliant read, and for those of you who will have to write papers on it... the story is not long, but it is thick with meaning. There are very few stories that I would give 5 stars to, this is one of them."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Published in 1890, this novel by Oscar Wilde is a startling, fantastic portrayal of fin de siecle indulgence and hedonism.The novel is dark in its tone as it describes Dorian's fall from purity, and it involves itself heavily with suicide, death and supernatural occurences. The novel is also somewhat satirical, as Wilde makes reference to the absurd state of social affairs in Victorian London. Ironic and suspenseful, the novel keeps the reader interested in each plot development, and keeps the reader engaged and moved by the beautiful, carefully crafted prose.The story begins with Lord Harry Wotton, utterly captivated by a painting by a friend, the artist Basil Hallward. The painting is of the handsome and unspotted young Dorian Gray. Dorian is stunned at the worldly knowledge of the older gentleman, and soon finds himself under Lord Wotton's care and attention. Harry, the eternal pessimist, schools Dorian in his existential, hedonistic view. Dorian wishes in his vanity that the beautiful painting might age instead of he. When Dorian falls in love with and coldly rebukes a young actress, he returns home to find that the painting bears a faint expression of cruelty and callous; a certain sneer about the mouth. His wish had come true; \\"the canvas [bore] the burden of his passions and his sins.\\"As the story goes on, Dorian falls further and further into his own mind, indulging his every whim, strangling the lives of most everyone he touches by the ropes of scandal that Dorian is entangled in.Resonating throughout the story are the themes of power and love, overriden by vanity and swept beneath by slight homosexual undertones (easily overlooked by anyone who wants to overlook it).I thoroughly enjoyed this novel; the characters were well-developed, and I could identify with Dorian's desire to find a balance between his selfish motivation to indulge himself and his moral need to free himself from his sins. It is the endless plight of human existence: The moral drive to overcome the sins of our nature. The way the novel was written gives the reader a deep appreciation for Oscar Wilde, and the way in which he writes. The novel was a little difficult here and there, not because it was verbose or stylistically challenging, but merely because it was very in-depth. The book itself is a beautiful work; but moreso than the book itself are the ideas behind it. This is a book that makes one think about consequences of actions, the importance of emotions, of repentance and redemption.I would highly recommend this book.\\"Something has changed you completely. You look exactly the same wonderful boy who, day after day, used to come down to my studio to sit for his picture. But you were simple, natural and affectionate then. You were the most unspoiled creature in the whole world. Now, I don't know what has come over you. You talk as if you had no heart, no pity in you.\\" - Basil Hallward to Dorian Gray, Chapter 9."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I have always heard of Dorian Gray, but never got around to reading it until now. Very well written and a wonderful Gothic classic. This freebie is worth downloading. The devil seems to be none other than his so-called friend who points out some truths to the shallow Dorian. That begins his unravelling. I won't be commissioning any portraits of myself - ever! (Reviewed from my Kindle 2)."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The tricky plot, the accurate psychological analysis, the theme of the double, of pleasure and sin make this novel still an up-to-date one and I was really fascinated by the scheming protagonist who, in a way or in another, can be told to represent the human being in all his aspects. Compelled by my teacher to read it, I didn't think this book could give me so many hints. Thanks to Oscar Wilde I had my first approach to the Aesthetic ideolgy, absolutely one of the most involving and interesting: let's do &quot;Art just for Art's Sake&quot;! Dorian Gray embodies the new intellectual who thinks life should be lived as a work of art, so that it is possible to stop the destructive power of time. He also stated the only reality is that of impressions and sensations, and everything in life should be done in order to experience every kind of sensations, no matter how to do and what society could think. Well, I'm just a teenager and maybe for this reason I share some of Wilde-Dorian's instances: like me, the protagonist tries to reconcile wills of rebellion, linked to his soul's corruption, with desires of worldiness. In conclusion I think this is one of the best book I've ever read - and I have read al lot. I would suggest it to everybody who's willing to descover the most intimate and deepest aspects of his own soul!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is a beautiful book in layout and design. Oscar Wilde was many things, but for me he is an Artist first and foremost, and with this book The Belknap Press pays homage to a brilliant writer. The novel's reception is an intriguing story. I have recently purchased OSCAR WILDE: THE CRITICAL HERITAGE, and it beautifully relates the history of the book's reception. One unsigned review, In PUNCH, begins, \\"The Baron has read Oscar Wilde's Wildest and Oscarest work, called DORIAN GRAY, a weird sensational romance...\\" Another review, in DAILY CHRONICLE, begins, \\"Dullness and dirt are the chief features of Lippincott's this month. The element in it that is unclean, though undiniably amusing, is furnished by Mr Oscar Wilde's story of THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY. It is a tale spawned from the leprous literature of the French Decadents--a poisonous book, the atmosphere of which is heavy with the mephitic odours of moral and spiritual putrefaction...\\" (How I'd LOVE to get such a review for one of my wee books!) What seems clear is that the novel could not be divorced from Wilde's reputation.But as a novel, THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY is wonderful and strange--if not entirely \\"successful\\".

It is now a classic of supernatural fiction, and I think it has been in-print ever since its first book appearance, or shortly afterward when Robert Ross worked so diligently to bring Wilde's works back into print. This is a beautiful and definitive edition."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde's only novel, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" provides a cautionary tale about the dogmatic pursuit of youth and beauty at the cost of one's own soul. Wilde provides an insight into the hedonistic lifestyle that he lived and championed. Indeed, one of the basic tenets of Wilde's philosophy - aestheticism - is presented in contradictory terms. While aestheticism attempts to redefine art as a means of beauty with no moral purpose, the novel's artwork - the portrait of Dorian Gray - shows the moral consequences of Dorian's hedonistic and narcissistic lifestyle.In a way, Dorian is the work of art, for he never changes his appearance. It is his portrait that is burdened with the sins and iniquities of Dorian's wickedness, for his portrait becomes haggard and disheveled as Dorian's soul sinks further into a dark abyss of nefarious behavior. On the outside, Dorian shows the luminous beauty of youth and a pure mind, yet the true soul of Dorian is diseased and dying. Any attempts at changing his inner essence only reveal him to be a hypocrite and egotist.Another cautionary tale is that in one of idolizing others and falling for their influence. Dorian begins his descent into immorality when he becomes enamored with Henry Wooten's philosophies that \\"the only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it\\" and \\"beauty is the wonder of wonders.\\" The cynical and satirical Henry Wooten espouses his hedonistic lifestyle, yet does not become entrapped in it like Dorian. Then, it is Dorian's influence who corrupts and ruins the lives of nearly all those with whom he is intimate.It is easy to see why this novel was criticized and decried as immoral in Victorian England. From the first chapter, there is a definite homosexual undertone. Henry and Basil admire Dorian's beauty and Basil declares that he cannot live without seeing Dorian everyday. Indeed, Basil's fondness of Dorian could just as easily describe romantic feelings toward a woman. Although there are heterosexual relationships, they are shallow and fleeting. Dorian's own deplorable actions are never revealed, save for opium, yet his corruption of young men implies that he engaged in acts of \\"gross indecency\\", the very same acts for which Oscar Wilde would be tried and convicted years later. Perhaps Wilde is attempting to justify his own lifestyle and criticize moral judgments, for \\"it is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances.\\"Although this is essentially a dark, Gothic novel, it does contain scenes of wit and humor. Henry's dialogue and witticisms convey the same tone as many of Wilde's highly acclaimed plays. Through satire, Wilde reveals the superficial nature of the aristocracy. Despite rumors of Dorian's sins, he is still highly desirable in London society, as his beauty and youth trump all.This is a superb novel by Wilde. I only wish that he would have honored us with a few more novels."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Dorian Gray was quite the read.Dorian Gray is a young man who has exquisite, wonderful features. He is good-looking. He is a model for Basil, a painter. Basil paints a portrait of Dorian Gray. Lord Henry, one of Basil's friends, meets Dorian and remarks how sad it is that Dorian will not always retain his youth and beauty. Dorian grows sad about this - and thinks, if only this picture would grow old and I can always stay young! He envies his own picture, because he thinks that the picture will forever retain its youth - while he will bear the wrinkles of life.Then things start becoming strange. After an unpleasant experience with his fianc&eacute;e, an actress, he looks at his picture and notices a cruel twist of the mouth. This is only the beginning. As Dorian makes his descent into debauchery and sinfulness, the picture bears the weight of his actions. Everytime he commits a transgression, the picture grows uglier and uglier. The picture becomes his sort of \\"conscience.\\"This book is one worth reading. I had heard of Dorian Gray and was curious. Wilde's writing was descriptive, yet easy to read. It is one of the easier classics, in my opinion.The only flaw to this novel was, at one point, there is a stage where Dorian collects a lot of things - like embroidery, etc. It describes the things he collects and makes lots of references and allusions to seemingly random people (perhaps famous people in history?). This seemed to me like a non sequitur, and just lots of rambling. Furthermore, it was confusing because I didn't know who the people being mentioned were. It was tedious, although I endured it. I'm glad I did, because the story progressed wonderfully.The ending is... quite morbid, but didn't come across as a complete surprise.The Picture of Dorian Gray is worth your while. It will make you think - is eternal youth worth it? It will trigger lots of probing questions in your brain. Highly recommended to anyone looking for a good classic read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Gray is a beautiful young man who after seeing his portrait wishes that the painting ages rather than his own face. Initially innocent he is corrupted by Henry Wotton his supposed friend, a devoutly immoral character who leads Dorian Gray into a truly sinful existance.By chance Gray discovers his wish came true and the portrait not his own face is aged by his lifestyle, but when he sees the extent to which the image has been ravaged he wishes to recinde the wish. Wilde illustrates the ugly side of our natures and shows there is always a price to pay for it despite the public face presented to the world. Despite the dark message, the biting wit and sarcasm keep the reader amused as well as disturbed, leaving me with a somewhat guilty feeling if I should laugh while reading it (which I often did). The interesting thing is the author does not take a moral stance, maybe because of the life he led himself. Although Wild's only novel and not overly long, it is a truly great work. For the wit alone and a lifetimes worth of quotations it is essential reading."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I had heard speak of The Picture of Dorian Gray, but I must admit I did not expect the depth and clarity of thought, the utter honesty to be found in this short novel.

Dorian Gray sells his soul for eternal youth, in a Faustian bargain, whereby all the age , decay corruption will show in the picture , while Grey's appearance will stay eternally young and fresh.Encouraged by the hedonistic cynic Lord Henry Wotton, Gray embarks on a life of corruption, decadence and cruelty. Lord Henry is also the vehicle through which Wilde put down his many uniquely Wildesque epigrams into the novel, such as \\" Conscience and cowardice are really the same thing, Basil. Conscience is the trade name of the firm. That is all\\"; \\" Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love. It is the faithless who know love's tragedies\\"; \\"There is only one thing worse than being talked about and that is not being talked about\\" ; \\"The only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it.\\" ; \\" It is better to be beautiful than to be good. But it is better to be good than to be ugly.\\" And \\" As for the virtuous poor , one can pity them of course , but one cannot possibly admire them\\".The bargain made by Gray can only lead to eventual destruction , and the novel is a statement by Wilde on humanity and society , in the cavalier and irreverent way that only Wilde could."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"If you have seen the movies or know the story, the book is a completely different experiance!

READ IT NOW!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I used the built in dictionary regularly with this story which is rich with precise descriptive language of the 19th century."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wilde sees the world more clearly than any writer of fiction in the last century. It is for that reason that his work is so filled with countless paradoxes and contradictions that challenge the mind and titillate the senses. Wilde lived in an infinitely ironic age, when society had grown so influential as to crowd out the individuals that made it up. Today, we have taken for granted this incongruity and so our writers cannot express the kind of irony that Wilde mastered, despite the fact that we all know that something is amiss.\`The Picture of Dorian Gray' is filled with this irony. The plot shows us the ultimate irony of a man giving up his soul for the beauty of youth--the condition that is exalted in the modern age above all else, intellect, truth, justice, life itself. Interspersed are dialogues and epigrams that persist one hundred years later as some of the finest word handling ever recorded. Even a few samples should compel the potential reader:\\"The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about.\\"\\"Every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter.\\"\\"A man cannot be too careful in his choice for his enemies.\\"\\"The only difference between a caprice and a life-long passion is that the caprice lasts a little bit longer.\\"\\"Men marry because they are tired, women marry because they are curious. Both are disappointed.\\"\\"I love acting, it is so much more real than life.\\"- \\"I am on the side of the Trojans, they fought for a woman.\\"- \\"They were defeated.\\"The mastery of wit that Wilde displays must be seen in its context. He was a decadent as much as the characters he portrays are. Ultimately, the disillusion that the decadent faces comes through in the story and the reader is left with a very uneasy feeling upon completing \`Dorian Gray.' Is life as absurd as it seems? Is there a solution? Or are we stuck with a life of paradox? Perhaps our current period of decadence will show us an alternative. Until it does, we can enjoy the astounding word play offered here."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde was one of the foremost representatives of Aestheticism, a movement based on the notion that art exists for no other purpose than its existence itself (\\"l'art pour l'art\\"), not for the purpose of social and moral enlightenment. Born in Dublin and a graduate of Oxford's Magdalen College, he initially worked primarily as a journalist, editor and lecturer, but gradually turned to writing and produced his most acclaimed works in the six-year span from 1890 to 1895, roughly coinciding with the period of his romantic involvement with Lord Alfred \\"Bosie\\" Douglas, sixteen years his junior. Douglas's strained relationship with his father, John Sholto Douglas, Marquees of Queensberry, eventually resulted in a series of confrontations between Wilde and the Marquees, which first led to a libel suit brought by Wilde against his lover's father (who had openly accused Wilde of \\"posing as a sodomite\\" and threatened to disown his son if he didn't give up his acquaintance with the writer) and subsequently to two criminal trials against Wilde for \\"gross indecencies,\\" based on a law generally interpreted to prohibit homosexual relationships. Sentenced to a two-year term of \\"hard labor\\" in Reading Gaol, Wilde emerged from prison in 1897 a spiritually, physically and financially broken man and, unable to continue living in England or Ireland, after three years' wanderings throughout Europe died in 1900 of cerebral meningitis, barely 46 years old.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\\" Wilde's only novel besides seven plays as well as several works of short fiction, poetry, nonfiction and two fairy tale collections originally written for his two sons, is critical to an understanding of Wilde's body of work and his personality primarily for two reasons: First, because it constitutes one of his earliest fully accomplished formulations of Aestheticism, and secondly because of its undeniable undercurrent of homoeroticism; an inclination which, after a six-year marriage widely thought to initially have been a true love match, Wilde had begun to explore more openly around the time of the novel's creation (1890). The story's title character is an exceptionally handsome young man who, both in the eyes of the artist tasked to paint his portrait, Basil Hallward, and in those of their somewhat older friend Lord Henry Wotton, epitomizes perfect beauty and is coveted by both men for that very reason. Seduced by hedonistic Lord Henry into believing that beauty can literally justify anything, including any act of immorality, Dorian sells his soul for maintaining his beautiful appearance, letting his portrait age in his stead. (In that, his character resembles Goethe's and Marlowe's Faust.) He then quickly turns from an innocent youth into a cruel and calculating man whom society, in its shallow adherence to appearances, nonetheless never associates with any of the results of his cruelty, never looking beyond the surface of his handsome exterior and assuming that a man so beautiful must necessarily also be good. Ultimately it is Dorian himself who brings about his own downfall when he is no longer able to face the manifestation of his evilness in Basil Hallward's picture.Upon its initial publication in Lippincott's Monthly Magazine in 1890, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was widely scorned as immoral by a public neither familiar with nor particularly open to the concepts of Aestheticism and its mockery of middle class morality, and repulsed by the thinly veiled homoerotic relationship of the novel's protagonists. Wilde republished the work the following year, adding a preface designed to explain his views on art. Yet, it was that preface which, along with several of his other publications and his written exchanges with Lord Alfred Douglas, ultimately would play a devastating role in his trials, where Queensberry's attorney would come to use an excerpt from that very preface - \\"There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written\\" - to extract from Wilde statements to the effect that any book inspiring a sense of beauty (including, as implied in the attorney's question, an \\"immoral\\" book, if \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" could be qualified as such) was well-written and therefore commendable; that only Philistines, brutes and illiterates - whose views on art he considered invariably stupid and for which he therefore didn't \\"care twopence\\" - could consider this novel \\"perverted,\\" and that the majority of the reading public would probably not be able to draw a proper distinction between a good and a bad book. It was testimony such as this, as well as the impending confrontation with a number of male witnesses ready to testify as to the nature of their relationship with Wilde, that not only caused the author's attorney to convince his client to drop the libel suit against Queensberry but also opened the door for Wilde's own subsequent prosecution.If \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" has a central theme besides the supremacy of beauty and the depiction of a society primarily interested in appearances, it is a call for individuality: Dorian's cruelty is brought out only after he allows himself to be influenced by Lord Henry's equally seductive and cynical hedonism; and similarly, Basil Hallward's blind idolizing of Dorian eventually proves fatal for the painter. - Wilde's only novel is one of the first and most poignant expressions of his own individualism; but unlike his protagonist, who ultimately pays a ghastly prize for selling his soul and giving up his individuality, Wilde paid as high a price for maintaining his. Like Dorian, he knew that \\"[e]ach of us has Heaven and Hell in him,\\" and although this novel's preface ends with the provocative statement that \\"[a]ll art is quite useless,\\" it was the very fact that Wilde put his entire being into his art that ultimately destroyed him. But like beauty, which is finally restored to perfection in Dorian Gray's portrait, Wilde's works have stood the test of time; and not merely for their countless, pricelessly witty epigrams. They're as well worth a read as ever.Also recommended:Complete Works of Oscar Wilde (Collins Classics)Oscar WildeWilde (Special Edition)The Oscar Wilde CollectionThe Picture of Dorian GrayThe Importance of Being Earnest - Criterion CollectionThe Importance of Being EarnestAn Ideal HusbandA Good Woman"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I found the first half or so of this novel the stronger, more interesting part, mostly for the unbelievable abundance of mercilessly satirical paradoxes of the cleverest quality.The building of the story around three characters, really quite different, is satisfying; though, as the story goes on, it's really only about Dorian and his mysterious portrait.The most prominent character for the first part is Lord Harry, the mouthpiece for all of the novel's notoriously subversive paradoxes. People may find him irritating because of his supercilious, scornful intellectual brilliance - they may even be jealous of him because of this, like I was to begin with; and then others will most likely be offended becuase of his espousal of an immoral aestheticism which disregards corrupting social consequences. Yet, I find Lord Harry as remote and inflexible in his decadent aestheticism as any unsympathetic moralist I've ever met in fiction - it's just Lord Harry chooses to be moralistic in a paradoxical, unconventional way. His attitudes are exclusive and unbending, and he lives out his beliefs uncompromisingly. He is impatient of any other view - yes, he is highly moralistic - a brilliant character. I don't think he's meant to be taken too seriously, in the sense that one tries to warm to him or learn from him, like one does with central, powerful characters in other stories - he does not serve that purpose. He's not there to be engaged with; if you attempt it, he'll laugh at you and push you away. He has a weary dislike of you before you even begin reading. So, if you try to make yourself like him, it won't work, and you'll dislike him all the more, and may dislike the novel because of it. Don't upset yourself: read it in the right way. It fully deserves it, because there are pages and pages of gifted prose to be in awe of.Dorian can be likeable because of his sincerity. If I've mistaken him and he isn't really sincere, then I like him because at least he's never at ease with himself for his bad actions - though even that might not be totally true! Well, he is not the same as Lord Harry; he doesn't repulse your advances towards him as a reader like Lord Harry. He's not untouchable.I don't think the story is making any great moral point. Such is the beauty of the writing style and the ideas and the way the people are, rather than who they are, that I think the characters are secondary, in some strange way. The tragedy that befalls two of the main characters near the end of the book isn't heart wrenching. But that isn't a fault of the author's in not making them likeable enough or not developing them well enough; because, like I say, they are slightly removed from us. What is presented for our delectation is the beauty of how they are, more than the morality of how they ought to behave."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"In books, magazines, television, etc. in the English-speaking world, we often come across references made to Oscar Wilde, as many people quote his witty sayings and lines. Having come across so many of these references and quotations myself, I was hesitant to pick up any of his works, assuming that to understand and appreciate Wilde I would have to be some kind of a literary scholar. Let me set the record straight: this is definitely not the case at all, as Oscar Wilde is very down to earth and easy to understand.He is a gifted writer and I understand now why people quote him so much. He's a master at putting thoughts to pen and paper so ingeniously. After I found out for myself what he was all about, I regret that I never read his books earlier. I picked up this book that included various works and I was truly amazed at his genius. He interlaces humor with the heavy so cleverly.In all of his works you can easily identify a so-called \\"dandy\\", a male character whose one role is to make flippant but ironically true remarks to the dismay of stuffy characters. The quotes we so often see or hear are usually remarks uttered by one of Wilde's dandies. Offering tongue-in-cheek humor with wholehearted honesty, Wilde called a spade, a spade but could so with such brilliant wit. Oh if only I could be even half as gifted with the pen!I am not going to write about any plots of the stories and plays, as other readers have done that already. I simply wanted to say that if you have never read anything by Wilde, I highly recommend you do. I am confidant you will enjoy. You could end up like me, frantically longing to get your hands on as much of his writing as you can."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Picture of Dorian Gray is a great work of fiction. Its interplay of Hellenic thought and Judaeo-Christian ethics was light years ahead of its time, even though it might come across muddled to the casual reader. Perhaps, this novel was too far ahead of its time, as it was eventually used as evidence against Wilde in two court cases for 'gross indecency' in 1895.It is a simple story; really, Basil Hallward paints a lovely portrait of Dorian Gray, a veritable Adonis. As the Painter puts the finishing touches upon this portrait, Gray is involved with a conversation regarding the nature of beauty with Lord Henry (Harry) Wotton. This culminates in Dorian wishing and praying that his beauty may never diminish; that he'd have eternal youth. Ultimately, the painting would bear all of the marks of sin, decadence, and decay that cause our physical bodies to age, while Dorian kept his stunning good looks. Wilde brings about a rather wonderful conclusion, and it is a very enjoyable story.The Picture of Dorian Gray has its dull parts. It doesn't remain current, and I'd suggest getting a copy with notes, so that you may be able to keep up with all of the references. Let's be honest, in 2004 who really cares about what was fashionable in 19th century France? These are questions the notes can clarify, and make some of the references more amiable. Still there are parts where Wilde just lists things, and these you should skip.When reading this novel, I think it becomes clear that the three main personalities are a reflection of society at that time. While Basil Hallward seemed to personify Christian conservatism, and a mundane attachment to the status quo, Lord Henry is the questioning romantic, a character that seems to argue everything yet prove nothing, and believe in even less. This makes him no less interesting, and I believe Wilde may have included him as a farce of some of his contemporaries, yet some of the best insights and quotes actually come from Lord Henry.Dorian is the romantic ideal of perfection. Though a horrible character that fears no consequences for his actions, he still remains perfection. I think that aristocratic England valued physical appearance, social wit, and worldliness more than an ethical life.Dorian Gray also typifies Wilde's affections for Hellenic culture. Dorian is the stereotypical Greek Tragic Hero. He has a flaw; his vanity; this flaw leads to his downfall; a life of sin; he realizes his flaw in the end, and tries to make amends, but it is too little too late. If you enjoy Shakespeare Allusions, you will enjoy this.I really liked The Picture of Dorian Gray, but I will not advise one way or the other whether you should read it or not. If you want something stimulating that will have an enormity of good quotes that will make your dominating intellect seem even more so to the untrained eye, then check it out. If you're looking for pulp go check out Tom Clancey or Danielle Steele."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Innocent and young Dorian Gray is seduced by some bad influences, and taught to worship youth, beauty, and sensation. Due to a passionate prayer, the physical effects of a life dedicated to self-gratification and pleasure-seeking are borne by a painting of him instead of by his own body. The story focuses not on the actual events of Dorian's life, but the discussions on the philosophies supporting such a life. To this reviewer, the message is that a life of selfishness and self-gratification corrupts, and in the end we can have no separation from this corruption. Dorian Gray is a tad slow at times, as the conversations can get long, but it is still educational, and certainly worth reading."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I never would have thought this interesting combination of Marlowe, Shakespeare, and Dickens possible. For those of you who follow my writing, you know that I really liked Mr. Wilde's \\"Importance of Being Earnest.\\" And his \\"Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is enough to put him right up there with Mr. Marlowe, Mr. Shakespeare, and Mr. Dickens. Like any good tale of terror, the story starts normal and plausible. We only get to know Sybil for a short while, but she delivers a very touching passage on her love for Dorian which prepares her very sympathetic character. Her brother is prepared early and resurfaces with good timing. Basil is well drawn as the artist who has an interesting fascination with Dorian. We only see Alan Campbell briefly, but we are permitted to feel some sympathy for him when he is forced into a criminal act and finds himself overcome with anxiety. Harry is a well drawn character who not only provides comical touches, but jokes (unknowingly) about many dark thoughts that are undoubtedly revolving in Dorian's mind. And Dorian? What a wonderful creation! First we get to see him as a normal person. Soon afterwards, we see his dark desires. We see him fall in love, and then we see his love turn to abuse. But even as we see his character descend into evil, Wilde never quite permits us to forget that he is human. This is especially prevalent when he longs for his childhood innocence. Wilde masterfully builds tension when Dorian's unchanged face starts to raise questions. And as if this were not enough, Wilde allows Dorian's reputation to degenerate with his character. What's left? Only beautiful and excellent wording, magnificent suspense, terrifying moments, dramatic irony, some well placed comical touches, etc, etc, etc. This is a phenomenal book that offers an interesting combination of Marlowe's techniques (showing pacts with evil), Shakespeare's techniques (articulate wording and passages), and Dickens' techniques. (Fierce humor side by side with pure terror.) DO NOT let this phenomenal masterpiece get away!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"When asked to pick a favorite passage from a book, a lot of people will choose a vivid description. These people like authors to create beautiful scenes for them that they can forever conjure up in their heads. For this kind of reader, The Picture of Dorian Gray is probably a pleasure. Unfortunately, I am not this kind of reader.It is perhaps fitting that a book about beauty is defined by the images it creates rather than by the story or the dialogue. However, Oscar Wilde's mastery of dialogue is what makes his plays such a pleasure. For me, The Picture of Dorian Gray will never live up to Wilde's plays. This is not to say that the book is completely irredeemable; whenever Lord Henry is around, the book becomes better (but only insofar as it becomes more like a play, more focused on dialogue).You will love this book if you like descriptions, if you, unlike me, were able to read the chapters of The Grapes of Wrath that rambled about the land and that did not contribute to the plot. If you are like me, on the other hand, this book will be readable but not particularly enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The storyline is very good and the theme is thought provoking. However, the great weakness for me are the characters in this piece. Character driven novels have characters that bring out some form of emotion from the reader. Be it fondness, admiration, sympathy for the hero or hate of the villain. I had no emotional interest in any of the characters in this book. I simply didn't care about any of their fates. Had Wilde developed the characters better this could have been a masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"If you have never read an Oscar Wilde book, read this one. It is easy to read, entertaining and throughly enjoyable. The language doesn't trip you up. I have enjoyed reading it."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I have watched the old movie of this story and the newer one but had never read the book. This was excellent!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The most disappointing part of this book is that it read more like a non-fiction philosophy book than a story or novel. I would say 70% of the pages were portrayed as thoughts of a character or a speech of a character contemplating life, women, how we are suppose to live, etc.The actual story was hidden throughout the book, but you have to drone on through many pages to find it. The story itself is highly predictable and yet still has many missing parts to it. Many years of Dorian Gray's life is missing where it is hinted to that he commit's the most awful sins. I think reading of those sinful actions was to be more entertaining than the rabbit trails that Wilde goes on.Despite these facts, I am glad that I read the book once. It held my attention enough and was brilliant enough that I did learn something from the book, which is a great accomplishment in itself, to teach a reader a few principals that may slightly help or change on any small level, the readers actions. So I do recommend this book if you have no more pressing serious books on your reading list.On a side note, I do disagree with all the reviews I have seen on this book where the reader says that they can not relate to Dorian Gray's sins and that his sins are outdated. His chief sins in the book are (SMALL SPOILER ALERT) murder, drug use, pride, treating others harshly and without respect, using women in many ways, etc. are all sins practiced today even if they are not practiced exactly the way they are in the book. If you can relate to none of those sins in any way, then you are a better person than I, or suffer from foolish pride which is the chief sin in the book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I'm being made to read this book for the third time (once in high school, twice in college), but I've always rather detested it. I've been told I need to \\"appreciate\\" it, and to that effect I've been reading a number of reviews (both positive and negative) of this book, trying to get a grip on *why* it's so highly regarded. The basic story is this: Dorian (a pretty twentysomething without much personality) makes a tacit (implied, not stated) bargain with a painter: his portrait will grow old and sick while he remains young and beautiful, no matter what he does to himself. And he does *plenty* to himself. 230 pages later, he grows a conscience and tries to destroy the painting, bringing age/sickness on himself and thus dying, unpunished for his \\"sins.\\" The Faust parallels are evident; unfortunately Dorian Gray is no Faust, and lord Henry (his \\"corrupter\\") is no Mephistopheles. The book is told as a series of banal witticisms and jests which sound good the first time you read them but get chewed up and spat out the second they're exposed to intelligent analysis. (Example from the preface: \\"All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath the surface do so at their peril. Those who read the symbol do so at their peril. It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors. Diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new, complex and vital. When critics disagree the artist is in accord with himself. We can forgive a man for making a useful thing as long as he does not admire it. The only excuse for making a useless thing is that one admires it intensely. All art is quite useless.\\")Synthesizing all the reviews, I get the sense that people who *really* like it--the \\"witty\\" verbiage, the Faust-lite storyline, and the moral heavy-handedness--like it because it shields them from the knowledge of their own inner emptiness. That sounds harsh; let me explain further. Since everything is stylized, pre-determined, and \\"fake,\\" there's no danger of self-discovery--no danger of discovering anything true. Oscar Wilde was deeply alienated against his own self (most homosexuals living at that time and in that society were), and so is not capable of feeling honestly, or expressing himself with any sincerity. Human nature (in the wider, not baser, sense) is \\"reduced\\"--that's the only word I can think of to describe it. Words are everything; appearances; everything. But words are empty sounds without the meanings attached to them (anyone who knows more than one language knows *that*), and appearances are superficial and deceiving, to trot out that old cliche. Human beings do not exist merely to think up verbal ripostes to personal attacks, and yet, here, this is all they do. Well, that and \\"sin.\\" But what a \\"sin\\" is is never really defined, and Dorian Gray doesn't really \\"sin\\" much (he seduces a girl, dumps her, and there's some implied homosexuality---*yawn*).\\"Dorian\\" is a morality tale, like the story of Jesus. It is something to tell children with no imagination, to warn them of the dangers of societal rejection--the dangers of being \\"different.\\" In a subtle way, it encourages conformity--and it *definitely* encourages repression. It is false to me in so many ways that I can hardly stomach it."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"nicely bound, beautifully embossed, priced especially well considering the binding and compared to other retailers such as Anthropologie; contains a sewn in ribbon bookmark which I love.

When I started to read, I was in some kind of rapturous awe of Wilde's writing. It was so utterly beautiful, shaped and molded as finely as the face of the man Wilde so eloquently describes, Mr. Dorian Gray himself.

It centers on a young dandy who is rather shallow and self-absorbed. He makes an off-handed statement about how he wishes he would never grow old and that a picture painted of him would suffer the ravages of age instead. This wish is granted and the story follows the events that unfold up to Dorian's realization that he has received everything he \\"wanted\\" and is now miserable. Two main acquaintances Basil and Lord Henry abound. Basil in some ways is a God figure in that he represents the good path and encourages Dorian to better himself and be an upright person. Lord Henry on the other hand is more of a Beelzebub. He encourages Dorian to debase himself, follow his whims and not concern himself with the wreckage he leaves in his wake. One of the two advisors wins out as the story proceeds and it ends in the only way it could."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I listened to the audio version, which was a delight. This classic impresses upon the reader the importance of Christ's rhetorical question: what does it profit a man to gain the whole word but lose his soul? Wilde also underscores the point that true beauty resides in the eternal soul not the temporal body. This is a book to read and re-read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I was highly impressed by this novel of arts, society, morality and immortality. It has to be one of the most deepest things that I have ever read.

I always loved this story. I'm keen on wordy books. I love to be overwhelmed by description and beautiful lavish language.

It was an interesting book, and while I cannot say that I liked it as such, it is good to have read it - my curiosity is satisfied.It was very sad that Dorian went so completely \\"off the rails\\", so to speak, under the influence of Henry, and I found the worldview difficult to cope with. At times the irony in the situations was very poignant - such as when Dorian tells Sybil Vane that she is selfish, while he, in fact, is the selfish one. I suppose that justice was met at the end of the book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"First published in 1890, Oscar Wilde's now classic novel is a meditation on decadence, art and morality. At the center is a young man of strikingly good looks who's portrait is painted by a dear friend - a portrait that then absorbs and reflects the young man's soul as he makes decisions that affect others as he slides into a life of debauchery.Highly stylized, the prose contains classic lines such as \\"the only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it.\\" Wilde's only novel, the book was viewed as scandalous and immoral when published despite the fact that the immoral - or, more accurately, amoral perpetrator of ill deeds suffers as he chases empty pleasures and eventually comes to reflect upon the impact that his actions have had upon others and himself.The book is not the easiest of reads given the heavy style, the setting, and pervasive use of cultural references from high society in the late 19th century. However, for those who want to fully understand the commonly referenced trope of \\"Dorian Gray's portrait,\\" nothing serves bettern than the source."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I read this book because it was a bookclub read.

I am happy that I read the book and I did find it to be a good story and plot overall. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read the classics."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I really have no idea why \\"Illustrated\\" is included in the title of this work. The only part of this book that is illustrated (besides the cover) is the short biography found at the end of the book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"It must have been around 1870 when very capable artist Basil Hallward brilliantly painted soon to be very rich 20-year old Dorian Gray. Hallward's wordy, witty friend Lord Henry Wotton on their first meeting in the painter's studio persuaded Dorian Gray that youth was any good looking human's greatest attribute. And youth, since it did not long endure, must be lived to the utmost while it did last. This meant Dorian's \\"expressing,\\" externalizing every insight, impulse and passion that most people learn to keep bottled up inside them. An early version of \\"let it all hang out.\\"Oh, how hitherto naive and innocent Dorian wished that he would never have to say farewell to his youth and beauty! If only he might stay young while the young man in his portrait did all the aging? That wish was granted. And THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY (1890, 1891) unrolls the next 18 or 19 years of Gray's while everyone around him grew older but he did not.It can be argued,that Dorian's wish for eternal youth was morally indifferent, neither good nor bad. It might have remained harmless, like Ponce de Leon's search for the Fountain of Youth. It was conceivably a well-meaning God who granted Dorian Gray's wish. What would matter in the end was what Gray did with his youth.He was given good albeit secular advice by painter Basil Hallward and very bad, cynical, character-ruining advice by Lord Henry. Unfortunately for Hallward (whom Gray would later murder) and for Dorian himself, the young man consistently heeded Lord Henry. In consequence, Dorian Gray learned to separate art from reality, learned to value clever words and eptithets more than unselfish deeds and denied himself nothing that his fertile brain could imagine. This self-indulgence included frequent visits to London opium dens, brawls with foreign sailors on the docks and viciously spurning Sybil Vane, the teenage Shakespearean actress, whom he loved for her acting skills but who renounced them because they seemed unreal compared with Dorian's love for her. Hours after a scathing denunciation by a disappointed Dorian, young Sybil swallows prussic acid and dies.All this dissent into hell is faithfully reproduced in the increasingly cruel, vicious lines of face and body in the portrait of Dorian Gray. The picture becomes the conscience of the novel's hero who often sits spell-bound before it. It sometimes persuades him, very briefly, to make half-hearted efforts at reform. But the portrait allows Dorian to understand that every single one of his half-hearted good deeds is hypocritical, is bad acting. For 18 years, until he destroys himelf with a knife intended to destroy his portrait, Dorian Gray remains a handsome 20-year old while all others move steadily toward the grave.Telling the bare story of Gray's decline takes up perhaps a third of THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY. The rest is ballast, starting with excursuses into Gray's sometimes year long fads of the moment: tapestries, music, religion (especially Roman Catholicism), mysticism and decadent French literature. Then there are teas, dinners and parties among the swells and aristocrats of London. These are all contrived social stages for Oscar Wilde to let his decadent characters like Lord Henry Wotton and handsome young Dorian Gray skewer institutions like marriage and preen themselves before admiring audiences as they drop several hundred seemingly spontaneous epithets into sparkling conversations. The London ambience of useless Duchesses, members of Parliament and wealthy society widows is lovingly limned by Oscar Wilde.Let one party and its smart talk suffice for many. As brilliant for its repartee as any other social occasion in the novel is Chapter 15's small, hastily puled together dinner at Lady Narborough's. Dorian Gray appears, having mere hours before having stabbed to death his friend painter Basil Hallward and having then blackmailed another onetime friend to dispose of the body. At Lady Narborough's Dorian was wildly excited but outwardly calm and his manner \\"as easy and graceful as ever.\\" The company was rather dull. His hostess's married daughter had \\"one of those characteristic British faces that, once seen, are never remembered.\\" Things became livelier when Lord Henry Wotton arrived, very, very late. The table discusses the amours of Madame de Ferrol. Lord Henry summed her up: \\"Her capacity for family affection is extraordinary. When her third husband died, her hair turned quite gold from grief.\\" Henry preens himself when accused of wickedness: \\"It is perfectly monstrous ... the way people go about nowadays saying things against one behind one's back that are absolutely and entirely true.\\"The question arises at Lady Narborough's: are we such a sorry lot because it is \\"the end of the century\\" (fin de siecle)? or the end of the world (fin de globe)? Certainly none of the players is morally outstanding or even self-content. They are useless and they know it.-OOO-"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This was a English summer project for my daughter in school. She really enjoyed it.

Oscar Wilde's \\"Dorian Gray\\" is about youth, corruption, and esthetics. Reflective of Wilde's own life and revolt against Victorian era sentimentality, young Dorian Gray slowly changes after his philosophical discussions with the cynical Lord Henry Wotton, whose cold criticisms and harsh wit are often humorous in an addictively jaded kind of way, and tempting to arm oneself with; however, read on and observe Wilde's destruction of Lord Henry's young protoget. The immediate power of Basil Hallward's portrait of Dorian retains a demonic hold on its confused subject, taunting and torturing his vanity with its strangely metamorphizing characteristics. Who's changing, and what exactly is changing? Wilde creates an unforgettable \\"portrait\\" here of one man's (or is it the whole of Victorian society?) demise. Many critics of Wilde have seen him and \\"The Portrait of Dorian Gray\\" as pure evil and criticized the undertones of homosexuality, and linked it with a lifestyle of debauchery and degradation. Wilde was thrown in jail for his \\"unlawful activities\\". To them I must concur with Wilde, that \\"Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without being charming. This is a fault.\\""},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wilde's Dorian Gray is such a powerful book because it explores the path of one man's sins and their effect on his life and the lives of those around him. Wilde uses Dorian as an example to demonstrate the struggles of humanity coping with its flaws. Wilde's plot is simple enough. Dorian was a man who had everything going for him. He was young, beautiful, wealthy, and unspoiled. Then he met Lord Henry, whose bizzare philosophies that he himself didn't even take seriously had a great impact on the impressionable Dorian. Lord Henry had convinced Dorian that once his youth had passed, he would have nothing enjoyable left in life, which caused Dorian pray aloud that a portrait he had of himself would take on his own physical burdens. As Dorian becomes more and more corrupted by Lord Henry and commits more sins, he notices that the painting (which represents his conscience) is becoming more and more wretched. He occasionally feels remorse and tries to change, but his plans always fail when Lord Henry draws him back under the shadow of his influence. The discouraged Dorian finally resolves to start his life anew by destroying the painting, the only record he has of his sins. When he stabs the picture, however, he kills himself.This is a powerful story that portrays the important lesson that sins are inescapable and everybody's actions catch up to them. This isn't a hard concept, but Wilde's writing is very challenging. He uses very poignant expressions constantly throughout the book that can get the reader off track because they tend to cause him to attempt to frequently stop and process what has just been said. I think that this was a great book, but it wouldn't be good to require it at Mercy High because it takes so long to get through."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"More than a story, The Picture of Dorian Gray contains many of Oscar Wilde's most famous commentary on life. Unlike any other work of fiction that I have read before I actually read this book with a pen in hand, underlining Wilde's eloquent thoughts about art, tragedy and life.No need to recap the story here other than to say that it continues to be applicable to every human being born into this world. Each of us has our own picture that reflects our deepest and truest feelings, thoughts and actions. Facades abound but there is no getting around our frequent trips inside to have a look at the portrait that only we can see.A masterful book that goes far beyond the well-known story."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"\\"What does it profit a man if he gains the world, but loses his soul?\\" This is the core question raised by \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\", Oscar Wilde's reworking (if that isn't too unkind) of Goethe's Faust for the Victorian era and his attack on the values of the middle classes caused a scandal when it was first published in 1890 and over 100 years later, while not particularly shocking to the modern reader is still a deeply unsettling tale. The novel revolves around our hero Dorian, the tensions within his own character and the forces that conspire in his eventual destruction.The book begins with Dorian seeing for the first time a portrait of himself painted by his friend Basil Hallward and Dorian's wish that the portrait would age while he remained forever the same as he was on that day. The \\"prayer of his pride\\" is answered and not only does the picture carry the assault of time for Dorian, but also the full weight of the casual cruelties and crimes he commits, evolving from a reproduction of his physical form into a mirror image of his soul. Realising this, Dorian is driven to even greater excesses safe in the knowledge that he can get away with it until finally his own guilt catches up with him.In his only novel, one can't help but feel that Oscar is giving us an insight into his own soul and the guilt he suffered over his sexual orientation. But on a deeper level, Wilde shows us the damnation of one soul and in that gives us a metaphor for our world and ourselves. Despite the Victorian idea that a person&#65533;s nature is written on their face, which is frankly ludicrous with the hindsight of the last century, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is a truly wonderful and thought-provoking story heavily laced with the famous wit and wisdom of the great man himself."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"\\"It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors\\" - Oscar Wilde\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is an excellent novel about the degradation of the human soul. The novel focuses around the handsome Dorian Gray and his interactions with the artist Basil Hallward, who paints his portrait and Lord Henry, who becomes the corrupting influence on Dorian's soul and Dorian's iinteractions with the British aristocracy. Dorian is compared to Narcissus, who was so obsessed with his own beauty, that it swallowed him whole. Dorian seals his fate with one wish; upon viewing his portrait, he wonders if it would be possible for his portrait to show the signs of aging, in exchange for his mortal beauty. Throughout the novel, we see Dorian's decent into total self - absorbtion and evil all of which culminates in an ending that is predictable but still entertaining none the less.Just a quick side note, there is some great social commentary running throughout \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\\" specifically Wilde's commentary on the stiff, British aristocracy of the late 19th century, absurd views regarding women, who are painted by Gray as blubbering idiots (a sign of the times) and last but not least, the underlying homosexual undertones present between Dorian, Basil and Lord Henry are fascinating to deconstruct.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was my first introduction to Oscar Wilde and after reading the novel, I was hooked. I would like to return to the quote above, about art mirroring the soul of the spectator, after reading this novel, you will have a sense of how trully frightening that notion is."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"To be honest, I had two reasons for choosing this book. One was for a class assignment. Having a list to choose from lead to the second reason I picked this- a friend told me she had greatly enjoyed it. Therefore, I began reading with the expectation of having a &quot;nice&quot; read. Other than that, I didn't expect much from the novel. This is one of the times I am glad to say that I was wrong. &lt;i&gt;The Picture of Dorian Gray&lt;/i&gt; providea, first and foremost a good storyline. A young man, worried that once his youth and beauty departs he will lose everything, wishes that a portrait painted of him bear all reprecussions of time. After a period of time, this young man, Dorian Gray, discovers he has gotten his wish. However, an old maxim proves true once more in this novel: be careful what you wish for, as Gray learns he will, in fact, get what he deserves as a result of a life of debauchery. Yet an interesting (and certainly unsettling, at least at the time it was written) story line is not all the book has going for it. Wilde provides the reader with three main characters who are well-developed enough to make them convincing. We are given a tempramental artist (another good reason to read this book: anyone with any sort of artistic temprament will greatly appreciate some of the commentary made within the dialogue of the story), who is given to jealousy, a jaded, rather intellectual man who always has an opinon and never hastens to inform those in the vicinity of it, and, finally, a young man who begins the story as a very naive person and changes throughout the book in a seemingly natural manner. A wide variety of smaller characters also help to enhance the plot. In short, this book was one of the most interesting I have ever read. At times, I found myself getting the attention of someone nearby, to point out a line found in one of the passages that I felt they might enjoy or somehow relate to. In one way or another, it is my opinion one would be hard-pressed to find someone who did not relate to something the book. Overall, it was an excellent read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The idea of never growing old and having a painting take on all your admoralities is appealing.Dorian reacts as anyone would. He lives life with full adbandonment pays the price.I believe the moral of the story is this. In the end we all pay for our actions.Wilde does a great job building characters and leading the reader into the world of the Englis upper-crust."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book is sooo good, I think no jaded reader can deserve that title without having read this book. Dorian Gray, an astonishingly beautiful young aristocrat, receives the gift of eternal youth in the form of a painting one of his friends has made of him. Later, prompted by another friend, the divine dissolute Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian gradually falls into a dissipate lifestyle and the eerie painting shows both the ravages of age and the advance of Dorian's moral decay, while he retains his breathtaking looks. As Dorian becomes more and more obsessed with the painting's worsening appearance, the changes in his once sweet and naive personality are explained in the story, and Dorian lives in fear of the painting being exposed to the world, therefore showing him beyond any doubt as the sleazy creep he is, until it comes to a point when the gift he prized so much ends up turning against him. Dorian Gray is one of the least likable characters I have seen on print, but I really liked his wicked friend Lord Wotton, who in the story is the one in charge of leading Dorian astray and dishing criticism after witty criticism of nineteenth century English society. I later learned this particular character was a sort of mockery of Oscar Wilde himself. A mellower version of this character can be found in another of Wilde's works, Lord Arthur Savile's Crime, my second favorite story by this author."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Contrary to some opinions I've come across, this book does NOT romanticize or promote a loss of morals. It is the exact opposite. Yes, Dorian becomes corrupted, but does the ending suggest that Wilde was making Dorian a hero for it? By no means. Dorian did not live happily ever after. It is a very moral book in that it clearly reinforces the principle of inevitable consequences of one's actions. Yes, at times it was a little slow (that is when the characters went into long life-philosophies)but all around it was very interesting and provided an insight into the late Victorian world in which Oscar Wilde lived. It addresses some key concepts such as appearance and its relation to virtue and the double-sidedness of one's character. Overall this book was not bad at all. A good read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I am a fan of many writers, but Oscar Wilde holds a special place in my non-existant but nonetheless real Hallway of Marble Busts of Famous Dead Guys. Obviously, Wilde was aware of his already-forming legend status at the height of his popularity, and his arrogance is permeated throughout every one of his works. This does not, however, disqualify him from being rightly honored by his huge and admiring readership. It also doesn't change the fact that he was victim of his own irony, dying young and humiliated in jail. No one illustrates tragicomedy better than Oscar Wilde. This particular book is the Bible of the Infinitely Quotable Strokes of Verbal Genius. My personal fave: &quot;Cigarettes are the perfect form of the perfect pleasure. They are exquisite and they leave one unsatisfied. What more could one want?&quot;"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Besides the clever fiction and vivid details that draws you in deep, this book brings out the shame of humanity and puts it on display so elegantly.

It was actually why I decided to read it.If you expect exploits as in the movies, where he uses his ability and all that, then you'll regret it.It's a good story about a man who realises what morality is and how to live with it, or not live with it."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I heard of the movie first because I'm a Fan of Ben Barnes before I found the book. I read the reviews and saw how people praises the book a lot. I liked the concept so figured I'll read it first before I'll watch the movie. I really thought I'd walk into a grotesque environment but it ended up so intriguing. Its exhilarating and atmospheric. I admire Oscar Wilde's brilliance in creating the characters, specifically Lord Henry. He is Dorian Gray's (the evil one) creator and honestly, Henry is the keystone of the story. His lines are perfectly constructed making them alluring even if he wasn't brave enough to do them himself. If I were like Dorian who grew up seeing only 4 walls and suddenly got freed, then get to talk to a man as eloquent as Henry is, I really believe his influence will be so great too. The characters of the book also show deep interest in art of different forms including Painting of course, literature and fashion which reflects the artist within Oscar himself. The author described Dorian Gray as \\"art\\" himself, I figured it will be challenging to find a person to play the part in the movie so beautiful to be called \\"art\\". Amazingly, Ben Barnes lived up to the role. Being chosen to play that role brings pressure and flattery of course, but the challenge is, if he can bring to life the Dorian Gray Oscar Wilde created. Its a good read! Oscar Wilde is a talented writer as we all know. This book can change your point of view of some aspects in life if you let it!! As what Ben said, \\"there's a great difference between pleasure and real happiness\\". You can try the movie too, its wonderfully made; great acting and the story line is nice. they made a few modifications and additions from the book at it made it more interesting. Colin forth and Ben Barnes were fabulous! The movie is lush, exhilarating and extremely sexy!!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"A fascinating look into the human ego and basic selfishness,this story could as easily have been written regarding our society as that of 1890s England.

Some of their friends sent their children there long before I was born. Pastor Jones might have had Dorian Gray in mind when he said: \\"Dissipations of youth must be paid for with a draft on old age.\\"Wilde's Dorian Gray is devoted to the fanciful premise that a soul might scar itself with the most horrible of depraved debauchery, which in Victorian London included opium dens, prostitution, and in the case of Mr. Gray, murder, both by proxy and in personal excess of temper. So, if you exercise patience, a murder mystery unfolds. (Lots and lots of patience!)What dark meditations crossed my mind, and how like ice was my countenance while feasting in Wilde's psychological eulogizing of scarlet sins and opulence from dozens of characters famous in classical Western history. As my mother was a history major with emphasis in fine arts, I've seen many of the anecdotal persons from art and mythology named in this book, experienced their art and literature and stories in our own collections and the local library. I've read their sad, sordid sense of moral turpitude, the decay of dynasties possessed of great art, luxury and wealth.Dorian's zeal to experience every pleasure on which he might lay his hands is reminiscent of the Ecclesiastes, though more lengthy and of less lucid outcomes. Accused sometimes of misanthropy, Oscar Wilde is nonetheless a master of florid verbosity. As once observed by author Ursula K. LeGuin, each sentence must dedicate it's reason for being, to an introduction of the next sentence.I might not have read all of this novel, except that I'm awed in admiration of the incredibly artful architecture of Wilde's sentences. One simple sentence might introduce what literature teachers will scold their students about being a \\"run-on-sentence.\\"But Wilde philosophizes elaborate arguments in the heads of his characters. There is nothing wrong analytically, or logically with attaching the cohesive phrases and clauses of two or more sides of an argument all together into a unified thought, even wielding a dozen commas to conjoin these articulated opposites.The style evokes memories of reading St. Paul in the King James English Bible, or the sublime constructions found in the tragedyRamona (Signet Classics), by Helen Hunt Jackson. I would never subject juvenile readers to the philosophy of Dorian Grey. Even as an adult, I'm grateful to have experienced a healthy dose of Shakespeare, prior to microscopically examining the minutia of a deeply troubled mind preoccupied with male beauty."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I started out disliking this book: too much silliness, not enough serious message. However, as time progressed, it turned out that the silliness (often shown in people's favorite quotes) is froth, and the body underneath is substantial: good, evil, innocence, and corruption. Wilde is a sublime genius at meshing the two levels in one work."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"this was a well written book but I wouldn't suggest it to anyone who wants a relaxing read.

To allow us to see deeper into the human soul than we could otherwise. Although this book was short, it took me a good week to read. I kept having to put it down after a chapter or two so I could read something else. Every word seemed to suck me in while not making me want to read another sentence at the same time. I guess the fact that I was also reading Milton's Paradise Lost at the same time as Dorian Gray doesn't help cut down the long internal debates Dorian Gray forced into my skull. Either way, this novel is a must read for anyone who has even thought that self examination is a part of what it means to be alive. But beware.

Given a magical portrait that protects the subject from the consequences of immorality, Rod Sterling would have ended it the same way.Still reading through a contemporary lens, Dorian Gray provides rich imagery of life in the 19th century.

Already teetering on the verge of chronic narcissism, Dorian is pushed off the edge into the abyss of eternal damnation by Henry's seductive, imaginative, and in the end, destructive speech.This classic, cautionary tale of the woes of youth has vanity at its core. Dorian, like all of us, is afraid of becoming irrelevant and unloved as a consequence of old age. Only in his case, he let his paranoia coupled with bad influence (Lord Henry) devour him. The story isn't unique in the sense that it happens everyday in the form of inconsequential lives consumed by gyms, beauty salons and drugs, chasing reluctant love and evasive youth.If you haven't read this classic in school, I highly recommend you do now. Lord Henry's lines, though evil, are very entertaining and almost too poetic. No man I know has a wit and sharp tongue like Lord Henry, but again, he is not a man. He is the devil's incarnate."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"That famous quote from Shakespeare's Hamlet certainly applies to Dorian Gray. And Lord Henry Wotton couldn't help using this quote, much like he couldn't help baiting Dorian Gray. Lord Henry admires the man in Basil Hallward's new portrait so much that he has got to meet him. Is he as beautiful in real life as he is in the painting? Is he ever! He is an Adonis, a young man as pure on the inside as he is on the outside. No wonder Hallward is obsessed with him! So begins Lord Henry's attempts to corrupt the young man. In no uncertain terms, he tells Dorian Gray that \\"beauty is the wonder of wonders. It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances.\\" He also goes on to tell him that his wonderful youth and good looks are his best qualities, too bad someday they will fade. Dorian Gray is upset. His portrait will remain young and beautiful forever, whereas he will age and lose with his physical beauty. If only it were the other way around...That is all I'll share in terms of plot. You have got to read this magnificent novel to know the rest. The Picture of Dorian Gray, first published in 1890, is one of the most disturbing works of fiction I have ever read. No wonder it is so popular! It is thought provoking from beginning to end. Dorian is a cross between Narcissus and Faust -- his vanity is obvious from the very start, and Lord Henry is depicted as a devil, whereas Hallward is the angel who tries to maintain Dorian's innocence. Yes, as it has often been observed, the novel does have some not-so-concealed references to homosexuality. The aforementioned theme, mainly noticeable in Hallward, is, in the words of Marianne Dashwood in Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility, \\"implied but never declared.\\" There was no need for Wilde to say it in so many words, but he dropped hints here and there, like the rumors that Hallward moved to San Francisco. I doubt he would have been able to be more inconspicuous in his time. This novel could cover long hours of discussion. There are so many themes and symbolism and magic realism and foreshadowing here, and Lord Henry's crude but honest musings and observations are fascinating. He is definitely the most interesting character in the book. This is my first time reading this book. I'd wanted to read it since I read Amanda Filipacchi's Nude Men ten years ago. Why it took me so long to give it a whirl I will never know. Better late than never, I guess. And if you haven't read it, well, need I suggest that you do? You won't regret it. This is nineteenth century literature at its finest."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I truly enjoyed this book. It's a story of Dorian Gray's journey through life. There's a great quote, which really is the theme for the entire book...\\"what does it profit a man if he gain the world and lose his own soul?\\" The pleasures and sins Dorian Gray enjoys in life are conveyed onto his portrait. Ultimately, his portrait ages and warps with each transgression that tarnishes his soul.Wilde has some great narratives and descriptions in the book. His writing style immersed me in the book. Very moving. I can truly see why it's a classic and wish I had read it sooner."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The quickest way to sum up this book in one word is \\"wow.\\" I will admit that for awhile I didn't find the book 5-star worthy, but I soon found myself thoroughly engrossed. Wilde has written this story like a symphony in four movements with an overture, ballad, climax, and finale. The prose is absolutely lyrical.Beauty is a dominant theme. Wilde excessively alludes to Greek Gods and the perfection of Adonis. The concept of beauty is also represented in the idea of man vs. himself, or better yet as beauty vs. immortality. Dorian wrestles constantly with his inner self and with the immortality his beauty presents to him. But with his beauty comes sins and pleasure that have no effect on him because their consequences marr his self portrait. Dorian uses his beauty to sin which ultimately leads to violence; his emotions often confuse his sins with pleasure.A secondary theme is the absence of reality. In the Importance of Being Earnest, Wilde echoes a similar line as that from Dorian. He writes that the two most attractive types of people are those who know nothing at all or absolutely everything. Three key characters represent varying degrees of reality, as well as Wilde's description of attractive people. Dorian knows nothing and Lord Henry knows absolutely everything, but Basil is the medium ground between the two that represents reality. Basil is the only one who sees/acknowledges things for what they truly are, but he is shunned by others who don't want to see reality. Characters like Dorian and Lord Henry have the idea that to see reality is to be scared of life. It is bad to be a spectator to one's own life. Dorian even admits that \\"He felt that the secret of the whole thing was not to realise the situation.\\" If he didn't acknowledge it, it simply did not exist.Lastly is the theme of homosexuality. Wilde does not mention any specifics of homosexual relationships, but what one has to read between the lines jumps off the page with equal magnitude of the written text.All in all, this book is excellent. Read this book, you will be glad you did!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The novel \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" by Oscar Wilde is yet another triumph for this talented author. The dark tale of a young man who unknowingly sells his soul in order to stay forever young is wittily brought across through three main characters, each resembling a different part of Wilde himself.Dorian, the main character, represents what Wilde himself said he would like to be, yet Dorian also clearly resembles part of Wilde: the part that was once young and innocent before becoming corrupted by the world he lived in.Henry Wooton, the man responsible for the corruption of Dorian Gray, is the side of Oscar Wilde that the world thought was the true Wilde: carefree and conceited, caring nothing for other people, yet extremely witty. This is also Wilde, as far as the witty and carefree parts go. Only when Henry displays his rare moments of care for other people does this character seem like Wilde.Basil, the man who paints the infamous picture of Dorian, is the character who Wilde found himself to be the most like. Quiet and withdrawn, Basil is a caring man with a good consience who completely adores Dorian. Out of the entire novel, Basil is one of the few truly good people.This novel does, however, have it's shortcomings. Lord Henry Wooton's wife is introduced in a scene and given an extremely interesting description. She is a nervous woman who laughs often and also displays the wit that Wilde was so famous for. This description, however, makes one think that she will be extremely important later, when in truth, she never shows up again (though she is mentioned once by Henry). There is also a chapter that delves a little too deeply into the obsessions that Dorian went through, going into long run-on sentances and too-long descriptions.Overall, this is an extremely well-written novel that portrays what is wrong with society today through the views of the characters and the actions they take. Though it may not be the easiest read for today's society (many of whom are as corrupt as the characters in the book), it is one well worth reading, if only for a new outlook on life."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"\\"It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors\\" - Oscar Wilde\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is an excellent novel about the degradation of the human soul. The novel focuses around the handsome Dorian Gray and his interactions with the artist Basil Hallward, who paints his portrait and Lord Henry, who becomes the corrupting influence on Dorian's soul and Dorian's iinteractions with the British aristocracy. Dorian is compared to Narcissus, who was so obsessed with his own beauty, that it swallowed him whole. Dorian seals his fate with one wish; upon viewing his portrait, he wonders if it would be possible for his portrait to show the signs of aging, in exchange for his mortal beauty. Throughout the novel, we see Dorian's decent into total self - absorbtion and evil all of which culminates in an ending that is predictable but still entertaining none the less.Just a quick side note, there is some great social commentary running throughout \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\\" specifically Wilde's commentary on the stiff, British aristocracy of the late 19th century, absurd views regarding women, who are painted by Gray as blubbering idiots (a sign of the times) and last but not least, the underlying homosexual undertones present between Dorian, Basil and Lord Henry are fascinating to deconstruct.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was my first introduction to Oscar Wilde and after reading the novel, I was hooked. I would like to return to the quote above, about art mirroring the soul of the spectator, after reading this novel, you will have a sense of how trully frightening that notion is."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"C.S. Lewis wrote that pride is the greatest sin. It is the doorway to all other kinds of evil. Though this was certainly not what Oscar Wilde was writing about, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a perfect illustration of this. The protagonist's pride causes him to go to horrible lengths. In the end it causes everyone around him (and eventually himself) great pain. I have read Wilde's works only a couple of times since being introduced to them in high school. Each time I do, I remember how much I like him as an author. This time, I was once again reminded how masterful Wilde was as a writer. His keen wit and incisive humor is refreshing. His prose is clean and unlabored. I don't know why I haven't read his stuff more often. I certainly will now."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This story is positively a masterpiece. Dorian Gray is a young boy at first, whose beauty is so entirely dazzling that Mr. Basil Hallward, an artist, becomes utterly obsessed with the portrait he is painting of Dorian. Feeling certain he has not only achieved his best artistic work yet, he confesses shamefully that he has put so much of himself into the portrait that were it ever displayed publicly, the world would glimpse his soul. In short, Basil is in love with the image of Dorian Gray. Lord Henry Wotten befriends Dorian, much to the chagrin of Basil, who feels a near homosexual jealousy. When Basil presents the finished portrait to Dorian, Dorian makes a whimsical wish \\" If it were only the other way! If it were I who was to be always young, and the picture that was to grow old! For that - for that - I would give everything!\\"From that moment on, Dorian's life changes. Lord Henry becomes his mentor of sorts, and a finer fictional character I have yet to meet. Indeed, Lord Henry has a profound influence on young Dorian, and his philosophies will hypnotize you, as they often do Dorian Gray. The portrait takes on sinister and looming proportions, and eventually Dorian must face the consequences of that one whimsical wish, and fight the ultimate battle - for his own soul. An amazingly fabulous book you absolutely MUST read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"When Wilde landed in America in 1882 for a lecture tour, he was asked if he had anything to declare. He responded, &quot;Only my genius.&quot; Okay now, an attitude like that didn't exactly make me want to read any of his works for a long time. Finally, I decided to try The Picture of Dorian Grey, and I found that it really was a work of genius.The novel is the story of Dorian Grey who at the beginning of the novel has his portrait painted by Basil Hallward. The picture turns out to be remarkable, and Grey becomes jealous because the picture will remain young and beautiful while he will age. He expresses a wish that the picture would age instead of himself. To his delight, his wish becomes true, and believing himself to be immortal, he embarks on a path of of hedonism. He always searches for pleasure above happiness, and above all things he loves beauty. Along the way, the portrait chronicles the total moral decay of Dorian Grey.The are a lot of interpretations to this novel. My favorite is to read it as a moral tale warning of the consequences of leading a life of hedonism. It could almost be read as &quot;The Picture of Oscar Wilde&quot; as he seems to be criticizing his own lifestyle. This is probably also the most ironic reading of it since Wilde continued after the novel to preach aestheticism. But anyway, taken within itself, the novel is marvelous. The prose is well-polished. The pacing is elegant and the plot is always interesting. The points is makes are important. The Picture of Dorian Grey deserves its classic status, and Oscar Wilde actually was a bit of a genius."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I'd heard a lot about Wilde when I started this book, but this was the first of his works that I'd ever read. I was half-way expecting long, incomprehensible philosophical discussions, impossible to decipher passages...my stereotype of 19th century literature. But when I was through the first chapter, I had a wake-up call. &quot;Wow,&quot; I thought, &quot;this is really GOOD!&quot; I became addicted, and sped through the rest of the book. It is engrossing, absorbing, entertaining, and not the least bit boring. Brilliant."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This novel provides a fascinating story on a young man's desire to keep his appearance while having his age expressed and progressed in a portrait of himself. The story not only has a good plot, it has a strong philosophical foundation which is characterized through numerous epigrams. Among the characters, Dorian Gray and Lord Henry present various explanations throughout life. I have read this book as an assignment for preparation toward the AP [Advance Placement] test in English Literature and enjoyed it. I would recommend this book to anyone who, not only would like to prepare for an AP test in English, but to those who appreciate philosophy."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"As Wilde's only novel, it does have it's slow spots. However, the genius of the writing is in the dialogue (as is generally true of Wilde). The depth of the ideas discussed is often overlooked by the simple way in which they are presented.Dorian's example forces us to examine our own lives and face the unmistakable truth: the choices we make everyday determine the state of our souls."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wilde's novel takes us through the dangers and temptations of hedonism. It is a fantastic psychological adventure."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"If you didn't read this book, do it. Even if you watched the movies and didn't like them, or particularly if you didn't like the movies. As always Oscar Wilde shows here a great talent to analyze human society and behavior, creating an extremely interesting book in the process."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Everyone should read this book. What interesting ideas and philosophy are presented! It is not your average battle between good and evil - this is a pained battle. The protagonist does not behave like any usual protagonist - good, pure, lovely. You're not quite sure who you're rooting for throughout the book an the ending seems both just, unjust, mercuful, and harsh. What a book. Really makes you think."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"In the mid 70s I watched a two part mini series based on this book. The book is far better because Mr. Wilde is able to whisk you away to Victorian England and give you a sense what that time and place was like."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I chose this rating because I was fully absorbed in this book. The words were beautifully written and it reminded me of how society hasn't really changed. K"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Excellent book! A classic.

I thought it was going to make for a pretty boring reading to be honest. After all it is not so much about the plot or the fiction as it is about its peering into the human psychic and philosophy. Henry is the by far the most interesting character. His conjectures and theories are what makes this book worth reading. Although very popular reading material in my earlier years, I would not recommend it to young people; there's stuff you have to have lived through to really appreciate."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is one of the greatest stories ever of the struggle and torment between good and evil, between animal versus spiritual influences that resides within our mind and soul . An absolute masterpiece. A more modern version of Dante's inferno."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I thought the picture of Dorian Gray was ok. There were some parts that I was confused with and some parts I did not like. It is about a man named Dorian Gray who asks for his portrait to be done. His friend Basil Hallward does his portrait.

So he gave away his soul in order to have eternal youth,so no matter what happened nothing would happen to him and the portrait would grow old instead. Later he goes insane and kills... In between these confusing times he still has a normal life at the same time. He is engaged to a girl but she commits suicide. He has this good friend named Lord Henry. Lord Henry helps teach him how to have emotions and he teaches him about life. Sometimes it is really confusing advice. He even throws parties.

It's a book written by Oscar Wilde, that alone ought to make you order right on the spot! This book is great! I love it! And I love Dorian Gray! Get this book!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Though this book was well written, Oscar Wilde fails in his attempt to glorify aestheticism, and in fact condemns it, and thus condemns himself. It was hardly surprising that following the publication of this book, the authorities sought to have him arrested for homosexuality. If aestheticism is embodied by Lord Henry, Henry is a despicable character, whose philosophies sound not only juvenile and sophistic, but ignorant due to his lack of practicing what he preached. He didn't act out his hedonistic, immoral theories, only Dorian behaved that way, and when doing so brought torment, shame, and guilt upon himself. And to preface the book with &quot;All art is quite useless&quot;? That makes no sense, since the picture was the most useful, significant, meaningful thing in life. Was Wilde's goal to declare his own dear philosophies completely worthless? If so, he succeeded, but I am much more impressed by someone who sets out to justify his philosophies rather than someone who sets out to debunk them."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I love the classics and somehow this one escaped my attention until now. I wish only that it hadescaped my attention forever. This rambling book of boring, sexually unstable rich people with nothing better to dowith their lives than look at pretty Dorian (because, Dorian is very pretty), and insult the commoners who have no rank or class,is tedious, boring and a complete waste of time.Dorian has his portrait painted while the painter and another man oogle him and tell him how pretty he is.The painter said his life was not complete until pretty Dorian came to sit for him.Dorian is very pretty..Dorian wishes he could stay young and pretty and that the painting would age instead of him.,,.. because he's young and prettyand men and women alike tell him how pretty he is.Dorian gets his wish and then the book ignores all his issues and goes off into the prose land of mushrooms.We next see Dorian decades later, the painting is hideous but Dorian is pretty. All his sins have left him pretty and the painting ugly.What happened in that time span is not told.Dorian is pretty.There is zero character developement and by the end I was just hoping everyone character in the book would die.Even Dorian, who is very pretty. We do not not know him, or the painter and have only a glimpse of the life of thethird main character in the book. He thinks Dorian is pretty too.*****************Spoiler Alert*****************I guessed the end about 1/3rd of the way through, I only missed that I figured Dorian (he, who is pretty) would torch the painting insteadof stabbing it.*****************End Spoiler Alert*****************I'm sure all the world is aflutter because of the daring topics discussed, or not discussed as it wasn't in this book. For its time period, I guessit would be shocking. Dorian, however, is still very pretty and that remains regardless of when this book was written.So, I hear this is only an edited version and somewhere out there is the REAL version, and it is oh so much better, but, nothing could savethis travesty of words. I wasted enough time with these pathetic characters (and author) although I think Dorian is still very pretty according to everyone.I'm only glad I read it on my Kindle so a tree didn't die in printing this boring book. However, if a tree was cut for your book rest assured, the tree would be happy because Dorian is very pretty!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I have recently read this book as part of my A-level syllabus and found it little more than an excuse for Wilde to voice his egotistical and condemnatory views of Victorian society.

While full of wonderful quotes that sound great over a dinner discussion, a noteworthy tale this is not. Wilde seems far more interested in catologing lists of inane objects and people than he is of entertaining or interesting the reader. Wilde only glosses over Gray's sinful actions letting us know sparse details about his supposed debauchery but never exposing the reader to them...So a woman kills herself over being jilted, so he uses opium, so he goes to prostitutes, so he is bisexual...Who cares?? Such a shallow character (and this book is filled with shallow, undeveloped characters) is impossible to care one way or another about...So when the end of the book comes to its obvious conclusion as a reader I simply shut the book, pondered what all the fuss and bother has been about and put the book on Ebay as its not worth taking up space on my bookshelf..."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"sdfj dsljf asdfjksl sadf lsdjf al asdl sjdsl flasdf fl. fsdjls,..f lf fdjfdsl. dsdfjs.. eoweoiwiew wwed vfrd vmri riejkfn fkjei fjf"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Okay when I bought this book I was leery because I thought it would be too scary.

I found myself constantly amazed that someone from Wilde's time could have had such clarity of thought on certain topics. I've never seen the movie made from this but I saw some movie posters. So it was hard taking the horror look and putting that in this book. It is more of a twisted coming of age story and not even one that gets too deep. Lord Henry has deeper moments of speech then Dorian. And as shocking as they said this book would be...I read nothing shocking. I thought maybe the unedited version would actually have a sex scene in it lol but they don't even mention a naughty body part lol. Nothing ever gets remotely sexual. I mean several characters are definitely gay but not in a shocking way. More like Jack McFarlan on Will and Grace. Most of the time I chuckled as I saw \\"Just Jack\\" with Jack doing his jazz hands as I read. The main appeal of this story is when it was written. So here is the thing...horror NO.

When I watched that movie I had no idea who the character of Dorian Gray was. The movie wasn't that good, but I was still interested in that character. When I saw The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde, I decided I wanted to learn more about that character.This book was not easy to read at all. It wasn't because of the language that it was written in, which did add to its difficulty. The part that bothered me the most about this book, other than its length, was the horrible lack of flow. I got the main idea of the book, I understood most of why certain parts of the book were there, but there were so many parts that did not add to the plot that for many pages at a time you would read about things like a jewel collection, book collection or whatever else fancied Dorian Gray at the time. It was so hard to finish this book because there were so many times that I couldn't grasp why I was reading what I was reading. There were so many times that Dorian or his friend Harry would go into these monologues for absolutely no reason at all.There were a few redeeming qualities to this book, but unfortunately they did nothing to help me enjoy it at all. The one thing I did like was the basic premise of the book. Dorian Gray could not age and he was beautiful so he could do whatever he wanted to. His lack of need to preserve his soul led him down the path of evil. His friend guided him down that path as well. The whole time I was reading this book I was thinking about Harry as the devil. He would plant thoughts into the brain of Dorian that led him further and further down his path of destruction.The book was a let down and I hope that the next classic fiction book I choose is a good one.If you like my review and want to read more of them I have a blog chronicaling my first year with my Kindle. I would love your suggestions and comments. Check out my profile for the website."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"While trying to start some kind of an aesthetic as well as a moral revolution, The Picture of Dorian Gray instead became a disappointment in the world of literature. I began reading this book upon the premise that it would contain fascinating worldviews, as well as a gripping plot. Rather, the book fell flat on its face. Wilde reflected his views of the importance of art, the pitfalls of beauty, and the horror of aging in this novel, and though it wasn't the views that were a problem, it was how they all contradicted one another. The author claimed, \\"all art is useless\\" in the preface of the novel, yet eventually it is art itself that becomes the bane of Dorian Gray's existence.The novel follows a young, beautiful young man, Dorian Gray, along with two of his friends, Basil, who paints a stunning picture of Dorian, and Harry, who leads Dorian into a world of lies, sin and betrayal. Though it starts off interestingly enough, the novel drags after the 50th page, and it only gets worse and worse until the very end. It is meant to shock its readers, with tales of murder and drugs, yet the writing isn't sophisticated enough to support these statements. The downward spiral of Dorian Gray's life is deserved, and the novel fails to leave the reader with a strong residual message. To its credit, however, the original premise was interesting, and the decay of Dorian Gray's existence and how he views himself makes for a decent plot.I will not bother to go into the details of the novel, for example the sexism and the portrayal of women in the book, and how it is questionable whether the characters are more in love with women, the idea of women, each other (yes, they are all male), or themselves. The homosexuality in the novel did not bother me, though the inaccurate portrayal of women did.If you are interested in reading about art, corruption or murder in the late 19th century in England, please, spare yourself the torture of reading Dorian Gray, though it is only a little over 200 pages."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The picture of Dorian wasn't that great of a novel. The subjects in this moral fable are very dramatic but go exceedingly too far. Tragedy stalks every crack and turn of it. It ends in a tragedy. In the beginning, it is rather happy, but right after the actress and lover commits suicide it goes completely. I do not doubt Wilde's famed wit but, he could have written something more happy than this depressing novel. The descriptions are very well done(especially in the beginning.) Thus, he should used his wit and humor for a more enjoyable and felicatous novel."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"this book was really really twisted, our sophmore class had to read it for school, and almost everyone hated it"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde seems to have written a somewhat scathing critique of late nineteenth century English life, or at least that of the upper class. The two main characters, Dorian Gray himself and his mentor Lord Henry Wotton, lead lives of extreme self-indulgence.Lord Henry constantly spews forth his theories and philosophies regarding everything about human nature. Although they are numerous, Henry's ideas can be condensed into one main point. Early in the narrative when he is first exercising his right to influence under the title of mentor, Henry exclaims to Dorian that the only thing worth having is youth. Youth, which is, according to Henry, the only stage where beauty can be found, comes with an ever-present hedonistic lifestyle. This is the template for which the impressionable Dorian bases his life upon.Dorian becomes the ultimate purveyor of self-indulgence and corrupts everything he associates himself with, all the while accompanied on his journeys by a curse of grave implications. To the disappoint of many, I will not give away more of the story; as I'm sure most of you are already salivating over the details I have put forth.The story unfolds at first in a matter of weeks and then jumps several years, yet the focus of the novel does not waiver. This Romantic Period novel is filled with the standard mystery, and a central dealing with human nature. It is well written and comes with excellent detail, as required by this writing period. It also comes with the characteristic whit of Oscar Wilde. The dialogue between characters is excellent and Lord Henry's theories are exquisite often bordering on comical, but always cynical.Wilde seems to warn against the excess of hedonism and uses the story of Dorian Gray as a deterrent. More importantly I believe this is a social critique of high society, which breeds excess and cultivates decadence, while often regarding everything with a selfish eye. The book is filled intellectual quips about human nature and society, yet it is a short book and relatively easy read. This book is required reading for many, so possibly you've already read it, but if not, during commercial breaks of course, give this a try."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is a terrific melodramatic Romantic-era novel. It is a pleasant story of an artist-Basil-and his relationship with a young man named Dorian Gray. Basil often paints portraits of Gray, and one day a man named Lord Henry Wotton comes and changes Gray's life. Though I don't want to spoil the rich plot, Gray is faced with the reality that he will soon age and the sketches will not, and he is horrified.The book is a quick read, despite mostly long chapters (fifteen pages or so). I was able to sit down and read the book, often finding myself enjoying a book assigned in English class. Though it is quick moving and a reasonably short book, it is a book meant for high schoolers and older.For a story out of the Romantic era, I really enjoyed reading this book. It wasn't one of the books that I had to turn to Cliff's Notes to understand-it was an easy read. The book kind of reminded me of a soap opera, though not nearly as lame, it had some parts that would appear in the script of a soap. I found myself hating Lord Henry for ruining Gray, and enjoying the choices that Gray made.Overall this book is definitely worth a quick read. It's not your typical Romantic book, because it isn't a cheesy novel, it has some real depth. I recommend it to anybody looking for a quick and easy read or if it's on the reading list for somebody's summer required reading for English. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The story in itself was great, I loved it! However, Wilde's use of excess pronouns could tend to confuse a reader.

Oscar Wilde incorporates conventional defeating human dispositions such as superficiality, idolatry, and obsession into an astonishing tale of the life of a young man conflicted between morality and a hedonistic culture.

I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I picked up this book on a whim at a local bookstore knowing little to nothing about Oscar Wilde. This story kept me entranced the entire time. I, like Basil, was completely infautated with Dorian Gray from the moment his name was annouced. A beautiful boy completely unspoiled by the darkness in the world. A boy immeressed in the decendance of his times. When Dorian realizes he too must face mortality and it's grip on his beauty he makes a wish to never lose his youth and beauty, to instead let his painting age for him. This the painting does... from the curve of his lips to the look in his eyes. Dorian uses this completely to his advantage and commits selfish and horrible acts all the while hidden under a charming smile and innocent face. A Picture of Dorian Gray is now one of my most favorite books of all time. If only Wilde had written more than one novel!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde was shunned by the public after publishing The Picture of Dorian Gray. It is a beautifully written book and is as much a work of art as an elegantly painted portrait.Centered around the vain and young Dorian Gray, it tells the price one pays for eternal youth and gives a new dimension to the human soul. As Dorian succumbs to the tempting dark underworld of London, and he lives by night in wicked ways, the beautiful portrait painted of him becomes like a journal of his soul, becoming ever more twisted and deformed. It begins to haunt Dorian continuously, day and night, consuming his every thought. Then a shadow from his young past creeps back into his life and makes Dorian's life even more frighteningOscar Wilde's novel is a magnificent read and explores the issue and thoughts surrounding man's soul. How tarnished it becomes if we live a bad life, etcetera.I recommended anyone to read this Wilde masterpiece. You do not have to like horror to enjoy it. Any lover of a well written book would also fall for this."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray, by Oscar Wilde is a novel that explores the themes of human corruption, moral decadence and the value of youth in society. The novel follows the life of a narcissistic youth, Dorian Gray, who makes a Faustian pact with the devil to keep his youth. Dorian grows to love immorality and the darker joys of life. However, the evils of his life do not manifest within him but in his portrait.Published in 1890, The Picture of Dorian Gray is still a popular choice of literature for society today, being praised as one of Wilde's greatest works. The appeals of The Picture of Dorian Gray to a modern day society are the plot, characters and Wilde's firm command of language. The novel deals with themes that are common in society, drugs, violence, immorality, social decadence and human corruption.At times, Wilde's writing appears shallow and wooden, lacking any action. However, what is lost in action is gained in dialogue, which is exquisite and strongly reflects Wilde's own nature. The novel is riddled with finely wrought epigrams and witticisms that display the true skill and genius of Wilde as both an author and an orator."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"What is more important, physical beauty or a beautiful heart?

I have appreciated Oscar for 40 years and I only read this gem four months ago! It is truly one of my \\"classics\\"."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The picture of Dorian Gray may have been shocking for its taboo innuendoes when it was first published late in the 19th century, but to a modern reader, almost seeking out an element of that shameful pleasure a well written novel of vanity and desire might evoke, such a thrill-seeker will be a bit disappointed here. That said, the higher threshold of today's readers for topics that would have made a Victorian-era bookworm blush doesn't take away at all from the bona-fide quality of writing, and depth of thought, manifested within the complex discourses of Oscar Wilde's characters time and again throughout \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray.\\"The storyline itself is interesting -- a young man, driven to trade his soul for lifelong youth and beauty, is left with a brutally accurate reminder that the burdens of the soul are inescapable. Nevertheless, the clever plot is the lesser of the art forms Wilde exhibits in this book.The most impressive feature of Wilde's writing in this novel is the manner in which his characters express and justify devious thoughts. Corrupt and evil notions are so explicitly well-rationalized, with such a seemingly undeniable logic, that the reader is almost forced to pause, mid-paragraph at times, to debate in his own mind whether he agrees with what he just read. As the story unfolds, and the maladies brought about through the gradual corruption of Dorian Gray grow more and more apparent and profound, one almost needs to turn the pages back to the stanzas previously used to justify an ill-fated thought simply to reconsider why such statements at first seemed to be such decent insights about humanity. Perhaps we are all just as corruptible as Dorian Gray? If so, that is the genius of Oscar Wilde in this work.This novel is not simply one to be read; rather it is a novel to be read deeply into. There is a little bit of Dorian Gray in us all."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"reading this for the first time, i remember the movie that was made in the 1980's (vaguely) i'm a fan of oscar wilde and these pocket editions as well!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I love this story.

I highly recommend this classic book.Check out my newest thriller - Bound by Birth - by Randall R WheelerBound By Birth"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"What a delightful book! Many of us our familiar with the basic Dorian Gray fable - a man yearns for immortality and gets it. In Wilde's take, Dorian Gray, a young handsome teenager wishes the deprecating effects of age to strike his portrait and not his flesh. He gets his wish and at the goading of Lord Henry becomes an absolute hedonist. Always within though there seems to be a remorseful conscience, a longing for purity. But the ease of depravity squashes moral sentiments before they take root. In the end though, the ageless man finally confronts his portrait...After learning of the author, Oscar Wilde, I was surprised that the book came from his pen (thinly veiled homoeroticism nonwithstanding). I interpreted the book as a cautionary tale against heedlessness and indulgence - basically against the materialist character of Lord Henry. It is a moral tale that explores themes of beauty and its subsidary: age. One cannot help but see one's own portrait in the depiction of young Dorian Gray.I found the writing of the book to be fantastic. Great dialogue and monologues with the British witticisms that you would expect."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"So you want to remain eternally young? This book will tell you an engrossing moralistic tale that paints the picture of where the deadly sin of vanity can take you. It will take you into a descent into a hell full of shadows where the light will never touch you.This is a classic dark tale of intrigue. It is filled with the depths to which the human condition can sink. It is a page turner, but it may leave you feeling empty at the end. That is what it did for me. Nevertheless, it is a haunting book that is well worth reading. Oscar Wilde will speak from his grave throughout the centuries through this book.As the author of a spiritually-themed book entitled \\"The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude,\\" I appreciated this book for the most unusual reasons. I am a former addict who knows what it is like to experience hell within life. The hopeful note within this book is that it will wake the reader up to taking responsibility for his or her own life. That is what I have had to do with my own. Thank God for books that can wake us up to that reality so that we do not have to sink into the abyss of nothingness.Davis Aujourd'hui, author of \\"The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude\\""},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Famed for his biting wit and a master of epigrams, Oliver Wilde fails to disappoint in the only novel he has ever published. The Picture of Dorian Gray is both shocking and profound, delving into the daunting choices one man makes after obtaining, through a careless wish, perpetual youth.Dorian Gray begins the book as an innocent, wholly untainted Adonis. He is introduced to the decadent Lord Henry Wotton through his friend Basil Hallward, a renowned painter. After the influence of Lord Henry, Dorian, upon seeing his alluring, youthful self captured in Basil's portrait of him, rashly wishes that he might remain young and beautiful like the portrait while it grew old and ugly. The discovery that his wish was made a reality leads Dorian down a sordid path. He coldly scorns his love, Sibyl Vane, when she loses her acting ability for love of him, resulting in her suicide. After this mar of blood on his conscience, Dorian chooses to lead a life of hedonism, ignoring the pleadings of his old friend Basil. Blaming Basil for his tainted conscience and corrupt way of life, Dorian murders Basil and eventually, stabs his portrait in rage, killing himself. He reverts to his true self, utterly grotesque and unrecognizable.Although the plot alone is enticing, Wilde's incredible skill with language is really the highlight of the book. Many astonishing events occur in the story of Dorian's descent into decadence, but Wilde's consistent, calm narration does not mask the scenes' madness but rather enhances it, making Dorian's evil actions all the more eerie. Tempting in its morbidity, the book drags along its readers as a horror movie would its audience. Through his mastery of syntax, Wilde is often able to convey exactly Dorian's emotion and state of mind. Varying between short, choppy sentences and long, languid descriptions, Wilde skillfully manipulates syntax to reflect upon the state of the characters. Imagery runs rampant throughout the novel. Whole passages devoted to the description of the gardens and the like drug the reader with sensual images, pulling them into the scene itself.The characters are also developed to an amazing extent, especially Lord Henry, the most intriguing in the book. Despite being a bad influence on Dorian, Lord Henry is actually a main contributor to the profundity of this novel. Although he is seen as a decadent, and often times, the intellectual lightweight of the story, Henry is also very philosophical. The man seems to have a philosophy of everything, smothering in his constant philosophical didactics. However, sayings like \\"Ordinary people waited till life disclosed to them its secrets, but to the few, to the elect, the mysteries of life were revealed before the veil was torn away\\" are very thought-provoking. It seems that Henry is Wilde's spokesperson through whom the author questions society's way of life and any alternatives. Lord Henry's thoughts, thus, not only influences Dorian but also has a tremendous effect on Wilde's readers.However, this amazing novel is not without flaws. Basil is intended to be the most moralistic of the trio, an opposition to Lord Henry's negative influence on Dorian. Although Basil's weakness can be interpreted as Wilde's criticism of Victorian society and its own weakening morals, his reluctance to fully acknowledge Dorian's stray from the noble path and thus, his inability to save his friend is infuriating and almost annoying.Overall, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a great read. Its morals are fairly simplistic while its messages are wholly complicated. The masterful use of language in the novel establishes once more the reason for Oscar Wilde's popularity. Provoking and profound, The Picture of Dorian Gray definitely merits a second read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"It has been said that this book is one of Oscar Wilde's classics and I do say it is. The story revolves around one man and his desire to be young. Although it was originally published in the 1800's, the themes and ideas within the book you can adapt to today's time. I have underlined many quotations that I found very interesting and if thought about make sense.Now, for those who know or don't, it has been made a movie before and it has been revived this time around as a movie set to release this year with the lead character played by Ben Barnes (The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian). Ben Barnes was known for Prince Caspian and this is his next movie to release. Also starring, Colin Firth.I would certainly read this book first before seeing the movie and for a price like this, you cannot take advantage of reading a great literary classic."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The experience of reading Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray is tantamount to engaging in a philosophical debate with a person suffering from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder--and they're winning. The exquisite attention to detail paired with a sharp analytical wit delivers an indomitable argument. One cannot help but succumb to temptations along with the charismatic Dorian and echo his cries of despair when the effects of sin become prominently displayed, marring the handsome features.Wilde creates a subtle trap, luring the reader with Dorian's innocence and naivet&eacute;. The snare gently tightens as the pure boy slides deeper into depravity and becomes corrupted by pleasure. So slowly is the reader introduced to the poison, by the time realization hits there is no hope of escape. They are as thoroughly embroiled in the life of hedonism and aestheticism as the protagonist. Dorian becomes subsequently more callous with every act of debauchery he commits and the impact of his actions is reduced by the sheer number of skeletons in his closet. Rather than becoming appalled as his wickedness grows, the reader is simple hardened for what is to come. When Dorian finally carries out the act of treachery that tilts the scale, no one is surprised.The pictures painted by Wilde's careful words are elaborate to the point of being mind-numbing. Explicit descriptions of Dorian's hobbies fill pages while serving no apparent purpose. Closer examination determines the usefulness of aforementioned descriptions in drawing the reader closer to the child-like curiosity of Dorian, perhaps justifying his eventual corruption. Unfortunately this knowledge is not enough to banish the tedium and some passages must simply be suffered through.Oscar Wilde has created a thought provoking masterpiece. An excellent read for those who have ever question the morality of society of have peered out across seas of corruption and vowed to stay away. Not for the faint of hear or easily distracted, hose who choose to take the plunge will find themselves pleasantly rewarded."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"a classic literary staple of the modern world! a must read for any intellectual. every sentence is brimming with stimulating ideas and paradoxes."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde's only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray, is one of the finest pieces of literature ever written. Wilde has taken an old story and transformed it into a tale of Victorian excess and corruption. He has created a main character (Dorian) with whom a little part of all of us can identify with--he lives his life to the fullest extent, but doesn't age, while his portrait bears the burden of his fast living. I highly reccemmend this book to anyone who enjoys good literature at it's best. Wilde was primarily known as a playwright, but with Dorian Gray, he has proved that he was a great novelist also."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"A true work of art that anyone can hold in their hand and return to again and again. I found myself constantly reaching for a pen to underline all those Wilde words thast only Oscar could have penned. He saw the world in such a unique way that will never be replicated.

Throughout his life he becomes more and more heinous morally, while retaining his innocent look until his death, which is the suprise ending...Also included in this book are the short stories 'Lord Aurthur Savile's Crime,' 'The Canterville Ghost,' 'The Sphinx Without a Secret,' and 'The Model Millionare.'"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"After hearing about Oscar Wilde and how his novel The Picture of Dorian Grey was renounced because it contained hints of homosexuality I was very eager to read the novel. However, I was utterly disappointed. The disappointment had nothing to do with the novel's themes but rather its characters and delivery.As a literature major, I am one who enjoys long novels full of detail and old romantic language such as that of Jane Austen. While The Picture of Dorian Grey was written with glorious detail and all the flowery language that I love I found myself very bored. There were many places where I found that the story dragged and though I am sure they were meant to be brilliant social commentary I could not stand the countless scenes where Lord Henry or Dorian sat about with their friends and chatted.I may have still been able to give this book at least a three star rating if the boring scenes scattered throughout the book were the only fault but unfortunately what truly put me off was the characters. I cannot enjoy a book whose characters I do not come to love or at least care for in some small way. By the end of the novel I did not care one bit what happened to Dorian Grey; he was a spineless boy and a cruel man. Lord Henry was always a wicked man and a tiresome preacher of what he considered to be cleverness. Basil Hallward was the only character that I enjoyed and somewhat identified with but he was not enough apart of the story to redeem it and nothing could make up for Dorian himself.I was extremely disappointed in this book and I cannot say that I would recommend it to anyone other than a literature fanatic looking too read as many classics as possible."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Ugh, what to say about this book. I wanted so badly to love it, but I didn't. I didn't even like it a little bit. That's terrible when you don't really enjoy the very first classic you read. This isn't setting a good stage for the future and planning on reading one classic a month. Good thing Alice in Wonderland is next month. That will definitely make up for the suck of this one. Don't you hate it when you hear such good things about a book and you go in expecting to love it only to be completely disappointed? Yeah, that's what happened here.The book follows Dorian Gray (the original Mr. Gray, if you will) who is apparently a very beautiful man who is envied by many only he doesn't quite understand why. I liked Dorian but I didn't feel like his character had much depth. I liked that he wasn't all look how sexy I am you know you want this, but at the same time he was kind of a sissy. He follows this Lord Henry guy around like he's a lost little puppy dog and puts up with him bashing him on numerous occasions. I don't know who this guy thinks he is but I had to force myself not to skip over his parts. The only rational person in this book (minus his psycho obsession over Dorian) is Basil but he isn't in enough of the book to really care too much about.I think I know why I couldn't get into this book as much as the rest of the people who told me about it. Have you seen the movie The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen? Okay, I see Dorian Gray in that movie when I think about him. I see Stuart Townsend in all his \\"I'm the bomb get over it\\" glory. I cannot and will not picture him as the pushover that he was in this book. That movie ruined the book for me. I remember watching the actual Dorian Gray movie but it was boring too. I may have to watch it again just to see how terrible it was in comparison to the book, but I vaguely remember falling asleep at some point.The only reason I didn't give it one butterfly is because I was able to finish it. It was hard and it seemed like forever, but I did it. And the only reason I did it was to get to the end. I read on and off for like five days just to read about the scene I could have watched in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen after only an hour and a half. Stuart Townsend will always be my Dorian Gray. This book just didn't do it for me. However... Dorian is a VERY cool name. Props to Mr. Wilde for that."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I feel perplexed about The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde. On one hand, the story is well written about a young man being moulded and shaped. On the other hand, this book was incredibly flowery and doesn't really start for 100 pages. Dorian doesn't really know about life and meets an artist and an aristocrat that help him though his journey into manhood. The artist paints his portrait, subsequently making him keep his youth. The aristocrat had the biggest influence on Dorian Gray, though Lord Harry Wotton is very annoying. He talks and talks the whole way through this book, thinking he's so witty.Dorian Gray starts off in this novel as a blank slate, an easily influenced young man. Thoughout the rest of the story he gets moulded and pushed into shape. After Basil paints his portrait Dorian starts to unravel, afraid to show the picture, he locks it way in a room and never lets anyone see it, protecting it at all costs. The whole thing symbolising the way we hide our real selves from the rest of the world, scared of what they may think.The Picture of Dorian Gray would have been controversial in its day, with strong homosexual themes. Though the book itself is more about the life and morality, Oscar Wilde did a brilliant of capturing this element of the book. For me the biggest downfall of this book was that Lord Wotton was too loud and dominates throughout the entire book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is an incredibly well written, wonderfully illustrated, and very interesting book to read. I have read and already own The Picture of Dorian Gray, but this book adds so much to my understanding of the story, the characters, and the time in which Wilde wrote the book. Plus it has fascinating references to Oscar Wilde's friends, enemies, his views on woman, art, life, and his other stories. I am reading every annotation, every footnote, and the story all at the same time. This book is a must have if you enjoy Oscar Wilde, and wish to understand him better. Buy It!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"First off, for the audience looking to read this book after viewing the character from the movie LXG, know that the characteristics of Dorian are no as they were in the movie. Dorian does not die when he looks at his portrait; in fact his observation of the changes in his picture is one of the main elements of the story. Basil, an artist that is obsessed with the beauty of one man, Dorian, paints a portrait so beautiful that the subject is pained by the fact that the portrait's beauty will outlast that of his mortal body, and he wishes that this formula could be reversed, with the portrait aging in his place. He gets his wish, but at what price? Dorian, now free from the bounds of mortality, is no longer afraid to sin, since there he thinks that nothing can happen to him. But his behavior was not all due to his immortality; it was also due to the fact that the negative influence from Lord Henry corrupted his pure soul. The fact that he was able to keep his beauty but not able to keep his soul shows that judgment based on appearance is not only wrong, but inaccurate. This book is recommended, but not to the highest extent. The story picks up quickly, as it must with such a limited amount of pages. One of the only flaws in this book is chapter 11, the long, unwanted pause. A classic nonetheless, one that should no be overlooked."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wilde creates a Faustian plot where Dorian Gray wishes to never grow old, and gives up his soul to do so.

Dorian Gray does represent the reality of the British Aristocracy of old and how useless their lives really were for many."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I saw many variances of movies but never read the book. It was a true page turner. It left me wondering about Oscar Wilde's state of mind...LOL!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"With his life spanning the later half of the 19th Century, Oscar Wilde wrote in a wide variety of mediums, ranging from poetry to plays and from essays to fairy tales, and one novel. His fairy tales are arguably the most accessible of his writings, and as is the case with fairy tales revolve around some moral theme being conveyed. For instance in \`The Selfish Giant' a giant places a wall around his garden to keep the children out, and thus spring never comes on his garden, causing him to realize the result of his selfishness. Similarly in \`The Star-Child' a beautiful boy is forced to come to terms with his prideful cruelty.The Picture of Dorian Gray can be seen as a continuing of this fairy tale manner of writing, except in novel form (though even then the novel is fairly short).The story begins in the art-studio of Basil, a painter who is putting the final touches on what is said to be his most greatest painting. With him is Lord Henry, a shallow obscurantist of high society who upon hearing of the figure in the portrait desires to meet with him - the figure being that of a young and impressionable Dorian Gray. The two become friends and eventually the philosophy of Lord Henry begins to have its affect on him.In the words of Lord Henry, this amounts to \\"if one man were to live out his life fully and completely, were to give form to every feeling, expression to every thought, reality to every dream-I believe that the world would gain such a fresh impulse of joy that we would forget all the maladies of mediaevalism, and return to the Hellenic ideal-to something finer, richer than the Hellenic ideal, it may be... The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it.\\"Throughout the course of the novel Dorian comes to embrace this ideal, giving into his own inner nature: \\"Eternal youth, infinite passion, pleasures subtle and secret, wild joys and wilder sins-he was to have all these things. The portrait was to bear the burden of his shame: that was all... For there would be a real pleasure in watching it. He would be able to follow his mind into its secret places. This portrait would be to him the most magical of mirrors. As it had revealed to him his own body, so it would reveal to him his own soul. \\"Thus Dorian Gray enters into a sort of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde type of scenario with himself where he resolves to do away with his conscience - where Mr. Hyde reveals the truth of Dr Jekyll, the portrait comes to reveal the truth of Dorian Gray, and before the end he must come to face that truth.The book is enjoyable, and at around 180pgs can be read in an evening. Like his fairy tales it comes away with a moral, though modern renditions of the character seem to miss this point.Memorable Quotes:-\\"You know how I love secrecy. It is the only thing that can makemodern life wonderful or mysterious to us. The commonest thing isdelightful if one only hides it.\\"-\\"Modern morality consists in accepting the standard of one's age. I consider that for any man of culture to accept the standard of his age is a form of the grossest immorality.\\"-\\"Ah! in what a monstrous moment of pride and passion he had prayed thatthe portrait should bear the burden of his days, and he keep theunsullied splendour of eternal youth! All his failure had been due tothat. Better for him that each sin of his life had brought its sureswift penalty along with it. There was purification in punishment.Not \\"Forgive us our sins\\" but \\"Smite us for our iniquities\\" should bethe prayer of man to a most just God.\\"Specific CriticismsI don't believe I have any real criticisms or complaints about this book. I do have to say that I greatly disliked the character of Lord Henry, and the book can be read much more quickly if you skip all his dialogue after his first few rants. If you've read one of his conversations you've read them all; the basic model is that he says something absurd or outlandish and then the other characters alternately gasp and fawn over his words.Every now and then this is interrupted by him saying something exceptionally bland, such as remarking that \\"They are both simply forms of imitation\\" when Basil makes the statement that \\"Love is a more wonderful thing than art.\\" Or by making some contradiction in terms, such as \\"I never approve, or disapprove, of anything now. It is an absurd attitude to take towards life.\\"Little nuances of character stand out, such as Henry and Dorian constantly remarking about the shallowness of other characters while demonstrating a pointed shallowness throughout the book. Of course this isn't a criticisms of the book or the writing, it is likely in fact a praise of the writing, that he can create such a distasteful character.More reviews at ellipsisomnibus.wordpress.com"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Especially considering the time of writing, this book sets out a rare insight into the workings of the human mind.

I can't believe how well it is writen. I love classics and the picture of Dorian Grey is one of the best.

It just so happens to be my favorate book, and I looked so see if there was anyone who didn't like it. Quite horrified, and rather losing my faith in Humanity (or HUMANITAD) I thought: I must write an essay myself!To be honest, I am sure that dear old Oscar would not have been terribly upset some people didn't like his book, for his works are, let's be honest, only truly understood by those who share something of his divine temprement (like me!).Let me now say why I like it.I first read the picture when I was at school (vague memories of having written a review for this book before, have I?) - and, quite honestly, it is the most beautiful and cleverset thing in the world (bookwise).Heaens above, if you can't enjoy a book that is so obviously about pleasure (in a very Epicurean, spiritual way, ye moral detractors, mark you!), what are you doing engaging in the Epicurean pleasure of reading at all? Give up! You do not have a soul to be corrupted!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I love this book! I completely think that I have fallen in love with the character Lord Henry. He is by far one of the wittiest characters that I have ever read in a book and trust me that I have read many books!

The vocabulary in it was from the time it was written about, and was hard to understand. If you read this book, you need to be able to understand words from context.I liked this book because it talked about the eternal fight for beauty, and I think that this is an interesting topic.

It is beautifully done like a silk tapestry or a work of art. His ideas about life and what place art has in life are equally as interesting. It is obvious to the reader from the moment he or she picks up the book that it is mostly about art, as the title itself shows---The Picture of Dorian Gray. It becomes clear to the reader Art was the true basis for this book. Dorian himself is a physically beautiful man who collects art, and he enjoys all the splendor of a fashionable existence. Oscar Wilde was a man who also shared interest in these things so it clear that the base for his most successful book is his ideas about art ( as show in the preface) the relation ship between artist observer and art. The characters in this book are playing the parts of his opinions of art wonderfully and in doing so reveal to the reader their inner most thoughts and feelings.Dorian and his painting that he holds so dear each have a different place in Oscar Wilde's ideals as the art and the artist .One of Oscar Wilde's statements about art is \\"The artist is the creator of beautiful things. To reveal art and conceal the artist is the artist's aim\\". (3). Dorian's outside appearance that he \\"reveals\\" becomes an illusion, a sort of mask, which hides or \\"conceals\\" his inner unhappiness and inability to live. Dorian's outer persona becomes his \\"art\\", the elegant illusion that he offers to the world, while his inner feelings are the \\"artist\\". Dorian's \\"artist\\" is his soul, but in fact while he is revealing this beautiful surface to the world and enchanting everyone he is concealing his true self. He separates himself from the aging and corrupted painting. Putting on this act is to \\"conceal the artist\\" which is the artist's aim. For Dorian Gray, hiding away all signs of aging and keeping up a surface youth, beauty, and innocence is creating himself as a work of art. This point is further illustrated in the text when after basil's visit to him he nearly goes mad about protecting his painting or his soul \\"when his servant entered, he looked at him steadfastly, and wondered if he had thought of peering behind the screen.... yet he thought it best to be on his guard...his eye fell on a large purple satin coverlet heavily embroidered with gold, a splendid piece of late seventeenth-century Venetian work ...Yes, that would serve to wrap the dreadful thing...Now, it was to hide something that had a corruption of it's own, worse than the corruption of death itself-something that would breed horrors and yet would never die.\\"(103-4). The most obvious point that this paragraph shows is Dorian's need to \\"conceal\\" his soul or himself. The Venetian coverlet symbolizes Dorian's \\"art\\" or need for splendor and beautiful things to conceal his true identy. Dorian's need to conceal himself is shown with literal symbolization he is taking his art or Venetian coverlet and putting it over his \\"painting\\" to hide his soul. As the paragraph goes on he describes the painting or his \\"soul\\" in a way that shows you his true feelings about his soul he thinks of himself as being corrupt, horrible, and worse than death and naturally wants to separate his art or outter self from his painting or inner self. Oscar Wilde's theory's about art and artist's relationship connects perfectly with Dorian grays feelings about himself.Dorian has no conscience about other people's feelings because he does not expect his own which relates to Oscar Wilde's opinion that an artist has no ethical sympathies. Oscar Wilde says, \\"No artist has ethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable mannerism of style\\" (p. 3). Dorian seems to be without human emotions. He remembers his parents only through their outward appearance--- the lips or shape of the face that he has inherited. He does not remember their feelings for him or his attachment to them. It may have been that he was raised without emotional ties. The only time that his family is mentioned, Dorian calls his memories of them hateful (p. 103). In Victorian High society, feelings and emotions were considered less worthy than opinions or ideas. This has caused Dorian to grow up and not understand moral conscience he believes that the only thing that is important is new innovation and ideas, because he was taught to be that way. That is demonstrated when he decides to show Basil his soul:\\"You can tell the whole world about it afterwards, if you choose. Nobody would believe you, if they did believe; they would like me all the better for it. I know the age better than you do\\" (p, 133). He says that his age---the end of the nineteenth century---was more pre-occupied with style than substance, so his youthful glamour---and the fact that the had a secret for escaping ageing---would inspire envy and imitation, not horror. But it is show in the story with basil's reaction to the painting or his \\"soul\\" that people will in fact be horrified by someone who destroys their soul by keeping themselves enterally young and beautiful or renovating their \\"art\\". And by saying \\" I know the age better than you do \\" he is actually proving the opposite and that he doesn't have any ethical sympathies because he so obviously doesn't the nineteenth- century does care about a persons soul. It also relates to the modern day struggle over plastic surgery whether it is a way to keep yourself beautiful or a way to become obsessed with your appearance and destroy your morality you could say that a modern day Dorian Gray is a Michael Jackson someone who is once loved and admired by his public but then after turning to plastic surgery and shopping to better his appearance he becomes a joke and loses his admiration much like Dorian Gray. They both do not relate to the public and have lost their moral conscience do to constantly trying to better their appearance or better their \\"art\\". Dorian Gray doesn't understand other people's ideals because he is not willing to except the fact that he thinks of his internal self as an ugly disgusting thing. Dorian plays into Oscar Wilde's opinions about artists not having ethical sympathies because he does not understand moral conscience of his society. He also shows the reader his inner feelings that he thinks of himself as something awful.Basil and Dorian are like art and observer basil's ideals about Dorian are mirrored on to him. Basil Howard's influence is reflected in this quote from the preface; \\"All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath the surface do so at their own peril. It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors\\" (p. 3). The spectator in this story is Basil Howard. Basil Howard sees Dorian through his own eyes as a beautiful young man who is full of life and innocence. Basil's soul of truth, love, kindness and caring for others is put into his painting. Dorian's external appearance is appreciated by a spectator (Basil) so it begins to mirror what the spectator sees, and other people also come to see Dorian as a prince of art. Like when an observer looks at art they interpretative it in their own way. This is shown when basil comes to talk to Dorian about the way he is perceived to society \\"I want you to lead such a life as will make the world respect you. I want you to get rid of the hateful people you associate with...you have wonderful influence, let it be for good and not evil\\" (p, 132). This shows basils admiration for Dorian and the way that he thinks of Dorian that it mirrored in the way that he will see him. He is in fact saying that he wants to lead a life where the world respects him and that he has wonderful influence because all he knows about Dorian Gray is what he knows about himself. In the page before basil talks about Dorian's face and the way that he looks means that must not be a bad person but that is only a surface opinion, like that you have of art, once you learn something about the artist, you interpret in another way. Basil doesn't know Dorian's \\"artist\\" or soul he doesn't see him he only sees himself, so basils beautiful heart and soul are projected onto Dorian's appearance. Again Oscar Wilde's ideals of the relationship between the artist and the spectator are interpreted on to his characters Dorian is just a mirror of basil, Just as art is just a mirror of the spectator. It also shows that basil wants to respected by the world, and have wonderful influence.A person could spend days and pages and pages explaining why Oscar Wilde's ideas of art reflect on the characters of The Picture of Dorian Gray and what it reveals about the characters true feelings. Here are the most important Dorian Gray and his painting reflect on the his ideas of the artist and the art, Dorian Gray and his ideas of artists not having ethical sympathies, and that Dorian and Basils relationship is the same as the art and the artists relationship. And a person could also go into the fact that according to Oscar Wilde's ideals about art the critic is he who can translate into another manner and I hope that was done in this essay.please anyone don't steal thi sessay as your own, because believe it or not if your teacher is smart and will type in the first sentance of this essay in google and this will come right up and you will be expelled.thank you for reading"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Who knows? But right-wing orthodox Catholic monarchist readers will be required to steel themselves through the first two chapters which consist of a drawn-out slap fight between Elton John, Graham Norton and Ian McKellan. Now I like a cat-fight as much as the next guy, but a tussle among effete Brit cats with man parts is just icky. So the narcissistic homo-erotic banter opening the book was significantly under-appreciated by this reader. But after you get through those chapters the book gets much, much better.It is difficult to maintain that the book represents a defense of amoral Aestheticism, since the embodiment of the aesthetic ideal, Dorian Gray, is shown to be a damned man. That is not to say that Wilde embraces Catholicism in the novel, as the narrator often posits confusing opinions on issues of conscience and sin. At times Wilde seems to suggest that only immoderate (quantitatively speaking) behavior is immoral; and yet, at other times, it appears some actions themselves ought to be avoided. Is Wilde acknowledging that there are exceptionless moral norms? And what is the reader to make of rotten Wotton, whose epigrammatic phrases seem so akin to Wilde's? Hallward points out that Wotton's cynicism is a pose. He never says a moral thing, but he never does a wrong thing. So are we to take his Wilde-isms seriously? Are we to take Wilde seriously? Wilde says art is neither moral nor immoral, yet Gray is poisoned by A Rebors, a book by another decadent author who, oddly enough, also converted to Catholicism. And then there's the picture itself, the fruit of Hallward's homosexual obsession, which is clearly cursed, in spite of its initial apparent beauty.Wilde's protests notwithstanding, it is a book with a moral informing the reader that he cannot escape his conscience, that he cannot reject nature and nature's God, and that the wages of sin are death. But therein lies hope, for if God is to be believed regarding the wages of sin, then why should we doubt Him regarding our Redemption? Unfortunately, this message is made ambiguous by an author who, rather than unintentionally creating a distorted image of an idea that cannot be fully represented, intentionally peppers the novel with paradox for the sake of cuteness. But the Truth is not cute. He's terrifying, and Wilde knows better. Therefore the book is best left to the orthodox or the decadent. The lukewarm will simply be confused."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"For me, The Picture of Dorian Gray was a tedious read. I did not particularly enjoy it that much, although I acknowledge that it is a good piece of literature. It is very well written and full of details and vivid descriptions. The story is told artfully and exquisitely but I found it long-winded and difficult to get through at times. Many people would enjoy a book like this, but it was not for me. I couldn't relate to the British aristocracy system and was utterly appalled at how unbelievably shallow the characters were, although Wilde was probably going for that effect. I was also disappointed with the ending. I thought the point of the novel would be to eliminate the stereotype that bad people are ugly, but it just perpetuated it. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a book that makes them think. It is also recommended to people who like books from this era (late 1800's) and have a lot of time on their hands."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Will someone please tell me why this \\"uplifting classics\\" edition uses an image of Thomas Jefferson on the \\"cover\\"?

He should not have to lower himself and preach to the reader."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I was really looking forward to this book, since I heard glowing reviews about it. However, I found it to be perhaps the most excruciating reading experience of my life thus far (with the exception of mathematics texts), and I wish I could've given it 0 stars. I don't mind it when authors digress a bit from the story to reflect on a theme or two, but Wilde did it so often it seemed like I was reading a 100+ page philosophy essay on art. I think Wilde is a fantastic writer with an almost perfect sense of wit, and I think he had a good story, but something went wrong when he was writing the manuscript and he ended up making this novel a university lecture for his beliefs."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"which is a waste of paper.

In the end all I can say to truly show how I feel about this novel is that this book BORED me. 177 pages of art that is 'quite useless'.

Although the moral of the story has been copied over by many other authors (with slight variations), the dilemma remains the same - is one willing to sacrifice his internal peace for the price of the eternal beauty?

Under the influence of Lord Henry, whose philosophy rest entirely upon self gratification that looks upon those good in life as those who are too weak and timid to live life, Dorian Gray trades his youthful innocence for a life of self pleasure at what ever cost. As he falls deeper into sin, taking all those around him along, his portrait receives all the marks of sin while he remains looking as young as he was the day his portrait was finished. Even though he has been able to live his life the way he thinks is the best, doing whatever he wants and not paying any price for it, he winds up feeling loathsome as he is haunted at night by the deeds of his sins and Lord Henry's theory of \`relieving the soul through the senses' no longer works for Dorian. His portrait also haunts him as it tells of all sins. He tries to reverse the process of contamination by behaving in a way he thinks is good, but being good for selfish means is almost as bad as a sin, and though we may repent of our sins we still bear some scars from our past sins, so seeing no instant change he tries to destroy the painting, but the painting is a link to his soul.~And the moral of the story is don't live for self"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"A book for all time.

This story is about a young man who grows to be a sinful and terribly vain man driven by love, beauty and art.The Main character, Dorian Gray, at the beginning of the book is a beautiful and youthful man. Dorian was a man everyone wanted to be around just because he had innocence and he was different. \\"He has a simple and beautiful nature.\\" Says Basil Hallward. This innocence and beauty changes as he becomes friends with Lord Henry and his values of life change him. Because Dorian was so nave, Lord Henry lured Dorian into a whole new life and new philosophies about love, beauty and selfishness. This is not the only deep friendship that is developed in this book. Dorian also becomes friends with Basil Hallward and Basil paints a portrait of Dorian and Basil puts his whole heart into this painting for it to ultimately destroy himself and Dorian. Anyway, Dorian wishes that he could stay young all his life and always be beautiful. As he grows older Dorian does many terrible and shocking things but he still remains beautiful and untouched while his painting of himself shows the real nasty, terrible, and corrupted Dorian.One part of the book that really captivated me is when Dorian murder's one of his good friends. I think this is one of the turning points in the book because I believe Dorian realizes that life shouldn't be based on the appearance of things but more about quality and spirit. Dorian understands that his lifestyle of upscale parties with London's elite, and his friendship with Lord Henry is not all that it seems to be. You can see that after Dorian murders someone he questions himself and the painting because he realizes what the painting has done to him. During the last pages of the book we can see how Dorian self-destructs and finds away to restore the painting of exquisite and youth.This book was very different from anything I read and I loved it. I like how Oscar Wilde wrapped me into this book with many compelling and interesting thoughts. The main lessons I learned from this book is question your role models and to value your life. Another lesson I learned is to not worry about beauty because if we only pick things that are beautiful we miss the wonderful and mysterious things that don't look pretty but deep inside they are."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde's only novel is one of the best books I have ever read. The story is fascinating, and one that most people have heard of--that Dorian Gray, a young, beautiful man, makes a fervent wish that he would never grow old, and that the portrait just painted by his artist friend would age instead. This occurs, leading Dorian down a path of debauchery and cruelty, most of which must have been too horrific for Oscar Wilde to go into detail without violating obscenity laws.The book is a masterpiece in examining manipulation. The artist introduces Dorian to a friend, Lord Henry, who calls Dorian's attention to his beauty, and Dorian, formerly innocent and sweet, becomes vain. It is amazing to see just how potent the power of suggestion is, and this novel demonstrates it perfectly.The writing is less than perfect. One chapter goes on and on about artifacts that Dorian has collected around the world, leaving the reader saying, &quot;Okay, and who cares?&quot; Wilde's prose is far from flawless, but the story is so engaging that the reader will be willing to overlook the imperfections and will be intrigued in spite of this."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This fascinating story of extreme narcissism and moral dilemna provides food for thought on the author's strange and sometimes twisted views on society as played out by the characters.

I have a region free DVD player and sadly there was never a US release of this film). I haven't seen this film version yet and I know it strays from the original novel but that's not the worst thing in the world. I've seen a version where Basil was a woman and it was set in the nineteen sixties with really bad acting. Now that was terrible. And there's also the 1944 version of The Canterville Ghost that turned it into World War 2 propaganda. So I don't mind what they've done with the Ben Barnes version of Dorian Gray.But since I am waiting for this adaptation I would like to write a review now for the novel The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde. I LOVE the work of Oscar Wilde. Allow me to stress that. I absolutely love the work of Oscar Wilde. My two favourite works of his are The Canterville Ghost and The Picture of Dorian Gray.The Picture of Dorian Gray tells the story of a young man who sells his soul for eternal youth and beauty. While he remains flawless, a portrait of himself grows uglier every time he sins. He cannot die unless you destroy the painting.Thanks to temptation and vice Dorian falls into hedonism and debauchery. As he externally remains pure and untainted his soul bears the burdens of his actions as reflected in the painting. Dorian learns the hard way that it's not physical beauty that matters but the inner beauty of one's own soul in qualities of kindness, mercy and compassion, things that he had lost along the way for selfishness, hedonism and greed.Dorian's fall from grace is a road lined with wit and humour. The story is riddled with clever epigrams (witty, short sayings) mostly said by the morally questionable character, Lord Henry.Lord Henry is a surprisingly naive character who plants bad ideas and temptations into Dorian's head while he, himself, doesn't seem to actually commit any sin he talks about. He even has the naive notion that people of their status don't do things like murder, as if such crimes are vices only of the lower classes.The picture of Dorian Gray is a very good and interesting read that talks about social conformity, morality, hedonism, and good and evil. The messages are not heavy handed and it's an intelligently written story.People of Oscar Wilde's era who called it an immoral book were made uncomfortable by Dorian's descent and lack of redemption but ultimately he was punished for his sins. Others noticed the subtle hints of homosexuality and bisexuality in the story but these things were kept subtle as this was a Gothic Victorian novel.Many people over-estimate how much homosexual content there is in this book or they don't see it at all but in fact it was actually very subtle and you only notice it if you are looking for it.However lines such as 'The world is changed because you are made of ivory and gold. The curve of your lips rewrite history.' - which was engraved in a cigarette case given to Dorian by Lord Henry make the relationships obvious to the astute reader.The sexuality of the characters isn't even an issue. Poor Oscar Wilde was far ahead of his time in this regard.It's Dorian's decadence, hedonism and selfishness that cause his downfall and prove the moral lesson of the story; the value of the soul and inner beauty over external eternal flawlessness.Dorian might have had eternal youth and beauty but it was at the price of the eternal beauty and youth that comes from a good natured and kind soul. And Dorian, being an aesthete could only see this transformation when his soul was physically manifested in a portrait that changed with the changing of his nature.The 1940s movie adaptation of the story (the first film adaptation of The Picture of Dorian Gray) held the hope of redemption in showing that in acts of compassion the portrait could change for the better. This was something the novel lacked though it is still a fine novel.Oscar Wilde was right when he said there is no such thing as a moral or immoral book. There's only well written or poorly written books and The Picture of Dorian Gray is very well written.This isn't an action packed thriller (though there are some intense moments). This isn't a romance about an immortal with a teenage lover (though something of that does happen). This is NOT Twilight. This story actually has substance.This is more of an exploration of a character's nature and all of human nature in the process, the flaws of modern superficiality, selfishness and hedonism and the power the spiritual can still have over human consciousness.

So I don't mind what they've done with the Ben Barnes version of Dorian Gray.But since I am waiting for this adaptation I would like to write a review now for the novel The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde. I LOVE the work of Oscar Wilde. Allow me to stress that. I absolutely love the work of Oscar Wilde. My two favourite works of his are The Canterville Ghost and The Picture of Dorian Gray.The Picture of Dorian Gray tells the story of a young man who sells his soul for eternal youth and beauty. While he remains flawless, a portrait of himself grows uglier every time he sins. He cannot die unless you destroy the painting.Thanks to temptation and vice Dorian falls into hedonism and debauchery. As he externally remains pure and untainted his soul bears the burdens of his actions as reflected in the painting. Dorian learns the hard way that it's not physical beauty that matters but the inner beauty of one's own soul in qualities of kindness, mercy and compassion, things that he had lost along the way for selfishness, hedonism and greed.Dorian's fall from grace is a road lined with wit and humour. The story is riddled with clever epigrams (witty, short sayings) mostly said by the morally questionable character, Lord Henry.Lord Henry is a surprisingly naive character who plants bad ideas and temptations into Dorian's head while he, himself, doesn't seem to actually commit any sin he talks about. He even has the naive notion that people of their status don't do things like murder, as if such crimes are vices only of the lower classes.The picture of Dorian Gray is a very good and interesting read that talks about social conformity, morality, hedonism, and good and evil. The messages are not heavy handed and it's an intelligently written story.People of Oscar Wilde's era who called it an immoral book were made uncomfortable by Dorian's descent and lack of redemption but ultimately he was punished for his sins. Others noticed the subtle hints of homosexuality and bisexuality in the story but these things were kept subtle as this was a Gothic Victorian novel.Many people over-estimate how much homosexual content there is in this book or they don't see it at all but in fact it was actually very subtle and you only notice it if you are looking for it.However lines such as 'The world is changed because you are made of ivory and gold. The curve of your lips rewrite history.' - which was engraved in a cigarette case given to Dorian by Lord Henry make the relationships obvious to the astute reader.The sexuality of the characters isn't even an issue. Poor Oscar Wilde was far ahead of his time in this regard.It's Dorian's decadence, hedonism and selfishness that cause his downfall and prove the moral lesson of the story; the value of the soul and inner beauty over external eternal flawlessness.Dorian might have had eternal youth and beauty but it was at the price of the eternal beauty and youth that comes from a good natured and kind soul. And Dorian, being an aesthete could only see this transformation when his soul was physically manifested in a portrait that changed with the changing of his nature.The 1940s movie adaptation of the story (the first film adaptation of The Picture of Dorian Gray) held the hope of redemption in showing that in acts of compassion the portrait could change for the better. This was something the novel lacked though it is still a fine novel.Oscar Wilde was right when he said there is no such thing as a moral or immoral book. There's only well written or poorly written books and The Picture of Dorian Gray is very well written.This isn't an action packed thriller (though there are some intense moments). This isn't a romance about an immortal with a teenage lover (though something of that does happen). This is NOT Twilight. This story actually has substance.This is more of an exploration of a character's nature and all of human nature in the process, the flaws of modern superficiality, selfishness and hedonism and the power the spiritual can still have over human consciousness.

He was a poet, playwright and author, though is perhaps a little more widely known for his wit. He studied at both Trinity College Dublin and at Oxford's Magdalen College - where he became a part of the Aesthetic Movement. At Trinity, he won the Berkeley Gold Medal while at Magdalene, he won the Newdigate Prize in 1878. He subsequently graduated from Magdalene with a double first - however, he failed to be elected to the Oxford Union, which is something I'd imagine they're very embarrassed about now. After a very colourful - though, at times, difficult - life, he died in 1900 and is buried in Pere Lachaise in Paris. \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is Wilde's only novel, and was first published in 1891.Basil Hallward is a highly-regarded and well-known artist. As the book opens, he has just completed his latest portrait - one of his latest muse, a young gentleman called Dorian Gray. Hallward's friend, Lord Henry Wotton, thinks it's the finest work completed by Hallward and suggests it should be exhibited in the Grosvenor - Hallward, however, disagrees. He feels he has put too much of himself into the portrait, insisting it would reveal more of the painter than the subject. Basil has become obsessed with Gray : he sees him daily, and describes his presence as \\"absolutely necessary\\". Wotton naturally becomes intrigued, and is keen to meet Gray. Basil, on the other hand, wants to keep them apart - knowing Henry would be the worst possible influence. Unfortunately, Gray calls round unexpectedly and he has to introduce them...Basil's fears were well founded. By the end of their first conversation, Dorian is completely in Henry's thrall and is convinced that his youth and beauty will only gradually fail - leaving him with nothing of value. He offers his soul, if his looks remain as they are, while his portrait ages in his place. Under Henry's guidance, Dorian dedicates to the \\"new Hedonism\\" - and, in time, he notices the portarit not only ages but becomes more hideous with each sin.I found it difficult to see exactly how Basil and Henry came to be friends. Apart from a little pretentiousness and plenty of flouncing - especially in the book's early pages - they appeared to have nothing in common. I did find it a little difficult to take Henry seriously, though - luckily, for the book - Dorian proves to be as impressionable as he is vain. He is dominated by Henry's malign influence and - despite occasionally considering returning to the straight and narrow via Basil - generally remains happy to follow the path Henry set out for him. A book that gets better as it goes along, as it starts to deal with Dorian's internal struggles - and is certainly much better than some other classics I've read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I have never read this book before getting it for my Kindle. I love it, the book makes you tink about how you conduct your life and how it shows on you.This book also gives the reader a window into the life of a the rich of England at the time. I find the book to be well writen, a great add (or like me a great beginning) to your classic collection."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oh what sinister fun! A morality tale wrapped up in a story dripping with homoeroticism and hedonism. I can't imagine how much pleasure Wilde had when he wrote this story and how much went on his head that never actually made it onto the page as a result of the laws of the time. This luscious, lusty Faustian tale is so dark and delicious; discreet when it has to be, suggestive when it wants to be. And the picture I have of Dorian Gray in my mind is that of the most beautiful man on earth--yes, we're all suckers for a bad boy, aren't we!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I'm really not sure why a lot of people have not read this. It truly is a work that can only be appreciated when read and reread. This is my second time reading through the pages that Wilde weaves with this epigrams and curious cascading delight for words. Each sentence is as interesting and beautiful as the last as he speaks of sin conveyed in the most interesting of manners.Truly, Dorian is a fall from grace. A Lucifer that could have looked upon what he would become if he had the choice. Perhaps the concept of the Devil hanging over Dorian's shoulder is what makes this story so interesting. Sin never weathers Dorian's face, he remains as beautiful as he was when he was in the prime of the human age. Only the tell-tale signs of age and sin and hate and cruelty are etched upon the portrait that Basil so intricately painted. It is an ugly thing that portrays every crime Dorian ever committed. Even, towards the end of the novel, when he wished to become 'good' the old sin cannot be washed away. Even so, Dorian cannot conform to the 'good life' and instead forces himself to an unknowing demise because he cannot cope with the prospect of living a wholesome life. He would have to give up the sweet taste of sin, that which he had known without reprimand for years."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Dorian Gray is an exceptionally handsome young man, but when he sees his portrait and realizes his own beauty he wishes that the painting would grow old while he could remain young. At first he is mortified when he finds changes in his painted image, but influenced by a friend Dorian begins to seek the pleasures in life. No matter what depths he sinks to his handsome face remains unchanged, while the portrait grows uglier and more hideous, burdened not only by age but by his debauched lifestyle.I don't know if this work of literature is as widely read as it maybe once was but I was quite taken in by the story. It's interesting that Dorian, instead of using the portrait as a type of conscience to correct his actions, instead takes strange delight in observing the change. He revels in his freedom from outward consequences and digs deeper, delving into every pleasure. In some ways the separate manifestations of the individual reminded me ofDr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, while his recognition of his outward appeal and how it would fade seemed to have shades of Bradbury'sDandelion Wine. And the character of Lord Henry is interesting, always in the background congratulating him and encouraging Dorian's sensual hedonism. But it's also a critique of society, both Victorian and today: we spend our time and money trying to reverse the effects of age (the gym, cosmetics and cosmetic surgery, etc.); companies spend billions idealizing (or idolizing) \\"youth\\"; and some even even seek to excuse away weakness and place blame elsewhere. In all, it may not be a perfect story but it's very interesting and thought-provoking."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"When THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY was first published in 1890, England was still in the last throes of a Victorian morality that still prided itself on all sorts of morality, especially sexual prudery. Into this realm of things which were not dared to be spoken, along came Oscar Wilde to say them. Wilde's gay background formed a subtext both in the novel and in his personal life that both titillated and repelled much of England.THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY is a reworking of the popular literary motif of the consequences of making a deal with the devil. The average Englishmen well knew of Marlowe's Dr. Faustus who had signed such a pact with Mephistopheles involving the exchange of power and knowledge for Faustus' soul. Every human being has a soul worth bartering; Wilde dared to suggest to a homophobic England that even a gay man's soul was as well.Dorian Gray is a young, handsome man whose portrait is painted by Basil Hallward. Beginning with the very introduction of Gray, Wilde consistently combines two seemingly unrelated themes: the role of the artist in society and the role of the gay man in that same society. In the Preface to his book, Wilde maintains his aesthetic belief that the only purpose of art is to have no purpose: \\"All art is useless.\\" Wilde connects this inutility about the nonpurpose of art with the aging and the dissipation of the painting that grows progressively more unattractive the more that Gray sins. Lord Henry Wotton, who is surprisingly the most interesting character in the book with his witty epigrams and biting cynicisms, is the rou&eacute; who leads--or perhaps seduces--an initially innocent Dorian into a life on nonstop debauchery. Dorian, urged on by Wotton to drop Dorian's newest girlfriend, the actress Sybil Vane, crudely berates what he saw as a second rate theatrical performance, causing her to commit suicide in grief at his cutting remarks. After her death, Wotton leads Dorian into a two decade long life fall into sin. Eventually, Dorian considers it time to clean up his act and this is where many readers have become confused with Dorian's advice about art in the Preface and Wotton's advice about art in the book. When Wilde asserts in the Preface that art is useless, he rejects the current Victorian notion that art ought to be used for the betterment of humanity. He states that the contrary is true. Art must not be used for betterment. He further implies that his belief's corollary must be true too: that art cannot harm human life. In fact, as he finishes his Preface, he notes, \\"All art is useless.\\" Yet, in the novel, Wotton rejects Dorian's claim that his painting has led Dorian's beauty on a straight line road to disaster--for Dorian, for Sybil, and earlier for Basil, whom Dorian has murdered. What is apparent, at least to Wotton if not to Dorian, is that it was not art that was responsible for their deaths, but Dorian, who in his hubris wanted to assume the same mantle of godlike near immortality that damned Faustus centuries earlier. Thus, art had nothing to do with Dorian's descent into evil. It was nothing more prosaic than pride gone berserk.Wilde's not so subtle intent at painting his own portrait of a homoerotic connection between Wotton, Dorian, and debauchery has also been a source of much confusion. Wilde could not afford to state explicitly that Dorian was involved on a gay level with Wotton, Adam Campbell or anyone else, but it is pretty clear that homoeroticism was just one in a long line of events that Wilde knew would point out the ongoing degradation of Dorian. But if Wilde allowed Dorian to escape the consequences of his seduction by Wotton, then he might not have been able to find a publisher. It was hard enough the way it was to do that.Readers today regard THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY as a fascinating if not a dated period piece about trading one's soul for forbidden delights, but no other book warns of the consequences as eloquently as this one."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I picked up this book to read, partly because I am a big fan of Wilde's plays, and partly because the concept behind this novel has become such a part of our collective conscious that I wanted to know what was behind it.It was filled with all the wit and cynicism that I expect from Wilde, but, I found it to be a bit tiresome to read. I suspect that this is partially due to the fact that it is so solidly grounded in the late 1800's that the concerns of the characters are a bit distant.Still, I must say that I feel that it is a book worth reading. Anything that has seared itself into the western world's consciousness is worth investigating."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"To my mind, this is one of the best works in all of English literature. Oscar Wilde is a artist who uses the page as his canvas and the written word as his paint. His wit cuts at the human condition like a scalpel with depth and precision. Dorian Gray is his finest work.This is a Faustian tale of a man who utters an oath offering his soul for the youth portrayed in a painting of him, if only it would age instead of he. He discovers that the wish has been granted, only he gets more than he requested, as the painting shows not only the marks of age, but also the marks upon his soul as he slips into a hedonistic and odious life.I have read a lot of criticism of this book by modern and especially young readers as being slow and boring. This is much like the criticism of a beer guzzler describing a fine wine. \\"Forget the bouquet and refined taste, just give me my buzz.\\" This story, and the subtle philosophies contained within, need to be sipped deliberately and relished. There is page after page of astute insight into the paradoxes and ironies of society and the mysteries of being human. To be bored with this is to be insensate to life's depth and meaning.Many have also criticized the book as espousing hedonism and attacking Victorian society especially at the time it was written. Such critics wrongly assume that Lord Henry is Wilde's mouthpiece for a fatalistic and cynical philosophy. Actually, the exact opposite is true. The cynic is the one being satirized, not society.Lord Henry uses paradoxical aphorisms to bolster his sardonic view. However, they are specious and self validating arguments that look at the small truths about the world and draw the wrong conclusion. Rather than assume that these eccentricities and foibles are things that we can and should rise above, he draws the conclusion that we should embrace and accept our instinctive weaknesses. He ignores the higher truths and points out instead how the capitulation to our own desires sets us free. Wilde's refutation of this philosophical connivance comes in the person of Dorian Gray.Dorian was Lord Henry's prot&eacute;g&eacute;. He was living the life that Harry espoused (but ironically didn't live himself). And what was the result of Dorian's decadence? He lived a life of torment and self loathing. He agonized over the hideous marks on his soul as catalogued by the portrait with each dastardly deed. Wilde is telling us that this is what such self indulgence and cynicism about life and society brings. His message is that a civilized society, with all its inconsistencies, paradoxes and ironies, is preferable and superior to living like an animal. By smiting Dorian, he is really smiting Lord Henry and everything he advocates. He is making a case for the soul over the body; intellect over instinct.This is an exquisite and thought provoking treasure that is every bit as relevant now as it was almost a century ago when it was written. I have read it a number of times through the years and I never tire of it. As I have gotten older and more experienced, its truths have become more vivid and resonant. If you've never read it, pick it up and savor it. Don't rush through it for the plot. Ponder it as you read. If you have already read it, put it away and try it again in five or ten years. You may discover new meaning, and much that you missed. That's the beauty of a timeless novel. Its wisdom will wait patiently until you've had time to catch up."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray, a story of morals, psychology and poetic justice, has furnished Oscar Wilde with the status of a classical writer. It takes place in 19th-century England, and tells of a man in the bloom of his youth who will remain forever young.Basil Hallward is a merely average painter until he meets Dorian Gray and becomes his friend. But Dorian, who is blessed with an angelic beauty, inspires Hallward to create his ultimate masterpiece. Awed by the perfection of this rendering, he utters the wish to be able to retain the good looks of his youth while the picture were the one to deteriorate with age. But when Dorian discovers the painting cruelly altered and realizes that his wish has been fulfilled, he ponders changing his hedonistic approach.Dorian Gray's sharp social criticism has provoked audible controversy and protest upon the book's 1890 publication, and only years later was it to rise to classical status. Written in the style of a Greek tragedy, it is popularly interpreted as an analogy to Wilde's own tragic life. Despite this, the book is laced with the right amounts of the author's perpetual jaunty wit."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Basil, who up until now was a mediocre painter after meeting Dorian Gray a young Adonis, was inspired to create a masterpiece of which he puts himself into. Against Basil's wishes, Dorian Gray is influenced by Basil's friend Lord Henry. Dorian looks at his portrait and realizes that while the portrait will stay young forever, he will grow old; so Dorian makes a wish that if only he could stay young forever and the portrait can age.At first Dorian does not realize his wishes been granted. He falls in love with a beautiful young actress who is every woman that Shakespeare ever wrote about. But once again due to Lord Henry's influence, he realizes that she's just a common girl.Starting with absent-minded acts Dorian slowly sinks into debauchery. And with every new act his picture becomes more grotesque while Dorian stays is young and as innocent looking as the day his picture was painted.What will become of Dorian?What will become of Dorian's painting?What would you do if you were Dorian?Oscar Wilde paints a picture himself as he describes Dorian Gray's dilemma. And we as readers travel with Dorian as each decision is made. In some places in the story Oscar Wilde seems to drag on and on with detail; however we find that this detail is necessary to set the next scene.Oscar Wilde himself led a risky life that lead to a jail sentence; is attitudes can be seen in the dialogues in this book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This has to be one of my favorite books of all time. This is breath-takingly honest look at life when the physical is all we look at...and many of us do.From the brilliant quotes to the numerous times when Dorian Gray proves what a scoundrel he is, this book makes any reader think and enjoy their own lives much more to see what that type of thinking causes. Here is a man who looks lke a Greek God and he takes everything for granted because he knows his powers will never allow his looks to be tarnished. Then he loses his sanity and actually commits murder on his artis who painted him and then does himself in!Not only brilliant, but pretty funny, too!Check out this book! It's a once in a lifetime experience!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is one of the most interesting books I have ever read. There is a lot of philosophy packed into this short, fictitious account of several (three main characters) rich men who live life in a very nonchalant, yet formal environment. The characters are developed beautifully and invoke strong emotion toward each one. I found myself hating Henry, loving Basil and having strange mixed feelings for Dorian. While there are a lot of different views in regard to the overarching theme of the book, I believe (along with what seems like a majority) that the book is about morality. Man left to his own logic (shown in the character of Henry) is left only with death, and a meaningless existence. Dorian shows (I believe) the struggle of man in choosing a morality outside of human authority and logic. Dorian loses the struggle and of course it ends with his own death, which in reality is the logical conclusion to a life lived for one's own pleasure.It is interesting to note that Oscar Wilde was an accomplished painter himself, and got the idea for this book through an actual experience. I thoroughly enjoyed the story, and the different themes that the book brought out."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"First let me say that this is a very good story. I truly did enjoy reading this book and read it in a matter of days. I very much like the modern library version since it had nice print along with some good notes.Second, this is a deep story. The first 100 pages is about the philosophy of Lord Henry. I am not sure but I equate Lord Henry to the devil. It is either that or the devil is working through Lord Henry. Thoughout the book, it appears that Lord Henry knows what is going on with Dorian even though he was not around when certain events took place. One must read and then read again chapter two of this book. This is the chapter that reveals Lord Henry's philosophy. It is deep so I had to read that chapater twice.After the first 100 pages and it is clear what the picture represents, it becomes much more of a fast paced novel. However, chapter XI (11) is a difficult read. At the end of chapter X (10) Dorian is only 19 years old. At the beginning of chapter XII (12) he is now 38 years old. Chapter 11 basically gives you a history of his life in those 19 years. It seems as if it was added later to give this history. It did add a little to the story but not too much.I very much liked how the book ended but it seemed a little quick for me. However, this book did get me thinking and that is the point of the story.Given that this is a short book (only 254 pages) it is well worth the read. I recommend to anyone that has any type of interest in Gothic stories read this book. Even if you don't have an interest in Gothic stories, this is still a very good, quick read. You will not be disappointed that you read this book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The greatest marriage of classic literature and modern philosophy, poetry masquerading as prose, and a psychological epic in art-house clothing ever created! The genius of Oscar Wilde knew no bounds, and this book remains disturbingly chilling and alarmingly familiar over a hundred years after its first controversial publication. Though the plot could never exist anywhere outside of fiction, it is at once starkly shocking and believeable, never once wavering from the quietly accusing mood set early on.Dorian Gray is a beautiful youth who becomes painter Basil Hallward's artistic obsession, and the masterpiece painting Basil creates of Dorian seems to mock the young man, who grows jealous of the fact that it will never grow old or ugly, as he knows he will. He silently curses the painting and wishes it would age instead of him, and eerily enough, the painting becomes in itself a picture of Dorian's vain, ugly, hedonistic, and murderous soul.Indelibly true and deliciously quirky, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a treasure trove of genius observations and statements so true and yet so stunning you'll be forced to look over it a second time, just to make sure you didn't miss any of Wilde's poignant words. Well worth your time and energy, this book is reason enough to fake sick from school or work so you'll have the extra time to read it."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde is a man who is obsessed by appearances. In this particular novel, he follows from the moment Dorian Gray sells his soul to the devil named beauty and youth, pleasure and enjoyment, to his death and he describes how someone who looks perfect, perfectly young, intelligent, brilliant, beautiful, moral and healthy is in fact nothing but a monster decaying in all possible immoral actions, deeds and ways just under the surface. It is a very strong criticism of victorian society that considers appearances as more important than real ethics and morality. He exposes the hypocrisy of such a society where a whole class of people are nothing but perambulating pictures of perfection hiding the mire and mud of crime and evil. We can also feel another dilemma in this book. Oscar Wilde's own dilemma who has to keep up appearances, the appearances of a well behaved, well educated and perfectly integrated man in this aristocratic society of his, and who yet lives a passion and a whole basket of desires and impulses that are absolutely rejected as crimes by victorian society. We know he will not be able to hide this deeper nature forever. But the book shows that no one can evade one's being exposed and rejected, condemned and sentenced to some punishment forever. There always comes a moment when one will be exposed and rejected. This shows how deeply Oscar Wilde must have suffered in his life. The painting is nothing but a mirror of the deeper self of Dorian Gray, but a mirror who will become one day his accuser.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Perpignan."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Appropriately, I read this book while travelling the dark, sombre tube system in London. I already knew the story, but what struck me most was the perfection of the writing. Wilde uses such beautiful, concise and clear language to convey his own version of the Faustian legend.The subject matter is troubling to some but one cannot deny the quality of the art."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The book at times appears to be a sequence of Wilde's best one-liners, intersperced with narrative. Once, when I thought that that was all that the book was, I still liked it: after all, the story was a good one, the one-liners were mostly good, and if the two didn't fit well together, well, that was a pity, but it didn't prevent the book from being fun to read.I realise now that the book packs a greater moral punch than I'd thought. Wilde makes evil seem genuinely attractive; and this is not to be done merely by telling us that so-and-so finds evil attractive, and then giving a spurious causal explanation. When Dorian performs his first act of genuine cruelty, not only Henry, but the author as well, tell us to forget about it, that it doesn't really matter. They even give us some genuinely good arguments. (Whereas Basil, the force of good, seems to be able to do little but utter stolid platitudes.) So we forget about it as much as Dorian does, and are hit over the head all the more smartly by the end of the book. It's true, Wilde still gets a bit carried away with himself in places; and the effect of seeing so many of his epigrams together in the one place is to make us wonder if we could write a computer program capable of creating a couple of hundred more; but I was wrong in my initial reaction. The flippancy and the deep seriousness are both necessary. They contrast, but they do not clash."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I read this book as part of a personal quest to read some of the classic authors and was pleasantly surprised. I read some of the other reviews posted for the book and since it was free for Kindle I grabbed it. It was an awesome read that i felt was very relevant even though it was written many years ago.It tells the story of Dorian Gray who is a beautiful young man who has his portrait painted and upon seeing the protrait's beauty, doesn't think that he could ever live up to its beauty. He wishes that the picture could age instead of him and with that, in effect makes a \\"deal with the devil\\". Who actually turns out to be an acquaintance of the painter. Now I must clarify that the use of the term devil isn't literal or traditional in the sense of a scary creature whom Dorian encounters and actually makes a deal. Over time, it becomes apparent that Dorian doesn't age and that the picture does which causes a emotional distress for Dorian and we see him living his life in seclusion and treachery.People who encounter Dorian seem to have harm follow them or they in fact, harm (kill) themselves. All the while, he maintains his boyish looks and draws the ire of the townspeople and becomes the subject of many comments, rumors, and suggestions.In the end Dorian decides that the only way to be free and have a clean slate is to destroy the very thing that he feels has been holding him back...the picture and what happens next...well...I guess you should just read the book ;-)"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Basil, who up until now was a mediocre painter after meeting Dorian Gray a young Adonis, was inspired to create a masterpiece of which he puts himself into. Against Basil's wishes, Dorian Gray is influenced by Basil's friend Lord Henry. Dorian looks at his portrait and realizes that while the portrait will stay young forever, he will grow old; so Dorian makes a wish that if only he could stay young forever and the portrait can age.At first Dorian does not realize his wishes been granted. He falls in love with a beautiful young actress who is every woman that Shakespeare ever wrote about. But once again due to Lord Henry's influence, he realizes that she's just a common girl.Starting with absent-minded acts Dorian slowly sinks into debauchery. And with every new act his picture becomes more grotesque while Dorian stays is young and as innocent looking as the day his picture was painted.What will become of Dorian?What will become of Dorian's painting?What would you do if you were Dorian?Oscar Wilde paints a picture himself as he describes Dorian Gray's dilemma. And we as readers travel with Dorian as each decision is made. In some places in the story Oscar Wilde seems to drag on and on with detail; however we find that this detail is necessary to set the next scene.Oscar Wilde himself led a risky life that lead to a jail sentence; is attitudes can be seen in the dialogues in this book.The Picture of Dorian Gray Starring: George Sanders, Hurd Hatfield"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Dorian Gray, a young man of high English society, possesses a beauty that any man or women would long for. However, the reader soon realizes that even the purest beauty can not save us from the horrors and intrigue of sin. After seeing his portrait, Dorian curses the fact that soon his beauty will fade and declares \\"if it were I who was to be always young, and the picture to grow old! For that - I would give everything\\". Dorian soon finds that his ill-fated wish has come true, and his portrait now carries the burden of age. As the years pass, Dorian becomes obsessed with sins and evils, for they do not afflict his personal appearance, but rather aid in the deterioration of his portrait, his soul. But, although Dorian continues to sin and think nothing of the consequences of his actions, he is consumed with an overwhelming fear that his portrait and sins will be revealed to the world. Through the actions and sins of Dorian Gray, Oscar Wilde shows human's weakness to the evils of the world. Wilde urges all readers to renounce sinning for it leads to the deterioration of one's moral principles, but more importantly, creates an everlasting fear that can destroy one's soul and eventually destroy one's desire to live. This story should be read by teenagers everywhere for it shows that the true nature of our character is judged by the beauty of one's soul, rather than the beauty of one's face."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Though it's rather slow to get going in the initial chapters, Oscar Wilde's &quot;Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; builds up into a splendidly effective piece, written in highly polished prose. Dorian Gray, who is suggestively described as &quot;charming&quot; and &quot;beautiful&quot; ... is painted by his friend and admirer, Basil Hallward. Dorian, a self-centered social luminary whose character is reminiscent of Narcissus, makes a bizarre sub-Faustian wish which tragically comes true: that his beautiful portrait may age, while he retains his youthful looks. The conclusion is disastrous, the culmination of a narrative containing elements of murder, suicide, blackmail, a confrontation in a grimy alley and an episode in an opium den. The characters are very well sketched out, particularly the triad of Dorian, Basil and the intellectual cynic, Lord Henry, Dorian's mentor and the mouthpiece of some of Wilde's most cutting amoral opinions. The style is, typically, marvellous, characterised by brilliant exchanges and aphoristic gaiety. Wilde lacerates English bourgeois culture, the conceptions of sin and virtue and the attitudes towards art of his time with tremendous aplomb. Some of his quips are patently snide, sometimes mysogynistic, as in: &quot;Woman represents the triumph of matter over mind, while man represents the triumph of mind over morals.&quot; Oh, isn't that just despicable?! I love it!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"If you could retain your youth, what would you give up? What would you be willing to barter? Imagine, you're always young, vibrant, desired and the envy of all those who age around you?The Picture of Dorian Gray doesn't set out to answer the question, just to pose it. Oscar Wilde writes like no other I've read. The prose moves along along like a tempestuous sea. It rolls, it sways, it rocks and occasionally calms before the next surge. Amazing penmanship. Verbose conversations stir between the players as they seek to answer each other's questions and address each other's comments.The main character of the book, for me, was Lord Henry Wotton. A dandy gentleman who, for his own sake, is way too educated. It always seems to be Henry who plants the seeds of thought, or challenges the conventional wisdom which, in turn, sets the other players thinking. Henry meets Dorian as his portrait is finished by Basil Hallward. Henry, struck by Dorian's youth and beauty, remarks that, as Dorian ages, the picture will constantly remind him of who he was. Dorian wishes it the other way around and, his wish is granted but, at what cost? The picture always remains at the age when Dorian was painted yet, the face reflects Dorian's soul. The soul that becomes more dark and damaged.Chapter XI of this book describes, at Sir Henry's urging, Dorian's exploration into life. I don't think I've ever read anything like it before. Oscar Wilde seemed to have gone mad with the pen as he describes riches, wealth, decadence and hedonism. The finest details of objects of desire are described so richly you can almost feel them. This outpouring of prose meanders over many pages. At the end of the chapter I let out a \\"phew\\" as I felt Wilde had probably thrown down his pen and gone for a nap. I was exhausted from reading it. How he felt after writing it is anyone's guess.Gray does some horrible things as he develops and eventually, he sees what he's become. The picture, a mirror of his soul, becomes darker and darker as his soul becomes heartless and self-serving.It's great stuff. The book is relatively short yet overflowing with rich text and thought provoking idioms. Enjoy it, digest it, this one is a classic."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"What a wonderfull book. I Love the classic's. There are plenty of great books written today, but the classic's are from other periods in time that show life in a different light."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I picked up a an audio cd of 'The Picture of Dorian Gray' at the same time I was reading 'A Stranger's Child' by Alan Hollinghurst. Interestingly the respective narratives move through Edwardian England while peeling back the layers of sexual repression and eroticism associated with the era. The author Diana Galbaldon accomplishes this successfully, too, with attendant similar homo-erotic themes in her Lord John (Grey)series.While both listening and reading similar books simultaneously I was trying to keep the characters aligned with each story. In fact, several characters from each book have the same name. 'Dorian Gray' begins with a prologue by the author that addresses in advance the freedom to publish content that Wilde surely felt would be controversial. This proved to be prescient.The main character for whom the book is named in effect sacrifices his soul for the vanity of youth and life's experiences and excess. Up to a point, one could make a contemporary parallel to a life lived by a celebrity (i.e. Mick Jagger, Lindsay Lohan, etc.) at least from a public perception perspective. The song 'You're so Vain' by Carly Simon could easily have been written as homage to the Dorian Gray character.There exists in the story line a protagonist (the painter of the picture) and antagonist - a friend of the painter's who, arguably is a devil incarnate, guides by suggestion Dorian Gray down a path of self-gratification, vanity and excess.For those of us that recall the Twilight Zone TV series from the 1960's, this book - a classic for it's time - would have made a marvelous episode."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde's \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" has appeared in nearly a dozen forms, some reflecting publishers' objections, some adding new material by Wilde to compensate for cuts, and some simply bowdlerized in pirate editions. For the first time, Wilde's original manuscript submitted for publication has been printed as he wrote and intended it, before other people's prejudices and pressure caused him to alter the text. This is a beautifully produced large format book, beautiful cover with Caravaggio's \\"Narcissus\\" cropped and darkened, detailed introduction, bibliography and analysis of the complete publishing history of this unusually tortured author and book. All variants are included in the notes and annotations. Of particular interest is the fact that it is this text, which has not previously been published, that Sir Edward Carson, Counsel for the brutal and sociopathic Marquis of Queensbury whom Wilde absurdly sued for libel over an open note in a men's club in which Queensbury, father of Wilde's infamous lover Bosie Douglas, wrote \\"Oscar Wilde posing as a somdomite (sic).\\" But for Wilde's utterly mad legal action against Queensbury, he would not have faced the tremendous wealth of testimony and written evidence placed before the civil court by Carson, and would not have been prosecuted for any crimes, as he was after losing his libel action. Many of the passages which appear only in this new edition of \\"The Picture\\" were used by Carson to paint Wilde into a corner of criminality; and it is interesting to see just which sentences and paragraphs were accumulated to impeach Wilde on cross-examination. All in all, this is a wonderful book, almost too grand for its subject matter. But then Oscar, I am sure, would have expected nothing less."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray was an amazing book that had an incredable thought process.

The earnest prayer he utters before the portrait grants his wish. Now only the portrait will show the effects of age. And the stains on his character.For the rest of the book we see his life become his beauty. All the other important things in life fall away. Everyone wishes they could have his life of fortune and youth, but they have no idea how his soul is suffering. Neither does he.There are some passages that might appear wordy.

Oscar Wilde encorporates conventional defeating human dispositions such as superficiality, idolatry, and obsession into an astonishing tale of the life of a young man conflicted between morality and a hedonistic culture.

The book builds up beautifully towards the climax. Wilde's generates idle irreverent amoral and bitingly sarcastic dialogue as if out of thin air."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is a masterpiece of English literature from the 1800's. It's easy to see why the book aroused so much controversy when it was released, and why it had an integral role in Wilde's subsequent imprisonment: the moral dilemna the book presents is disturbing even today. Wilde was truly a great writer; it's obvious from reading this book. Not only was his wit top-notch as is often ackwnoledged, but his prose is very smooth and polished, very refined. Wilde's attitudes towards art are well-known - indeed, he says in the book's introduction that \\"all art is quite useless\\" - but it seems obvious now that he was a natural talent. I hesitate to say things like He was meant to be a writer, but it certainly seems true of Wilde. This is one of the books that shakes our moral foundations. Wilde's high-class lifestyle is well-documented - it seems his surname was utterly appropriate - and one can definitely see where the plot and perhaps some of the details of this book came from his own experience. Undoubtedly, the main premise of the novel - a man selling his soul for eternal youth - most likely sprung from a desire that Wilde himself expressed. Perhaps he was having doubts about his hedonistic lifestyle even when this book was written, several years before his imprisonment. One can conjecture all one wants, but the fact remains that this book is a marvelous piece of work. The wonderful, polished prose is a joy to read - with aphorisms abound - and I, for one, see it as a deep regret that this was the only novel Wilde ever wrote. We missed out on a lot of great literature, especially with the general disdain the plays are now looked upon with in our society. Alas, read this masterpiece, and you will miss out less."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I read this book in 6th grade and have loved it ever since. It's rich and compelling words are fantastically written and portyayed in the mind frightfully real and visual. Oscar Wilde is one of my all-time favourite writers and I congratulate his excellence of writing and choice of description. After his two year sentence on Abnormal Sexual Vice his career literaly ended but even though he is gone, his writing is still fresh, enjoyable, and always a favourite."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"&quot;Every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist...&quot; says Oscar Wilde's Basil Hallward - and every book is the author's autobiography. Wilde provides an irresistible coupling of his fascinating wisdom and seductive voice in THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY, a self-portrait.In a story of forbidden love, Wilde languishes in an idyllic setting eager with curous onlookers whom he delights in stimulating. He insists upon being provocative and alluring, taking 'strange pleausre in saying things that he is not sorry about having said.' THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY is an image drawn by a lover whose passion for realism is transcended only by the hands of a writer who leaves everything to your imagination. As Dorian Gray protests, &quot;Let me think. Or, rather, let me try not to.&quot;But this IS a book about thinking - and deeply. A book that fathoms the deep erotic recesses of the human heart and speaks its language perfectly."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Dorian Gray was definately an excellent book, although the wording was somewhat outdated. It is an excellent piece of work, but I just had one question about it. Do you really think it was all Dorian's fault that everything happened? I believe Dorian's horrid fate would never have existed if Lord Henry had not been introduced to him. Lord Henry put outrageous ideas into an innocent litte head, and should be noticed as the fault of all of Gray's actions. It just killed me that no one realized what was really happening! But besides that question of fault, it was a grade A book, that I would read again, but not without a dictionary by my side. I recommend it to anyone who likes intelectual reading, and who is willing to sit through outdated talk. Just go for it, it's worth your time, and better yet... it's a short novel!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"A tale of beuty, love, innocence and cruelty. Wilde did a wonderful job of telling the story of young Dorian Gray, a timeless beuty that never shows his age and whose face never displays his sins. He betrays close friends, is fuel for many a suicide, is down right cruel and unfeeling to any of his numerous loves, is selfish and self immersed; yet his young, beutiful face never shows a trace of ill being. Being in a room with him, drowns anyone with pleasure, peacefulness and charm- it is impossible to look at his face and believe that someone so sweet and innocent in looks would commit any of the evil he is rumored to have done. Instead of himself being affected, a portait of him as a young man endures the strain of his uncouth behavior.This timeless tale, set in England at the turn of the century, would be an excellent story line for any modern novel and would make a wonderful movie. Wilde's writting style is proliferic, poignant and delightful. It captures the language of the time period, yet was easy to read and easy to relate to. Wilde conveys the evil of the aestetic world and how it can drive one to stop at nothing for fear of losing it. And though he hints at such controversial topics such as drugs and homosexuality; it is neither detailed nor graphic; and is only slightly touched on. Throughout the novel, Wilde creates an image and lets the reader fully develop it for himself. I absolutley adored this book and highly reccomend it to anyone. Not for a moment did I think it dull, or too wordy. It is a very easy read (which is difficult to say of such a classic), and incredibly enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book fits Wilde's description of a cigarette as a perfect pleasure - portable and brief, yet leaving you unsatisfied. Like Dorian Gray himself, this book is superficially charming, with its numerous and clever epigrams, but with some very ugly undercurrents, e.g. virulent anti-semitism, misogyny, and homosexuality. We never connect emotionally with Dorian Gray, who never matures into a complex or interesting character, but remains as some gay ideal with psychosis. Read Henry James' &quot;Portrait of a Lady&quot; or Edith Wharton's &quot;Age of Innocence&quot; for a far better written, devastating attack on Victorian morals and hypocrisy."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Indudablemente Oscar Wilde es uno de los m&aacute;s grandes escritores de la Literatura Universal; pero m&aacute;s que eso fue uno de los pocos que se atrevi&oacute; a enfrentar a una sociedad adoctrinada y primitiva, siempre dispuesta a estigmatizar aquellos que no se alineaban con los patrones impuestos por ellos mismos.

Most of the book is what used to pass as witty dialogue between stifled, elite Englishmen and women. Most of this dialogue displays the thinking of a totally amoral Lord Henry who verbally paints everyone he meets as a slivered character reflecting his own amorality. To Lord Henry, one's belief in anything is proof of one's deranged thinking. Both he and Dorian experienced continued hedonism but with no gratification.The reader is forced to accept the premise that an artist painted the portrait of Dorian and in so doing captured the young man's soul on the canvas. While Dorian lived the portrait kept aging while Dorian retained his outer, youthful appearance. Thus no other living character in the story had any evidence of the aging ugliness of the portrait. At Dorian's death the living portrait, the soul of Dorian, returned to its pristine, youthful glow.Throughout the story the reader is joined with the character Dorian in accepting the portrait's brutal transformation. But with the array of deaths that followed Dorian's heartless cruelty the reader kept being confronted with the pointlessness of the tale. The reader would like to have witnessed Lord Henry's response to the apparent suicide of Dorian Gray who he worshipped throughout the tale.

The first few pages are incredibly interesting. They are written extremely well and are filled with facinating ideas. That doesn't last long, though. After the forthy-somthing page the reader begins to understand that Oscar Wilde uses a lot of words to say nothing. And he does say something, you won't notice it because it's strangled to death with a lot of useless information.However, I do think the book does make a good read. You can't really blame Wilde for writing the way he does, since he, himself, says on the second page of this book: &quot;The only excuse for making a useless thing is that one adimers it intensely&quot;, and Wilde does admires his work intensely and for that we &quot;owe' it to him to read &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I enjoyed reading the book, and thought that it was a great allegory.

Certainly, it is dated insofar as many other Edwardian novels out of Nineteenth Century England seem trite and shallow (faring badly with what was coming out of Russia at the time: Gripping, universal, human stories from titanic authors like Dostoevsky or Tolstoy). But, cultural handicaps aside, let's give Wilde his due: The book is a treasure trove of wit--from his brilliant epigrams to its very fascinating plot, which anticipates Magical Realism by at least 50 years. That is to say, when one thinks of &quot;Twilight Zone-esque&quot; writing one is put in mind of Kafka, Borges or Grabriel Garcia-Marquez. The best in World Literature. But all of these writers take their cues from Wilde."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book was so well written and covers so many important, seemingly timeless dilemmas that I felt guilty while I was reading it. Even though there is no explicit language, there was a subtle sexual undertone throughout the work that was frightening. It is one of those books that people love to hate and hate to love because it hits so close to home for people in so many walks of life. I think the reason it can touch so many people is because it makes people wonder about how well their friends would think they are doing rather than how well they themselves think they are doing. \\"What would I look like if the mirror were to show my 'inner' self rather than my 'outer' self?\\" is the pervasive question here."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I enjoyed reading this book I chose it because of the Author.

It provides an interesting look on the society of the time through this multi-layeredstory, and Dorian Gray is a perfect representation of the human species. The novel depicts anundeniable influence of the French Decadence movement of the late 19th century, and allows thereader to understand better why it upset the British society that was emerging from the socialconstraints of Victorianism. I appreciated the beauty of his writing style, always elegant, witha flow that looks like poetry all along the book. The conversations exchanged are also witty andpoignant.Maybe some people could find the flow of the story quite slow, or with too many descriptions,which may not give enough room for imagination. Also the text was a little small, but remainedvery readable.Anyway, I highly recommend this book.

You're supposed to read it because it's a classic (no need for quotes around classic). On the other hand, it's pretty much about giving in to one's lesser wants and needs. We've all probably seen Dorian at one time or another. If we're lucky, we see him before the fall. There is something about a beautiful youth who has yet to fell the fingers of corruption. Many have seen him during the process of corruption (gosh...we may have even participated in said corruption). We've probably even seen him near the end of the process. Oscar Wilde's novel is brilliant. It covers the process of corruption very well. The ending is cliche, but it wasn't (probably) at the time.And, since I'm writing this for the e-book (uncensored), the model on the cover of the book is, ummmmm..., worth considering being corrupted by or corrupting."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This free classic version for my Kindle was very good!

Oscar Wilde was a \\"wild child\\", and he gives a glimpse into the often vain and decadant world of English society through the wanton excesses of Dorian...who appears to remain beautiful, youthful, and untouched by evil. It is Dorian's portrait that decays with every misdeed, including murder. The picture haunts Dorian as he travels among the rich, and also into the opium dens and low life of the waterfront. This edition contains a glossary of lesser known terms and references, for us modern folk. It was a quick and fascinating read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I knew relatively little going into this book...and what little I did know was from less than 100% accurate retellings such as in League of Extraordinary Gentlemen or references from cheesy shows or horror flicks (I think perhaps there was a reference in Scooby Doo somewhere?). I had the basic gist...there's a guy, Dorian Gray, who has some magical painting that ages while he stays young and wonderful forever. Not much to go on, but I was still excited to read it. I was pleasantly surprised that the book had much more depth to it.&lt;u>Plot&lt;/u>The plot is intriguing and has been used in other stories, though I think this one has more depth than I've seen before. Essentially, Dorian makes a wish that he will be forever as pristine as the painting made of him and that instead the painting will take on it the toils of his life. Whatever supernatural forces allow this to happen are irrelevant...the wish is granted.It's more than a simple \\"young forever\\" contract. Although age plays into the plot in a couple of places, the primary things that distorts the picture are the vices that Dorian engages in. The first transformation of the painting happens after an intense argument with the first woman he loved. It was interesting to me how quickly Dorian recognized the cause of the change for what it was, but had he belabored the motive for too long, the pacing of the book would have stalled and become unacceptable.Dorian uses his \\"power\\" to be ruthlessly reckless in his living. Dorian Gray becomes entirely uninhibited, taking everything to its limit, seeking absolute pleasure. He even sneaks out at night (so as not to tarnish his pristine reputation) to the \\"bad side of town\\" and lives a sort of double life in opium dens with gangs and prostitutes.In many ways (perhaps because I so recently read it), I felt many similarities to the morale commentary presented in Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. I felt that Wilde did a better job of delving into the psyche of the hypocritical character, largely because we were able to get into Dorian's head and think and feel with him, while in Jekyll/Hyde, we were kept at a distance by a third person narrative.&lt;u>Characters&lt;/u>There are three pivotal characters in this book.The first, obviously, is Dorian himself. For the first many chapters (perhaps nearly the first half of the book in fact), I wasn't terribly pleased with Dorian as a character...he felt very flat to me. He was basically a mirror to one of the other primary characters (Harry) and didn't ever show his own opinion. He was hailed as pure and beautiful. Perhaps it's all the art references in the book, but I often felt as if Dorian existed more as a classical statue than as a living, breathing character. As his interaction with the 'picture' progresses and once he takes some rather unexpected steps, he became a deeper character and a lot of fun to be with.The second primary character is Lord Harry (or was it Henry...blast those Brits for swapping those names interchangeably so often *grin*). Harry exists as the provocative, cynical, always-with-a-comment-about-anything mentor to Dorian. Harry is absolutely encouragable and a lot of fun to listen to. His speeches often have to do with the pursuit of pleasure at any and all costs and the hazard of a virtuous and peaceful life. His influence over Dorian is profound. As I mentioned above, it often felt as if Dorian existed merely as a mirror for Harry's advice. Harry didn't seem to follow all of his own advice, but Dorian took it readily to heart and strove to live a 'come-what-may' existence. Harry had some of the funniest and most profound comments of the entire narrative. He's a fabulous character.The third character I want to point out actually existed as more of a background character, but I feel the need to call him out merely because of his pivotal involvement in the plot. I actually can't even remember his name now...but it will suffice to call him, \\"the artist.\\" He's the one who paints Dorian's picture. He's the one who introduces Dorian to Harry. He's the one who tries to give Dorian good advice to counter all the reckless advice that Harry poisons him with. The artist was kind of like Dorian's \\"Jiminey Cricket\\"...his conscious that was often (always?) ignored until it was far too late. He showed up in surprisingly few scenes considering the huge importance he had to the plot.&lt;u>Style, Pacing, etc&lt;/u>The language used in this book was truly beautiful. Wilde wrote flowing, vivid descriptions of characters, places and actions. At times it was very poetic. It may be a bit too flowery for readers who don't enjoy that sort of description...it came very close to being 'over the top' to me in a few places. Still, I generally enjoyed the formality of it and the life it gave to the text. The first dozen or two pages were tedious to me...whether because of the language or just the style and thematic pacing, I'm not sure.The pacing was a bit slower than I would have liked. The main difficulty I saw was that Wilde was trying to present so many themes that he often had to result to lengthy passages praising or condemning one thing or another. There were often very long monologues by one of the three primary characters mentioned above. Harry's were generally offset by bits that made me laugh by their extremity while speeches from Dorian and the artist sometimes made me want to slap them and tell them to shut up.&lt;u>Overall&lt;/u>I was a little torn on my overall feeling for the book. It took me a while to get into it and there were long passages that were drudgerous to push through. However, from a high level, this is one of the better books I've read this year...or even for numerous years. It had a plenitude of intriguing themes that left me thinking in between readings. It had a lot of humorous quips and paradigms as presented by Harry that I laughed out loud at. It had surprising twists and tension that left me curious as to the true outcome (as opposed to that from rip-off stories). There are a couple of spots that could be considered \\"climax\\"...the confrontation with the artist is the main turning point in the book. Personally, I would have rather seen more pages after that turning point than before it. I think the last 1/3 of the book was far more engaging. At the same time, the buildup was necessary to promote the intended mood.Overall, this is a book I definitely recommend, with the caveat that you should be aware that it does slow down at points. Just push through those. The overall work is worthy of a couple of slow zones. In fact, perhaps those slow zones serve the purpose of allowing more pondering.****4.5 stars"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This was a rather difficult book to get through.

It's too deep. A story like no other I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"While this is Oscar Wilde's only foray into novel-writing, I must say it is justifiably called a classic. The use of descriptive language and mood is exquisite.The only downsides that I can mention would be how slowly it moves in some spots. Once in a while, the story takes sort of a vacation, and you are given a lot of details that don't really apply to the overall plot. Some of the things that are discussed are good at shedding light on some of the things that Mr. Gray was doing throughout the years that this book took place, but they can get a little boring. Truth be told, I skipped most of one chapter because it went on, and on, and on about the things that piqued Dorian Gray's interest. It doesn't stop there, but it explains why it did, what he did about it, and some other people that he associated with while he was pursuing a certain subject, like gemology. In this edition, many of the names that are given through these pages are given an endnote in the back, but to the average person these don't hold much interest. Even to some hardcore fans of classic literature and Gothic Horror could find certain chapters (one at least) very tedious.That being said, there is certainly more good in this book than needed to balance out the less interesting parts. In the beginning, we get to see where the corruption of young Mr. Gray comes from. As the book progresses, you can see the corruption finally consume him, culminating in a surprising finale. I read at work, and my jaw dropped more than once, which I only realized after a co-worker brought attention to it. Even though most people have heard of the themes in the book, this is a fine example of taking an existing theme, and making it into a brilliant new idea.The ideas contained in this book can be a little disturbing to some with a weak stomach. Some of the language can be a little stiff and hard to read, but remember it was written in the 1890's.This book is highly recommended for anybody who has an interest in the Classics or Gothic Horror. Not for the faint of heart, but if it's ever crossed your mind to read The Picture of Dorian Gray, pick this book up! If you want to start reading Gothic Horror, I would suggest something a little lighter to start with -- Edgar Allan Poe, The Phantom of the Opera, or something like that. Those are a little easier, and give you a good idea of what the genre is all about.Happy Reading!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"\`So, Henry, how is that young Prot&eacute;g&eacute;e of yours progressing, hem?Lord Henry paused to saviour his glass. Pleased, he set it down, just so, beside his dinner plate, and turned to Lord Fermor.\`Pundits say troubles come in threes, Uncle,' replied Lord Henry. \`What the pundits omit in their gabardine rush to spread their misery to others in a foolish attempt to alleviate their own, is that the best in life never travels solo. Take, for example, the wine and dinner before us. Both French. Together they constitute a meal to entice the gods down from the Mount. When did you ever come across a bad French meal, or a good French man? Yet when wine and food march together, they repay the Creator.'\`No doubt,' replied Lord Fermor, \`but you evade the issue. I asked about the young chap you have taken into your entourage, you know.' Lord Fermor struggled to recall the name, \`that chap who poses for Mr Hallward here.'Basil Hallward felt the heat of recognition first on his brow, then running through his whole body. A retiring man, more at home with his easels and sitters than at high table, he shrank from the public glare.Recognising the signs, though failing to sympathise with them, Lady Agatha piped up.\`Mr Hallword has many sitters, do you not, Sir.'\`Er, yes, indeed I do,' replied Mr Hallward, grateful for the prompt. \`For example, just today I encountered a young man of exquisite appearance, youth in all its pomp. He has promised to sit for me. Lord Henry, I fancy, will try to take him away and teach him of the world, thereby spoiling him as a object d'art.' He laughed to denote humour, simultaneously glancing at his friend to convey the serious meaning behind his joke. Keep away Lord Henry, the glanced announced, shielded behind the laughter. Keep away from this young man lest you send him on the eternal search for fulfilment and in so doing corrupt his soul.Lord Henry roared.\\"Why Basil, you surpass yourself! Hiding a serious message behind a joke so that you may deliver it in public. Would that the Good Book decked itself in such garlands, the better to frighten the masses. You are a greater artist than your canvasses know.'\`I fear my husband is avoiding your question, Lord Fermor,' laughed Lady Victoria. \`When it comes to hiding a serious message behind the veil of farce, he may rival Dante himself.'\`What is the name of your young beauty?' Inquired Lord Henry amidst the general humour. \`I only ask,' he pressed, \`so that I may avoid him. Let us hope I have more success than Eve, who expressed no desire to harvest the only tree in the garden that contained a serpent, until admonished not to. Of course,' Lord Henry continued, \`our Creator did not warn off the firstborn with laughter on his lips. Had he done so, perhaps we would be consuming ambrosia still. Mind you,' he reflected, \`this French cuisine is an adequate substitute.'\`Yes yes yes Henry,' broke in Lord Fermor, \`but what about your young Prot&eacute;g&eacute;e? Has he a fine future, seeking the dark mysteries of life of which you profess to be so fond?'\`Should he avoid hubris, I see for him a long, comfortable and satisfactory life.'\`And should he fail to avoid hubris?' teased Lady Agatha.\`Then I see for him immortality in print and prose. Hubris is man's affirmation of his living soul, his insistence that all must be as he ordains, and his rage that it is not. Should Basil paint hubris he would reveal Caliban.\`Modesty, on the other hand, is pleasing to the casual senses but fleeting, like snow on the chimneystack. Modesty and prose combine to produce the barely adequate. Hubris and prose combine to produce immortality, but not personal happiness.'\`And this choice, modesty of hubris, is one you see before Dorian Gray?' queried Mr Hallword.\`Dorian who?' Lord Henry responded. He reached again for the reassuring certainty in his wine glass. \`I was referring to my Prot&eacute;g&eacute;e, Oscar Wilde.'"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde is definitely a disturbing book. I think there is great worth in reading it, particularly when paired with a book such as Uncle Tom's Cabin by Harriet Beecher Stowe or Les Miserables by Victor Hugo. Contrasting Dorian's sordid downfall with with the heroic ascension of Uncle Tom or Jean Valjean is particularly beneficial.The Picture of Dorian Gray begins with Dorian, a young and handsome gentleman who is involved with philanthropy, sitting for a portrait while his new friend, Lord Henry, a sarcastic and hedonistic man of society, watches on. Dorian is described as being \\"unspotted from the world\\" and his beauty inspires the artist to his very best work. Lord Henry exclaims how lovely the portrait has turned out, but laments that it is too bad that the picture will stay young forever, whereas Dorian will eventually age and lose his youth and beauty. A vexed Dorian makes a wish that he will stay timeless and the picture will age instead of him.Taking Lord Henry as a mentor, Dorian sets out to apply Lord Henry's selfish and narcissistic worldview into nearly every facet of his life. In time, Dorian realizes that his wish has magically come true. He remains beautiful, while his painting takes on all the consequences of his wicked actions. As the debased Dorian sins more and more, the picture becomes more hideous and tortures Dorian's soul.Despite being filled with Wilde's signature wit, this is a haunting story showing the consequence of selfish character and the downfall of the soul due to despicable and hideous behaviors. Dorian loses his inner beauty long before he realizes that his soul's ugliness will destroy him.It's interesting to note that he chooses a French novel as his own Core Book, a personal classic which guided him throughout his life. In comparison, Uncle Tom and Jean Valjean both chose the Bible as their Core book. Near the end of the book, Dorian laments, \\"You poisoned me with a book once. I should not forgive that. Harry, promise me that you will never lend that book to any one. It does harm.\\"Wilde clearly shows that books exert an amazing influence over our lives. We must be wise in our choice of what we read. As Thoreau once said, \\"Read the best books first, or you may not have the chance to read them at all.\\" I would only add to that, \\"Read the best books most often, for they will color your soul.\\""},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"A classic and moving novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde discusses man's desire for youth, as well as his involvement in vanity. A tale of two differing personalities, the story is enticing, yet grippingOscar Wilde does an excellent job of revealing the contrasting atmospheres throughout the book. He does a fine job depicting the lighter side of Dorian Gray with images of life and excitement for example when he is getting painted, the light is bright and it takes place near a garden filled with beautiful flowers. Wilde is also able to portray the dark and menacing side in Dorian Gray as he eventually commits murder. Dorian Gray comes off as such a complicated character which makes him so interesting. He wants to fulfill his desires but is unable to do so successfully. People can feel how each person has a part of Dorian Gray in him or her. We all have our flaws we want to fix, but we should not become obsessive over them or it leads to destruction as seen in the book.The story is fascinating in that it is able to capture reader's interest because the mysteries in the plot are so intriguing. Although the book has that characteristic gothic element of a man living without the fear of death or consequence, The picture of Dorian Gray is still an accomplishment because it is written beautifully through the character description.The Picture of Dorian Gray is worth the read, as readers are guaranteed to be captivated by the mysteries the character Dorian Gray holds."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Story:Dorian Gray is an adonis who is reminded or rather made attentive to his own beauty by a gentle artist friend (or lover) of his, Basil Hallward, who makes a breathtaking portrait of Gray. The portrait eventually becomes a favorite with Dorian, which also mirrors, in its painted face a sombre reflection of his own misdeeds and immoralities -- each time he commits it -- by growing uglier and uglier. He guards it with extreme care and caution everyday wanting none to see it found marred by his iniquities. Early in the story Dorian happens to meet with a reckless rich man, Lord Henry, a friend of Basil, who cares not a tithe for morality and its dull unattractive ways but believes in living life to the fullest at any cost. He preaches hedonism as sacred and purity a sin. Both Lord Henry and Dorian take an instant liking towards each other the day they meet. This friendship has an obvious deleterious effect on Dorian in that he kills himself repentantly after realising the worthlessness of his having lived a pompous, immoral, wicked and greedy life. Just before the story ends, he kills his well-wisher Basil too.How the story is arranged:Initially, the first few chapters seem to move fast and the story gains momentum. Just as the reader becomes inquisitive, a dull tone appears making the following chapters languorous. Wilde becomes a bit didactic in elaborating on the various interests Dorian picks on in his later adult life. Also, as one naturally imagines Dorian as a young lad, we then suddenly find him a thirties something in the last few chapters without a clear and smooth manifestation of this transition from adolescence to manhood. Most of Dorian's life is sinfully adventurous and in spite of that is portrayed quite uninterestingly. No events are specifically narrated upon and the emphasis on homosexuality can be smoothly sidelined. Overall, the story is good only if viewed as a philosophical inquest into human nature. Anything beyond that may disappoint the reader.Relevance, Reflections and Conclusion:The entire story is a narration of essentially how importantly one's mind makes one's personality, how one's personality makes one's deeds, and how in turn those deeds make one's soul. Of course we do not really fashion our soul, we only help it manifest it through our deeds. Gray's character is a reflection of the kind of narcissist weaklings in humanity who lack the courage to face their dark corners, while constantly finding strength and support in being mentored (actually misled) by feckless perverse people, like Lord Henry here, who lead them increasingly towards moral obscurity. How different the world would be if each one of us could reason out \\"responsibly\\" all that seems perverse and sacred, and yet not give in to anything perverse or sacred until one has found it true himself! I have also found the concept of blame game in this story very interesting. Do we not often dutifully blame others for our own darkness and failures, just as Dorian Gray blames his friend Basil Hallward for turning him into a deplorable narcissist? A responsible man always shares the burden of his own actions, rather than carelessly and callously point fingers at others -- a good lesson to learn! The story also raises deep philosophical arguments at every nook and corner if one plunges deep into the characters of the story attentively. Simple sentences like \\"Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing\\" had me thinking and I found it strongly relevant in today's consumeristic hegemony. There are many more such dialogues which raise questions about the importance of femininity, marriage, purity, aestheticism and so on. Anyhow, to read it for its \\"own sake\\", or to try to finish it in a hurry, will certainly make it very boring and tiresome. But for those who inveterately love to question and investigate the world they live in with its various dogmas, theologies, philosophies and doctrines either propagating or thrashing morality, this book makes an interesting read. Since I do not possess a bent of mind that appreciates a tragic ending, -- I consider human life very precious --, I was sorely disappointed to see the protagonist, Dorian Gray, dead in the end. In fact I find this style of defeatist writing/ending a flaw in itself though it appeals to many. Plainly, if I were the author, I would have given my protagonist a new life, a new philosophy, a new guidance, and a new hope. HOPE...without which the entire humanity cannot exist."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I knew what this story was about long before finally reading it. That's probably common. The famous premise is a fascinating one, though I found myself wondering if the narrative would have been even more impactful if written as a short story or novella length rather than stretched out to a full novel. The Lord Henry character who serves the purpose of putting bad ideas in Dorian's head gives multiple speeches throughout detailing his hedonistic world view. If the number or word count of these lectures was cut in half I don't think the story would suffer much from the absence. Another decision made by Oscar Wilde was not to show readers very much of Dorian's behavior. His first act of cruelty is laid out before us as is his final one, but in between we are only told that his bad reputation precedes him without being shown what he has done to earn it. It's left to our imagination. A few more scenes exhibiting decadent behavior rather than various dinner party conversations in which a pro decadence philsophy is expressed would have made for a juicier read. Would it have made for a better read? That's arguable, as perhaps it also is whether this book is intententially homoerotic or simply written during a time when heterosexual men were much more comfortable going on and on about how good looking a guy was. What's beyond debate is that Oscar Wilde came up with a great idea to build a story around, one that is as timeless as the desire for eternal youth."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I've developed a general rule to avoid free Kindle editions of virtually anything, and it paid off handsomely when I picked this edition. There were two Penguin Kindle editions. This one for $.99 and another for free. As with other free Kindle editions labelled \\"Penguin\\", the edition was not Penguin, it was a \\"Pocket Book\\" edition. This one, for a buck, is true blue Penguin.To further validate my point, this edition has many addins which are often missing from a cheap Kindle edition. First, it has a history of the book's writing and publication, an outline of Wilde's life, an excellent bibliography covering both 19th and 20th century works, two appendices on 19th century reviews of the book and on the provinance of this edition. It also has notes on the chapters which explain things understood by a late 19th century Londoner, but which have been lost to us. An example is the term \\"Japanese effect\\" referring to a style adopted by some late 19th century painters, mimicing some aspects of Japanese art. A leading example was the great portrait artist, James MacNeill Whistler.In a word, it is a complete, genuine Penguin edition, cheap."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I was reading the graphic novel: Jaka's Story (Cerebus, volume 5) by Dave Sim and Gerhard (which I strongly recommend anyone to read, together with the sequence: Cerebus, volume 6, Melmoth) when I met the fictional character &quot;Oscar&quot;.In that story, &quot;Oscar&quot; discussed with Jaka's husband, Rick, about a poisonous book (&quot;The Picture of Alfred Douglas&quot;), written by a certain Lord Henry Wotton! Any resemblance with the reality? :) &quot;Oscar&quot; told that he asked to Lord Henry how did he explain his success after saying that &quot;to be popular one must be mediocre&quot;? Lord Henry answered him that &quot;in this matter as in many others, he was the exception that proved the rule&quot;.Reading these passages, I was charmed with the Oscar Wilde character and decided to read the true &quot;The Portrait of Dorian Gray&quot; written by the true Oscar Wilde.I think the passages in Cerebus clarified to me what this book was about (modern graphic novels have the power to illuminate one's thoughts). One should not read this book looking for coherence. All the characters are incoherent, and this is one of the genial points in this book. People are not coherent, so fictional character must not be coherent either!In the preface the author, himself, says that art is quite useless, though it is the thing he loves most to do! The artist Basil says initially that a picture, done with heart, belongs to the artist. Later, he gives the picture to Dorian Gray. Henry Wotton throws along all the story a series of poisonous thoughts that he doesn't follow!Other genial point is that Dorian, although being evil (and could be considered a villain in his own story) is not punished for what he does!Sybil Vane commits suicide because of him, but nobody was able to connect her death with him. Later, he kills Basil, but he just disappears with the body, with no consequences. Near the end, when we think that he is going to be killed by Sybil Vane's brother, he escapes easily from him. Only when, by caprice, he makes the foolishness of trying to destroy his portrait, is that he finds death. That is, he dies merely by accident, not because of his vicious or crimes.If, instead, he just tried to cut the picture he would learn that it would have the effect of hurting himself physically. Then he would guard the picture, and proceed living his life of eternal youth and beauty (that is, until some day some insects, or rats, or something, decided to eat his canvas... :) )These are for me the mistakes of many writers, and what turns the end of many stories so boring and so unsatisfactory! The first one is that they want to produce a plot and tie all the characters of the story (as though it was necessary, and as though all characters deseverd to be well developed!!). The second is to try to create characters that evolve learning with their mistakes (as if everybody learned with their mistakes and stopped continuing doing them for all their lives!!!).Borrowing the words of Lisa Simpson (in one of those funny, crazy, genial, Simpsons' stories), the moral of Dorian Grays story is that it has no moral!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"All art is quite useless. Or so believed Oscar Wilde, perhaps the foremost member of the Aestheticism movement of the late nineteenth century. Wilde and his followers believed in art for art's sake: he thought his works needed no meaning beyond beauty. The Picture of Dorian Gray achieves some level of philosophical meaning nevertheless, but whether the book is worthy of the label 'genius' is questionable.This novel tells the story of Dorian Gray, a vain young man with a powerful personality. At the beginning of the novel Dorian has a portrait painted by the artist Basil Hallward, and Basil decides never to publish the painting because he put too much of himself into it. Dorian keeps the painting, wishing that its image would grow old while he himself stayed young. Eventually his wish comes true, and his increasingly Epicurean lifestyle causes the painting to rapidly age and grow uglier while Dorian himself stays young and beautiful.Despite its authors claims about art, the novel provides considerable insight into human behavior and the depths of apathy and vanity a man can reach. It is at times horrifying, but at others the writing itself can seem vain. Wilde often seems more concerned with flattering himself through his writing than with producing anything valuable which, of course, is consistent with his aesthetic philosophy, but that hardly benefits the reader, and I at least disagree with Wilde and believe that a work of art with no real value should not be considered art. Strewn throughout the novel are quotable passages which give the impression of intellectual depth but at closer inspection seem to contain little more than vanity: \\"I like persons better than principles, and I like persons with no principles better than anything else in the world.\\" \\"Is insincerity such a terrible thing? I think not. It is merely a method by which we can multiply our personalities.\\"I did enjoy the novel overall and found it insightful, but I think Wilde's writing is generally too selfish, which is a natural result of his philosophy: the core issue is that I disagree with his philosophy and am therefore bound to find at least some fault with the art it produces."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is quite a book. Mr. Wilde has quite a literary ability. His characters are as vibrant as a Van Gogh, his plot is tense, and he has quite a gift for quips and comebacks. All of this combines for a great piece of literature, regardless of the topic or story.This book explores the darker side of humanity, along the lines of Faust, Dr. Jekyll, and Lord of the Flies. We all feel this dread and anxiety deep within our soul; Wilde does not hold a mirror, but a picture for us to look upon and marvel. You get the chills up and own your spine as you watch Lord Henry seduce Dorian Grey.I think the high point of the story was in Chapter XI when Dorian sets a mirror next to the foul picture and goes back and forth looking at his baby-face and then the incubus in the painting. What is crucial is that Dorian is so detached: he sees himself as the smooth-faced god, but in reality, he is the demon in the picture. But his detachment is what is so crucial. He knows what his soul looks like, but he doesn't care!At times this books seems like a play, which has Wilde's native element. But the prose has such a smooth flow that you do not notice. I found myself constantly underlining Wilde's aphorism. He has a gift for one-liners, and his book is quite a charming read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The book is very interesting, although it starts out slow. Provides a gruesome tale of vanity and egoism, a great choice for a book report."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Read this for a book club and really enjoyed Wilde&#8216;s writing style.

Have read it in my teens, 20's 30's 40's 50's and 60's and continue to be thrilled by the eloquence of the writing"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is a true classic that should be read by everyone. It may be fiction, but truth lies within the pages of this book. Oscar Wilde has painted a truly perfect representation of the human species with his character Dorian Gray. A character so full of life that you can't help but be drawn into the book. I was unable to put it down after reading the first page!When you open this book, you are not just reading a story, you are looking into a mirror. You see yourself in Dorian Gray's position as he goes through his trials and tribulations. Regardless of who you are, everyone feels and, at some point, thinks along the line's of Dorian Gray. For some, they may have even traveled down a similar path. It is for this reason that Oscar Wilde was able to create such a realistic character. He created something that people can relate to because each of us has a Dorian Gray within us, at least, to some degree.I don't know if Wilde meant to be so philosophical or psychological with this story, but it is a work of genius. I believe that this book should be part of the required reading material in some age appropriate schools. I doubt that it will, but I feel the character of Dorian Gray and his 'life' would be an eye opener for many.I highly recommend this book to anyone even vaguely curious about it. I honestly cannot understand why this has a single bad rating! If your still not sure after reading the reviews, check with your local library about borrowing it. If you like it, then buy it and save it to read for later. I've re-read mine several times now and have yet to grow bored or tired of it."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Dorian Gray is absurdly good-looking. Utterly infatuated, Basil Hallward captures Dorian's youthful beauty in a portrait.While posing for this portrait, Dorian meets Basil's friend, Lord Henry Wotton, who charmingly preaches hedonism. Lord Henry's efforts to corrupt Dorian work quickly. Convinced that youth and beauty are the only things worth having in life, Dorian looks upon his finished portrait with cruel jealousy. His image will never grow old, but he will.One wish sends the plot of the novel into action: Dorian wishes the portrait would age, while he stays youthful.Enter a lover whose heart Dorian breaks. Her despair coerces her to suicide. With her death on his conscience, he notices an evil glint in the eye of his portrait. Over the years, Basil's painting begins to age. Dorian sabotages reputations and even commits murder, all the while looking as young and beautiful as he did on the day his portrait was painted. However, the portrait-a grotesque reminder of his double life-documents every immoral act.Focusing on duplicity and aestheticism, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a captivating and cinematic tale. Oscar Wilde's knack for dialogue is what made him a famous playwright and parts of Dorian Gray are rich with clever play-like exchanges.Lord Henry's wit is exceptionally tantalizing. But he doesn't seem to take himself too seriously, whereas Dorian adopts everything Lord Henry preaches with the conviction of a Southern Baptist. He's basically just a dumb pretty person that everyone coddles despite the fact that he's a terrible human being.**Side note**The Picture of Dorian Gray is Oscar Wilde's only novel. The book was scandalous when it was released in 1891 because of clear homoerotic undertones. Dorian's lovers are both men and women. Though not overtly sexual, Basil's infatuation with Dorian is questionable. Wilde himself had an affair with Robert Ross."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I read quite a lot and I have not been so entranced by a book in a very long time. I finished it in one day, because I could not put it down. I highly recommend this book, and all other Oscar Wilde works for that matter."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is a Faustian novel, and one of the first ground-breaking pieces of gothic literature along with novels such as \\"The Castle of Otranto\\" by Horace Walpole and \\"The Mysteries of Udolpho\\" by Anne Radcliffe. Based on this merit alone it is worth reading. If you're a connoisseur of literature it's mandatory, and if you're not, it's highly recommendable.It tells of the life of Dorian Gray, who, upon meeting Basil Hallward (his painter's) friend Sir Henry Wotton, begins to fret over the ephemerality of his youth, and makes an involuntary wish for...Well I don't want to ruin it for anyone, so I'll leave that out. Chances are, going in, you know the premise of the novel, but I still don't want to risk a spoiler. Either way, slowly, he starts to lose himself, and the gentleness of his nature, and he is driven to \\"sin\\".It's a good read in many ways. For one it is an easy read, it can be enjoyed whether you are sitting at home or travelling. In another it is thought provoking, you could pull about two hundred quotes out of it and apply them to your daily life (and I'm not exaggerating). And lastly, the story line is gripping.If you're approaching this after experiencing Wilde's plays then I should warn you, there is no comedy here, in fact there is barely even a resemblance to the tone of his plays (although some of the dialogue is fairly similar).Either way, this is a damn good read and I certainly recommend it.If you're interested in gothic literature, this is highly, highly recommended, as are the above titles."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The story is pretty standard. Art comes to life or rather the other way around in this case. Oscar Wilde knew how to write to entertain and this novel is no exception. The characters except Dorian all come off as rather shallow, but I suppose that is the point of the story."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"definitely an interesting book. a classic. would read if you are into classics. quite violent and shocking. i should have seen it coming, but it was still good"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This haunting tale is fraught with discussion points ranging from the \\"curse\\" of beauty to the state of our souls to the consequences of our decisions and actions. Is beauty only skin deep and what happens to the outside of someone who has become hideous inside?With beautiful turns of phrase and provoking insights which will invade your thoughts long after you put the book down, this is a class worth your time."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book is really worth reading! Some classics are just kind of boring, but this one was quite a surprise! I really enjoyed it!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY is one of the most elegant novels in the Gothic canon; that it is also one of the most sinister is hardly surprising given Oscar Wilde's curious aptitude for tempering the macabre with the sensuous and the frivolous with the fatalistic.A considerable scandal upon its publication in the early 1890s, the novel still reads as slightly homoerotic, even if only in the most clandestine and aphotic of ways. Woven through its themes of beauty, decadence, age, and the nature of art is a thread of shimmering doom that becomes more poignant the longer one spends with DORIAN GRAY and the more one considers its relationship with its author.It is a peacock's fan of luminous wit and glimmering color, dripping with venom and smelling of strange perfumes. We are all familiar with the general flavor of things: an innocent and exceptionally beautiful youth has his portrait painted one fateful afternoon; upon viewing the piece, he is paralyzed by the sudden revelation that one day he will be old and hideous while the painting will retain its beauty and life. In a devil's bargain, he wishes that it would be the other way around. And then, under the influence of a particularly deleterious gentleman, Dorian Gray begins to change: his innocence gives way to corruption and his beauty seems apt to languish under the spell of opium, cruelty, and languor. One day Dorian notices that the painting has begun to transform, while he himself retains all the beauty of an innocent despite the ever-swelling ocean of his sins...Few works of literature are as effervescent as DORIAN GRAY and just as few are as utterly pessimistic; that it is capable of fusing remarkably disparate parts into a whole that is absolutely cohesive is a fascinating example of its author's gifts. Like Wilde's SALOME, DORIAN GRAY is as colorful as it is bleak, and even its weaknesses, in context, seem like strengths.Seldom is an artist's most famous work also his most erudite and brilliant: this is one of those works. I have approached it perhaps six or seven times in the last five years, and each reading has left me more enraptured than the last--which is high praise for a novel that relies a great deal on suspense and aesthetic splendour. I consider it one of the finest things I have ever read--daring, sultry, venomous, eloquent, and radiant in its own decay.(From my Gothic fiction blog:[...]"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"My impetus for reading this book, since I read few novels, was a book entitled \\"The Ripper Code\\" by Thomas Toughill. That book's author posed the theory that in writing \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\\" Oscar Wilde was attempting to point the finger of guilt at one of his erstwhile friends, and possible homosexual lovers, as London's \\"Jack the Ripper.\\" This intrigued me, particularly since Wilde's book was published only a year or so after the last of the Ripper murders, and, as Toughill noted, Wilde and his suspect lived only about six miles from the Whitechapel district, where the murders took place, and Wilde clearly chose the date of the last Ripper murder, November 9, 1889, as the date which brought his story to its climax. So, in reading this book, I couldn't help but bear that in mind.After reading this book, it is clear that Wilde based some, if not all, of the main characters in his novel on persons whom he knew and, in all likelihood, on actual conversations he had had with those and other prominent people in London society. And there are certainly clear similarities between at least two of the most prominent characters in his novel and Wilde's friends: namely Dorian Gray, himself, and Wilde's presumed suspect, George Francis \\"Frank\\" Miles, an artist who contracted syphilis and died in 1891 shortly after the final Ripper murder; and Dorian's first love and suicide victim, the young actress Sybyl Vane, and the actress, Lilly Langtree, who Miles and Wilde both knew in her early days and whose career they clearly advanced. Other than that, however, there is little to suggest that Wilde was attempting to point the finger of guilt at Miles or at anyone else.As for the novel itself, I found it to be extremely interesting and hard to put down. I was particularly impressed by the author's apparent insight into human nature, as reflected in some of the ideas expounded on many occasions by Dorian Gray's friend and mentor, Lord Henry Wotton. Some of those passages were rather long, and perhaps a little tedious, but still interesting if one persisted. I consider this to be a classic which most readers would enjoy, but, in my view, Wilde simply drew on his experiences and chose certain events and characters to help sell his book. Frank Miles can rest in peace --- at least for now."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Nothing that can be said of this book will truely do it justice- you must read it to understand it.Some books are so clearly written that when a character voices a thought all you want to do is agree and quote it so others can see what you didn't even know- but have now relized- you were thinking. This book offers rich ideas on everything in life guided by the moral decay of Dorian Gray who's fulfilled wish of youth becomes the means to vices and sins. Meanwhile two friends offer opposing advice- and through it all there is no black and white and moral judgement. Simply a tale of human desires and dissapointments. Though it was written long ago it could have been told today and still ring just as true (perhaps with just alternate form of transportation and letters being sent via e-mail)"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I had to go back and rethink and reread this story, but profoundly moved by how timeless the message seems to be. Modern culture (Hollywood etc...) would benefit from what seems to be the basic MORAL of this story. The more shallow and superficial the pursuits in life, the more corrupt, evil, wicked and proverted one can become. This is a fact, no \\"religious right\\" or anyone else, made it up. Many just turn their backs or ignore the truth. Mr. Wilde himself should have taken a lesson or two from his own story. What a tragedy with his talent to die sick, corrupt, lonely and penniless. At least this classic work came from all the sadness and despair.....too bad.I have often thought that this tale may be one that would be a great stage production/story....Mr. Wilde should have possibly considered it, again............too bad!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"When Oscar Wilde published his only novel back in 1890 he caused much excitement among the literary critics and the society as a whole. And I'm a little bit puzzled because there is no evidence that the book deserves some negative feedback. It seems to me that someone who criticizes the ideas in the novel and summarizes it as an \`immoral' demonstrates high level of hypocrisy. This is art and art is about freedom of imagination and expressing. If we expect from art to represent only moral emotions we experience in our daily life then art wouldn't worth so much.The story of the book is somehow very simple. A young and innocent man named Dorian Gray fascinates an artist so much that the artist finds inspiration even in his only presence. Basil Hallward confides his secret obsession to a friend of his named Lord Henry Wotton and at that very moment Henry decides to meet Dorian. From their meeting on, their relationship is the main point around which the story evolves. Henry is a cynic person who has very provocative and fascinating way of declaring his position for most of the aspects of life. His attitude is uncommon for 19th century London high society and could be characterized as immoral. Dorian gradually adopts the lifestyle Henry proclaims and indulges in taking maximum from the life no matter the cost and no matter who will have to pay for it. On the other hand a rash desire expressed by Doran that the portrait Basil has painted of him ages and Dorian himself stays forever young becomes true. With always innocent look on his beautiful face Dorian is in a very good position to take maximum of his life and he does it. By breaking norms, recognized by high society he ruins lives of most persons attracted and charmed by his beauty and charisma. Lord Henry stays always beside him as a \`spiritual' mentor while Basil goes to the background of Dorian's world. The picture Dorian hides in an abandoned room in his house shows not only marks of aging but also is a mirror of Dorian's soul - everything he does reflects on the picture's face expression which turns to an evil grimace that disgusts Dorian. Finally he comes to a moment that feels sorry for the life he had chosen and decides to make everything possible so that to restore his portrait's humane look as much as possible.The end of the story proved quite an intriguing to me and I feel somehow confident that such an end seems to be the most logical for the story although being drastic and direct in his representation.The writing style of Wilde is of a person who knows very well what he has to say and in the same time you don't get feeling that someone is trying to teach you something. On the contrary - this novel looks like a very good related story. On some moments too much attention is paid to the details, something that represents more successfully the atmosphere of the story but the movement suffers a little bit.I personally am in deep sympathies for Lord Henry's character. His directly stated position on the topic is very often shocking but the interesting part is that you could stay and think a while and take from it what you appreciate. Nothing in this world is completely wrong I think. Just be careful not to fall into blind deviation and become second Dorian Gray."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"With today's slippery morals and exhausting vanity, The Picture of Dorian Gray is an eerie comparison to &quot;then&quot; and now. There are many interesting scenes in the book that make this book very exciting. It is about a man who, upon receiving a portrait of himself, is so upset that it will &quot;mock&quot; him with it's permanent beauty, while he will age and decay. He makes a wish that he will remain young and beautiful and the picture will age and take his sins for him. In the end, though he is beautiful on the outside, he is horrendous on the outside.Definitely a good read for high school students. It's interesting and short, and not as cumbersome as other Romantic novels can be. You can relate it to today's times and it is not a hard read. I did not want to read ANY Romantic novels but I am very happy that I chose this one! And you will be, too!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book offers its readers a chance to understand the meaning of true beauty and the reason why time passes the way that it does. If you enjoy really good quotes that make you think, this is a great book for you. It made me think of ideas and concepts that I had never thought about before. Some reviews of novels say they could &quot;never put the book down.&quot; But what happens when the book is over and it goes on the shelf? I would like to hope that, with this book, the wheels in my head will keep turning, and I will continue to think about the concepts it brought up, and apply it to my own life. I think you will do the same if you read this novel by Oscar Wilde"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde tries to argue in the prologue of this book that literature, as a form of art, is not moralistic and that people therefore should not treat it as such.In all honesty, however, The Picture of Dorian Gray is an extremely moral book; it's just hard to decide what exactly the moral is. The very good and the very bad do not fare that well in this tale of elitist debauchery, while those who go the middle path and avoid both evil and righteousness seem to do quite well. Wilde once said that he wanted to be like Dorian Gray (evil), was perceived by the world as being Lord Henry (moderate), but was actually like Basil Hallward (good). Does this mean that Wilde, by his own moralistic views, was inevitably doomed, regardless of what he tried to be or actually succeeded in being?Anyway, all of this moral stuff is very interesting, but don't fear; the novel isn't terribly philosophical and pretentious. Instead, the book has a by-and-large well-done and consistent plot, and by the end of the novel, when all of these questions of right and wrong are flowing through your head, you can barely recall how on Earth Wilde slipped all that philosophical stuff by you without seeming lofty or ridiculous.I read this book to compete in an essay contest, but I never got around to writing the essay and I'm still glad I read it. A quick and amusing romp through the darkest corners of upper-class 1800s England; recommended."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I absolutely loved the novel written by Oscar Wilde, The Picture Of Dorian Gray. When I was beginning the novel it was a little slow and even a little dry. But, as the plot thickened and the story went on, I can say it is one of my most favorite books ever read. Dorian Gray, the main character, is obsessed with his good looks and his youth. Gray sells his soul for eternal youth and beauty. But his close friend who is an artist paints a portrait of Gray. As the years pass Gray doesn't age but the picture does. His conscious and eternal youth ends up becoming well ........ You'll have to read to find out.People most likely to read and enjoy this novel would probably be late teens and older. Mainly because it has a lot to do with being young and having all the time in the world to do whatever and learn and experience so much. It also is a little bit harder to read for someone younger. I would really recommend this novel to everyone. The story is great and has a little bit of everything in it."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Rod Stewert once sang that &quot;every picture tells a story&quot;, and in no case is this more true than of one Dorian Gray. By now everyone knows that young Dorian makes a childish wish that a beautiful portrait of his should age in his stead, and that he should remain forever young and vibrant, and somehow this wish is granted. What follows is a tale of increasing debauchery and depravity that poison a man's soul, while leaving no visible clue upon his face.This is not the most entertaining or gripping novel that you will ever read. Far from it, in fact, but the real merits of the novel come not from the action and plot, but from the extremely clever dialogue and the shredding social commentary. (not surprisingly, this novel took a long time to get published, and was later used as evidence against Wilde during his trial for indecency) Wilde takes several shots at the aristocracy, especially their values, as well as art itself, hedonism, and the very concept of morality.Perhaps the finest aspect of the novel are Wilde's quotes, often through his favorite mouthpiece: Lord Henry Wotton. Henry serves as a goad to Dorian through all of his excesses, and he waxes philosophical upon almost any subject that he can get anyone to listen to. He's wonderful and horrible all at once, and best of all, he doesn't even believe half of what he says. This is definitely a 'classic' novel, and well worth the read. Again, if you're expecting high paced action you'd probably best look elsewhere, but if you're in the mood to think a bit, then chances are you'll enjoy &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Picture of Dorian Gray is a very sinful, witty, humorous and beautiful book. This has got to be Wilde's most personal work, one can tell from the writing itself that Wilde really put himself into these pages or maybe what he wanted to become. The tale of Dorian and the tale of Wilde have the same kind of \\"tragic ending\\" to it. Wilde's downfall of being accused of homosexuality and Dorian no longer being able to bear the pain of his acts and conducts bring tragic endings to their lives. I think that every person has or has had for a certain amount of time the wish to stay forever young and beautiful, the burden of time not affecting you at all but something else, in Dorian's case, it was the painting, anyways I'm rambling on and on, do read this book, it's 2:00 am right now and I have a Physics exam tomorrow, today actually, anyway, do read it, it's enjoyable, funny, touching and everything else that a good novel should be."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY has enough going for it to retain its classic status for some time to come. It is loaded with epigrammic sentences by a writer who continues to hold interest. Its concept was highly original and has inspired generations of science fiction, fantasy and horror literature since its debut. Wilde stows a lot of his themes and notes on society and character into its pages, so that it often reads like a stack of dispatches from the late 19th century. The dinner party scenes are priceless. It is certainly worth reading in order to understand why Dorian Gray has entered our language, so often alluded to.While possessing the above traits, the novel does have its flaws that are more pronounced under the glare of contemporary light. Wilde's bigotry shows through. Some of the passages are melodramatic and wooden. Dorian Gray's physical beauty is a work of art, and as Wilde says at the outset, all art is useless. However much he embodies many of Wilde's ideas, he remains rather vapid, even when he is at his most corrupt. Part of that is due to the fact that many of the actions that condemn him are only spoken of or hinted at. Mostly we see the highlights, the suicide of a young girl to whom he was unjustly cruel and some subsequent deaths."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Loved this story in school and it just gets better with rereading.

The desire to find a fountain of youth rings as true today as it did in 1890 when the story was first published. Dorian Gray is a young and dashingly handsome man. When he looks at a portrait that was painted of him it stirs up the regrettable fact that he's at the top of his game now and will never look better. He's irritated that the portrait will continue to look the same and in a sense mock him as he ages in real life. What's a man to do? There was no such thing as plastic surgery back then, and Botox was unheard of. Dorian laments: \\"Oh, if it were only the other way! If the picture could change, and I could be always what I am now!\\" Boom. He gets his wish. That brings us to the old adage, be careful what you wish for. Being young and beautiful is wonderful--at first. Many, many years later, it can get tiresome, at least for Dorian. Dorian doesn't know what to do with all that time. He studies many things and that part of the book got a tad tiresome for me. But stick with it, things get better and a lot more interesting. I thought this was a great book.

But now, I see the struggle between good and evil, self-indulgence versus altruism, hedonism versus retraint and self-respect.

What follows is a tragic tale of decadence and hedonism as Dorian Gray succumbs to a lifestyle of excess and debauchery.

Throughout the book, Dorian Gray becomes very popular and attracts all sorts of attention just by waltzing into a room. People find him so innocent and pure, he's alluring (which soons turns sour.) But they don't see his other life. His loathing of the once-beautiful portrait which now displays his age, sins and iniquities. This deep hatred drives him to do many strange things in this dark, twisting tale of morale, age and youth. The book follows Dorian through love, loss, murder, disdain, hurt and ofcourse, happiness.

He proceeds to live his life by indulging himself in episodes of increasing debauchery and immorality, wrecking other people's lives and committing blackmail and even murder, and all the while his portrait bears the physical signs of his aging while his own body remains young and fresh. The novel offers some weighty questions: Would we choose to be immoral if we knew we were immortal? Is an artist's work the manifestation of his own latent immorality? Are the world's imperfections, sins, and shames represented better through art than through reality?As much as I admire Oscar Wilde's great play &quot;The Importance of Being Ernest,&quot; I must admit that I found some faults with this short novel of his. Despite its florid prose and dialogue containing wickedly caustic wit and punchy aphorisms that evoke a time when conversation was an art, the novel has a strangely artificial, stiff tone. With dialogue that sounds like it would have to be rehearsed before spoken and many scene descriptions that seem like stage directions, it often reads like a play that's been converted into a novel. Interior furnishings are described in the meticulous detail of a Sotheby's catalog; a nice touch, but what's the point? This is an intriguing novel that combines elements of gothic horror and social satire, but it is marred by too many moments of unintentional goofiness."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"In London, the well-known artist Basil Hallward meets up with a wealthy young gentleman, Dorian Gray.

In certain parts of the book he starts to show a nervous side of himself. He does this because he is witnessing that a certain picture of someone is changing before his very eyes. Whose picture you're asking, what do think that I'm going to tell you! Stop asking, and read the book already. Anyway, the setting of this book is taking place around the Victorian Times in England. In England there is an art studio in which Basil Hallward, the artist that paints a certain picture, works and spends most of his time. The problem in the story all started when Dorian spoke a &quot;request.&quot; He &quot;requested&quot; that, &quot;Why can't this picture age instead of myself?&quot; Dorian will be scared of what happens after the next few months. One person enjoyed reading the book, and thought that it was great reading. This person loved how the author used vivid details in all his characters, especially Dorian Gray.

Not only do I have much of the book highlighted, but it is worn from reading again and again. I would definitly reccomend this brilliant novel to anyone who wants to walk away with a feeling as if they've discovered a treasure they must share with the world."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Basil Hallward is an artist, who paints a portrait of Dorian Gray, a very good looking and nave young man. The portrait is a masterpiece that in reality depicts Basil's feelings for Dorian, as well as, Dorian's youth and beauty.Lord Henry Wotton, a seductive emotional predator and selfish pleasure seeker, is a friend of Basil who meets Dorian at Basil's house and gives him a philosophical speech about the fading nature of youth and beauty. Dorian whose greatest qualities are his youth and beauty pledges his soul to stay young and beautiful. As part of the deal Dorian Gray's portrait becomes the surrogate for the disgrace and aging of the real Dorian Gray.Under the growing influence of Lord Henry over Dorian, the later embraces Hedonism and increasingly sinks into a sinful corrupt life and shows no regard for values or morals. A tragic event caused by Dorian's behaviors starts the projection of Dorian's ugliness and self -centeredness on the portrait. Dorian creates excuses and excuses himself with lame explanations for the tragedy and hides his portrait so he can't see the hideous transformation of himself reflected in his picture. As long as his beauty remains, he can ignore the changes in his portrait. It's interesting how Dorian tries to avoid his inner feeling of ugliness by trying to surround him self by beauty, and other beautiful distractions such as roses and music.Basil's love for Dorian, which is likely a real life reflection of Wilde's love for Lord Alfred Douglas, causes Basil to defend and protect Dorian, even from his self destructive acts, until the last shocking event. I'm tempted to describe the ending event, but I won't deprive the reader from the pleasure of exploration and discovery.Given the period when this novel was written, Wilde is artistically candid and courageous beyond belief. Wilde displays his usual wit, sarcastic playful ways and funny style, while he walks us through serious dilemmas like the supremacy of youth and beauty, homosexual feelings, repentance and murder. Wilde grabs the reader through the use of shocking events that not only criticize Victorian morality, but ironically displays a moral lesson about vanity and narcissism.\\"The picture of Dorian Gray\\" is a wonderful piece of literature in which the portrait asserts itself as Dorian's conscience in a superficial society that places values on looks and wealth while ignoring the real value of humans. Simply, a one of a kind work."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"If you want a new slant on this classic novel, read 'The Ripper Code' by Thomas Toughill. This is the book which reveals that Oscar Wilde was blackballed by the Oxford Union."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wilde sees the world more clearly than any writer of fiction in the last century. It is for that reason that his work is so filled with countless paradoxes and contradictions that challenge the mind and titillate the senses. Wilde lived in an infinitely ironic age, when society had grown so influential as to crowd out the individuals that made it up. Today, we have taken for granted this incongruity and so our writers cannot express the kind of irony that Wilde mastered, despite the fact that we all know that something is amiss.\`The Picture of Dorian Gray' is filled with this irony. The plot shows us the ultimate irony of a man giving up his soul for the beauty of youth--the condition that is exalted in the modern age above all else, intellect, truth, justice, life itself. Interspersed are dialogues and epigrams that persist one hundred years later as some of the finest word handling ever recorded. Even a few samples should compel the potential reader:\\"The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about.\\"\\"Every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter.\\"\\"A man cannot be too careful in his choice for his enemies.\\"\\"The only difference between a caprice and a life-long passion is that the caprice lasts a little bit longer.\\"\\"Men marry because they are tired, women marry because they are curious. Both are disappointed.\\"\\"I love acting, it is so much more real than life.\\"- \\"I am on the side of the Trojans, they fought for a woman.\\"- \\"They were defeated.\\"The mastery of wit that Wilde displays must be seen in its context. He was a decadent as much as the characters he portrays are. Ultimately, the disillusion that the decadent faces comes through in the story and the reader is left with a very uneasy feeling upon completing \`Dorian Gray.' Is life as absurd as it seems? Is there a solution? Or are we stuck with a life of paradox? Perhaps our current period of decadence will show us an alternative.

Filled with deliciously witty, catty wordplay and bon mots from a day where banter was highly valued, Wilde was skillfully adept at scrutinizing society and all of its flaws. The Picture of Dorian Gray is tragically ahead of its time, its philosophies on aestheticism and art are still relevant today - and will most likely always be. There were a few downsides (as I said, very few), including some dense chapters expelling the virtues, of well, non-virtue. Wilde would swiftly make up for these with delightful conversations taken straight out of the parlors of the age in which he lived. While some of them felt contrived, Dorian's slow decay into hedonism is wonderfully depicted, and the haunting last paragraph of the novel will stick with every reader. The theses the author conveys are spellbinding and dead-on, and the descriptions colored with imagery and allusions referencing Shakespeare and mythology are vivid. Wilde makes one question their own limits and passions, and engages the reader into being an active participant in life and reading."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is a beautiful and witty tale about a depraved man. His ugly soul is mirrored by his ever-changing portrait while he retains his youthful visage. Suspenseful throughout. A classic."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar WildeI have downloaded this ebook and have found it to be the most well thought out in terms of navigation."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde's classic gothic tale of a man who is granted his wish to remain forever young is still a fine and compelling read. Dorian Gray is captured at the height of his physical charms in a painting and soon discovers that the corruption of his body and soul is reflected in the painting while he retains his youthful attractiveness. His life becomes one of increasing debauchery and narcissism.The most quotable of authors, Wilde uses a friend of the young man to deliver an endless collection of axioms and witty observations that add another dimension to the plot.As Gray becomes more convinced of his invincibility he grows more callous toward others and his actions become less human and more monstrous as the story progresses."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Am I no less agreeable?

Dorian teaches me a very important lesson:You can never escape the consequences of evil and regardless of how fortunate you are in some areas of your life, there are always lurking in our souls those moments of shame and regret.I know that the book has many messages about narcissism, beauty, art, conscience, friendship, social classes and other topics, but Dorian's inability to shake his evil actions is what I will remember the most."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wow. This was my first Wilde, and I don't think it will be my last. Another reviewer said that this book was about people doing horrible things, and yet the book was impossible to put down.Nearly everyone knows the story. Dorian Gray wishes that his portrait will show the ravages of time and wickedness while he remains young and beautiful - and he gets his wish. I knew that Dorian's life was going to be ruined - and at times I could predict what was going to happen next. Usually that turns me away from a book. But Wilde's storytelling is so delectable, so riveting that (to use a cliche) it was like watching a train wreck. Terrible to see, but I couldn't look away. I was fascinated.I have heard complaints about the 'flowery' language, but I loved it!Being the overthinker that I am, this book also raised some questions for me: Was Dorian really corrupted by Lord Henry, or did Lord Henry merely show the world Dorian's true hidden nature? Was Basil to blame somehow for painting the portrait? This was probably Wilde's goal - to make us think, and to make us question our hidden nature."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Ever since I got my kindle, I've been downloading free classics and The Picture of Dorian Gray was one of them. I remembered it was an option to read for our British Literature final paper so it caught my eye. I started reading the book knowing absolutely nothing about it and within the first few pages I was caught up in its beautiful writing and witty banter between the characters. It's a great story about how a man basically trades his soul for his youth. Wilde writes about the debauchery that Dorian goes through without being so literal about it, which is probably because he was living during victorian times, but it's great because it lets your imagination wander. He doesn't outright say that Dorian seduces women, gets high, or is bisexual, but you assume all of that from his writing. This is not a story that teaches you to choose the \\"good\\" path in life. It's a story that tells us that if we could be a little hedonistic without consequences we would. I'd love to live Dorian Gray's life for a week to know what it feels like...but then have it erased from my life.The negative reviews were basically that the book is boring. I admit there was this one part of the book where it describes everything that Dorian Gray bought, but it's only for a chapter. Another negative reviewer wrote that this book is full of quotables without substance, and well, I don't think the quotes are a bad thing. It's funny! I personally love reading all types of books, both classic and modern, but the ones that keep me fascinated are the classics. The style of writing is just beautiful."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"It felt longer than the actual (approx) 280 paper pages it is. I skipped over some of Dorian's ranting about 60% through. I've never skimmed like that... Even in Anne of Green Gables.

Nice ending, but I feel like it was a bit abrupt.SIDE NOTE ON TECHNICALLY EBOOK ASPECTS:The chapters are not recognized by Kindle. You cannot advance by chapter as in other books."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Rather impressed as I have never read this one. Although, there are a few typos on the Kindle version."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Though many of us no longer believe in \\"corruptible souls,\\" Oscar Wilde's \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" still holds up as literature and a container of meaning. Though the metaphysics of the novel were likely a mere literary device even in Wilde's day, they nonetheless strike at something deep. Essentially, they ask two perennial questions, \\"what does it mean to be a good person?\\" and \\"How do I know if I'm a good person?\\" Unlike most non-literary mortals, the extremely corruptible (aren't we all?) Dorian Gray has direct empirical evidence of the state of his \\"goodness.\\" He receives, via a Faustian pact sans Faust, a \\"soul mirror\\" from the hapless painter Basil Hallward. As Gray develops from an innocent, almost waifish, youth endowed with irresistible masculine beauty into the Marquis de Sade of the English leisure class, the painting records his increasing dissoluteness. In trade, his physical being retains all the luster of youth and beauty he possessed at 18. This would provide a near irresistible bargain for many twentieth century people, and one wonders at the number of real but metaphorical equivalents of Gray portraits that exist today. But universal belief in a soul, especially as a \\"chalkboard of one's self,\\" has become quaint (even those who believe in a soul probably don't imbue their lives with this belief). Who then, apart from religious adherents, today really worries about \\"damage to the soul\\" in an eschatologically consistent manner that would make Wilde's book blare a meaningful warning signal? Hasn't such thought gone the way of the ether and phlogiston (even though exorcists still dwell among us)? Why read this novel?The simple answer is that \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" remains great literature, though even that concept carries far less weight today than fifty years ago. But if by \\"great literature\\" we mean a story with depth, intrigue, drama and unforgettable characterization then maybe more antennas perk up. Many have also called it a \\"horror story,\\" so perhaps one can subsume it under precursors to Steven King and other morally based modern horror novels? Whatever convenient label one puts on such works, great stories, be they novels, movies, video games, hieroglyphics, songs, dances, buildings, or even a splotch on the sidewalk, teach us something about ourselves. They flip that often neglected \\"introspection switch\\" somewhere in our wiring that supercharges the wonder mechanism. So regardless of the now ancient metaphysics and 19th century ethos of this novel, the telling of such a story as a \\"horror fable\\" still touches that ineffable part of us that strives for \\"goodness,\\" whatever that means. Dorian Gray explores this theme by depicting the abstraction of goodness in visual form that morphs in sympathy with some objective measure of that quality. This in itself summons the creeping question \\"what would my portrait look like?\\" As well as \\"what standards would make my portrait writhing and horrid?\\" The novel suggests, amongst other things, that disregarding the situations of others and focusing selfishly on one's own pleasures makes one corrupt. Sybil Vane's tragic end, arguably the result of Gray's selfish cruelty, produces the portrait's first \\"scrupulous twitch.\\" We still experience these wispy twitches today, with or without a belief in souls. But our increasingly individualistic world throws rationalizations up for any parallel behavior. In a curious twist to the enlightenment-inspired right of \\"pursuit of happiness\\" we suddenly find ourselves morally justifying the destruction of others in the name of principles of \\"individual freedom.\\" This novel seems to eschew such thinking all the way to Gray's macabre and unforgettable death scene. The portrait wasn't so detached from the body after all, it seems. Reducing the book's \\"moral\\" down to a platitude such as \\"selfish hedonism doesn't pay\\" belittles Wilde's achievement. Though really, it says as much but in a beautiful and horrifyingly satisfying way. And it says it in a way that even touches the modern sensibility. Fables can still have impact in an emergent posthumanist era.Another reason to read \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is that, being Wilde's only novel, one can claim to the unknowing that \\"I have read all of Oscar Wilde's novels\\" and come across as quite educated indeed. Of course Wilde was well known for his plays. And the sensibilities of the playwright do appear throughout this short book, with the exception of some long passages of narrative summary in the book's second half. Copious dialogue inhabits large sections, especially when the loquacious Lord Henry Wotton spews his neo-hedonist views. These play a role in Gray's corruption and also suggest a fear of contagious and dangerous ideas. Can ideas corrupt? \\"Dorian Gray\\" seems to say \\"yes.\\" But this novel will not corrupt. It will entertain, being a great story, and it will inspire thinking, because it has substance. And since it spins a great yarn it also has the ability to moralize without the appearance of moralizing. Double bonus. So voluminous reasons exist to pick up and chew at this old tale, either in fiber or electronically. And, finally, if you're going to write only one novel, make it a jaw-dropper. Wilde did."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Beautiful beautiful copy. I was delighted to receive this in the post. It looks like an aged piece of literature--which it is.

It stirred my imagination to desolate and lovely zones that I didn't even know existed in my mind.After reading it , I bought Wilde's Salome, and the frightening overflow of pure desire in both works changed my feelings forever. Wilde was a genuine sensual genius,and how often are these two elements combined?"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wilde's literary genius shows brightly in this captivating story of a young man who decides that the one verity of nature is living life for the pleasure of it. The &quot;new hedonsim,&quot; a philosophy of our own age, illustrates the futility of knowledge and the problems of an orderly society. His doctrines and delightful epigrams continues to enthrall us and is a testament of the novels value as one of the greatest books of the world."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray, was perhaps one of Oscar Wilde's best works. In this story, Dorian Gray is an extraordinarlily good looking man. As he is so beautiful, painters use him as a sitter. One day, as he is looking over a portait of himself he realizes the fragility of his beauty and wishes for portrait of himself to grow old, rather than himself. For this, he would give his soul; and that was exacly what happened.This is no ordinary book. This book is funny and interesting. While reading this book, you will find that it is saturated with Wilde's epigrams and wonderful sense of humor. I admired it quite intensely, just as Wilde has."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"After reading this story of a man who is so caught up in beauty that he ruins his life over it, I took the time to examine my own feelings on many things....Wilde has done it again in this one.I LOVED IT!!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The picture of Dorian Gray is an excellent story that shows how money and beauty not allways lead to happiness. It reflects a wish that many of us have probably made: the permanence of beauty. Dorian Gray is granted a wish so that his beauty remains always but the terrible social conduct effects don't. Do you want to know why this doesn't make him happy? Magnificent ending. Read it"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Still controversial today, Wilde's study of a man's moral distintigration is both richly poetic and ultimately disturbing. The book even resists classification today. Is it part of the Decadence movement or the Symbolist movement?Or is it an experimental novel, fashioned perhaps as a psychological gothic study? More importantly, though, Wilde's creation poses the question: Can a book be poisonous? Gray succumbs to the &quot;evil&quot; influence of Huysmans' book A Rebours. As Wilde as written, &quot;there is no such thing as a moral or immoral book. Books are well written or badly written.&quot; Wilde may have created a well written book, but he also, albeit purposely, created a book when, viewed from its many horizons, can be seen as terrible moral study in the lesson Gray undergoes."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":". . .of what we love about books: superior critical work, excellent physical presentation.

Finally decided to re-read it in English. I was astonished as to how differently I perceived it this time around. Without a question, Wilde is a master of words, but the subject of this book was questionable. It appeared to me, that Wilde was set on pushing his own philosophy and views of life and self onto others, and, as I read it, I found myself rejecting it with every fiber of my being. I was rather surprised to have such a strong reaction to this piece of literature. Would not read again and would not recommend it to others either. Just my two cents."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This may be entirely shallow, but I bought 8 of these books just because I was obsessed with the cover design.....they look so great on the shelf, and I am sure they are good reads too!

My only qualm...the pages are bright white, and I wish they had gone with a more \\"vintage-y\\" look on the inside to match the outside. But I guess they will get that with age ;)"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Normally, I would love a Gothic novel, even if it flaunts conventions and is highlighted by long-winded descriptions of proper gentility. However, The Picture of Dorian Gray gets bogged down with trifles too often, which is distracting. There is an air of stuffiness and superficiality that becomes a little tiresome.Also, there are few redeeming characters in the novel, as the principal ones are nauseating. Take Lord Henry for instance. His long-winded philosophies and monologues dominate a good deal of the book; rather than adding much to the story, they become heavy-handed, like a point is being shoved in our face too often. And, then there is Dorian. So overdramatic and high-maintenance. Everything revolves around him and his precious little world. I get that he is supposed to be vain and materialistic, but there's little sympathy for him at all, especially when you realize he's more about forgetting his sins than actually repenting them. I realize that Wilde is philosophizing through his characters and the plot, but the means with which he goes about this is tedious.Still, there are redeeming aspects to the novel. Wilde does give us a moral to take away from the reading experience, as the Faustian angle of selling one's soul for beauty becomes apparent in Dorian's life. As Dorian ultimately chooses vanity over spirit and conscience, he sets the wheels of fate in motion. With devil in disguise Lord Henry egging him on, he gradually sees the portrait embody his tarnished soul: vanity, pleasures, sins. Wilde does give the book a very Gothic vibe. Dorian's portrait almost seems alive with grotesqueness, something horrible and monstrous hiding behind that sneer.While I did enjoy the Gothic aspects and the moral to Wilde's novel, I didn't like this novel as much as others."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I've only just started reading the book but so far I've enjoying what I've read of it to this point."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I ordered this book some months ago for my love, and it arrived quickly and was in phenomenal shape; exactly as the description stated, and was priced very fairly."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Only read three pages.

Like most of his works this novel is few in characters, but copious in themes. The novel captures the ideals of aestheticism or \\"beauty for beauty's sake\\", a philosophy for which Wilde was a spokes person and prominent proponent. He used this novel as an opportunity to combine the elements of aestheticism with his observations of larger social themes of the era and really define his philosophy as it pertained to society. As part of the observed social themes, the novel incorporates Wilde's refined ideas relating to the supremacy of art and society's view upon decadence, duplicity, and beauty. Yet despite Wilde's attempt to bring focus to his ideas of aestheticism his novel serves as juxtaposition to his ideals if not the exact opposite.Aestheticism was a movement that sought to free art of the restricting responsibility of having a meaning and also of being moral or immoral. Wilde was under the impression that art, of all forms, need serve no purpose but be beautiful. In his novel Wilde uses two prominent symbols of these ideas: the picture which represents beauty and the unnamed yellow book that served as a symbol that literature also needed to moral restrictions. Though his intentions may have been to advance his own ideas, this novel serves to counter that for despite the idea that art have no purpose this novel gives a purpose to both of the aforementioned symbols. The picture is transformed into a mirror of sorts and through this mirror the world can see the corruption and age that Dorian's physical self has been spared. Wilde created the idea that Dorian's portrait became a portal into which he could look and see the nature of his soul and its transformation as his actions corrupted it. The novel itself may have escaped morality but served as a guide to which Dorian became corrupt. Therefore the novel served the purpose of being the catalyst causing Dorian's corruption. This simply proves that although it is possible to subvert and avoid moral restrictions everything can be interpreted to serve a purpose and thus nothing can escape having a purpose.The primary principle of aestheticism is the importance placed upon beauty to which Wilde ties this in with the superficiality of society. Throughout the novel Dorian is influenced by the philosophy of Lord Henry, who believes that beauty and the senses are the most important values, and beauty reigns for most of the novel. Wilde writes of how society places such high a value on beauty and refers to it as the most valuable of commodities for it is soon to be lost. The idea is that beauty is the only thing of importance. For throughout the novel Dorian is treated the same by the company he keeps despite his ethics. This is a clear representation of aestheticism in which beauty need have no relation to ethics. Wilde juxtaposes this idea with that of another character who believes that the price is too high. The way in which Dorian meets his doom confirms this second idea, for he gives his soul. However, at the end of the novel beauty is still held to the upmost of importance which again refers to the both the value of beauty and society's superficial nature. Yet the reader comes away feeling that beauty is something dangerous to value so highly, as is apparent by the demise of the model of beauty, Dorian Gray.Wilde may have intended for his novel to further his own philosophy however, The Picture of Dorian Gray, does the exact opposite. Wilde effectively illustrated both the flaws in a society that valued beauty so highly and the flaws in his own philosophy."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I got this free for my iPad and I enjoyed reading it.

I think this is one of the few times I would say see the film first and then read the book. The book alone is not the best showcase for the genius of Oscar Wilde. would love to give this a five star review because I am a great fan of Oscar Wilde from his well known works to De Profundis, but the inconsistancy of this story made it difficult to get into. The first half is a way for Wilde's wit, unfortunately at the expense of story line and character developement, although I should that for me the wit of Oscar Wilde was reason enough to keep me reading.

My experience is that school actually demotivates people from wanting to read. How many of us can relate with the feelings of never wanting to read another book after high school. When grades are the motivation to read, people search for the cliff notes and or look for reviews in Encyclopedias. In my High School English class, grades were given on the basis of how many books one read. If you read 8-10 you received an A. The problem was that after knowing one was going to get an A, all reading stopped. Reading is supposed to be done for the joy of it. I hear the word boring used a great deal when reviewing a book. I know so many kids who end up hating reading because they received a poor grade. The classics are challenging books. I would never use boring as an adjective to describe a book however."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I feel sad that I couldn't give this book more than two stars.

When I realized I was wasting my time I moved on."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This sophisticated but crude novel is the story of man's eternal desire for perennial youth, of our vanity and frivolity, of the dangers of messing with the laws of life. Just like &quot;Faust&quot; and &quot;The immortal&quot; by Borges.Dorian Gray is beautiful and irresistible. He is a socialit&eacute; with a high ego and superficial thinking. When his friend Basil Hallward paints his portrait, Gray expresses his wish that he could stay forever as young and charming as the portrait. The wish comes true.Allured by his depraved friend Henry Wotton, perhaps the best character of the book, Gray jumps into a life of utter pervertion and sin. But, every time he sins, the portrait gets older, while Gray stays young and healthy. His life turns into a maelstrom of sex, lies, murder and crime. Some day he will want to cancel the deal and be normal again. But Fate has other plans.Wilde, a man of the world who vaguely resembles Gray, wrote this masterpiece with a great but dark sense of humor, saying every thing he has to say. It is an ironic view of vanity, of superflous desires. Gray is a man destroyed by his very beauty, to whom an unknown magical power gave the chance to contemplate in his own portrait all the vices that his looks and the world put in his hands. Love becomes carnal lust; passion becomes crime. The characters and the scenes are perfect. Wilde's wit and sarcasm come in full splendor to tell us that the world is dangerous for the soul, when its rules are not followed. But, and it's a big but, it is not a moralizing story. Wilde was not the man to do that. It is a fierce and unrepressed exposition of all the ugly side of us humans, when unchecked by nature. To be rich, beautiful and eternally young is a sure way to hell. And the writing makes it a classical novel. Come go with Wotton and Wilde to the theater, and then to an orgy. You'll wish you age peacefully."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I first was introduced to Dorian Gray through a book club, and I thought 'Oh no, Oscar Wilde, here I go, another hard to read boring society book&quot;. I was wrong. Within the first two chapters of Dorian Gray I was intrigued and fascinated. This book deals with several issues that are as important now as they are today: the way our culture worships beauty and youth, an admiration that boarders on homosexual love, virtues, the differences between men and women, and what art is and what makes it truly art. Dorian Gray is a beautiful young man, who sees a portrait of himself and says &quot;How sad it is! I shall grow old, and horrible, and dreadful. But this picture will remain always young...If only it were the other way! If it were I who was to be always young, and the portrait to grow old...I would give my soul for that!&quot; The book takes off from there, leading you from a small theater to great parties. While younger readers may find some of the wording as tough as an old gym shoe, anyone older than 13 with an interest in mystery, romance, and how society runs, will find this a pleasurable and haunting read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is a mesmerizing read dominated by two amazing personalities. Dorian Gray is certainly interesting, but I was much more impressed by his friend and mentor Lord Henry Wotton. Dorian is a perfectly nice, well-meaning young man when we first meet him in the studio of the painter Basil Hallward. Hallward in fact is so drawn to the youth that he draws his greatest inspiration from painting him and just being with him. It is the influence of Hallward's friend Lord Henry which leads to Gray's downfall. There are few characters in literature as decadent, witty, and somehow enchanting as Lord Henry. He is never at a loss for words, fatalistic observations of life and people, sarcastic philosophical musings, and brilliantly devious ideas. Among his world of social decadents and artistic do-nothings, his charm remains redoubtable and highly sought-after. Gray immediately falls under his spell, soon devoting himself to living life to its fullest and enjoying his youth and beauty to the utmost. He solemnly wishes that he could remain young and beautiful forever, that Hallward's exquisite picture of him should bear the marks of age and debauchery rather than himself. To his surprise and ultimate horror, he finds his wish fulfilled. Small lines and creases first appear in the portrait, but after he cruelly breaks the heart of an unfortunate young actress who then takes her own life, the first real signs of horror and blood manifest themselves on his portrait. His love for the ill-fated Sibyl Vane is a sordid, heartbreaking tale, and it marks the culmination of his descent into debauchery. He frequents opium dens and houses of ill repute, justifying all of his worst actions to himself, while the influence of Lord Henry continues to work its black magic on his soul. He hides his increasingly grotesque portrait away in an upstairs room, sometimes going up to stare at it and take pleasure in the fact that it rather than he bears the stains of his iniquities. In time, his obsession with his secret grows, and he is constantly afraid that it will be discovered by someone. For eighteen years he lives in this manner, moving among the members of his society as a revered figure who magically retains his youth, but eventually he begins to see himself as he really is and to curse the portrait, blaming its magic for his miserable life of ill-begotten pleasures and loss of moral character. The final pages are well-written, and the climax is eminently satisfying.Exhibiting the undeniable influence of the French Decadence movement of the late 19th century, this wonderful novel serves as a morality play of sorts. One can understand why its unique nature upset a British society emerging from the social constraints of Victorianism, but this reader is hard pressed to see why this novel proved so damaging to Wilde's eventual imprisonment and punishment. Dorian Gray is no hero, nor does his ultimate internal struggles and yearnings for rebirth inspire one to engage in the sort of life he himself eventually came to regret. The only \\"dangerous\\" character in this novel is Lord Henry; his delight in working his evil influence on others as a type of moral experiment and the silver-tongued charm he exploits to aid him in such misbegotten quests have the potential to do harm to a vulnerable mind such as that of Dorian Gray. Lord Henry's evil genius makes him much more interesting than his disciple Dorian Gray. By today's standards, this book is not shocking, and indeed it is much more dangerous to censor work such as this than it is to read it. This book in eminently quotable, and it still manages to cast a magical spell over readers of this day and age. Quite simply, The Picture of Dorian Gray deserves a place on the shelf of the world's greatest literature."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"What made Oscar Wild(e)?The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press has published a new edition of Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray. While there is no burning need for such a volume in the day of Lady Gaga and marriage equality, it's important to remember that Wilde spent two years in prison for being gay and for having the guts (stupidity?) to flaunt his sexuality. In many ways, it was the flaunting rather than the act themselves that so angered his persecutors.And Dorian Gray, his first and only novel, was certainly a shot fired directly into the heart of Victorian prudery.And in this day of Kindles, e-books and tweets, this is truly a magnificent job of bookmaking. Oversized, lavishly illustrated and gorgeously presented, Oscar would have loved it. The text is examined minutely, with a variety of comparisons from various publications of the novel, as well as Wilde's original manuscript. While there's nothing particularly new to discover in the emendations from the sources, merely a reinforcement of the outrageousness inherent in the piece, the scholarship is both astounding and informative.The annotator and editor, Nicholas Frankel, easily and effortlessly places the modern reader in Wilde's time and place, London's late Victorian Age in London. There is still a tingle to Dorian's story of endless debauchery while he remains looking pure and innocent for decades and the painting ages and grows monstrous, reflecting his sins and crimes.Strangely, the book seems more modern than one would imagine. Rather than merely a potboiler from two centuries back, WIlde's genius imbues the story with a strange and haunting immediacy, and a cautionary tale for us all: Be careful what you wish for.One could hardly wish for a more beautifully accoutered book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Is your soul a good bargaining chip for perpetual youth and beauty? Young Dorian Gray was led to believe so and impulsively struck that bargain. \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is the story of his decline into depravity following that ill-advised trade-off. The story is well-known in popular culture. An artist becomes obsessed with his young model's attractiveness. He and his jaded friend compete for influence over the young man. The friend corrupts young Dorian, encourages him to embrace a life of sensual pleasure and to prize his own beauty. Dorian exclaims that he resents the portrait because IT will keep the freshness of youth -- then the fateful words, that he would give his soul if the picture could decay instead of his own face and body.Be careful what you wish for! Over the next twenty years Dorian sinks into the depths of moral slime and watches the hidden portrait show all the signs of that immorality, while his own face and figure keep the blush of youth.Along with the adulation of youth and beauty, Oscar Wilde delves into the theme of art as morally neutral, a principle of the aesthetic school of thought. Can art be moral or immoral? Should it teach us, improve us? That was the common 19th century view but the school of aestheticism believed that the arts had no role in moral enlightenment. The preface of the book lays out this theme in a series of proclamations.The entire book, like all of Wilde's work, is packed with \\"sound bites.\\" The corrupting friend, Lord Henry Wotton, is particularly prone to Polonius-like declamations, and Dorian tells him, \\"You cut life to pieces with your epigrams!\\" In fact Wilde does that, ripping into polite society and the opium dens of London alike.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is Oscar Wilde's only published novel. It first appeared in a magazine in 1890 as a shorter work, and was later expanded and edited to remove some of the more blatant homosexual references. His writing is exquisite, his themes repugnant but (dare I say it?) edifying. \\"What does it profit a man ...\\"Highly recommended as a true classic of modern literature. I read this book when I was young and thought I understood it. Now that I'm not so young, I'm sure that I don't.NOTE: I listened to this book on CD, not tape, but I chose this product link because it's the same production. The Brilliance Audio Library Edition, read by Michael Page, was incomparably presented and added a great deal to my enjoyment of this absorbing book.Linda Bulger, 2008"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book contains the story 'The Picture of Dorian Gray' - in original typescript form. This is the way Oscar Wilde wanted the novel to actually read before the publishers got hold of it. There are two other versions of the novel out there - the version printed for magazine publication & the one printed in novel form. After the publishers got hold of the manuscript a lot of changes were made because of content - the homoerotic element was toned down. The novel version is also longer - Wilde expanded the story. There are pictures, illustrations, & extensive notes included to explain all the changes. It's very interesting to see a version in print that is how Wilde intended it. If you are a fan of Oscar Wilde's works or of Dorian Gray in particular, you will appreciate having this book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Basil Harwood talks to his friend, Lord Henry Wotton, about his latest painting, a portrait of a striking young man named Dorian Gray to whom he has taken quite a fancy. He feels that his art has never been alive as it has since meeting this young man. Intrigued at his friends acute interest, Lord Henry determines to meet the young man himself, and quite by chance, manages to remain in the studio as Dorian arrives and stands for the finishing touches to his portrait.Once it is completed, Lord Henry comments on how youthful the painting is, remarking how unfortunate it is that the portrait will always remain as young as on the day it was painted, whereas Dorian will slowly age, losing his youth and looks to time. Dorian frets over this and says that he would give anything if only his portrait would age instead of him.Weeks later, after an unfortunate scene with his fianc&eacute;e, Dorian notices a subtle change to his portrait, a certain cruel turn of the lips. As the days pass, he notices more changes and begins to realize that he can commit every vice and cruelty imaginable without any harm coming to him. His portrait will bear the brunt of his adventures. But at what price? As the years pass, he begins to wonder about the state of his very soul and if he can change, perhaps bring the portrait back to its original beauty.This is a great novel, dealing for the most part with man's quest for eternal youth. Who wouldn't want to stay young forever? We go through fad diets, gyms, botox, plastic surgery -- all in the name of trying to remain healthy and youthful. Dorian is given a unique opportunity, the consequences of which show him the havoc that all the vices and cruel acts have upon his soul (or his conscience). We also get to see how getting what you wish for doesn't always turn out the way you thought it would.It's a well-written story, full of unique characters. The majority of the male characters seem to have no problem whatsoever having intimate relationships with other men. By his actions, Basil appears to be in love with Dorian. Dorian, in turn, is infatuated with Lord Henry, even thought both of them do have relationships with women (for Dorian, a fianc&eacute;e; for Lord Henry, a wife). There's even a bit of jealousy on the part of Lord Henry's wife when she finally meets the man who's been monopolizing her husband's time.At times, though, it does move slowly due to long passages discussing the place of art in society and philosphizing about the quest for youth and beauty. In these passages the text seems to turn more into a lecture rather than a novel. That, however, does not take away from the enjoyment of the novel."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"While Oscar Wilde's central theme of corruption initially captures the readers attention, the character development does not help to hold the reader's attention for a long period of time. Dorian Gray, the central character, has the potential to be a very romantic and dumbfounding character, but because Wilde does not go into great character development, he seems almost more like the painting that comes to represent him ... dimensionless. The point of the novel is to point out how changed Dorian becomes over the years and how he goes from being the epitome of beauty to someone that is hardly recognized as the person he once was. However, in order to feel this transformation, the reader would need to feel as if he or she knew the original Dorian Gray. Because the beginning of the novel does not describe him enough, the full effect of Dorian's startling transformation is unable to be fully comprehended.In addition, although the theme of outer beauty coupled with inner corruption is a strong one, this book seems more like one that should be read in a class and discussed in groups. It is not a novel that is easy-reading for pleasure. The style of writing makes it hard to breeze through the book, although on the positive the book brings about much self-contemplation and is very thought provoking. The reader cannot put it down because the whole novel leads to the very disturbing, although somewhat predictable, ending.In general, it is a book that should be read and will be enjoyed by many. The reader can relate to the feelings felt by the main characters and the themes in the book are ones that can be witnessed in real life. The general faults of the novel are eventually outweighed by the suspense and the intrigue as the painting of Dorian Gray, once a masterpiece, becomes more defiled with each horrible act committed by Dorian."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Basil, who up until now was a mediocre painter after meeting Dorian Gray a young Adonis, was inspired to create a masterpiece of which he puts himself into. Against Basil's wishes, Basil's friend Lord Henry influences Dorian Gray.

He falls in love with a beautiful young actor who is every woman that Shakespeare ever wrote about. Once again, due to Lord Henry's influence, he realizes that she's just a common girl.Starting with absent-minded acts Dorian slowly sinks into debauchery. Moreover, with every new act his picture becomes more grotesque while Dorian stays is young and as innocent looking as the day his picture was painted.What will become of Dorian?What will become of Dorian's painting?What would you do if you were Dorian?Oscar Wilde paints a picture himself as he describes Dorian Gray's dilemma. In addition, we as readers travel with Dorian as each decision is made. In some places in the story, Oscar Wilde seems to drag on and on with detail; however we find that this detail is necessary to set the next scene.Oscar Wilde himself led a risky life that lead to a jail sentence; is attitudes can be seen in the dialogues in this book.The Picture of Dorian Gray Starring: George Sanders, Hurd Hatfield"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"After reading some of the contemporary reviews of this book, I was more than a little curious to see how awful this book really was. I was skeptical that it could be bad, because I'm very familiar with the wit of Wilde. As far as gothic novels go, this book ranks high in the Victorian era. Looking back from a historical perspective, I can see why the critics of the time disliked it. But from today's perspective, it is nothing short of brilliant. Wilde weaves a story like few authors could ever dream of doing, and of course his wit is played out beautifully in this book as well. full of quips and quirks, this book is a must read for anybody who has a love of sharp, intelligent writing."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde's \\"Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is an entertaining, short novel, with a very honest moral to it. A friend of Dorian Gray, Basil Hayward, paints a picture of Dorian which the painting's subject falls in love with. Dorian wishes that he could remain as beautiful as the picture and that the picture may take on the effects of human aging in his stead. In Wilde's creative twist, Dorian's wish comes true, although this only becomes evident to him as his life becomes increasingly chaotic. As the novel progresses, Dorian, in obsessive love with himself, fights to keep his sanity as the burden of his stress, sins, and guilt, are transfered to the picture which increasingly haunts him.Wilde's writing is colorful and his characters' emotions realistic. This novel is a cutting, yet accurate, observation of human nature in general, especially in our modern, self-glorifying societies. Wilde makes the perfect critique of our selfishness and vanity when Dorian Gray says: \\"There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about.\\" For many in our TV and Hollywood crazed world, this statement is not troublesome but rather, a personal mantra."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I had really high expectations for this novel, which were not fulfilled. The novel consists of mostly &quot;mindless&quot; dialogue and the true story does not really occur until the book is half over. then the story picks up pace until Dorian's descriptions of a book (totally unrelated to the rest of the novel) drag on. Once that portion of the book concludes, the end briskly approaches. Overall, I think I was expecting a more emotional response to this, which never occured."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is a fine piece of literature- a tale of excess, of corruption, of decay and of facades.Basil Hallward, an artist, paints a picture of Dorian Gary, a handsome and vain young man, whom the artist is besotted with. Dorian Gray sells his soul for eternal youth, in a Faustian bargain, whereby all the age , decay corruption will show in the picture , while Grey's appearance will stay eternally young and fresh.Encouraged by the hedonistic cynic Lord Henry Wotton, Gray embarks on a life of corruption, decadence and cruelty. Lord Henry is also the vehicle through which Wilde put down his many uniquely Wildesque epigrams into the novel, such as \\" Conscience and cowardice are really the same thing, Basil. Conscience is the trade name of the firm. That is all\\"; \\" Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love. It is the faithless who know love's tragedies\\"; \\"There is only one thing worse than being talked about and that is not being talked about\\" ; \\"The only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it.\\" ; \\" It is better to be beautiful than to be good. But it is better to be good than to be ugly.\\" And \\" As for the virtuous poor , one can pity them of course , but one cannot possibly admire them\\".The bargain made by Gray can only lead to eventual destruction , and the novel is a statement by Wilde on humanity and society , in the cavalier and irreverent way that only Wilde could."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This story about a man whose wish for eternal youth comes true through a portrait of himself delves into numerous philosophical nether regions. Set in upscale 19th century London, The Picture of Dorian Gray deals with such topics as truth, death, and most especially beauty.Dorian Gray's portrait ages while he remains his youthful self. Gray uses this to his advantage (let's be honest, who wouldn't?). Gray breaks hearts, corrupts others, and avails himself of numerous vices...most notably opium. Gray also takes advantage of his youth by learning new things...music and gemology come to mind. But Gray's self-enhancement does not make up for the copious sins he commits, both large and small...and even though his face does not bely his crimes, the portrait's face does.Wilde's play on eternal youth was almost certainly novel for the time. These days the concept has been played out time again. But I do not begrudge Wilde for this...in his time, he was an innovator.Four major things irked me about this book:First, the prose is overly flowery. I don't read many books written in the 19th century...maybe most of the books were written like this. Second, Wilde seems to use this book as a platform to give us his take on philosophical issues large and small. True, most good works of fiction are a reflection of the society in which the author lives, but Wilde is NOT subtle about giving us numerous opinions on art, love, life, beauty, etc. I think he could have been a bit more subtle doing this. Third most of characters seemed overly naive. Granted, this story is supposed to be set in a time and place where the rich did not concern themselves with trivial matters. Nonetheless...so much was going on under the characters' noses! Even, Henry Wotton -- Gray's longtime friend -- seems to come down with a bout of extreme naivete toward the end of the book. Somehow, this made the characters seem shallower than they otherwise might have been. And my final gripe kind of ties in with the characters' overall naivete. From the time that Dorian Gray is granted eternal youth by whatever powers that be, to the end of the book, nearly two decades elapse. There is only one, very minor, mention of Gray's youthful looks toward the end of the book. Didn't anyone notice that this guy has, supposedly, aged nearly twenty years and yet still appears as youthful as ever? Come on, even these days with plastic surgery and $100+ cosmetic cream, a 40 year old doesn't look half his age. Why did only Gray's closest friend only offhandedly mention this toward the end of the book? Surely someone else must have noticed?Wilde's concept had a lot of potential, and it certainly does make one ponder life's intangible mysteries, but Wilde spent to much time proselytizing his 19th century philosophy for this book to really stand out. This book is only recommended to those who enjoy Wilde's other works."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I do not know words to describe the way I feel about this book. The first time, with the exception of one chapter, I could not put it down. I have been hooked on Oscar Wilde since. I researched the period and wrote a term paper on this book alone, and after that, when I still was not satisfied, bought his complete works, a book of quotations, and a book about his plays. I only wish by byeing these books I could understand and be swallowed into the beauty of his wisdom. I can sometimes be an obsessive person, and I suppose this is how my review sounds at this point, but don't let your opinion of me detract you from interest in this book.It's worth giving a try...you may become hooked too (by the way for Wilde fans..the movie WILDE is a great window into his life). This book is written with beauty and the words flow like poetry...warning though...people with closed minds towards homosexuality should think of choosing a different book. One of the most descriptive and hiddenly believable parts of this book is the secret feelings Lord Henry has for Dorean. I don't want to misinterpret the book, but i believe Lord Henry's feelings to be more than fatherly...great excelent story!! my favorite book!! what more can be said???-SArah"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is just a warning to prospective kindle customers - the kindle version of this book is not \\"lavishly illustrated\\" which is not so surprising in a digital edition. But what was more surprising to me, Nicholas Frankel's extensive notes, which run alongside the text and which exceed the actual length of the novel itself, are not included. In fact, both the paperback and kindle editions are 'reader's editions'. Yes, there are two rich scholarly introductions, replete with notes, and some three pages of notes to the actual text (which are also included in the hardback) , but the \\"annotations\\" which have excited so much comment from reviewers are in fact missing from the kindle edition. There was no warning from Amazon that the kindle edition omits the textual notes that run side by side with the text in the hardback. However, when I pointed this out to Amazon, 'they' very generously offered me a certificate for the amount of the book on my next purchase. So that was very nice.In fact Stonewall Riot Press has a complete, uncensored \\"reader's\\" edition on Amazon for 9.19. The editor himself, JOHN MCARTHUR, praises Nicholas Frankel's annotations:\\"I was already at work on my edition of the text when I received my copy of Nicholas Frankel's P-book edition published in 2011 by Harvard University Press. Though I was somewhat dismayed at having been scooped, I could only admire the quality and thoroughness of Professor Frankel's scholarship.

I am in LOVE with this story. The way Wilde writes is fabulous- I am an increasingly voracious reader of the classics, and Wilde's writing style is exactly what I like. It is written in the eloquent verbage of the time, but not so much so that I find it stifling and hard to get through ( I am currently reading an Emily Bronte, and am having this problem). The story itself is charming and devious, with an ending that you expect and yet are shocked by.

Like a lot of free public domain ebooks, this one isn't exactly user-friendly. The lack of a title page doesn't bother me, but this book is also missing a table of contents. If you're reading this for a class or a reading group, that missing table of contents might be a deal breaker. Additionally, while you can always refer to line numbers, this book lacks pagination. Again: I realize this isn't something that's going to bother everyone, but if you need to refer to page numbers in an essay, you might be in trouble if you use this copy.If you're like me and you're interested in reading this book just for fun, page numbers and a table of contents probably don't matter much to you. However, I think everyone can agree that things like page breaks and proper spacing between chapters vastly improve one's reading experience. That's the real rub: There are none. Paragraphs sit immediately atop one another like a great wall of text. Chapters receive the same treatment and are only demarcated by plain text- no bolding, no new section, nothing. The whole effect is not only visually unappealing, but just plain annoying.So the layout of this Kindle edition isn't great, but this book isn't all bad. For one thing, it's free. You get what you pay for formatting-wise, but it's a fantastic story and it's yours forever at absolutely no cost. Plus- and this is also big- this ebook isn't riddled with spelling errors and typos like a lot of the other public domain books available on the Kindle.

The soft cover is 176 pages in length.Maybe one of Wildes' most famous works. An increasingly macabre tale set in London, England during the 19th century.Most are familiar with the plot behind this book...but some *SPOILERS* ahead for those that don't want to know.A most handsome young man has a most lifelike portrait done of himself by a up and coming young London painter. In his youthful exuberance over the detail and beauty of the work, he casually remarks that he'd give his soul to remain young and beautiful, like in the painting, forever.His curse is that he stays young while his friends age and the face and body in the portrait grows old through the years. But the portrait does more than just grow old, it reflects every bad or evil thing he's done (using his beautiful looks to gain unfair advantage); resulting in a framed visage that becomes more grotesque and ugly with every new sin he commits.*END SPOILERS*Beautifully written, with great descriptive detail (maybe at times, a little too much).

Although a beatiful young man, Dorian finds that his debauchery and sin are not reflected by the state of his own body, but by the image cast in a painting. As Dorian continues his decline in morals, an interesting question arises. Kind of a \\"which came first, the chicken or the egg\\" type of thing. Was his soul corrupted by his lack of consequences for his mistakes? Or did the freedom merely let him unleash the evil that already poisoned his soul?"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"One of the great joys of fiction is the positive encouragement to discard the intentions of the author and draw out individual meaning from its pages. This positive fruition is exemplified quite extraordinarily by Oscar Wilde in \`The Picture of Dorian Gray', as he weaves a tale of youth, corruption and disregarding hedonism.The protagonist of the story is the youthful and worldly-naive Dorian Gray who, through enticement by his mentor, pledges himself to eternal youth. His wish is sanctioned and the ravishes of age are transferred onto a portrait. Knowing that his appearance will remain forever innocent, he embarks on a pursuit of reckless pleasures, spiralling further into iniquity yet remaining unchanged, whilst his picture grows grotesquely disfigured...The novel was--and to an extent, still is--controversial due to the unsubtle suggestions of homoeroticism. Personally, I don't see the fuss. Partially for obvious reasons, but I also remain unconvinced that it is presented in such a way to have ever been an encouragement for others to embrace such a 'lifestyle'. Rather, it would appear that Dorian's sexual exploits with the same gender is a method to achieving his goal of ecstatic delectation; the goal which, in the end, is his destruction. But, of course, considering Wilde's own sexual practices, one could read it as a defence of those with same-sex attractions.Ultimately, I understood this novel to be a warning against unchecked desire and the pursuit of pleasure without limits; certainly an apt lesson for our own age."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book was truly one of the jewels filled with beauty that will never fade with time.

It is inconcievable to think that Wilde was denounced for this book being immoral as it is really quite moral, considering the consequences of Dorian's behaviour.

When Dorian's friend Basil paints a portrait of him, Dorian exclaims that he wished the portrait got old instead of him.This comes true and under further tutelage of Lord Henry, Dorian lives a life of debauchery, hedonism and the like while the portrait bears his age and sin, becoming more malformed with each act. The book is full of philosophical digressions on sin, beauty and indulgence and its most fabulous aspect is the fact that it is (or as least I think) both an ode to hedonism and an allegory against it all in one, all perfectly blended, all achieved through the medium of the witty writing of Wilde."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"No one really impresses me when it comes to Literature.

This is a time where the most important thing is preserving a good appearance. Sin is thought of as merely an adventure and the past is only a forgotten bother. The life of Dorian Gray is a race to see who will win his young mind and form it into his being. A most handsome boy, he never had much opinion and was content just to sit and be painted. Basil Hallward loves him for his features. Basil also was in love with the inspiration he felt whenever he was painting Dorian or whenever Dorian was near. Basil thought of finding beauty and living only through art, but none of this was appealing to the impressionable Dorian Gray.Upon meeting Dorian Gray, Lord Henry Wotton becomes completely intrigued. A man who loves nothing more than observing the behavior of human beings and implanting his ideas into anyone who will listen is quite a companion. Where many do not agree with his words, Dorian couldn't agree more with him. As days and years pass, Dorian is shaped into the perfect being that Lord Henry has only begun to imagine.Where there is beauty, worship, and incorrect influence there is flaw. There is hatred, there is jealousy, and there is corruption. Dorian has the strong belief that everyone will love him and he will forever be preserved the angel of time. To himself he is everything, but to everyone he is bad luck. His ideals, taken from Lord Henry, seep into the minds of others and cause them to fall. Precisely because of these beliefs he would never understand he was wrong.With the horror of the ego and the love of oneself there is no clear path again to the light. This is Dorian's story, his desperation, his trials, his losses, this, good people, is his soul.Lovers of philosophy and gothic idealism will find nothing to hate in The Picture of Dorian Gray. I am still baffled by many of the perspectives created and endorsed by Lord Henry. Though there are undoubtedly sections that could put a hyper person to sleep, this book is filled with so much philosophy and plot twists that it is worth the read despite the at times slow plot.

Mostly because it was the one book that Oscar Wilde wrote and it express a philosophy of the time in a fictional setting in a very unique fashion. The covert homosexuality is clear, for my personal taste, tolerable. It was an important part of his life. Also, the price was right: free."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was the only novel written by Oscar Wilde. The basic idea behind it is well-known even to those who have never read the book or seen any of various film adaptations. A beautiful young man named Dorian Gray possesses a portrait of himself, painted by his friend Basil Hallward. Dorian, who is very vain about his looks, expresses the wish that he could remain young and beautiful while the portrait grows old, only to find that he has made an unwitting Faustian bargain, because this is precisely what happens. Influenced by the hedonistic philosophy of another friend, Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian gives himself over to a life of debauchery, remaining forever young while the signs of ageing begin to appear on the painting. The portrait, moreover, does not simply reflect Dorian's chronological age. It also acts as a reflection of the state of his soul. By the end of the story Dorian is no more than middle-aged, but the picture is that of a hideous old man, disfigured by a life of sin and vice.When the novel was first published in 1890 (in magazine form) it was highly controversial, for two reasons. The first reason was its undoubted homoerotic overtones, although Wilde toned these down somewhat when the novel was published in book form the following year. Explicit gay sex scenes would, of course, have been taboo in the 1890s, but coded references to famous homosexual lovers from history and mythology (Hadrian and Antinous, Edward II and Piers Gaveston, Jupiter and Ganymede) can be taken as an indication that Dorian's debauches are not exclusively of the heterosexual variety. There is also an indication that Basil's feelings for Dorian, and possibly Lord Henry's as well, go beyond mere friendship.The other reason why the novel was so controversial was that Wilde was wrongly thought to be espousing Lord Henry's world view and advocating a love of beauty and pleasure as the only good in life. This impression was strengthened by Wilde's Preface, which consists solely of twenty-five epigrams about art, including \\"There is no such thing as a moral or immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written. That is all\\". These statements appear to align Wilde with the literary and cultural movement known as Aestheticism, or sometimes as the Decadent Movement. This movement adopted as its slogan \\"Art for Art's Sake\\", interpreted by many of its followers such as the French poet Theophile Gautier as a denial of the idea that there was any association between art and morality.Wilde's epigrams, however, should not be taken as the Twenty-Five Articles of a prescriptive artistic credo; they were rather intended as provocative aphorisms intended to stimulate discussion. The author himself frequently wrote works with a quite overt moral agenda- children's stories like \\"The Selfish Giant\\", social satires like \\"A Woman of No Importance\\" and \\"An Ideal Husband\\", poems like \\"The Ballad of Reading Gaol\\". Indeed, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" itself can be interpreted as an overtly moral work. In a letter, Wilde said of the three main characters: \\"Basil Hallward is what I think I am: Lord Henry is what the world thinks me: Dorian is what I would like to be--in other ages, perhaps\\"- an interesting remark, given that Basil is both the only character in the novel who is a creative artist and also the representative of a traditional, and often explicitly Christian, morality, which contrasts sharply with Henry's amoralism. Henry is a cynical dandy, much given to witty aphorisms, but like other similar characters in Wilde's works is not to be taken as a self-portrait of the author.If Dorian is a Faust-figure, Henry is his Mephistopheles, but he is a devil less corrupt than the man he tempts. For all Henry's cynicism, he never descends into the depths of depravity in the same way as his prot&eacute;g&eacute; does. He never quite has the courage to practise what he preaches, being guilty of what might be called inverted hypocrisy, making himself out to be worse than he really is. As Basil says to him \\"You never say a moral thing, and you never do a wrong thing.\\" Dorian's sins, however, are not limited to sexual debauchery and drug addiction (he becomes an habitu&eacute; of opium dens). His callous behaviour drives his fianc&eacute;e, the young actress Sibyl Vane, to suicide, and in an attempt to preserve himself from exposure he resorts to blackmail and murder.One thing that does link Wilde to the Aesthetic movement is his undoubted love of physical beauty; the story is written in a very rich, lush style with many striking descriptive passages, such as the opening description of the beautiful summer's day on which Dorian first meets Henry. Yet his attitude to Aestheticism is a critical one, and is perhaps closer to that of earlier writers such as Ruskin and Morris, both of whom promoted an appreciation of beauty not as an end in itself but as part of a wider political and social agenda. Wilde clearly saw the limitations, and the dangers, of a cult of beauty divorced from moral and human concerns. It is perhaps significant that, after committing his murder, Dorian sits down to calm his nerves by reading the poetry of Gautier, the writer most closely associated with the \\"art for art's sake\\" ideology. He breaks off his engagement to Sibyl after seeing her give a bad performance in the theatre; her explanation for the decline in her acting skills is that, having discovered real love, she can no longer be inspired by fictional love. For him, artistic concerns are paramount over human ones; for her, it is the other way round.As one might expect from the only novel of a highly original, idiosyncratic writer, the book occupies a unique place in the history of English literature. It is sometimes classified as Gothic fiction, and the work to which it bears the greatest similarity is perhaps another classic \\"Gothic\\" novel from the late 19th century, Robert Louis Stevenson's \\"The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\", published five years earlier. Like Stevenson, Wilde wanted to explore the duality within the human soul between the virtuous public side and the darker private side which we are compelled to keep hidden. As a homosexual forced to conceal his homosexuality, this theme had an obvious appeal for him.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is a complex, multi-layered work, and there is insufficient space in this review to touch on all its many aspects. It is, however, a work which well deserves its status as a literary classic more than a century after the death of its author."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is to my knowledge, the only novel ever written by Oscar Wilde. It is very intelligent and at some points, rather dark, but that all makes it even more fun! The story is that Dorian Gray, is a young man who finds the thought of aging, rather depressing. As it so happens, his best friend is an artist, who has been quite happy to paint a portrait of Dorian. Upon witnessing his youth preserved in art, Mr. Gray wishes it could perhaps, be the other way around...and his wish is granted but, in a nightmarish way. For now the painting reflects his sins. Believe me, he has more than enough. This is a great, if tragic story and I'm so glad it was free, as this was my first time reading it! Also, this book is positively packed with good quotes so, now's the time to create a My Clippings file on your Kindle."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde, The Picture of Dorian Gray (Tor, 1891)I cannot comment on the scariness of &lt;em>The Picture of Dorian Gray&lt;/em>, the only novel ever written by Oscar Wilde. Why? Because, despite the reams of column inches I've read over the years on how scary the blessed thing is, I couldn't find myself even turning a hair. Simply put, Wilde was a comedian, albeit a bitter, misanthropic comedian. The man didn't have it in him to write horror the way the Jameses (M. R. or Henry, take your pick) or Poe did. (Though one should note that none of those three acknowledged masters of nineteenth-century horror ever produced what we would consider, today, a novel-length work of horror, whereas Wilde did; Poe's only novel was a fantasy, while the longest works of James one and James two are both novelettes.) So if you go into it expecting a horror novel, you may well find yourself disappointed. If you look at it, however, as yet another exposition of the incredible strengths of Oscar Wilde's creativity--the biting satire, the homosexuality so repressed it's half-erotic when someone stands up from a table, the rampant quotability--then like everything else the man ever wrote, &lt;em>The Picture of Dorian Gray&lt;/em> will be right up your alley. It contains some of Wilde's most-recognized one-liners (\\"The only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it.\\", \\"If the cave-man had known how to laugh, history would have been different\\", \\"It is not good for one's morals to see bad acting.\\", and dozens of others), some thoroughly entertaining characters, a plot as old as time itself bent to Wilde's indomitable will, and any number of good, solid laugh-out-loud moments. It also, of course, comes with an excellent backstory that inspired Wilde's most important one-liner of all: \\"There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written.\\" Needless to say, were this not the former, there wouldn't have been such an uproar over it, would there? ***"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The book \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\", written by Oscar Wilde, deals with the issue of getting old and the question of how you want to live your life. In my opinion the book is a typical book from Oscar Wilde which shows the difficulties and the pressures in the community. Oscar Wilde is a critical author who always writes about his own point of view. Furthermore you can also learn about his personality and the society this time.I think that the Picture of Dorian Gray represents the wish from every person to stay young and beautiful with all the opportunities and chances, waiting for you to grab them. Also the second chance and the possibillity to change is a facility which is usually offered to the youth.Also the end is a perfect rounding which brings all topics and themes together to one point. And as Oscar Wilde shows in his opinion, the point is not how you look, it is more how you lived and what you did. At least the ending says that when you die,you die as the person you were and it does not matter who you pretend you are.The story of Dorian Gray is in my opinion a very gripping book which did not leave me until I finished it. And even then it makes me think about these things. Oscar Wilde's writing is very fast-moving and there are no long or boring scences in the book.Bringing all considerations together I have to say that I enjoyed the book very much, which is why I have read it in only three hours."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is Oscar Wilde's color commentary on the tug of war between Basil Hallward (good) and Lord Henry Wotton (evil--think Wormwood in C.S. Lewis' Screwtape Letters). The rope they pull is the young Dorian Gray. The score in this classic battle is widely known; in the end Wotton pulls Gray completely to his end of the field with Hallward dragged face-down in the mud. For those who have not read it, I will not reveal the absolute ending.Several themes apply to us all: the high price of pleasure and self-indulgence as a way of life; the absurdity of our superficial preoccupation with outward beauty; and how idolizing appearances blinds us to the truth."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"What would a portrait of your soul look like?More than anything else, this question beats at the heart of this thought provoking book.For Oscar Wilde, his alter ego Dorian Gray would not be too pretty.As the book demonstrates, years of sin ultimately rob Gray of his youthful beauty. But, consistent with a wish made by Gray, this theft occurs only a canvas copy of him made by an adoring male artist when Gray was still young.While it would seem that eternal youth is a great prize, especially to the very vain Gray, it ends up becoming a curse. Gray locks the aging picture away in an attic only periodically returning to it to witness the ravages that would have been visited upon him were he not to have made his wish.In this way, while Gray is permitted to retain his external beauty, he's also forced to witness his moral deterioration.As with the more contemporary Angels in America, self reproach over one's homosexuality moves deeply along the subcurrents of this book. Though most don't know it, homosexuality was prohibited by law in Great Britain until 1967 and those convicted of it were forced into harsh punishments and even harsher treatments intended to \\"cure\\" them.It's this deeper sense that most people resonate with in one way or another...substituting their own private sins for those of Gray in their estimation of their moral appearance.Having said all that, it still prompts consideration that Gray himself and his friend Lord Henry -- sinful that they are -- are the most interesting characters in this book. Unintentionaly (perhaps), Wilde is suggesting that it's our sins that make us noteworthy."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I would love to give this a five star review because I am a great fan of Oscar Wilde from his well known works to De Profundis, but the inconsistancy of this story made it difficult to get into.The first half is a vehicle for Wilde's wit, unfortunately at the expense of story line and character developement, although I should that for me the wit of Oscar Wilde was reason enough to keep me reading. The second half of the book tells the majority of the story and is a much more accessable read.Would I reccomend this book? I think this is one of the few times I would say see the film (1945 starring George Saunders and Angela Lansbury) and then read the book. The book alone is not the best showcase for the genius of Oscar Wilde."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is a review for the Penguin Classics hardcover edition of \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\", ISBN: 0141442468. Amazon.com, despite its general excellence, fails to take into account the bibliophile for whom the quality of the edition he determines to purchase matters, so, this is not a review for the intellectual content of the volume I have recently bought, but, rather, a review of the quality of this particular volume's production.I had hoped, that Penguin had finally decided to market its considerable store of intellectual wealth to those who desire a book of some distinction, to those who still admire the craftsmanship of a finely wrought tome. Largely, in this edition (and in those others, similar to it) they have succeeded. The cloth covers of these editions are attractively designed; the typesetting modern, attractive, and readable; the cloth marker a thoughtful edition. However--and this is a thing unabidable--the binding is glued and does not have signatures. Sewn signatures are a sign that some care has been taken to ensure the longevity of a book. The crude, merely glued together pages make this volume little better than some cheap paperback in deceiving, meretricious garb.

He befriends an artist named Basil, and at first Basil uses Dorian as a model for paintings, putting him into classical scenes. Eventually, however, he decides to paint a portrait of Dorian as he truly is. Around the same time, Dorian befriends one of Basil's acquaintances, Henry, and Henry makes Dorian more cynical and jaded. When Dorian finally sees the portrait Basil has painted, he weeps and wishes that he would remain young, and the portrait would age in his place. When his wish comes true, Dorian will go to murderous lengths to keep the secret.Sometimes, a girl just needs a little bit of the classics in her life. Thank goodness Amazon offers a wide variety of public domain books available for free Kindle download. This was my first foray into Wilde, and I wonder how different of an experience reading his work in his own time would have been. To me, the homoerotic undertones leap from the page, but I wonder how much of that was intentional on his part, and how much of that is me being influenced by what we know of Wilde himself. Regardless, there is something sensually sinister about the interactions of the men in this book. And while most of them do have relations with women, very few seem to value or enjoy female interactions at all.I very much enjoyed this dark, cautionary tale of a wanna be Narcissus. It did take me a while to get into the pacing of the more classical language and writing style, having been reading a lot more modern books lately, but once I was about a third of the way through the book I literally devoured it. I know Wilde did not write as prolifically as some classical writers, but I believe I will be seeking out some of his other works.I could not help but feel some pity for Dorian Gray. He became exactly what everyone groomed him to be, then everyone scorned him for being what they had wanted him to be in the first place. Someone needs to get this book to Lindsay Lohan as soon as possible, she may find it familiar. Which make me wonder, with all the modernizations and mash ups of classic literature out there, why hasn't anyone done anything with this story? It seems to me that it could be redone with a modern twist, or vampires or something really well if the right person did it. Of course, if the wrong person did it, it would be wretched, so maybe it is best left alone."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This novel is one of the best classics available. It is more entertaining for its controversy value than for anything else. Lord Henry Wotton is probably the most engaging character in the entire novel, and one gets the impression he is the mouthpiece of Oscar Wilde himself. For the rest of this review, it will probably be enough to suggest you read it if you haven't, and include some quotes from Lord Henry:There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about.A man cannot be too careful in the choice of his enemies.Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love; it is the faithless who know love's tragedies.The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it.

Women are a decorative sex. They never have anything to say, but they say it charmingly.

This is a fast pased book that doesn't have a single speed bump, you are forced to create them yourself putting down the book every few chapters to marvel at EVERYTHING. The dialog is world class, the theme's truer today than back then, the characters moving and dynamic, all tied up in as few of pages as possible. With the exception of one chapter, you'll know it when you read it.The dialog, I haven't read a book that I am more impressed with. The poet and playwrite in Wilde shows through here. The constant gloomy witt of Lord Henry is awesome. The dinner scenes are great, and you just want to memorize a few sayings to pull out at the next party you go to. Things like, \\"The only way to get rid of temptation is to yeild to it.\\", or \\"I like persons better than principles, and I like persons with no principles better than anything else in the world.\\" Now you might come off thinking this is a book for an angry teenager, but there is a lot more here than that. If you are an angry teenager though.... read this book you will not regret it.This book cannot be avoided for anyone who considers themselves well read. Also a great intoduction into the world of literature. I recomend this book to anyone that has only read Harry Potter or Twilight, it is an extremely easy read and for its age surprisingly undated, and shows how older books are just as entertaining, yet more thought provoking, and what good writing looks like.

This was not a comfortable read for me; in fact, it was quite difficult for me to finish. However, the difficulty did not arise because it was poorly executed; rather, it was so well done that I couldn't bear to watch the destruction of one man's soul.Oscar Wilde writes beautifully and eloquently, and this book overflows with witticisms and epigrams that are eminently quotable. However, many of these bon mots come from the observations of Lord Harry, who is the cynic that leads Dorian Gray down the road of temptation and vice. For that reason, I could not fully enjoy all of these wonderful sallies, knowing from whom they came and whose mind composed them.Dorian Gray is by no means an innocent throughout this book. However, he begins the book as An Ideal - the physical embodiment of all that is good, youthful, innocent and free of sin. In fact, his ideal purity is what inspires his friend, Basil, to paint the titular picture of Dorian Gray. Once Dorian makes the acquaintance of Basil's friend, Lord Harry, however, Dorian is fascinated by Lord Harry's worldly and cosmopolitan views. In a burst of youthful enthusiasm, Dorian wishes for the picture to bear the physical outcomes of his actions so that Dorian can retain his beauty. He soon discovers that his wish has been granted. Adopting Lord Harry's way of life, Dorian descends into a lifestyle of vice and pleasure seeking and perversely (and childishly?) anticipates the devastation he can wreak on the portrait without bearing any evidence on his own physical form.The levels of Harry's influence, Dorian's self-destruction, and Dorian's blindness to the true elements of his fall from \\"goodness\\" combined to make for a powerful read. I couldn't help but get a Faustian vibe throughout this novel, and I found myself calling Harry (in my head) \\"Mephisto! Mephisto!\\"The story told in \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" of the ruination of a man's good character and moral compass is terrible, tragic, and, despite the fantastical nature of a portrait that reveals the blackness of one's soul, terrifyingly realistic."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is really a must read, I recommend it highly.

The book was quite \\"revealing\\" for me, it put into words so many thoughts and ideas in which I agree. What I liked the most about it are the amusing quotes and phrases that it has, it was quite difficult to choose my favorite one, most of them from Lord Henry for me the best character. Lord Henry has a unique style, like the book says \\"I represent to you all the sins you have never had the courage to commit.\\" For me he is like a paradox, and I like him for that because he is like the opposite of me. I think the book makes you want to have a good discussion with him. In general I think Oscar Wilde like the painter Bassil in Dorian Gray's portrait, puts so much of him on the book.

The book mainly focuses on a theme of sin and art, and this review will analyze how this novel treats aforementioned two topics and what readers can gain from such perspectives.Is sin inseparable part of one's life? No matter how moral or innocent way of life one seemingly leads, does sin work its way in insidiously to contaminate and destroy our soul? Oscar Wilde would agree. The novel is an intense meditation on morality. Here, As Dorian Gray leads a debauchery life, he is representing the dark side of morality. Once influenced by Lord Henry, who insists that \\"the only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it,\\" Dorian Gray's sole purpose in life is to please his senses despite the costs such lifestyle would incur. His sudden, whimsical wish that his portrait drawn by his admirer, Basil Hallward, would physically age instead of himself, comes true, and for the next 18 years, he keeps his youthful appearance while his portrait grows old. During those 18 years, he indulges himself in many indecencies (although readers could only glimpse at the specificity of those acts since apparently the press banned a number of erotic references when it was first published), yet he remains pure and pristine outwardly. His callous attitude toward and apathetic reception of others slowly taints his soul. One's decisive philosophy on life has huge impact on his moral conscious, as can be seen from Dorian's life. Dorian seldom visits his attic where he has hidden his portrait and takes a look at it. The portrait looks more horrific and sinister with the signs of aging everytime he looks at it. His sin is coming alive and reveals itself in the portrait.Here, Oscar Wilde seems to suggest that we human beings are all sinners since no one is immune to aging of one's physical forms. We age because we sin. Sin is one of inextricable condition of human being's life. As written in the introduction to the novel, \\"it portrays the author's internal battles and arrives at the disturbing possibility that \`Ugliness is the only reality.'\\"Then, can we, readers, say that Dorian Gray's sin's are unnatural and abomination? Can we not conclude that his sin is just different kind of sin from all the sins that human beings commit? Is his sin greater in intensity than the sins commited by others? If ugliness is the only reality, then he is merely candid with himself and is living in a true reality whereas everyone else only swims in the pool of illusions.In theology, it claims that God exists because everyone needs redemption. And we need to attain it through Him. If everyone needs redemption, then it logically follows that everyone sins. Although people may have rebuked Wilde's only novel due to immorality portrayed and done by Dorian Gray, they have done so because they were afraid to look at their own ugliness through the reflection cast by this very novel. Sin is a natural rebellion we all harbor, however unknowably, deep in our heart. Lucifer and Dorian Gray, they were just more honest with what their hearts were telling them.The theme of art, although seems peripheral to the theme of sin, is indeed an important facet that makes up the novel. The artist who paints the portrait of Dorian Gray poured his soul in the this very art. This metaphor becomes reality and the portrait embodies the soul of Dorian Gray. In addition, Dorian Gray is hugely influenced by the book given by Lord Henry Wotten, he who is ultra-liberal-minded and paradox loving friend of Dorian's. The latter fact is autobiographical in context as Wilde confesses in his other essay. Art affects lives exorbitantly. Art changes lives. Art roots unrootable philosophy deep inside one's heart. Art has soul of its own, or the soul of its subject.Then, was Oscar Wilde honest when he claimed in the preface that \`All art is quite useless\\"? Anything that has capacity to change one's philosopy cannot be labeled \`useless'. The very constrast that's shown in the story of the book is that Dorian Gray could not have lived such decadent life if it weren't for his portrait drawn by his friend. Art, here, gave him a new life. Art, when applied, becomes indispensable aspects of one's life. Scholars argue that the saying, \\"All art is quite useless,\\" was written after vituperative remarks Wilde received from his critics. It was his defense; yet his novels immediately rejects such claim through inordinate life story of Dorian Gray.Like many great novels, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a representation of a certain movement at a specific time. The movement was called \`Aesthetic Movement,\\" and the book remains as a symbol of its era, must as Albert Camus's book The Strangers remains the representation of existentialism in the 50s. Interestingly, the book is inundated with paradoxes, most of which were conveyed by Lord Henry Wotten, and its purpose is worthnoting. Dialectic has been a method for a couple millennia to get at the truth, and it seems like Wilde is purportedly using paradoxes to give us a chance to see other side by our commonly dull perspective. He is suggesting that morality is not easily defined, that the difference between virtue and vice is paper-thin. Here are some examples of paradoxes narrated by Lord Henry Wotton followed by my own interpretation:\\"We shall all suffer for what the gods have given us, suffer terribly.\\" -God's gifts are not a blessing but rather a curse-\\"It is only the intellectually lost who ever argue.\\" -People who use their intelligence and rhetoric for the purpose of arguing don't look smart; instead they look lost-\\"Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love: it is the faithless who know love's tragedies.\\" -It seems like the phrase is boasting the wonders and greatness of unfaithfulness, focusing on its dramatic elements-\\"And Beauty is a form of Genius--is higher, indeed, than Genius, as it needs no explanation.\\" -We generally think that concept of beauty as greatness is fleeting, that beauty is inferior virtue from other types of virtues; yet Lord Henry claims that beauty is the apex among all virtues.=== Forgoing my own interpretation for here are more wonderful paradoxes ===\\"The true mystery of the world is the visible, not the invisible.\\"\\"\`Always' is a dreadful word. It makes me shudder when I hear it. Women are so fond of using it. They spoil every romance by trying to make it last forever. It is a meaningless word too. The only difference between a caprice & a life-long passion is that the caprice lasts a little longer.\\"\\"Sin is the only real color-element left in modern life.\\"\\"One should absorb the color of life, but one should never remember its details. Details are always vulgar.\\"\\"Is insincerity such a terrible thing? I think not. It is merely a method by which we can multiply our personalities.\\"To define is to limit.\\"\\"Every effect that one produces gives on an enemy. To be popular, one must be a mediocrity.\\"\\"Their strong passions must either bruise or bend. They either slay the man or themselves die. Shallow sorrows and shallow loves live on.\\"This book is riveting and memorable book, full of paradoxies and deep insights and commentaries on life. I recommend this book to ones bored by mediocry of general mass and also to those who would like to see liberal-mindedness in its extreme. Although the main character leads a decadent life, because of censorship at the times, the passages do not contain explicit sexual scenes or drug usage. Approximately four movie adaptations on this novel have been made so far, the last one of which stars Colin Firth."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is an old favorite of my mother's.

Today it would be difficult to get people to read it. As a former English teacher, I was fascinated and intrigued by Wilde's sentence structure and word choice; most readers today would find it stilted and actually difficult to read. In addition, the class structure adds more problems for understanding how the characters behaved. Lastly, the older British custom of describing men and their feelings about their friends would put off many readers. (Same problem with some of Shakespeare's sonnets.) While it is certainly a classic, there are many contemporary authors who deal with the theme as well as Wilde. It is probably a great choice for English literature majors; however.

Can one possess both while maintaining a clear conscience?As for the irrepressible and intrepidly narcissistic Dorian Gray, \\"I admit that I think that it is better to be beautiful than to be good.\\" The Picture of Dorian Gray is a short work of literature that I read in one day. However, its brevity is due to Wilde's publisher purposefully omitting material at the time that was deemed vile and unprintable. This causes some holes in the story - references made to the many sins Dorian committed along the way to others were left unanswered upon finishing the book. More than a little frustrating. Having said that, I was pleasantly surprised with the Gothic, sordid, and dark themes that Wilde so aptly transcribes. Wilde amuses us with the copious amounts of witty quotable lines from Lord Henry such as, \\"The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it.\\"I found myself writing down clever witticisms constantly as I read the book. A good read if for nothing else than the unsurpassed wit of Oscar Wilde."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I usually try to go into English classes with a sense of optimism about the reading materials, and they're actually not usually bad. I find myself finishing almost every book ahead of schedule, and liking quite a few of them. So when I found out we'd be reading The Picture of Dorian Gray in junior year of High School, I started it with a positive mind. It was a famous classic after all! However, in this particular case, I was disappointed.The Picture of Dorian Gray is a novel with far too much unused potential. It's about the adventures of Dorian Gray, an upper class young adult living in the 1890's. Dorian acquires a magical portrait that diverts all physical traces of sin from him to his face in the portrait, allowing him to commit as much sin as he wants and remain looking youthful and innocent (i.e., after his insults drive his girlfriend Sybil to suicide, his portrait develops \\"a touch of cruelty in his mouth\\" [pg. 91] but his actual face remains the same). He gets advice from other characters about how he should live life, and after following his friend Lord Henry's way of life (outlined in a little yellow book that encourages Dorian to remain vain and shallow) and living hedonistically and selfishly for years and years, he finally realizes how \`ugly' his soul has become and launches an attempt at redemption. While it seems like there would be lots of action, I was disappointed at the lack of plot in general, and most of the book is actually rich people talking about human nature. Many of the book's lessons are taken from the obscure musings of Lord Henry, who acts as an outlet for Wilde's opinions, and while this is a decent way for Dorian to learn about life, I would much rather have read about him learning through experience as he traveled around doing something interesting. He could have been living a life of incalculable sin, and yet chooses to have sex and hang out in gardens smoking opium all day; not quite the worst decision ever, but not an exciting book.The lack of action isn't the only disappointing thing about the book. I constantly felt that Wilde was too busy sending messages to the audience to really give his characters life. Every dialogue read less like a real conversation and more like a (sometimes cryptic) scripted debate, and Wilde skips past something like twenty years' worth of Dorian Gray's character development (summarizing the slow corruption in one chapter). Other characters serve only to invoke development in Dorian, and no other characters show any significant development themselves, making the story just slightly distant. Wilde wastes space for the plot to talk about his ideas about human nature, crossing the line between novel and essay too much for my pleasure (\\"...you must keep your good looks. We live in an age that reads too much to be wise, and that thinks too much to be beautiful. We cannot spare you.\\" [pg. 220] is a good example of Lord Henry voicing Oscar Wilde's opinion on not just Dorian, but on life, and the Victorian generation). Another book that actually balances preaching with plot well is Animal Farm by George Orwell; it manages to simultaneously deliver a message about communism and entertain the audience. If you want a book where it is mostly messages and the entertainment is scarce, Dorian Gray is the book for you.Well, why is the story so famous? Part of its reputation is due to its shock value concerning homosexuality. There were various less-than-covert hints at homosexuality and adultery, which, unfortunately, are no longer effective in the 21st century. Now that the president is praising gay service in the military on national television, it is hard to be amazed about having gay characters in a book, and so a lot of impact is lost on me. Besides these homosexual exchanges between Dorian and the other male characters, the book is fairly void of plot, and Wilde's reliance on shock value make it boring and harder to take seriously at this point in time, no matter how revolutionary his writing may have been back in his era.The book was short enough to read through without losing focus, and to be fair, Wilde's writing is always very elegant with a signature fancy flair. Many of Lord Henry's musings are interesting, and most of the dialogues are widely quotable. The problem is that the story is just a little bit too boring for me to consider it a book you would normally read for fun, and combined with the superb premise of Dorian's magical portrait, this book's plot was really disappointing."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I never heard of Dorian Gray until I watched the movie The League of Extraordinary Men. I heard of Dracula [who wasn't in the movie], the Invisible Man, and Jekyl and Hyde, and Captain Nemo. But I have never heard of Quarterman or this guy Dorian Gray, and I wanted to read more about him. The idea of the picture growing old instead of the person, I thought was a brilliant idea. I could not wait to read this book.How disappointing it was for me, but I gave it two stars for two good reasons: the idea and the writer. The idea is quite neat, and I believe Oscar Wilde was ahead of his time when he thought of it. I think he was a genius, and it is apparent in his writings. There are some deep meanings in some of the passages of the book, and it requires a person to sit back and think about what he's saying. I can appreciate that part of it.But I have a huge problem with the characters in the book. I did not like Lord Henry AT ALL. I barely liked Basil, and Dorian was so over the top emotionally. They are all so judgemental and shallow. I knew this book was not going to work for me when Lord Henry kept talking about how beautiful Dorian was. It was just too much. I believe with Oscar Wilde's exceptional talent at writing, he could have made his point in less pages.And then did I miss how Dorian got his wish? Did it just happen out of the blue? Did he go see a witch or someone with supernatural powers? I would love to know how his wish happened. I must have missed it.Anyway, overall, this book is not my cup of tea. No doubt, Oscar Wilde has a lot to say and he's very smart. It is a must in someone's library. Unfortunately, not in mine.Thanks,Joy"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"If the book was entitled \\"The Picture of Dorietta Gray\\" it never would have become a classic. The idea of a man's beauty when the book was written and even today is suspect. There is something feminine about a beautiful person, pretty eyes, long eyelashes, a voluptuous mouth and smooth skin. Masculine men are suppose to be rugged even if handsome, a jutting jaw, thin lips and leathery skin. That Dorian was barely a man when his portrait is completed is important because when he wished for eternal youth, he refused to become a man and to be a pretty boy as he aged was itself, a decadent act.The book begins with lots of talk about Art and how Dorian Gray himself was a work of art who shouldn't bother with the hurley burley of real life. His first corruption comes when he can't accept Sybil Vane is so in love him she loses her ability to inhabit the lives the Shakespearean woman she played so well. But then the book become less about how Dorian fails to live up to the art of his life and more about his shadowy, decadent ways.Men and women fall in love with Dorian Gray. After Ms. Vane, it appears that Dorian falls in love with no one but he lurks around the docks, bars and opium dens with other men. What he actually does that is so disreputable is never clear and but for those of us living post Stonewall have a pretty good idea that it involved casual sex with men.The novel anticipates the celebrity that consumes us. It also proudly promotes male beauty in a new way. But after setting up a grand discussion about art and beauty, I think the book transforms into something more pedestrian, a creepy tale of horror where art and beauty are forgotten."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Title of Book: The Picture of Dorian GrayBy: Oscar WildeReviewed by: M. PoppinsPeriod: 5Basil Hallward painted a picture of his friend, Dorian Gray. Dorian was about eighteen years old, and everyone said that he was very beautiful. Lord Henry Wotton (Harry), Basil's friend from Oxford, became Dorian's best friend after they met. After the picture was finished, Basil gave the picture to Dorian as a present, and Dorian made a wish that he would always be young, and the picture would grow old. His wish came true. Whenever he did something bad, the person in the picture would get older. Dorian's face never changed after the picture was finished. He never let anyone know about the picture. One day, Dorian showed Basil the picture and showed him how much the picture was altered. Dorian then murdered the man by digging a knife behind his ear, stabbing him again and again. The day after Basil was dead, Dorian made Alan Campbell (one of his former friends) get rid of the body, by blackmailing him. Dorian then decided that he was going to do. He was going to destroy the picture, because he thought that he was going to be in peace after the picture was gone. He grabbed the knife that he had used to kill Basil and stabbed the picture with it. A cry and a crash were heard. A while later, his coachman and footman went through the windows, up to where Dorian was. On the wall, there was a picture of Dorian Gray, young and beautiful. On the ground, there was a man who was wrinkled, withered, and loathsome of visage. They had to examine the rings for them to recognize who he really was.I liked this book because it was fun and interesting at the same time. This quote is what made Dorian's wish come true: &quot;...only if it were I who was to be always young, and the picture that would grow old!&quot; He didn't know that his wish was to come true. I love when things like that happen!I also disliked the book, because in some parts, it just went on and on about things that I didn't understand. Also, there was too much philosophy in this book. This was something that Lord Henry said: &quot;I am afraid that women appreciate cruelty, down-right cruelty, more than anything else. They have wonderfully primitive instincts. We have emancipated...&quot; The quote still goes on. I think that Lord Henry is too philosophic.My least favorite part of the book was when Dorian was stabbing Basil, because that was too nasty for me. That is what I hate to hear."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I expected Dorian Gray to be rather dry and restrained when I picked it up. However, it is anything but! This is an enjoyable fast paced novel.Basil Hawthorne paints his masterpiece inspired by (and the portrait of) Dorian Gray. In the blush of innocence, Dorian begins to spend time with Basil's friend, Lord Henry who revels in making shocking statements and defying social protocols. A quick study, Dorian takes this to new levels as he - spurred on by Lord Henry and his own vanity - winds his way down a road of moral corruption all the while horrified at the changes on the canvas. When Basil decides that he would like to exhibit the portait (unaware of what has become of the portait while hidden away by Dorian), Dorian can no longer hide the flaws that have been for so long protected from outside eyes."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This story was really good. It's about Dorian Gray who is about 18 at the time his friend Basil paints a portrait of him. Gray prays that his portrait would age and he himself would remain young, and of course his prayer is answered.Having been written in the late 1800's, it's hard to get past some of the vocabulary in this book, and also there are endnotes which makes it hard to read because you have to flip to the back and find what that part meant and then go back to reading. Another thing that I didn't like was when the author went on and on about jewels and embroidery - it was so hard to follow and it wasn't necessary the story at all.Overall I liked the story, but it was a tough read, and although it's not a very long book (a little over 200 pages) it is not a light read. I think you should read this book if you're into classic literature, but otherwise I would pick something else."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"When I first bought this book, I expected it to be one of the best novels I had ever read. Boy, was I wrong. The book held my interest for the first half, but it got very boring. I skipped to about page 190, read a very exciting part, and then I skipped all the way to the end to read a stunning ending. If all that excess in the middle had been deleted, I would have given the book 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"First of all: I wish people would stop deconstructing Oscar Wilde before they deconstruct his message. He should be free to contradict himself, because &quot;the way of paradoxes is the way of truth&quot; (Dorian Gray). Secondly: I liked it, but didn't relate to the Victorian art scene and the &quot;choose-life-before-art&quot; message. It's worth reading, but I'd say Wilde's plays and poetry are more fun."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I think Dorian Gray is a book that is different for different people. For me it was a new experience, because I haven't read many books from the 19th century. I would believe that at the time when it was first published, it was a very different book for everyone. You can definetly see that the book contains lots of homosexual stuff. I think it's amazing that Oscar Wilde had the courage to write about that at such an early time. The book touched something deep in me even though it didn't have anything to do with my life or my present situation."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Picture of Dorian Gray was written by a man who was egocentric, socially polished and forever looking for the quiticential colloquialism. Notwithstanding, this book was a pleasure to read! It was easy to understand and was smattered with references to events and literature which were likely considered posh by English nobility in the mid-ninteenth century (i.e. Shakespeare, Greek Mythology, etc.). As stated above, this book is very reflective of the author in both spirit and style. I would definately recommend this book to a beginner reader of the English classics, due to its length and lack of confounding implicies which are common for this type of literature."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I wish I could give this book more stars but I can't. I've read this book 4 times &amp; am ready to read it a fifth. Despite its age, its a fast-reading, easily understood, thought provoking book. The only drawback to it was that I wish it had been longer."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I love it. I was hooked since the first page and I couldn't put it down.

Merely wish to lament on how starved this world has been during the past 140 years for someone remotely like Oscar Wilde."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Especially to people my age (14-18). You will enjoy this! Laced with Wilde's caustic wit and sly observations about life, it had me chortling out loud, and feeling wicked myself... I'm sure there's more profound things I can say about the book, but I'll leave it at this: go out and read it!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This novel has easily become one of my favorites. Wilde did an outstanding job in conveying his thoughts and opinions through Lord Henry. Dorian Gray was a very intriguing character who made me really think about myself and my actions. The only downfall of this book, in my opinion, is that there was no substantial background given on Lord Henry. I kept waiting to find out about his history, but there was none. Oh well...just adds more to the mystery surrounding the entire story."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I quite enjoyed the sharp witty dialogue,particularily that of Lord Henry who was one of the most interesting and provocative characters I've come across in quite some time."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The definition of &quot;classic&quot; is something timeless and universal; this book is neither. It does ask some &quot;deep&quot; questions but it doesn't make you really care about the answers; the characters are one-dimensional and transparent. It's hard to seriously relate to any of them, or this story. The writers' language is beautiful in a flowery way. If you want a feel for the book, read the intro/prelude; there are some interesting statements Wilde makes about &quot;ART&quot;. Otherwise, don't bother. There's only so much of art-imitates-life-life-imitates-art you can take."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Unfortunately I didn't like this classic story for many reasons. I downloaded theFree Kindle versionand read about half of it. I finished the story by listening to the Librivox audiobook recording using thefree smartphone app.I found Lord Henry to be quite unlikeable. His statements were absurd, contradictory, and got old quickly. Here are some loose quotes... \\"The only things that are necessary are those that are truly unnecessary.\\" He had MANY of those and I saw them coming when only three words of a sentence were out of his mouth. \\"I find people infinitely fascinating.\\" Which he quickly followed up with something like, \\"I pay no attention to people at all.\\" I believe Wilde was trying to paint a pompous, egotistical fool and he did a great job. It made me dislike the character greatly.The story was not balanced well. We started out by meeting Dorian and quickly jumped ahead through years and years of his life. There was very little build up of tension. Chapter nine was completely painful to go through. Did we need to read, in long, boring detail, about textiles and gems?My biggest complaint - various evil deeds and adventures are eluded to, but not shown to us. Dorian's actions are key to the concept of this story, but they are told to us at a distance and with very little feeling. Authors hear often that they are to show, not tell the reader what is happening. Chapter after chapter told us, in only vague hints, what kinds of things Dorian was up to. We skip over incidents very quickly. Some are just a word or two in a sentence. I realize that The Picture of Dorian Gray was written in an era when prostitution, drug use, and vile acts couldn't be written about in detail, but it could have been done so much better.This story reminds me ofThe Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. They both have themes of - Be careful what you wish for. Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde was also written at a time when sadistic endeavors and deviant sexual practices couldn't be written in detail. Stevenson succeeded where Wilde failed. I felt Mr. Hyde's strength and power. I could see the lust and greed. Wilde didn't bring any believability to this story."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Informative, deep analyis and fascinating to see Wilde's own annotations in the text. Highly recommended for a closer look at a classic."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Fistly, I would like to tell you why I'm interested to read this book? I have many reasons to read this book such as my friend is the big fan of Oscar Wilde's stories and she told me that it's a great book, another reason that really made me want to read this book is after I saw the movie called the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, in this movie all charaters are from very well-known book or we can say that they are classic characters. For example Dracula or Vampire, invinsible man(skinner), Dr.Jackle and Mr.Hike, etc.Only one character that I don't know is Dorian Gray(forever young guy), so I find the book to read.When I bought this book, at first I think it would be boring book because it's quite a all style.....but after I read a couple chapters from this book, I change my mind. It's fun, in teresting ideas and use a easy language or I can say that Oscar Wilde use a simple word but feel brilliant and amazing.Another good point for this book is explain the character and place very clear that you can imagine follow the story.I can't say that it's a bad point but it's quite difficult to understand some qoutes but if you read twice or more and think about fact or in a present time you'll understand or may think it's a great qoute.For other thing that I received from this book is social life in the past(around Victorian period), especially for the upper and middle-class people."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The beginning and end of this book were fairly interesting, we get to see Dorian Gray first as a young man (a child essentially) and how he was poked and prodded into becoming the man we see at the end of the book. The middle is somewhat lacking, and I completely lost interest for almost a month before picking the book back up and finishing the story.The story is essentially that of a man who sells his soul for something petty, namely, beauty and about the downfall of not only the main character but also those whom he encounters in his life. It is an interesting story, but I feel that the story could have been written better and become somewhat of a mystery novel. Instead of revealing Dorian's secret at the moment he discovers it, it would have been fun to leave the reader guessing as to why Dorain was so afraid to let others see the great picture of himself, and perhaps delve into the inner turmoil of Dorian a bit more before the conclusion.I have only read the story once, but in future readings I'm sure this story will become more intriguing."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"It's been a while since I read The Picture Of Dorian Gray, but I'll try to review it as well as I can.The Picture Of Dorian Gray takes place in late nineteenth-century England, among the wealthy middle- or lower upper class. It is about Dorian Gray, a young man who is beautiful, charming and popular. His good friend Basil Hallward is painting his portrait, and during a visit at Basil's house he meets Lord Henry, another friend of Basils. Lord Henry is decadent and provocative, and Dorian is very impressed by him and his ideas.Lord Henry tells him about how precious his youth and beauty is, and how awful everything will become when he grows old (\\"When your youth goes, your beauty will go with it, and then you will suddenly discover that there are no triumphs left for you, or have to content yourself with those mean triumphs that the memory of your past will make more bitter then defeats\\").When Basils painting is finished, Dorian sees his own beauty in it and is struck by the fear of aging. He makes a pact with the devil, and sells his soul so that he can remain young and beautiful forever, while his painting grows old and repulsive. His former kind and lovely self is gradually reformed, and he grows evil and corrupt although he still appears just as fresh and innocent as he has always been.This book is not the best one I've read, but it is pretty good. I think that the characters are sometimes turned into caricatures of themselves; they don't really appear to be real persons. Although I really liked Lord Henry's philosophical monologues, they sometimes grew tiresome and a bit too long. The novel, and in particular the ending, is quite predictable.However, the book is beautifully written (like most of the books I've read from that time (but I don't know if it's because of their superiority to the writers of today, or merely because the good ones are the only ones that are left to future generations))(...) There are strong homosexual tendencies in the friendship between Dorian Gray and both Basil and Lord Henry, and their friendship does not feel like a mere friendship.Apart from being a way for Wilde to, through Lord Henry, give voice to some of his philosophical ideas, I think the novel is about the shallowness and hypocrisy of the Victorian society, which considered outward appearance more important than ethics and moral."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"In the book the Picture of Dorian Gray Dorian, the main character makes a powerful wish that impacts his life and the lives of others.

Can Dorian find a way to make everything right?"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This cautionary tale of sensuality, excess, vanity, and self-love is slow-going for today's readers, used to a brisker pace of writing.

All throughout you want to rush through the pages to see how the story concludes. What will happen to Dorian? What will become of the hideous painting?The book's three main characters are Basil Hallward, the painter; Dorian Gray, the paintee; and Lord Henry, the intellectual mind behind Dorian Gray. It seems as if all of Dorian Gray's evils are inspired by his sidekick, Lord Henry. So, throughout the story, the reader is left asking: &quot;Is this guy a villain?&quot; As to the answer to that question, it still remains uncertain to me.And the ending - oh! - flawless, impeccable, divine! I dare not give it away, for you must venture into those pages to find out where all the events lead to. The last page of the book is truly the climax. You'll be left shivering with sweat trickling down your forehead just to see what happens.&quot;Of all people in the world the English have the least sense of the beauty of literature,&quot; Lord Henry claims in one part of the story.

There is a great difference.\\"The basic plot of the story is well known: thanks to mysterious/magical intervention the physical consequences of Dorian's action affect his portrait rather than his physical body. Urged on by Lord Henry Wotton (whose shocking/amusing/wicked epigrams are classic Oscar Wilde), Dorian descends into a life of ever-increasing debauchery, manipulation, hedonism, and the love of beauty above all else.Wilde brings up a number of themes in sometimes dizzying succession: the ability to \\"dominate\\" others, beauty as the supreme virtue, self-actualization as the guide to morality, yielding to temptation as a means of getting beyond temptation, physical consequences vs. consequences in general, the fascination of wickedness, etc. It is often unclear where Wilde stands on these matters since their proponent is Wotton who is \\"wicked\\" and the cause of much suffering, but speaks in the manner of Oscar Wilde. The moral ambiguity of the story lets the reader draw their own conclusions...fascinating."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Basil, who up until now was a mediocre painter after meeting Dorian Gray a young Adonis, was inspired to create a masterpiece of which he puts himself into. Against Basil's wishes, Dorian Gray is influenced by Basil's friend Lord Henry. Dorian looks at his portrait and realizes that while the portrait will stay young forever, he will grow old; so Dorian makes a wish that if only he could stay young forever and the portrait can age.At first Dorian does not realize his wishes been granted. He falls in love with a beautiful young actress who is every woman that Shakespeare ever wrote about. But once again due to Lord Henry's influence, he realizes that she's just a common girl.Starting with absent-minded acts Dorian slowly sinks into debauchery. And with every new act his picture becomes more grotesque while Dorian stays is young and as innocent looking as the day his picture was painted.What will become of Dorian?What will become of Dorian's painting?What would you do if you were Dorian?Oscar Wilde paints a picture himself as he describes Dorian Gray's dilemma. And we as readers travel with Dorian as each decision is made. In some places in the story Oscar Wilde seems to drag on and on with detail; however we find that this detail is necessary to set the next scene.Oscar Wilde himself led a risky life that lead to a jail sentence; is attitudes can be seen in the dialogues in this book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Part humorous fable, part mystery, part gothic suspense, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is another example of the late 1800s fascination with the soul, the senses, and science.Dorian Gray is a mere teen when the story begins, the muse of a local gifted artist, who paints Dorian's portrait in hopes of capturing his youth and beauty. Dorian's charm is also appreciated by Lord Henry, a rascally fellow, able to twist phrases and morals with his sly tongue. His winsome ways captivate Dorian, but Dorian soon finds himself pulled in the direction of a beautiful actress as well. These two loves tear Dorian in different directions, resulting in unexpected turns of events that send him down a road of sin and pleasure, though never with the rewards of true happiness. As his actions lead to even more drastic results, he finds himself fearing every shadow and questioning his own sanity.These events do not occur in a vacuum. With Dorian's sliding moral state, the portrait of his beauty begins reflecting the dark decay in his soul. Even as his own face refuses to age or show corruption, the painting becomes uglier by the day. Dorian is both fascinated and appalled by this. When, at last, he faces the consequences of his own selfish choices, he makes one final decision to try to destroy the evidence.I laughed aloud at many parts, particularly early in the book, then found the tone growing eerie and black. What a thought-provoking book! And one that kept my attention throughout. This is no glossed-over portrait of Mr. Gray, but a grisly depiction of evil--even when it masquerades in a cloak of civility.Oscar Wilde joined other writers of his day--H.G. Wells, Robert Louis Stevenson, and Joseph Conrad--in wrestling with concepts of the soul and the senses in the light of scientific discoveries. What about the conscience? Where did theology and psychology fit in? What about free will? In the last few pages, Wilde paints his own sobering portrait of a man who has tried to live as though the soul and senses have no effect on each other.This now ranks as one of my favorite classic novels. The results of Dorian Gray's experiment serve as a mirror for all those who consider themselves holy, heathen, or hypocrite."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is another one of those classics that I'd heard mentioned in passing or read about but never actually sat down to read. It's short, only 200ish pages long - but don't let the short length of it deceive you, it packs a fairly powerful punch.The premise fascinated me from the moment I read it. Innocent young man who manages to remain that way on the outside, but a portrait of him changes to reflect the corruption of his soul. Fascinating, no?I'm positive that this book has been dissected and analyzed from all sorts of different points of view, so let me tell you what I got out of it.I felt the tragedy, deeply. The corruption of a soul is something that is unpleasant to read, unpleasant to see and seeing the effect it has on others is difficult to deal with at times.It's interesting because I read this novel while I am still continuing to work my way through George Eliot's Middlemarch. Whereas I am having such a difficult time relating to and feeling emotions from Eliot's characters, there was such a wealth of emotion being poured out of Wilde's it was almost overwhelming. I felt the passion of love and the despair when it was lost.By the way dialogue was incredible, it makes the book, honestly. I highly recommend this book to anyone who hasn't read it.

Also like many here, I couldn't resist the free version after reading the reviews. The story is original (though of course well told after over a hundred years of publication) and the writing is eloquent and witty. I agree that the chapter about Dorian's exploits and collections did drag on a little but it acted as a segue from youth to middle age and was kind of necessary to show how the years were passed. Otherwise, the entire work was very engaging. I highly recommend reading this book!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I have heard a lot about this book and, having read a few of Oscar Wilde's plays and enjoyed them, decided to give it a try. Overall is was a good book, if a bit inconsistent in pacing at times.Dorian Grey is a beautiful young man, who is corrupted by a Lord to worry about how his looks might one day fade. While a portrait of him is being painted he wishes to never grow old. Later he realizes that the portrait is changing to reflect any cruelty in his nature, yet he remains the same.Oscar Wilde is a genius at writing. The cleverness of the language he uses and the sharpness of the commentary on society is deftly done and makes the story a joy to read, most of the time. The footnotes in this version of the book help to explain some of the more subtle jokes that I would have missed without them.The book does have some flaws, especially when compared to modern literature. Wilde takes nearly half to book to set up his characters. You can tell Wilde is a playwright at heart because many of the characters wander off into multiple page long dialogues that get to be a bit too much and sometimes a bit boring. Even in the second half of the book there are times where Dorian is reading from the book he is obsessed with and it just goes on and on and on.The second half of the book is by far the strongest. Wilde stimulates the imagination by talking about Dorian's unspeakable acts but never revealing what the majority of the horrible acts are. I was a little disappointed that there isn't a lot more to the plot than what you read on the back of the book. That being said, the end of the book is remarkable and really made the book a wonder to me.Overall this is a very interesting book and worth the read. Some of the lengthy dialogues can get a bit trying to read through, but most of the book has a quick wit to it that is amusing. The ending of the book holds some wonderful surprises. I would recommend reading this, especially if you are a fan of Wilde's writing style."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde (1856-1900) is best known today for his witticisms and classic plays such as \\"Lady Windemere's Fan\\" and \\"The Importance of Being Ernest.\\" However, Wilde also wrote short stories, poems and in \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" a short but fascinating novel.The tale is a retelling of the Germanic legend of Doctor Faust. Young Dorian Gray is influenced by the evil Mephisto figure Henry Wotton to make a pact with the forces of evil. Gray will not age despite a career of debauchery, decadence, opium usage and murder. However, the portrait of him by the artist Basil Hallward will age as Gray descends into an inferno of crime.The Marguerite love interest from the Faust legend is young Sybil Vane. Sybil is a \\"vain\\" callow actress who portraits the great Shakesperean female roles such as Rosalind, Juliet and others every night on the stage of a seedy London theatre. Gray marries her but she commits suicide since the girl realizes he fell in love with the stage heroines and not herself. Sybil's brother the sailor Jack Vane will return from sea to seek out vengeance against Dorian Gray. He will be unsuccessful being shot during a hunting accident on a wealthy estate at which Gray is spending a weekend. Basil Hallward is the young artist who will be murdered by Gray who is driven mad by the haunting picture of himself. The novel ends in a way never to be forgotten by the reader.Oscar Wilde published this short novel in 1890. In many ways it resembles the better book \\"Doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\" published in 1886 by Robert Louis Stevenson. That earlier work, like Dorian Gray, also looks at a character with a divided self in conflict with the norms and morality of society.Wilde's book is filled with aphorisms most of which are delivered by the cynical Henry Wotton The author is good at painting a scene so we feel as if we ourselves were in the garden and drawing room of wealthy Dorian Gray's London home or seeking an opium den in the foggy slums of fin de siecle London.The Picture of Dorian Gray is one of the best selling classics in the Penguin Classics catalogue. It is a satisfying piece of fiction which will make you think on the nature of evil, the human mind and how role playing and mask wearing are part of everyday life."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I have read this book many times, and enjoyed it more each time that I did. I have to admit that Lord Henry's wit and wisdom was what kept me coming back to the book, not the important and intellectual issues about art, life, temptations and all the literary matters. I know there are other reviews with the literary facts and theories presented there, better than I can, so I'm not going to try.All I will say is this is a classic, worth more than 5 stars, should be read by everyone at least once in your life, first for the great writing, if its your first time reading Wilde, this is a great book to start with. You should read it slowly, because Wilde is a word smith, no words for words sake, each one polished like the gems that they are. If one could speak like he wrote one would be like a god, or have a late night talk show better than all others.Second, this is a good, clear and complete edition, so now you have no excuses, read on MacDuff, and enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wilde sees the world more clearly than any writer of fiction in the last century.

This book, which takes place in 19th-century England, signifies the high price one young man had to pay for eternal youth.Basil Hallward, a mediocre painter, became infatuated with an extremely hansom but innocent young man, Dorian Gray. It was Dorian's picturesque beauty which inspired Basil to paint his best picture ever. Overcome by the beauty of his youth, Dorian wished that he would ramain young forever and that the portrait would deteriorate with age. However, when Dorian realised that his wish had come true and the picture took on the effects of his sins, his lifestyle signifcantly altered. Dorian went from leading a normal aristocratic life, to living a secretive life full of sin and slander.This book is proof that one can not be happy with youth and beauty alone. The suffering of Dorian Gray shows us that there is more to life than mere beauty. Dorian's life was ruined by a simple wish to be forever young. Although no one can stay young forever, this novel is a key example of why one should not simply focus on base characteristics such as youth and beauty, for these things will always fade."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This edition is slightly shorter than the others available, but it is the ONLY one whose text reflects Wilde's true intentions. Don't be fooled by the other editions claiming to be the \\"unabridged\\" or \\"complete\\" version. The material Wilde added later was meant to make the novel seem more morally edifying. It makes the novel worse. This one is WAY better -- and also way dirtier. A bunch of the more explicit stuff was cut by Wilde's editor. The editor of this ebook version has restored it all, based on Wilde's actual typescript, which he went and consulted in an archive. If you're a homophobe, get the other, more \\"moral\\" versions. If you want to read one of the great modern novels as the author wanted you to read it, get this one. You won't regret spending a couple of extra bucks."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde's strange and intriguing mind is apparent in this book, which is full of interesting concepts and bizarre happenings. Dorian Gray, a young man who is obsessed with his own good looks, befriends an English Lord and a struggling painter. After Basil, the painter, finishes Dorian's portrait, they are stunned by its magnificence and how lifelike it appears. Seeing this, Dorian is angered when he realizes that the portrait will live forever and retain its beauty while he himself is left to age. Dorian decides to trade his soul for everlasting youth, and to always retain his beauty, just like the portrait.Since Dorian believes himself to be immortal, he dabbles into various sinful acts. He carelessly pursues a relationship with Sibyl Vane, an actress, constantly letting her down and breaking her heart. Dorian is involved in several mysterious deaths, and he even explores the London underground opium scene. Even though Dorian does all of these things, somehow he remains young, to the surprise of his peers. In the end, however, Dorian receives the punishment he deserves through a series of bizarre events. The &quot;what goes around comes around&quot; theme is strongly emphasized in the conclusion of the novel, which serves as a fitting end for Dorian's struggle with sin.This classic literary work is frequently exciting, but can sometimes delve into the monotony of 19th century British affairs (which may be a little tedious.) All in all, the novel is a wonderful concept which is given life by the genius of Oscar Wilde. It is a perfect research topic as well because it contains many themes which can be applied to anything from English rhetoric to the Original Sin. I myself wrote a term paper on the book and it was very easy to express my ideas because Wilde is so straight forward in his literary agendas. So, whether you pick it for required reading or just for pleasure, The Picture of Dorian Gray is definitely a good choice."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Nota Bene: Once purchased, my Kindle download page contained this note near the download button: \\"This title has complex layouts and has been optimized for reading on Kindle DX's larger screen, but can still be viewed on other Kindle devices.\\" This message disappeared after a few minutes.Regardless, the formatting on my Kindle 2 looks good.

The other reviews have made very good points concerning this book - I can't improve upon them, but I can simply say that this is a version of the book that is well worth buying if you appreciate Oscar Wilde and The Picture of Dorian Gray. I am glad that I bought it!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray is a thought-provoking novel that vacillates between ambling, seemingly directionless conversation and a riveting narrative thread that eventually bubbles up to the surface with the intensity of a volcanic eruption. The Picture of Dorian Gray, though not much more than a century old, has already been deemed a \\"classic\\" by literature-lovers, and after reading the book, I can understand its status. Wilde's command of the English language is almost unparalleled in recent literature.Warning - Spoilers FollowHere's the gist of the book. Dorian Gray is a young man whose physical appearance is handsome and innocent. An aspiring artist paints a beautiful portrait of Dorian. Dorian wishes that he always look like his youthful appearance in the portrait. The wish comes true. Dorian remains the same - youthful and charming, but the portrait begins to transform itself into the image of his soul.When Dorian embraces a life of hedonism, he uses his good looks and charm to obtain whatever he desires in life. His insensitivity drives a friend to suicide. The evil desires of his heart eventually cause him to murder a friend in cold blood. Over a period of twenty years, Dorian becomes a monster on the inside (reflected by the portrait of his soul) even as he remains youthful and innocent on the outside.Oscar Wilde's homosexuality is no secret, and the reader can easily discern certain homosexual overtones in the book (especially at the beginning). Perhaps Wilde's subtle innuendoes of homosexuality have made his works so appealing to lovers of literature who tend to sympathize and approve of homosexual behavior.Upon reading Dorian Gray, however, I could not help but notice how the lifestyle of hedonism is so implicitly condemned by the narrative's outcome. If Dorian's hedonism includes sexual relationships with men as well as with women (and Wilde does hint at this), then homosexuality comes under the same umbrella as the rest of Dorian's sinful passions. One can hardly characterize The Picture of Dorian Gray as a pro-homosexual book.Readers of this blog will find the picture of depravity in Dorian Gray to be intriguing. Throughout the story, Dorian, even in his hedonism, acts in a manner that forces the reader to desire justice and redemption. The book's end emphasizes the need for punishment and retribution - pointing at death as the wages of sin.What does the life of unbridled hedonism look like? What does it do to the soul? What happens to the human being who seeks to fulfill his every passion and desire? How does sin affect us physically? Do we age because we sin? These and more are the questions that Oscar Wilde raises in The Picture of Dorian Gray."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde was one of the foremost representatives of Aestheticism, a movement based on the notion that art exists for no other purpose than its existence itself (\\"l'art pour l'art\\"), not for the purpose of social and moral enlightenment. Born in Dublin and a graduate of Oxford's Magdalen College, he initially worked primarily as a journalist, editor and lecturer, but gradually turned to writing and produced his most acclaimed works in the six-year span from 1890 to 1895, roughly coinciding with the period of his romantic involvement with Lord Alfred \\"Bosie\\" Douglas, sixteen years his junior. Douglas's strained relationship with his father, John Sholto Douglas, Marquees of Queensberry, eventually resulted in a series of confrontations between Wilde and the Marquees, which first led to a libel suit brought by Wilde against his lover's father (who had openly accused Wilde of \\"posing as a sodomite\\" and threatened to disown his son if he didn't give up his acquaintance with the writer) and subsequently to two criminal trials against Wilde for \\"gross indecencies,\\" based on a law generally interpreted to prohibit homosexual relationships. Sentenced to a two-year term of \\"hard labor\\" in Reading Gaol, Wilde emerged from prison in 1897 a spiritually, physically and financially broken man and, unable to continue living in England or Ireland, after three years' wanderings throughout Europe died in 1900 of cerebral meningitis, barely 46 years old.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\\" Wilde's only novel besides seven plays as well as several works of short fiction, poetry, nonfiction and two fairy tale collections originally written for his two sons, is critical to an understanding of Wilde's body of work and his personality primarily for two reasons: First, because it constitutes one of his earliest fully accomplished formulations of Aestheticism, and secondly because of its undeniable undercurrent of homoeroticism; an inclination which, after a six-year marriage widely thought to initially have been a true love match, Wilde had begun to explore more openly around the time of the novel's creation (1890). The story's title character is an exceptionally handsome young man who, both in the eyes of the artist tasked to paint his portrait, Basil Hallward, and in those of their somewhat older friend Lord Henry Wotton, epitomizes perfect beauty and is coveted by both men for that very reason. Seduced by hedonistic Lord Henry into believing that beauty can literally justify anything, including any act of immorality, Dorian sells his soul for maintaining his beautiful appearance, letting his portrait age in his stead. (In that, his character resembles Goethe's and Marlowe's Faust.) He then quickly turns from an innocent youth into a cruel and calculating man whom society, in its shallow adherence to appearances, nonetheless never associates with any of the results of his cruelty, never looking beyond the surface of his handsome exterior and assuming that a man so beautiful must necessarily also be good. Ultimately it is Dorian himself who brings about his own downfall when he is no longer able to face the manifestation of his evilness in Basil Hallward's picture.Upon its initial publication in Lippincott's Monthly Magazine in 1890, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was widely scorned as immoral by a public neither familiar with nor particularly open to the concepts of Aestheticism and its mockery of middle class morality, and repulsed by the thinly veiled homoerotic relationship of the novel's protagonists. Wilde republished the work the following year, adding a preface designed to explain his views on art. Yet, it was that preface which, along with several of his other publications and his written exchanges with Lord Alfred Douglas, ultimately would play a devastating role in his trials, where Queensberry's attorney would come to use an excerpt from that very preface - \\"There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written\\" - to extract from Wilde statements to the effect that any book inspiring a sense of beauty (including, as implied in the attorney's question, an \\"immoral\\" book, if \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" could be qualified as such) was well-written and therefore commendable; that only Philistines, brutes and illiterates - whose views on art he considered invariably stupid and for which he therefore didn't \\"care twopence\\" - could consider this novel \\"perverted,\\" and that the majority of the reading public would probably not be able to draw a proper distinction between a good and a bad book. It was testimony such as this, as well as the impending confrontation with a number of male witnesses ready to testify as to the nature of their relationship with Wilde, that not only caused the author's attorney to convince his client to drop the libel suit against Queensberry but also opened the door for Wilde's own subsequent prosecution.If \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" has a central theme besides the supremacy of beauty and the depiction of a society primarily interested in appearances, it is a call for individuality: Dorian's cruelty is brought out only after he allows himself to be influenced by Lord Henry's equally seductive and cynical hedonism; and similarly, Basil Hallward's blind idolizing of Dorian eventually proves fatal for the painter. - Wilde's only novel is one of the first and most poignant expressions of his own individualism; but unlike his protagonist, who ultimately pays a ghastly prize for selling his soul and giving up his individuality, Wilde paid as high a price for maintaining his. Like Dorian, he knew that \\"[e]ach of us has Heaven and Hell in him,\\" and although this novel's preface ends with the provocative statement that \\"[a]ll art is quite useless,\\" it was the very fact that Wilde put his entire being into his art that ultimately destroyed him. But like beauty, which is finally restored to perfection in Dorian Gray's portrait, Wilde's works have stood the test of time; and not merely for their countless, pricelessly witty epigrams. They're as well worth a read as ever.Also recommended:Complete Works of Oscar Wilde (Collins Classics)Oscar WildeWilde (Special Edition)The Oscar Wilde CollectionThe Picture of Dorian GrayThe Importance of Being Earnest - Criterion CollectionThe Importance of Being EarnestAn Ideal HusbandA Good Woman"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is a classic novel about the consequences of eternal youth.

While the passages did not confuse me they did occasionally bore me. I found the book hard to get into - and once I got into it I had a hard time keeping interest.I do not doubt Wilde's credibility as an author in the slightest I feel that, as a modern reader, this is a book that may not stand the test of time as well as others.

I have not read a book before that compares with this one and is indeed one of the best that I have read.

Usually they bore me so much I can barely finish them. However, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was an exception to this rule. Though the language was a bit more intricate than is commonly found in the books of today (at least the ones I like to read), I found it to be more elegant and eloquent than tiresome and confusing.This book, with all of its discussion of morals, evil, and purity really is a window into late 1800s of England. Despite this, I found the book to actually be interesting. The real appeal this book held for me was its wonderfully potent imagery and mildly creepy, definitely surreal theme. \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is also a very short book, which I thought was pretty cool because I don't have a very long attention span concerning books. In spite of how today's people are probably a great deal more jaded concerning morals, or rather the lack thereof, than the people of Oscar Wilde's time, a lot of this book was fascinating in an almost perverted way. That aspect is offset by the theme of good vs. evil, however. The only faults I found with this book were minor details concerning the definitions of good and evil, issues which I think this book was meant to rise anyway.If you're a parent or someone looking to buy a classic book for a friend or relative in high school, I think this would be a pretty good choice, assuming they like books. The vocabulary seemed fairly advanced to me, but they ought to be able to handle it. The conflict between \\"good\\" and \\"evil\\" in this book is engaging, and the nature of the book is such that the reader has difficulty simply viewing matters in black and white. This makes the book deeper and more interesting to read. The transformations that occur in this book are slightly haunting, and at the end of this twisting tale of corruption and beauty lies a powerful, sudden, and very awesome ending. I really think that everyone should read this book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is not just a book, it is a story that delves into each human's beliefs and views of the world, a book that makes a person really look differently at the world around them. Although Oscar Wilde wastes much space with over-explanatory details, the moments in which he tells his story are moments of inspiration and causes of great self-examination. The story, in which a good-looking young man gains eternal beauty, really makes its reader look within themselves and find the person they are and who they want to be. Also, through some very good symbols, Wilde is able to make his reader find new meaning in the world around them and is able to open the reader's eyes to the magnificence--and ugliness--of life itself.Even though the book is mostly filled with simple dialogue and extended (and sometimes, unnecessary) descriptions, the overall effect the story itself can have upon the reader's mind is overpowering. Not only does Wilde's occasional complex dialogue add to the reader's understanding of the world, the ideals with which Wilde writes (and therefore gives his character) make the reader work to understand where they fall within the spectrum of day to day life.The book was slow moving at first, but really started to pick up, due to its author's ability to excite the reader's mind, with the first meeting between the main character and the man who he would eventually blame for all of his problems. I would definitely recommend this book to those who have an open mind (there are some controversial ideas and lifestyles within the story) and are able to follow a character's complex mindset because, although most of the book is simple and in some people's eyes, artless, it still provides the reader with multiple \\"out-of-the-box\\" type ideas.I enjoyed the book, and the message it sent was one that I will probably never forget. It is one that forces the reader to question what they value in life, make them question what a \\"perfect\\" life would be. Because of the story's ability to reach within the readers mind and plant a new outlook on life, the book would be a great read for anyone who is interested in hearing the story of a man who gave up everything in order to keep the only thing he believed to be important within the world, the thing that he himself feared losing the most."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"A classic noir fiction novel were the worship of material values related to physical beauty and immortality drive the ego of a young man belonging to the upper classes of the English society of the XIX century to a tragic fate after circumstances force him to confront his real self.

There's a lot to be learned from Dorian Gray, I promise he's well worth your time."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I decided to re-read Dorian Gray for an upcoming book club discussion but I knew that I wanted to read the annotated edition because I cannot resist special editions--books, films, and music-- with all the accompanying special features. I had not realized the extent to which Wilde's original version differed from the final published edition. This edition gives me everything I would ever want to know about Dorian Gray, including not only everything he wrote that was edited out later but extensive footnotes, illustrations, photographs and paintings of innumerable peripheral points of interest.The Picture of Dorian Gray bears similarities in my mind with other notable philosophical metaphysical fantasies of the nineteenth century--Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Robert Louis Stevenson's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and one less well-known than those others but perhaps an even more direct influence on Wilde--Balzac's Le Peau de Chagrin, or The Magic Skin. In that novel, a man purchases a magic wild ass's skin that is supposed to grant his every wish. He, of course, indulges in every kind of debauchery and decadent, hedonistic activity he can imagine and discovers that the skin magically shrinks and his life span is correspondingly shortened with every wish fulfilled.All of these novels were published before Wilde wrote his philosophical fantasy and they all influenced him, along with other tales of magic portraits by Hawthorne, Poe and Gogol. Wilde used the device in a particularly unique way. The portrait is kept in a locked room in an attic as any reminder or repository of our darkest impulses would be, in a back chamber of the subconscious. In the final published version of the novel, there are connotations of homosexuality and bisexuality among the characters of the impossibly handsome Dorian, the effete artist Basil Hallward and the caustic, witty, married (and bisexual) Lord Henry Wotton. Each of these characters depict aspects of Wilde himself, with Lord Henry being the primary expounder of Wildean bon mots and witty aphorisms--\\"There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about,\\" \\"the only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it,\\" etc.In the original, uncensored version one can easily see from our \`unsuppressed' 21st century perspective that Wilde is writing about characters that are gay or bisexual. Even though Wilde was writing between and through the lines about these matters of sexual identity, it wasn't subtle enough to not be used as evidence against him in his trial for \`gross indecency' a few years later.From the perspective of someone outside Wilde's era, the novel is a strange, nightmarish parable of sexuality, youth, immortality and moral conscience. Without the sexual components, the novel is a strange neutered fable and attempts to heterosexualize it, as in the famous 1945 film version, only produce strangely asexual men with nebulous fetishes.It is Wilde's only novel and it is a brave, noble attempt. Its weaknesses, of which Wilde was aware, stem from his experience writing for the theater. There are pages of dialogue that could have easily been lifted from a page of script in which not a line of descriptive narration appears. On the other hand, there is an entire chapter in which there is no character interaction whatsoever, no dialogue, merely an extensive, descriptive catalog of the cultural stimuli that contribute to Dorian's dissipation.Upon reflection, one wonders if Wilde would have felt the need to write this novel in a less sexually repressed era. In our current day there would be thousands of opportunities for objective purgings of the darker impulses to be manifested not only through painting but numerous other visual media. Wilde would be one of many gay authors. The novel cannot be separate from the time in which it was created, however, and in the England of 1890, The Picture of Dorian Gray was an extremely daring shot in the face of Victorian social and cultural customs."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book is full of memorable lines. The conversations exchanged are witty and poignant. Definitely worth a read. A good intro into Wilde.I feel it is relevant to young readers struggling to define themselves in a morally ambiguous world.

He says aloud that he wishes he could stay young and beautiful, like in his portrait, and lo and behold, his wish comes true. He never grows old, but the man in his portrait (himself) does instead. He hides the portrait in the attic (his dirty secret), because he doesn't want anyone to see him growing old in the picture, and the story pretty much goes from there. This book is poetic in its writing, has a lot of witty commentary, and is a must for Wilde fans. All in all, I gave this story 4 out of 5 stars, only because I enjoyed his play much better... The Importance of Being Earnest. Regardless, if not for the plot, read it for the experience in exceptional writing."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This a well written unusual story with strong characters and definitely worth reading. Still, I would not rate this work of art as an excellent one. Its actuality for todays life is limited and, on my opinion, contains too much unbased social philosophy."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"about an old classic like Dorian Gray? Still entertaining after all these years. A bit wordy for the new crowd, but the lesson of the story is infinite."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Fantastic quotes and very poetically written book. Interesting story as well, definitely worth the read. I recommend taking a spin through the book"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Believe it or not, I had not heard of The Picture of Dorian Gray until the movie League of Extraordinaty Gentleman came out. I know, crazy right. No, I havn't lived under a rock my whole life. I don't know how i missed it. Well, after seeing the movie I rented every movie of The Picture of Dorian Gray I could find and fell in love with the story. Then I read the book... and fell in love with the writing.Reading the first chapter is like being swathed in wonderful writing from head too toe. I felt completely surrounded by it. You can almost feel the warmth of the garden, hear the sounds of the birds and dragonflies, and smell the beauty of the flowers as you sit and listen to this conversation between Harry and Basil. The writing is an immersive experince. And Basil's description of his first encounter with Dorian and the feelings that Dorian stirs in him, sound almost... romantic. At the least there's definately a bromance going on. And we also see the first crack of Dorian's facade in this chapter, which Basil's decsription of how Dorian sometiems seems purposefully cruel to him. Isn't it interesting, the first chapter ends with Harry demanding to meet Dorian and dragging Basil into the house and we haven't even met Dorian yet ourselves.As I read the book it occured to me that it could also have been titled the Influence of Lord Henry Wotten, for Harry's (as he's called by his friends) opinions and influence are as central to the story as Dorian Gray himself and more of a factor than the portrait itself. Hardly a scene goes by that Harry, whether present or not, is not quoted as an authority. It was as if he was the potter and Dorian was the clay. Harry was fully aware of his influence, and Dorian... Dorian seemed to be racing from one sensation to another like a spoiled child.This was by far one of the best written, most interesting stories I have read. I will read it over and over and would recommend it to everyone.STATS:Nook Pages: 240Genere: ClassicRe-readability: Very High"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I was curious about this book from another book I recently read. I first picked up the audiobook narrated by Edward Petherbridge (8 disks, BBC Audio, 1994/2010) from my Library, but I couldn't stand Edward's narration. He was terrible. He spoke really fast, then slow all of a sudden. He was british but it just was NOT working. It's was like Narrator ADD, and I just HAD to put the Audiobook down.Then I took out another AudioBook, narrated by Michael Page (7 disks, Brilliance Audio, 1995), and it was absolutely AMAZING!!! Michael does a wonderful job of keeping the pace and volume easy to follow and the words were British and clear. WOW!! Great job! I highly recommend Michael Page for all audio recordings.The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)Moving on to the story....It was great! It is definitely a Gothic classic. It is a story about a boy, Dorian Gray, who is beautiful beyond belief, but naive as well. He is first discovered by an artist, Basil and becomes the artist's muse. Basil paints the most wonderful, telling portraits, when Dorian sits for him. His work like never before. The artist has a friend, Henry, who is an absolute cynic. Henry thinks he is enlightened, but he is just a miserable existentialist mess! Dorian takes to Henry and they get close, thereby pulling Dorian away from Basil the artist.Henry is full of skepticism, and a deliberate, mean, philosophy on life that he expresses through twisted words and phrases. To Dorian, this is all new and he starts to look up to Henry, emulating him, and following his words. The Good, beautiful, kind, and chaste Dorian becomes a wicked, evil, manipulative, infamous character that everyone is afraid of. His good looks remain, through a portrait made by Basil.Just as Dorian is an inspiration for Basil's blank canvas, so is Henry an inspiration for Dorian's mind as a blank canvas.That is the story.But my summary won't really help you understand the book, you just have to read it.It's very interesting, and well written. I definitely find myself getting angry at some of the things said and done. I am repelled, I feel disgusted, I feel for the minor characters. I sympathize with Basil and I hate Henry. This book got me good.It is am absolutely one-of-a-kind novel I highly recommend you read. You might walk away feeling a little dirty inside, and questioning yourself as well."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Occasionally one reads a book that leaves a lasting impact in one's mind for the duration of a lifetime, and crops up at the most curious of times. \\"Dorian Gray\\" by the brilliant Oscar Wilde is such a one for this reviewer. While you are remaining curiously young and ageless to your friends and the world at large, your aging portrait hidden from all eyes is inspected by you alone as the years go by with some trepidation as the case may be, and as time marches on. Not only is your true appearance accurately portrayed in the picture, showing your actual physical age, but revealing in great detail your personality along with your good deeds and misdemeanors etched meticulously across the painting. When friends of mine sent word recently saying \\"Expect us to look younger since you saw us a decade ago!\\", I was quick to respond \\"I fully expect you to look your appropriate age, and far superior than when you were last here\\". Although this was meant as a note of humor on my part, the thought of Wilde's masterpiece came to mind immediately and the air around me was chilly for a moment. As for Dorian Gray when he attempts to alter and amend his portrait (which might be interpreted as his soul), I shall leave new readers to discover the results of such an enterprise for themselves. A powerful and magnificent novel by one of the greatest literary figures of all times."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"My first encounter with Mr. Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray has left me feeling my soul has been put under the microscope and I have been forced to look into those secret dark places that I keep hidden from the outside world. The language and attention to detail envelopes the reader and at times seems to go on for pages with no end in sight (the section on jewels and music for instance). I love this about Oscar Wilde's writing style. How deliciously dark and disturbing this book is. I am astonished it has taken me so long to read such a brilliant book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Set in the 1800's in the streets of London, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a haunting story of corruption brought unto Dorian Gray by the Lord Henry Wotton. Oscar Wilde explores the pleasures of life, beauty, and temptation through the character of Dorian who, one day realizes that his beauty will fade after Lord Henry's comments on Dorian's youth being captured perfectly: \\"Yes, there is nothing in the whole world I would not give! I would give my soul for that!\\" (Wilde 3). Dorian unknowingly offered his soul to the devil for his physical beauty in return, all his sins would be reflected in the painting.After his friend Basil, paints a masterpiece of Dorian, he tries to protect Dorian from Lord Henry's thinking and goals in life knowing where it would lead him. Although Hayward is only in the novel for a short time, his character inspired me to keep reading until the end where we can finally see how justice is served. Lord Henry Wotton, a friend of Basil Halyward, who grudgingly introduced him to Dorian. Lord Henry is the character you love to hate; he is such a perfect character, you can sense that something is wrong with him.The young and handsome Dorian Gray is the main protagonist who made me rethink my future and how I looked at life. Although very rich and in good social standing, he chooses to hang out in the slums of London in opium dens and around the docks, symbolizing his sins and where his values lie. The way Oscar Wilde characterizes Dorian gives a vivid and accurate picture of a good boy gone bad.The principal theme of this novel is that self-worship leads to self-destruction, this is one of the main themes that pulled me into reading this book. However, another theme that goes hand-in-hand with the previous one is living a double life. Many speculate Oscar Wilde used this as one of his themes because he was inspired by the story; The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde written by Robert Louis Stevenson.Although written over 120 years ago, this book is a must have and should be in every library across the world or on your shelf. This amazing read forcibly opens your mind to imagine every detail and corner of this story you can feel yourself get lost, just be careful you don't end up in an opium den!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is real entertainment. You have debauchery, murder, a love story that isn't really one, a main character that you both like and hate, and some kind of supernatural thing going on (usually not my cup of tea, but this case is the exception of the rule.) The best part of the book was that I kept wanting to know what happened next, and there were enough twists and turns to be interesting, yet still believable. I highly recommend this!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I read this when I was in High School and read it again now and I still see Oscar as a genius.

While the plays spark with wit and wisdom, with humour and satirical fun, Dorian Gray is of another class entirely. It is a serious look at the consequences of immorality, of vanity and greed and selfishness. And it does not flinch to paint the 'picture' in all of its gory details. It's contemporary today, as proved by a recent film adaptation (starring the drool-worthy Ben Barnes) which was quite accurately adapted from the book and is, to my mind, required reading. Or should be."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Just adding my two cents to a list of great reviews.I love British literature, and Oscar Wilde is a lot of fun. I read this book fairly quickly, it seemed that the text flowed well and the subject matter and characters held my interest. It is a lovely novel about vanity and envy.

Along with Dorian, I do wonder if he could have reversed it, if he had cared enough to try.

His reccomendation was so promising that I was eager to get this book. After about a week I was in a bookshop and I saw this book, immediatly I had to buy it, and it was so cheap.I've read it in a week or so, and after I finished it, I opened the first page and began reading again - thats how marvelous this book is. The dialogues are so thrilling and full of witty but thought provoking aphorisms, especially from Lord Henry (one of the characters). For example: \\"I am too fond of reading books to care to write them.\\",\\"Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing.\\" ,\\"Humanity takes itself too seriously. It is the world's original sin. If the cave-man had known how to laugh, History would have been different.\\"Wilde writes so naturally, with no stifness and with so much humour!I won't go into the subject matter because you can get that anywhere on google. But I will tell you that this novel made me a fan of Wilde and also made me read more of his work!Next week I plan on getting his plays (also from Oxford World's Classics, because they put so much to provide you with a good introduction, chronology and resources about the book, and the format is beautiful and easy too read).It's not hard cover, but I like it better as a paperback, it is not thick and you can take it anywhere with you, and its cover and design is unique."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"It deals with a commonly met theme in literature, the wish of men to stay forever young.

However, it's a classic, even if parts of the book are disappointing. Nevertheless, the beauty of the prose and the depth of Wilde's words are such that one can't fault the author for not living up to the standards he set for himself. If you're an astute reader and care to analyze the text, the points made by Wilde can change your life and why this book is a must read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The book reminds me of other great stories--Faust, Dr. Jeckell and Mr. Hyde, Macbeth--where the main character's corrupt longings become his or her undoing. Dorian Gray searched for immortality through immorality and discovered that it fails to deliver.Wilde presents biblical passages on occasion--usually scornfully--the last of which serves as an apt summary for the whole book. Lord Henry asked Dorian, \\"What does it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul?\\" (Mark 8:36). A rhetorical question that pricked Dorian's conscience.I think if we're honest, none of us can bear to stare at our own portrait. We either try to cover it or knife it--anything but face it! In that sense, the portrait is a mirror. But the picture frame is also a window. It reveals the reality of any life that seeks to gain the world through a compromise of character.Basil's dying words are worth repeating: \\"It is never too late, Dorian. Let us kneel down and see if we cannot remember a prayer.\\""},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I knew what this story was about long before finally reading it. That's probably common. The famous premise is a fascinating one, though I found myself wondering if the narrative would have been even more impactful if written as a short story or novella length rather than stretched out to a full novel. The Lord Henry character who serves the purpose of putting bad ideas in Dorian's head gives multiple speeches throughout detailing his hedonistic world view. If the number or word count of these lectures was cut in half I don't think the story would suffer much from the absence. Another decision made by Oscar Wilde was not to show readers very much of Dorian's behavior. His first act of cruelty is laid out before us as is his final one, but in between we are only told that his bad reputation precedes him without being shown what he has done to earn it. It's left to our imagination. A few more scenes exhibiting decadent behavior rather than various dinner party conversations in which a pro decadence philsophy is expressed would have made for a juicier read. Would it have made for a better read? That's arguable, as perhaps it also is whether this book is intententially homoerotic or simply written during a time when heterosexual men were much more comfortable going on and on about how good looking a guy was. What's beyond debate is that Oscar Wilde came up with a great idea to build a story around, one that is as timeless as the desire for eternal youth."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY is a very dark tale of vanity, debauchery, drug use, murder and depression. When a nave and stunningly handsome young man unknowingly trades soul for eternal youth and beauty with a wish caught by the devils ear, he inevitably finds that physical perfection, charm and pleasures of the flesh are worth not at the cost of ones soul.Is this classic an enjoyable read?... that's a tough one to answer for such a ominous story , but I will say it's an interesting one that holds some entertaining characters and introduces many thought provoking ideas. Obviously THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY is far from the best piece of literature I've ever experienced, but for me it was worth the short time it took to read, if for nothing else but for the appreciation of Oscar Wilde's famed wit."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The digital version (free) is quite good.

I saw the movie and decided to read it again and it never failed to entertain"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is my first Oscar Wilde book, and I finished the book very happy that I had read it. Dorian Gray is a young man, who has an incredible presence, due to his innocence and uncorrupted state of mind. We are introduced to him through painter Basil Howard, who is inspired by the young man. His acquaintance, Lord Henry Wotton, wants to meet the beautiful young man, and that is how Dorian Gray's demise begins.Everyone probably knows the premise of the book. Where this beautiful young man has a painting that ages, while the Dorian Gray never goes through the aging process that everyone around him inevitably goes through. The portrayal of how one changes over the course of a lifetime is seen through the life of Dorian Gray, as well as the portrait, which becomes more hideous over time.I did not give this book five stars, because I was disappointed in the character development of Dorian Gray. I feel that Lord Henry (Harry) was fully developed through his \\"musings\\" which are common throughout the book, yet the book's namesake sometimes seems to disappears into the background.The Kindle version seems to be complete (at least to someone who has never read the book before).

Oscar Wilde inhis introductory poetry says: Those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are cultivated.\\"One can't say that this novel is beautiful,but there is an element of eternal truth that even in ugliness has great virtue."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"this is one of the most accessible period novels i've ever read. the style of the storytelling is very conversational... indeed sometimes it seems like the main point is to showcase the conversations, especially the ones with Lord Henry in them, who is very quotable. i read that oscar wilde used to think of his witticisms ahead of time and then try to steer the conversations to a place where he could say them in public, and i guess there's no conversation more artfully directed where you want it than one you write yourself.the basic story is one that most people know before they pick up the book, but the descriptive style and the snappy dialogue are interesting enough that it doesn't matter. the only real flaw is that it seems like a lot of the book is missing towards the end... the story wraps up a little too quickly and the descriptions of dorian's descent into depravity is really beautiful but also incredibly vague and so that kind of helps to flatten the pacing near the end.overall i'd highly recommend this book, especially for lazy-reading. it has that kind of dreamlike quality to it."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Dorian Gray is very good novel, but it suffers from soapbox syndrome. The writing is accessible, even to those who tend to dislike more old-styled English writing, and the plot is certainly among the greatest ideas in literature. However, the character of Lord Henry, who carries a great deal of the novel, often goes on seemingly unending rants of his views on life and they bring the book down quite a bit. With these discourses, the book loses development in favor of pseudo-philosophy in a clever if rough attempt to both attract and repulse the reader. There is a mid-chapter in the book that describes the middle of Dorian's life that is absolute work to make your way through. The philosophy of the book is important of course, but it's much better when the story lends itself for the purpose. Overall, for the brilliance of the idea of the story; it's required reading."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book surprised me with its Gothic horror and surprising plot twists toward the end. This novel, for all its horrible philosophy on life, captures in a poignant way a lost person's search for fulfillment. Despite his indulgent quest for all kinds of pleasure, Dorian is still unfulfilled and in one of the most captivating passages of the book turns to opium to forget life. His descent into the opium den is characterized as a descent into hell, a personal hell which he has brought himself to and in which everyone sees through him and is against him.Though I wasn't a big fan at the beginning, as the book progressed I think it may have become one of the most memorable books I've read. The theme of the book is sin - its putrefying effect both on the sinner and those around him. One of the best moments of the book and one that sticks vividly in my mind is towards the end, when Dorian, sick of seeing his portrait so mangled and distorted by the sins he has already committed, does a \\"good deed\\" in order to try to start to clean it up. He races up the stairs, unlocks the secret room where his portrait is hidden, throws back the cover, and is faced with the same ugliness that had been there before. Then he is faced with a horrible realization of truth: because he had done the \\"good deed\\" out of motivation of making his own portrait/soul look better, he hadn't done a \\"good deed\\" at all and was now so deep in his depravity that even what he calls love has been warped into an all-encompassing egotism.Dorian's egotism gets progressively deeper. throughout the book. As Lord Henry says, It begins as innocent narcissism, but as it grows it begins to shunt blame for the sin of others and even motivates the good he does at the end of the book. Rather than his heavy sins bothering Dorian, \\"it was the living death of his own soul that troubled him\\" (226). His breakup with the young country girl was motivated more out of a desire to cleanse his portrait from its grime than any love for her, \\"for in hypocrisy he had worn the mask of goodness. For curiosity's sake he had tried the denial of self\\" (228). Being able to view his sin on the portrait in a sense made it more difficult to be selfless - \\"nothing makes one so vain as being told that one is a sinner. Conscience makes egotists of us all\\" (106) - and Dorian recognized this difficulty.The idea of pleasure in Dorian Gray is portrayed as a goal to pursue but never reach. \\"A cigarette is the perfect type of a perfect pleasure. It is exquisite, and it leaves one unsatisfied\\" (84). Despite Dorian's pursuit of pleasure (and pleasure of the most exquisite kind) he ends us dissatisfied and empty, jaded to the idea of the fullness of life. He is encouraged on by the influence of Lord Henry, who gives advice such as: \\"The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it,\\" (21) and \\"sin is the only real color-element left in modern life\\" (31). Dorian is quickly influenced by Lord Henry's philosophy, aping to everyone else Lord Henry's views and words and acting out on them by plunging into the pits of hedonism.The portrait itself is a mirror of Dorian's soul. It was a \\"visible emblem of conscience\\" (96). As Lord Henry's pleasure seeking philosophy takes hold in Dorian's mind, he sees that \\"eternal youth, infinite passion, pleasures subtle and secret, wild joys and wilder sins - he was to have all of these things. The portrait was to bear the burden of his shame; that was all\\" (109). However, in with a horrible fascination, Dorian \\"grew more and more enamored of his own beauty, more and more interested in the corruption of his own soul\\" (131) for \\"what the worm was to the corpse, his sins would be to the painted image on the canvas. They would mar its beauty, and eat away its grace. They would defile it, and make it shameful. And yet the thing would still live on. It would be always alive\\" (122). Even though \\"the leprosies of sin were slowly eating the thing away\\" (161) the portrait held on to its life of decay, just as Dorian held on to pleasure, refusing to be cleansed and beautiful again until Dorian's death.Quotes:\\"She was free in her prison of passion\\" (65).\\"She tried to look picturesque, but only succeeded in being untidy\\" (49).\\"There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about\\" (4).\\"Discord is to be forced to be in harmony with others.

The prose is admirable, the characters are compelling, and the whole book is full of obvious and implied vice. This book, after having been taken to heart, is probably capable of reforming any provincial folk into cosmopolitan epicures."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is one the masterpieces of the English language. A unique plot, the portait of Dorian Gray aging instead of Dorian Gray and writen in aperfect manner that few writers have/had the capability of doing.

Read it."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"For the past several years, I continually heard the name \\"Dorian Gray\\". As curiosity got the best of me, I finally looked this person up on the Internet. Finding that Dorian Gray was the main character of a most elaborate and interesting tale, enthralled me. Therefore, I set out to read this novel. From the preface alone, I was spellbound and couldn't put the book down.Lord Henry, with his quips and one-liners literally made me think twice. His tranquil ability to convince anyone of anything, sans Basil Hallward, amazed me. Although, I did find a few opinions of Lord Henry to ring true, for the most part I found myself thinking: \\"He's absolutely correct. Oh, wait! That's completely immoral and self-indulgent!\\" Needless to say, Lord Henry was my favorite character in the book.This book truly puts one's own life into perspective. It makes one think, and re-think of the importance of being true to only oneself without influence of others. As Lord Henry said it best: \\"Because to influence a person is to give him one's own soul. He does not think his natural thoughts, or burn with his natural passions. His virtues are not real to him. His sins, if there are such things as sins, are borrowed. He becomes an echo of some one else's music, an actor of a part that has not been written for him. The aim of life is self-development. To realize one's nature perfectly - that is what each of us is here for. People are afraid of themselves, nowadays. They have forgotten the highest of all duties, the duty that one owes to oneself\\"."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I thought this book was amazing. While the writing for some might be difficult at first, the later chapter are the ones that capture the imagination. The morals of Lord Henry might seem somewhat selfish and shallow, but I guarantee his quotes will make their way back to reader's head. This is definitely the most influencial book I have read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is one of the greatest books of our time. It is over one hundred years old, but has aged gracefully and is still easily understood and as relevant to matters of life now as it was when it was first published. Though there have been many imitations of it and many film depictions of it, none of them do justice to the real thing. This timeless classic follows the development of a teenager, Dorian Gray, into manhood as the people that he calls his friends corrupt his soul. This is symbolized in a portrait that Gray hides, which was painted by the man who was perhaps his only good-hearted friend, Basil, who later met his untimely demise. Along with the exceptional plot and surprising twist at the end comes the message that Oscar Wilde cunningly imparts to the reader: One must be master of oneself because outside influences often disfigure one down to the deepest part of their soul. On top of all this, the book is also simply well written and entertaining. It is enjoyable because Wilde uses his mastery of everything from satire to suspense to convey his message and an extraordinarily compelling plot to the reader. You should read this book if you are looking for new knowledge, literature with a deep message, or simply a good time. This edition is especially helpful because it has a glossary for the meanings of some older words and supplementary reading written by Oscar Wilde."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"One of my favorite books. I've read it again and again. Just make sure you don't get an abridged version. Read the whole thing."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde is a witty and brilliant writer, and his only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray, is a treasure. One of it's best aspects is something another reviewer mislabeled as a flaw, that every viewpoint presented by Wilde is contradicted in another part of the book. This is absolutely brilliant. By building an entire book out of contradictions, the reader can take absolutely any message they want from the book, or no message at all. It meet Wilde's goal (if indeed anything Wilde said can be taken seriously - remember that the paradoxical Henry Wotton is basically a fictional version of Wilde) of \\"art for art's sake,\\" but it can just as easily be a morality tale for anyone that wants one. Henry Wotton can either be the worst kind of villain or a quite harmless and likeable chap who a dumb kid took too seriously.So read this book for it's witty and memorable dialogue, mostly from Henry Wotton. Read it for the shocking (at least at the time) tale of Dorian Gray. Read it for the myriad meanings you can take from it. Just don't skip it because it doesn't have one, consistent message. Anyone can write a message. It takes a genius to write a collection of messages that perfectly balance and disprove one another."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Of all the fears that creep into a man's heart,the most disturbing is the fear of one's own self. A man may evade the whole world but can't deny his conscience and as William Shakespeare remarks somewhere,\\"Conscience doth make coward of us all\\". One may accomlish painting goodliness on one's visage but would never be able to blend his soul in a similar fashion. The whispers of the soul about one's past sins and misdeeds keep lingering in one's heart.And that's precisely the theme of Oscar Wilde's only novel \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\". It is a telling tale about a stunningly handsome,almost beautiful,man's bizzare idiosyncracy of authoring his own tragic doom,about how a youth so splendidly bestowed with beauty,wealth,royalty and women could get sucked in by the myriad forces that he himself gave rise to,about a man's confused,complex frame of mind.Dorian Gray is that ultimate effigy of an ideal youth gifted with all arts and talents. He's the instinctive and eternal source of inspiration,\\"simply a motive in art\\" to his friend,artist Basil Hallward. The backdrop is the gentry and the royalty class of London during the late 19th. century and the Irish writer's genius lies in exploiting this landscape to picture in words and absolutely ethereal imageries man's obscure desires. Dorian becomes obsessed with his portrait traced by Basil and in the general flow of the tyde,conceives an unimaginable notion:to remain forever young whilst the portrait may wither! Indeed such a wish lurks deep inside everyone and so does the realisation o its fruitlessness. But for once,at least in fiction,the fantasy is translated into truth,a dark,troublesome truth.Evey novel,and for that matter every incident,requires a certain spark to unfold a series of actions to conglomerate into a rare item called literature. That urge in \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is impelled by Lord Henry Wotton, a cynical and witty man just ten years older than Dorian,whose eloquent gush of words \\"touched some secret chord\\" in Dorian's heart and sets it \\"vibrating and throbbing to curious impulses\\". The philosophies and crisp remarks by Lord Wotton about life in general and youth in particular push the youth onto his demise.Supernaturally Doian Gray's desire to remain young for good does manufacture itself into a fascinating reality but there's nothing called free lunch under the sun. Commencing from the time when Dorian turns an implicit murderer of his lover Sibyl Vane through the constant denudation of principles and character in the subsequent fourty or so years culminating in him murdering his friend Basil,Dorian stays protected under the shade of evergreen youth whilst his portrait consistently deteriorates and ages---it even turns a mirror of Dorian's own soul with dark contours signifying the crimes committed by him lining its entire figure and in his attempt to relieve himself of the picture,and with it his hideous sins,the eponymous potagonist brings about his own end.The theme of \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is singled out to be about how we get disturbed by our own souls but there're other ideas webbed in as well. That the author Oscar Wilde had an inclination towards gay culture is of course a subtle truth and this is ever so slightly pictured in Basil Hallward's unassuming and suspicious admiration of Dorian. The general occurrences in the gentry society and invokation to women's feelings too are colossaly and humourously penned down superadded by a streak of confusing and often conflicting ideas of life that never falter.There was never really a Faust who sold his soul to the Devil but it was actually Goethe's authorical magic that made it seem so. There was never really a Dorian Gray who exchanged peace for youth but it's actually Oscar Wilde's staunch belief that \\"it is the spectator,and not life,that art really mirrors\\" that materialiases into a concrete portrayal of life in fiction. After reading Emile Bronte's \\"Wuthering Heights\\",we rue that the authoress never composed any other novel and similarly after imbibing the charisma of \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\",which just remains on the margins of a psychological insight into a man's nature,we regret that we can't lay our hands on another classic by this wonderful,wonderful writer."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Almost from the day that this novel was first published in serial form it has caused controversy and debate. It was immediately condemned as an immoral work that did not follow the custom of showing that evil deeds would in the end bring punishment to the evil doer. Just those evil deeds, which were acted out by Dorian Gray, were enough in themselves to scandalize Victorian society. Then, just as his novel was about to be published in book form Oscar Wilde added fuel to the fire by adding a preface that seemed to indicate that there was absolutely no hidden meaning or moral lesson to be found in this book. Apparently, according to the preface, it was simply art for the sake of art. The fires have raged ever since and I'm sure that the author's spirit has enjoyed every second of it.The fact is that the reader can read almost anything he wants to into this work and there have been almost as many interpretations as there have been readers. I found myself intrigued by a passage that is spoken very early in the book by the artist who has painted the now famous picture. This painter, Basil Hallward by name, tells a friend that, \\"every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not the sitter. The sitter is merely the accident, the occasion. It is not he who is revealed by the painter; it is rather the painter who, on the colored canvas, reveals himself.\\" Just what might this book have revealed about Oscar Wilde? Or could this book have been a dark commentary on London's high society of which Wilde does not paint a pretty picture? Maybe this book was indeed as written Wilde wrote in his preface and he had no deep purpose but just wanted to tell a good story. Better minds than mine have pondered this question and have arrived at no conclusive answer to the problem. I have however learned one important thing about this book as I have read it. That being that if one reads this book without worrying about it's implications they will find it a very enjoyable read.Dorian Gray is first introduced to the reader as a young man who was exquisitely handsome and wealthy but he had had a rough childhood. The thing he remembers most about the Grandfather who raised him in such a harsh manner was that he was old. This may well have played into what became of the young man although he would almost certainly not have sank to such depths of depravity had he not met Lord Henry Wotton. For the life of me I can not fathom what Dorian Gray saw in Lord Henry for he comes across as a loathsome, self-centered, tiresome know it all. Gray however becomes enamored of Wotton however and slowly adopts Wotton's theories of pleasing oneself no matter the consequences to others.The real change begins in Gray after an act of particular curliness for which he is already feeling sorry when he arrives home. It is not long until he notices a change in his recently finished portrait, a portrait that was in the beginning as handsome as Gray but suddenly was marred by a cruel mouth. Gray couldn't believe his eyes but suddenly it dawns on him that this picture will bear the scars of his sins and of the passing years. He himself will remain forever young and beautiful no matter how he conducts his life. As I mentioned above, some critics bemoaned the lack of punishment for Gray's acts but I found that there were indeed consequences for his actions. By the end of the book, Gray has become almost mad from the knowledge of his sins and actually seems to long for death. The very picture that has given him eternal youth haunts his every thought for he knows that the picture shows the wretched condition of his soul. That is about all that I believe I can say without giving away the ending and I hate people who do that.Overall I enjoyed this book but Wilde's characters were given to long tedious philosophical pronouncements that only added to my detestation of these pompous blow hards. I can't say that I would rank this book among the all time classics and much of the time the reader will not be able to locate a plot with a team of bloodhounds. Still, if you can get through the dry areas there is often a rich oasis waiting on the other side."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wilde's only novel contains some of the greatest dialogue of any literature written in the english language. There are few books that could be considered more quotable, and even fewer that could be considered more insightful. The novel is enjoyable even upon a cursory reading, but its splendor is revealed only when it is studied. Wilde reveals so much of himself in his art, and through reading of Wilde's biographies, plays, and the literature that inspired him, the reader becomes intimate with Oscar, and is able to understand him more throughly than most authors would allow from a study of their work. This is a piece I have truly enjoyed, and continues to be one of the premier pieces of English literature."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book, which I read quite some time ago but will never cease to love, is a beautiful horror story. The language, the surroundings, even the characters, are gorgeous, but at the same time, everything about them is frightening, and even a little grotesque. Lord Henry is utterly cynical, continually saying things one can never be quite sure he means or is only saying. Dorian is corrupted and horrible, and yet at the same time, one almost thinks he may suddenly stop and try to turn back. Basil is one of the only pure characters in the book, and his devotion to Dorian is sweet, but at the same time, one just /knows/ it will will cause something bad to happen to him--as, ultimately, it does.This book is a very satisfying read, although some people might be disturbed by the content, which is rather mature. Besides that, the homosexual subtext runs rampant waving a Dorian's picture. This may bother some people, although not yours truly. :)Personally, I think it's excellent. If you liked Victor Hugo's style, but would rather not hear historic digressions; if you liked Crime and Punishment's moral conflicts, but were highly irritated by the happy ending; if you enjoyed The Invisible Man's supernatural circumstances but would have been satisfied without the scientific explanations, then go forth ye and read Picture of Dorian Gray. (...)"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde's 'The Picture of Dorian Gray' is an exceptional novel. Through this novel Mr. Wilde presents many characteristics of the human heart and mind. It hits hard telling the truth of the way in which people really are. Mr. Wilde in his novel asks the question how far would one go to obtain beauty and youth forever to please society? And in doing so presents the desires of most humans to remain young forever and the lengths in which they might go to obtain it. This novel illustrates the obession society has with the outward appearance rather than the inward and is shown in the novel by the Dorian Gray being accepted into the 'circle' despite the 'rumors' that he is a bad man. Through Dorian Gray and Lord Henry Mr. Wilde also illustrates the influence of people over people. Resulting in the destruction of character.I enjoyed the book Dorian Gray because of the fact that it does tell the truth and quite often people don't like to hear the truth, but Oscar Wilde went against what society would view as good and did and wrote what he believed, which makes an wonderful novel."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I decided to be the FIRST to review this one here. Haha, go me.Picture of Dorian Gray is a great work of fiction. Its interplay of Hellenic thought and Judaeo-Christian ethics was light years ahead of its time, even though it might come across muddled to the casual reader. Perhaps, this novel was too far ahead of its time, as it was eventually used as evidence against Wilde in two court cases for 'gross indecency' in 1895.It is a simple story; really, Basil Hallward paints a lovely portrait of Dorian Gray, a veritable Adonis. As the Painter puts the finishing touches upon this portrait, Gray is involved with a conversation regarding the nature of beauty with Lord Henry (Harry) Wotton. This culminates in Dorian wishing and praying that his beauty may never diminish; that he'd have eternal youth. Ultimately, the painting would bear all of the marks of sin, decadence, and decay that cause our physical bodies to age, while Dorian kept his stunning good looks. Wilde brings about a rather wonderful conclusion, and it is a very enjoyable story.The Picture of Dorian Gray has its dull parts. It doesn't remain current, and I'd suggest getting a copy with notes, so that you may be able to keep up with all of the references. Let's be honest, in 2004 who really cares about what was fashionable in 19th century France? These are questions the notes can clarify, and make some of the references more amiable. Still there are parts where Wilde just lists things, and these you should skip.When reading this novel, I think it becomes clear that the three main personalities are a reflection of society at that time. While Basil Hallward seemed to personify Christian conservatism, and a mundane attachment to the status quo, Lord Henry is the questioning romantic, a character that seems to argue everything yet prove nothing, and believe in even less. This makes him no less interesting, and I believe Wilde may have included him as a farce of some of his contemporaries, yet some of the best insights and quotes actually come from Lord Henry.Dorian is the romantic ideal of perfection. Though a horrible character that fears no consequences for his actions, he still remains perfection. I think that aristocratic England valued physical appearance, social wit, and worldliness more than an ethical life.Dorian Gray also typifies Wilde's affections for Hellenic culture. Dorian is the stereotypical Greek Tragic Hero. He has a flaw; his vanity; this flaw leads to his downfall; a life of sin; he realizes his flaw in the end, and tries to make amends, but it is too little too late. If you enjoy Shakespeare Allusions, you will enjoy this.I really liked The Picture of Dorian Gray, but I will not advise one way or the other whether you should read it or not. If you want something stimulating that will have an enormity of good quotes that will make your dominating intellect seem even more so to the untrained eye, then check it out. If you're looking for pulp go check out Tom Clancey or Danielle Steele."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wilde gives a new definition to the good. Dorian Gray's problem, despite the fact all his sin is transmited to a painting, art reminds him of the good, and this reminding is enough to be in discord with himself. I don't feel, as some suggest, that Dorian regreted his wish of eternal youth and beauty, but the images of the painting, art itself, drove him crazy - his self doubt. The art showed his inauthentic life, how his feelings and actions were not in harmony. In De Profundis Wilde talks about Jesus' criticism of the Pharasee for studying, but not living what they know - they have no feeling for life, they are souless driviling intellects. Dorian\`s cognizance of his own inauthentic soulless profanatory abject self did him in, he died killing the reminder of his splintered self, and of the frustrations of being an aesthetically induced schizopherenic. Wotton's warning was that conscience makes egoists of us all. Is it the dualistic nature of conscience that drives Dorian to kill himself, not regret? In the end he desires to do good, but is it? Can he? Is he? Wilde, the master of Paradox, leaves some poignant questions, if not eschatological questions, availab.le to be thought upon. Wilde is highlighting the importance of art as truth and art as a mirror, but in the end who is the mirror? Art makes reality, as far as reality is a truth anyway, a perception of truth and reality that is more meaningful than these nonexistant abstracts. But then there is sin to ponder on, is it real? Wilde would say so."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"After reading Dorian Gray, it took numerous books to accept that not all authors can have the genius and prose gifted to Wilde. Dorian's journey of making his life an art, exploring issues such as hedonism, sin, conceit, deceit and youth is an unforgettable one, and this book has lingered on in my mind since I first read it, and I think will continue to do so forever. The best book I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Over 100 years later and still a very popular book, this speaks for itself.

He wishes that he--not the painting--will remain forever young and beautiful, while the painting ages and decays. Dorian's wish comes true and it is the painting that not only shows his age, but also all his sins. Oscar Wilde crafted not only a brilliant horror novel, but also a treatise on art and reality. Despite the claims of Lord Henry, art does reveal the truths of life. The painting reveals the true soul of Dorian Gray. When Dorian's beloved actress discovers true love (not the dramatic imitation), she is no longer able to participate in the elevated dramas on the stage. Then she loses Dorian's love. A book is what fully corrupts Dorian and causes him to live a life of sin. This is a story of the inability to bring truth and art together.

I never did, but thought I would give it a try as I really enjoy dry British wit and intelligent prose. Beyond that, I wasn't sure what else I was expecting, but for my tastes, I didn't end up entirely satisfied.The opening 10 or 20 pages insinuated themselves into my imagination and I felt that I would be entertained by the main characters throughout the rest of the novel. The detailed descriptions of the lovely country setting and extravagant flowers gives one an impression of decadence and a high society jadedness that I somehow expected from Oscar Wilde, having read none of his previous work. Unfortunately, the remainder of the novel didn't hold as much pleasure for me.Dorian Grey is a relatively uninteresting central character who is but a blank canvas for Lord Henry to experiment upon; Dorian's own thoughts and musings are not so compelling in and of themselves and yet we are treated to quite a few pages of them throughout. Lord Henry himself is an interesting character whose mean-spiritedness, which approaches evil in some instances, is obscured by his verbose bantering on half-baked, jaundiced observations on Victorian life. These also consume considerable paper stock, and as witty as his musings start out (his thoughts on marriage were particularly humorous to me), they start to run together and become somewhat of a misshapen lump through which I felt I was slogging at times.Anyway, the story is relatively well known to most at this point, regardless of whether you have read the book in question or not. It progresses more or less as one might assume, which is not entirely a bad thing (I would not classify this tale as a mystery or as a horror novel, a genre to which I see it is sometimes curiously attributed). Oscar Wilde is definitely saying something here, and there seem to be many elements of allegory contained within the story. I have read that he saw parts of himself within all three of the main characters, and they do seem to represent different facets of a single personality. Unfortunately these same characters are hamstrung by this very fact, as they each seem only part of a personality, part of a character, and not well rounded or believable in their motivations or actions.This is the first Oscar Wilde I have attempted to read, and I won't say it is my last, but there are classics of English literature which are as well written, more engrossing, and, in the end, more memorable, at least to this reader (\\"Silas Marner\\" comes to mind as a fine book I only just recently read for the first time as well).So, overall, about 3 stars from me. In my opinion it poses some interesting questions, sparkles in a few spots, and held my attention for a few hours, but it's not something I would return to or recommend for pleasurable reading.As a side note, I am somewhat surprised by the criticisms of the homoerotic nature of the relationships portrayed within the novel. Wilde portrayed the passionate nature of what amounts to a love triangle in a very effective (if slightly florid) way, and, as has been noted before, the relationships between the men seem more genuine and believable than those involving the fairer sex. Maybe this type of undertone would be out of place in a Hemingway novel but good grief it's Oscar Wilde! Scratch beneath the surface and read about where this man was coming from and the times in which he lived and worked."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"this book is interesting and deep as it delves into the desires of man. the notes provided are helpful and add more to the overall quality of Wilde's own words"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I read this book(translated to the portuguese), here in Brazil about twenty years ago.Being writen in XIX century, this novel remains a classic book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wilde's literary genious is evident throughout.

His only novel, Oscar Wilde's satire of the upper class in late 19th century Britain mocks their vapid lifestyle, while at times glorying in it, though the story arc comes from the tradition of Edgar Allan Poe. The combination is both delicious and shocking. \\"Picture\\" is also a veritable gold mine, or should I say minefield, of ironic aphorisms, most of them emanating from the mind and mouth of Gray's friend and mentor Sir Henry Wooten, who is kind of like Michael Scott of \\"The Office\\", except with a functioning brain.Brilliantly written, entertaining and thought provoking, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" stands highly recommended to readers young and old. It's sad that Wilde lived at a time when homosexuals were persecuted, in his case prosecuted, even moreso than they are now. A giant of 19th century literature could have contributed well into the 20th century, but died penniless, estranged from his birthplace in Ireland, and home in England, at the age of 46 in the year 1900."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray was a quick, easy and enjoyable read. I knew the very basic premise of the story from watching the 2003 movie, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. I also had a lot of wrong preconceived notions because of the the movie.The Picture of Dorian Gray was less supernatural in nature than I expected. Other than not aging and having the picture age for him, Dorian was a regular guy. When given the opportunity to live his life without his behavior marring his beauty, he chose debauchery. I found myself thinking, who wouldn't? He tried to experience everything the world has to offer (a noble pursuit) and finds that life can become pointless without boundaries.Dorian's friend, Harry, is the absolute shining star of this novel. He counsels Dorian in the way of the world, full of his own theories and cynical viewpoints. He's humorous and more often than not, what he says makes a lot of sense.The one thing I disliked about The Picture of Dorian Gray was that it seemed like the most interesting pieces of the story were missing. Oscar Wilde was very vague about exactly why Dorian actually did in the years he spent corrupting his soul. People who were once his friends couldn't stand to be in the same room as him and no explanation was given. Perhaps in 1890, when the book was published, saying that he did vile, cruel, disgusting things was enough. Now, 120 years later, I need more. I need to know and it still bugs me that I don't know what Wilde was alluding to."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Beautiful and lyrical told with biting wit.

I AM ALSO A HUGE BEN BARNES FAN"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Most people never truly contemplate the real meaning of beauty. It has an alluring quality that cannot be fully understood, even in an abstract form. One of English author Oscar Wilde's motivations was to write a work that praises beauty as an art but simultaneously reveals its darker nature. That is what I believe he attempts to accomplish in his sole novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray. The work is set in late 19th century London at a time when the cultural excesses of the Victorian era reached their zenith. Infused with elements of Gothic horror, it is a work of Symbolist prose, the Symbolists being a group of literary luminaries who sought to glorify beauty and aesthetic decadence almost as a kind of spiritualism. Wilde is no doubt part of this new endeavor to perceive beauty in an innovative fashion, and he objectively promotes a rather original world outlook through the dynamic characters he creates.The Picture of Dorian Gray is built upon an interesting premise. A local artist named Basil Hallward is fully enamored by the subject of his latest portrait, the eponymous Dorian Gray. Basil, like almost everyone else, is impressed by Dorian's pulchritude and handsome features. As Dorian indulges Basil by sitting for a portrait, another one of Basil's friends, a dignified aristocrat named Lord Henry Wotton, enters and, he too, takes a tremendous liking for the vigorous youth. Later, Dorian holds a discussion with Henry about senility and Wotton reveals to him his hedonistic worldview: \\"To me, beauty is the wonder of wonder. It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances. The true mystery of the world lies in the visible, not the invisible. [...] A new Hedonism--that is what our century wants. You might be its visible symbol. With your personality there is nothing you could not do.\\" With this in mind, Dorian upholds a new creed by swearing that youth is the only noble quality worth possessing; he would rather have Basil's new portrait of him age in exchange for remaining eternally young. Consequently, Dorian proceeds to engage in every sort of pleasurable vice possible, while the picture of himself hanging in his room slowly decays. The plot proceeding from this point forward holds up well, though the climatic conclusion may seem clich&eacute; in light of the Gothic horror stories that many readers are acquainted with.Wilde does a splendid job of displaying a tone of biting sarcasm. His clever use of wit and double entendre to reveal introspective truths with all the effort he can muster is one of his valiant triumphs. Dorian's lust for sensual pleasure reveals the author's taste as an aesthete and suggests another aspect of the novel's motifs, that of duplicity. Dorian leads a double life by interacting with aristocratic high society during the day and indulging his senses at night. This dualism of Dorian's character underscores the dramatic complexity of his inner struggles.Dorian Gray can be seen as a man willing to exchange his very soul for what he craves. He candidly discards his reputation and eventually risks his life for his lofty desires, which is reminiscent of the Faust legend. Wilde's protagonist is not very remorseful for his debauchery and is constantly being manipulated by his friend and confidant, Henry Wotton. Ultimately, Dorian is a tragic hero participating in an Aristotelian tragedy where he is subtly cognizant of his impending doom and experiences multiple catastrophes. His hamartia proves to be his downfall.While every work of fiction has its shortcomings, Dorian Gray's are minimal. The author exhibits a delightful candor in his narration and characterization, and his nuanced writing style is replete with metaphorical and psychological analyses of flawed individuals. No bookstore should ever be complete without a copy of The Picture of Dorian Gray adorning its bookshelves."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"It's amazing how Wilde's words continue to ring so true in this day and age.

During his portraiture, Gray meets Lord Henry Wotton, who preaches self-indulgence and the high social value, yet lamentable ephemerality, of youth. Influenced by Lord Henry, Gray becomes cold-hearted and self-centered. Gray soon discovers that his descent into moral dissolution is being represented by changes in his portrait. Over the years, Gray seems never to age, while his image in the portrait ages in his place and also continues to show the ongoing moral dissolution within Gray's character. In the end, he cannot bear to be what he has become.Comment: This novel struck me as glib. It is the novel of an intellectual fop."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"It's difficult to know the purpose of this edition of Wilde's novella. I didn't notice when I ordered it that it's not the size of a regular book--it's more the size of an academic journal or magazine. Nearly 8 X 10 inches. Further, there's no named editor, no introduction, no apparatus at all. Just the text of the story--and that is printed in two columns on the page. The result is a book that won't fit on the shelf and that is unpleasant to read. Baffling."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray was a hard novel to get into. But once the plot of the story got underway it transfolded into a page turning, mind questioning story. Wilde tells us the story of a beautiful man who wishes that his soul would forever be part of his self portrait, and that he will forever stay youthful. Little to say, his wish comes true. Though there were many parts of the story that seemed to be described in quite a bit of unwanted detail, they almost give the novel a sense of philosophy. This compliments the many complicated philosophical views of Lord Henry, one of the main characters in the work. As the story progressed I found myself being pulled into the plot. When Dorian fell in love with Sibyl Vane I anticipated each turn of events that followed. Since we know about Dorian Gray's wish, each chapter teases us as to what will happen to him. Throughout the rest of his life, Dorian involuntarily causes accidents and grief to others. From Sibyl's death to the suicide of Alan Campbell, things always turn tragic for the ones in his life. It is inevitable that Dorian will meet his own death by the time the novel finishes. The conclusion to the story couldn't have been done better. The way that Wilde closes the life of Dorian Gray is perfectly written, and paints a perfect \\"portrait\\" in our minds as well."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"great book hard to read because print was so small"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Review by Jason LushOne hundred and ninety pages of political masturbation disguised as a supernatural suspense story. Of the three main characters we have; Dorian Gray, who is a brainless puppet the personifies vanity; Basil Hallward, the artist who painted the fabled portrait and represents the sorrowful conscience; and Lord Henry Wolton, who is the quintessential 19th Century fop whose sole purpose in the book is to act as Wilde's voice on politics, religion and homosexuality and as a driving corrupter of everyone else in the book.The pacing is horrendously slow, the chapters devoted to explaining Gray's hobbies and the pictures of his ancestors in his hallway don't help with the lousy pacing.

It was written in a style of gentle prose that was easy to read, and it did put forth at least a few interesting concepts. On the whole though, the ideas in this book were utterly ridiculous and totally lacking in any true depth. They appear to me to be the vain ramblings of a man consumned in his own deepness, thereby proving how shallow he truly was. I would liken this book to a picture in which detailing, shading, and general looks are pleasing, but the perspective is off, ruining the whole picture. So perhaps you would enjoy this book if you are looking for a few ideas and smart sayings put together in a seemingly random, and almost chaotic order."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Every so often one has the good fortune of discovering an author whose work reaffirms all that is appreciable in literature by exemplifying its worst. Oscar Wilde, after reading whose novel and two fairy tales, quickly obviates any further need or desire to be further acquainted. The knowledge found on the cover of my paperback edition, between the obligatory sickly hagiography that usually betrays the expectation it inspires, that The Picture of Dorian Gray was apparently the author's only fruitful attempt at a \`full-length' novel, leaves one snickering ante facto in not entirely facetious gratitude. Wilde was seemingly more at home in the realm of fairy tales, and this 217-page full-length novel not by itself finding ground to fill the space between the covers, finds itself supported by three samples of that genre.One might be forgiven for assuming that the novel portends to explore an emotional or philosophical metaphor of a relationship between the eponymous painting and its subject, but the implied exploration is unfortunately mostly specious. The metaphor, to be sure, is there, but it is a mere seed that never takes root or grows out of its entirely obvious and superficial form, and the story thus fails to fulfil its promise.Furthermore, the filling leaves one with a bad aftertaste. None of the three characters have any endearing features to redeem themselves for the gall they otherwise freely spew. \`Lord Henry' in particular has no characterizing dimension other than denigration of everything else in the form of dull pseudowitticisms, from which comparison we take it the aristocrat was intended to benefit. We learn his contempt of clergy (bishops \\"don't think\\"), stockbrokers (\\"even a stock-broker can gain a reputation for being civilized\\"), dowagers (they are \\"overdressed\\"), academicians (tedious), the middle class (not modern), Americans, marriage, women, and Jews (I don't believe any mention of the religion ever lacks the adjective \\"fat\\"). The misogyny in particular is so pungent and the female characters so weak that the protagonists cannot otherwise but treat them with the contempt that they do. If indeed \\"women are decorative\\" it is merely because the men do not have a vision that sees beyond superficialities. This is no parody of aristocratic vanity (in the style of Thackeray, for instance) so one quickly finds oneself wishing for one of these maligned targets of Lord Henry's dull wit to return the favor with a dull but well-deserved kick in the [rump].When the characters are not railing against the world, they are theorizing about it, but the obvious inconsistencies and utter inanity of the theories make them impossible to consider seriously. To give an example, and not have one character take the brunt of all the book's failings, the artist Basil Hallward states first (speaking of his own work) that \\"every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not the sitter,\\" but six pages later that \\"an artist should create beautiful things, but should put nothing of his own life into them.\\" A story dealing ostentatiously with a profound relationship between ars and artis, in which the artist doesn't remember from one moment to the next whether or not he put feeling in his art, reveals that its author has lost control of his subject. Othertimes the theories are merely silly and quite impossible to take at face value. What to make, for example, of the idea that \\"beauty is a form of genius- is higher, indeed, than genius, as it needs no explanation,\\" or that \\"people say sometimes that beauty is superficial. That may be so, but at least it is not so superficial as thought is.\\" This is just tripe without considerable meaning.Within this theorizing there are faint reverberations reaching toward some oblique philosophy of hedonism, but never quite advancing beyond a mere slogan. Without actually doing the work of fully expounding the philosophy, or having the courage to fully sound its implications, in the way that for example de Sade did, the author cannot reasonably expect us to sympathize or find the actions of his characters anything but wholly unsatisfying and their reactions rather balmy.Wilde quite clearly has no desire (charitably assuming it is not from a lack of potential) to prepare and construct a plot. One of the adjunct characters, Jim, whose sister Sibyl later commits suicide over the protagonist, finds out he is a bastard son, his mother was orphaned, and forgives her (what for, we are left to guess), all within the space of three quarter page. Dorian's swings of attitude toward Sybil from ignorance through love through despisement through sorrow to self-forgiveness are so extreme and irrational that they make a pastiche of emotion. Jim's completely unfounded anger toward Dorian is so unrealistically sudden and out of proportion that it is obvious how Jim's fears will be realized and that there will be a confrontation. There is no mystery, less a sense of a world to discover than of being dragged along by an uninterested parent. The rhetorical questions Dorian asks in his histrionic despair are answered immediately, it is for me simply to get in, sit down, shut up, and hold on.Even more fundamentally, the characters are shallow, undeveloped, and quite stereotypical, the dialog stilted and unrealistic- altogether a surprisingly unsophisticated style, especially in the light of the beautiful writing of his contemporaries. Dialog has a tendency to spin off into unrelated tangents that are unceremoniously and artificially \`snapped back' to the main thread. Henry's inability to speak in any other form than witless aphorism is at first merely unfunny, then quickly boring, later irritating, and finally not bearing further reading. And this is unfortunately barely the only character development in the story at all, the only other characters having little strength of will of their own to resist mimicking this trite ascerbicism.If the book has revealed anything at all, it is not a deeper analysis of art or hedonism, but a much more animal homoeroticism. Dorian Gray is much more than anything else a love story with the trimmings (envy and a murder-suicide), and all the less respectful because it dares not speak its name. Female emotions are contemptible, but the same expressions of liking (Wilde can never bring himself to call it more), admiration of beauty, and extreme flattery by men towards other men, are accepted naturally and not subject to this contempt."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Well, I had to read this book for a school assignment. I'm not really sure what I expected from this book, but I know I didn't get it. This book shows the true demoralization of our society- past and present. The absloute worst part of the book (about 90% of it) was the long, monotonous, verbose speeches that consisted of the characters'ideals that were just &quot;off the mark&quot; by a little. I would not suggest reading this book, partly because of the boring content, but mostly because of the fact that I still haven't found a plot."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The novel The Picture of Dorian Grey is an unoriginal story line with disturbing morals in which innocent people are corrupted. Written in the late 18th century by Oscar Wilde the novel is an example of homosexual fiction. While the sexual preference of the characters is never addressed it is often hinted at. Many of the morals presented in the novel are very disturbing. Harry presents his views in such a way as to make them seem right. He \\"preaches\\" on living a life for pleasure, and the sensations. He stresses that women are merely brainless playthings there to provide entertainment. His theory on remaining young is to repeat all your youthful sins. This is presenting a lifestyle of self-indulgence, in which material things bring happiness. Harry's corruption of Dorian leads to the corruption of many others. As Dorian begins to live as Harry has suggested he begins to use his influence over people to his advantage. He drives Sibyl Vane to her death, and also her brother who tries to seek revenge. Many close friends become outcasts because of his escalating bad reputation. In this story of twisted corruption, Basil Hallward is a very likely target for destruction. Had is not been for his adoration of Dorian then Harry never would have become interested in him. It becomes obvious that in order to be rid of all the mishaps Dorian must be rid of the originator. Basils death is almost obvious from the start. The main storyline, man sells soul for youth, is one used many times by several authors. It is based on a 15th century German magician Johann Faust. In his time he was considered a fake and a criminal. In the original Faustbook (1587), written by an unknown author, is a biography of Johann Faust in which he sells his soul to the devil Mephistopheles for 24 years in return for power, knowledge, and youth and finally goes to hell in terror. It is ironic that this is also approximately the same amount of time it takes Dorian to become fully corrupted and destroy the painting. All in all the book was a waste of time. With its disturbing morals and unoriginal storyline the book left something to be desired. It was often predictable and uneventful. This is not a book that I would recommend to other people."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Please refer to page 212 of the Baronet Books version of The Picture of Dorian Gray.

Dorian Gray is a very dark work with drug use, murder, and depression. One of the main themes is homosexuality. It shocked and outraged the public when it was first realeased. It is scary. It scared me . Frankly, I doubt very much that many children would appreciate this book. Colleges study this book in literature classes. That's not to say no child would not get stuff from this book, but the few children that could would probably be just fine with the original work.

I eventually had a copy sent from a library 2000 miles away and when it arrived, despite having been printed around 1915, the pages were still uncut.I guess this means that it's not a well-read book.Having said all that, Imaginary Obligations is a time capsule. It is a collection of essays on whatever subjects interested the author and the public at the beginning of the twentieth century.In terms of both tone and content it is patchy. Some pieces seem terribly dated and some positively trapped in amber, while others express attitudes as fresh and enlightened as if they were penned yesterday.While Mr Colby was not an essayist of the stature of Mencken or Twain, he is nonetheless worth reading, even if only from a historical perspective: To see what op-ed pieces looked like back then is, I think, worth the read."},{"Title":"ENGLAND IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY 1714-1815.","review":"J.H. Plumb is a master historian who writes here a general introduction to the period he knows best , England in the 18th century. The book is divided into three parts, the first the Age of Walpole, the second The Age of Chatham, and the third the Age of Pitt. Plumb discusses the general social and economic background of the period, and provides real insight into its moving spirits, and their tone. He favorably cites DeFoe on the importance of Trade for England. And he gives a real sense of the dynamism of England in this time. He discusses the various economic players from the merchant princes to the simple landless agricultural workers. He provides an interesting picture of the way England looked and worked at the time, from the pot- holed broken roads to the rapidly expanding water- routes which facilitated trade. He writes of the great agricultural estates, the movement towards enclosure of the land, the hard fate of the peasants and lower classes in general. The energy of the Age in expansion of literacy and means of communication, the hunger for knowledge are also part of the picture. The technical innovations which were often sought out beforehand to solve a problem, and which in some way improved life are also written about. The craftsman and the artisans were ' the bridge of life'between rich and poor. Plumb also writes about the British relations to Ireland and India, about their foreign policy and the vast expansion of the Empire through War. He concludes with a look at the complicated and difficult situation Britain is in at the end of this remarkable period of its development."},{"Title":"ENGLAND IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY 1714-1815.","review":"The book has three parts-- the Ages of Walpole, 1714-1742, of Chatham, 1742-1784, and Pitt, 1784-1815, the prime ministers. Bishops became politicians. Clerical life attracted the younger sons of the nobility, the gentry.Walpole was energetic. He sought power. His temperament and will were suited to the office of Prime Minister. Walpole reorganized the customs system. By 1726 England was more or less at war with Spain. In 1729 he made the Treaty of Seville with Spain. In 1737 Queen Caroline died. For ten years she had been Walpole's most loyal ally. Walpole resigned in 1742 and was dead three years later. Under Walpole there had been rapid expansion of British trade. Early industrialists were supported by a canal system.In the Age of Chatham there was rapid change in agriculture. There were social consequences to the industrial revolution. There was a problem with rural poverty. In the towns there were commissions to carry out governmental and social functions. London and provincial towns were clean and orderly. Factories and mines hired children as workers. They didn't have that ingrained antipathy to factory work. The factory system spread slowly. Craft and the old domestic system survived.Wesley's parents were Tories. Methodism was for the poor. Brutality of life, a constant sense of death, was an inner tragedy providing the emotional core of Methodism. It gave its adherents emotional release and a sense of purpose.Priestly and Cavendish dominated the scientific world of the 18th century, Reynolds the artistic world, and Dr. Johnson the literary world. Priestly isolated oxygen. He discovered the Law of Inverse Squares.Pitt entered the government in 1746. He had great gifts, a manic-depressive functioning as the mouthpiece of destiny. John Wilkes and George III clashed. The American Revolutionary War was a war of incompetence on both sides. By the time of Cornwallis's surrender in 1781, Britain's situation was desperate.In the intensification of the industrial revolution, roads, ships, and ports imporved. Population grew. Wealth was not diffused. Most people remained in the position of the laboring poor. Rural poverty was more widespread than urban poverty. William Pitt was one of the greatest peace ministers. By 1815, after battling Napoleon for twenty years, Britian verged on bankruptcy and social revolution.This compact history constitutes a succinct treatment of British progress."},{"Title":"The Long March","review":"I read this many years ago before starting my own career in the Army. It is a good example of overzealous leadership trying to expose weakness in their own troops by pushing them without the proper train up time and preparation. The commander wants to use the \\"look at me\\" example but for all the wrong reasons; and, of course, the officers to dare to question him are labeled as malcontents. The Marines get their fair share of this and to be honest, it's often unfair. The Marines are expected to live up to the reputation of being the \\"best of the best\\" and they get more pressure to go the extra mile.

Enjoy!!"},{"Title":"Record of Things Heard","review":"Record of Things Heard, is the master translator, Thomas Cleary's translation of the Shobogenzo-zuimonki.This remarkable record of the great 13th century Zen master Eihei Dogen, has received little attention in the West, being overshadowed by the Shobogenzo and the Eihei Koroku. Yet this wonderful record offers a unique, and very human side of the great master that seems to stand more in the background in his two more popular works.Recorded by his disciple and Dharma-heir Ejo, this collection of talks contain intimate dialogues by Dogen on a vast array of topics. Dogen answers questions by his students about sitting meditation, koans, the importance of study, and the meanings behind classic Buddhist doctrines.While Dogen's intellectual brilliance and depth of spiritual realization is clearly apparent in all his works, Record of Things Heard, reveals his humor, sensitivity, and the clear compassion and love he felt for his own students.Whether this is your first taste of Dogen, or the simply the latest in a lifelong exploration of this great master, this accessible volume will be treasured. It introduces Dogen the Zen master, Dogen the scholar, Dogen teacher, and most wonderfully, Dogen the human being."},{"Title":"Gates of Hell","review":"I got this book from a community box in our lunch room at work and what a pleasant suprise.I could not put it down once I got started."},{"Title":"Until Death Do Us Part!","review":"Well, if he doesn't believe it, he sure can write about it convincingly.Simpson's book was a great weekend read. I was drawn in by the powerful opening chapter, and as he wove the tale, I found it difficult to put the book down.I was pleased to see some unexpected plot elements that disputed the generalization that all men are dogs.Also of interest where the variety of female characters, who cover the spectrum.Simpson did an excellent job of setting the scene, particularly in the &quot;club&quot; scenes. For those of us who have never experienced that, Simpson's use of &quot;felt life&quot; truly took you to the scene and made you a part of the action.I'm looking forward to a sequel which hopefully will develop the characters more.

Until Death Do Us Part takes us into the undercover world of drugs and racketeering in Atlanta. Along the way we are introduced to the undercover world of the government. How are these two entities related in the murder of a suburban wife and mother?Noah is a young, educated and successful businessman who is married to Andrea. Noah returns home from a business trip to find his wife murdered. After an attempted murder on another resident of their sub-division, the police have their killer and close the case. Noah, not satisfied with the answers he receives about why his wife was murdered, sets out to find who was behind the killer.To aid him in his search, Noah is given the name and history of an ex-convict named Bishop by an unlikely source. Through Noah's own devises he tracks down Micah, a strip dancer. How do these two people fit into Andrea's murder? This unlikely source also provides a tool for Micah in her search for some answers of her own. This tool is introduced early in the book and you are left to wonder its importance.Bishop offers a sensitive look at his life as a poor child in the heart of Atlanta explaining why he leads the life he leads and why revenge is his answer. This helps Noah to understand why Bishop would put his life on the line to search for Andrea's killer. Bishop explains his plight with such profound tenderness and intelligence you cannot help but root for him in his quest to make a change.Some of my favorite sections within the book are Noah's daydreams and his explanations of his life with Andrea. Noah and Andrea appeared to be two souls with like goals, brought together through love and admiration that Simpson effectively describes as their \\"flow.\\" Furthermore, Simpson does an excellent job of describing the different neighborhoods in and around Atlanta. From the buildings, the landscape, to the racial and ethnic make up, the reader is able to capture the heart of Atlanta.The only problem I had with the book was the climax appears to be unrealistic while leaving some gaps and unanswered questions. However, I truly liked this story and will read what Noah, Bishop and Micah are up to next. Until Death Do Us Part is a raw and gritty look at the realities of poverty, drugs, crime and the \\"system\\" as we know it.Reviewed by Dawn R. Reeves"},{"Title":"Until Death Do Us Part!","review":"Voodoo... Black Magic... call it what you wish. I was taken freely on a Sensual Mystery Adventure that as a lady,I am ashamed to admit I enjoyed!

The Dream girls so often talked about you know... The Bedroom,The Kitchen,The Boardroom and yo Boo? Micah, Andrea and Mia are women who've definately got your back!

By the end of chapter two I was in too deep to stop. Few books have taken me hostage as &quot;Until Death Do Us Part!&quot; did. I ended up reading through the entire night until I finished the book. I hope Mr. Simpson will write a second book that picks up where this one ended.

It's a very visual book, I couldn't help but visualize parts of Atlanta as I was reading it. I found myself quickly bonding with and hoping for the main char(Noah). My only problem with reading the book was trying to visualize who could play the lead(Denzel or Snipes)I found this book by accident, but you can best believe I will be looking for a part 2 and 3."},{"Title":"Until Death Do Us Part!","review":"First I have to say job well done Micah . I just finishedreading Until Death Do Us Part and I have to say Micah can take care of business when no was else did. She had no shame in her game and she took care of business . Dominque you got yours . I hope I have not given away to much of the story .Now I want to say want a love Noah and Andrea had it truly was Until Death Do Us Part and then some. Noah is a man I'm sure we would love to love us. He had so much love for Andrea and he was not ashamed to show it or tell it. When she was killed by mistaken identity I could actually feel his pain. I really enjoyed the memoirs of Noah and Andrea more that the mystery parts. I would have prefered reading the whole book about such great love.Having said all that I must admit I would actually rate this story with 3.5 or 3.8 * . I gave it 4 because I felt 3 * was to low it was between 3.5 and 4* . I got lost in some of the mystery, but the love he had for his wife was truly awesome."},{"Title":"Until Death Do Us Part!","review":"This was an excellent book. It was easy to read. There were many scenic descriptions and it was easy to imagine the streets of Atlanta and its nightlife.The characters were recognizable as people one might run into on the street. In other words, this author created believable characters. The verdict is still out on Micah, but the rest were folks I'd like to know.Another amazing facet of this book is the love the main character, Noah, had for his wife. Noah's love for his wife as descripted by a man is hope that this kind of love actually exists. Additionally the author does weave a story full of action and mystery.This was a great novel. I'm looking forward to more work from this author. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Until Death Do Us Part!","review":"This book is outstanding. Being a native Atlantan, I could easily relate to the scenery that Mr. Simpson described. This murder mystery is unfortunately about the kinds of murders that happen far too much, but nothing is ever really done about it. If you are tired of reading the same old plot: lover cheats, husband lies, wives left heartbroken, then read this book. Expect to be taken for a loop at every page. I read this book in one day! Great Job, I look forward to the sequel with Noah and Micah!"},{"Title":"Until Death Do Us Part!","review":"Gregory,I know it took me a while to share my thoughts. I found your book exciting and consuming. My favorite character was Noah. Every woman is looking for a Noah. He has a little thug and a lot of class, intelligence, physical and mental attractiveness. Recently I was home alone ill and I realized that a man like Noah would make sure that I was well taken care of.The character that I was most unsure of was Bishop. He also has all of the characteristics of Noah with the danger magnified. He was a little too extreme for me. Some of the sistas that really like a Ruff Neck Brother would dream of meeting a Bishop.The women in the book were phenomenal women. I loved each role and especially knowing that they were developed from a male perspective. Tuff as nails, intelligent, sensitive and sexy. BRAVO and KUDOS for a job well done. Hurry to the presses with the next installation of an obviously multi-book series. When it is made into a movie, may I have a small cameo role?Love ya,Stephanie"},{"Title":"Until Death Do Us Part!","review":"I was hooked from the first page.

Can't wait to read the next installment...."},{"Title":"Until Death Do Us Part!","review":"I was totally caught up in this book from word one and I must commend the author, Gregory J.T. Simpson, for a wonderful job in igniting the desire to read Until Death Do Us Part! from the first moments of reading. I think the question on the back cover of the book completely sums up the crux of the novel, \\"how do you measure a man's love for his woman?\\" the reader will eagerly turn pages to find the answer. Meet Noah, a successful businessman upwardly moving through his own corporate ladder in Atlanta with a beautiful wife named Andrea and a beautiful baby girl named Ashley. Noah could want for nothing more. The love they had can best be described as \\"flowing\\"; a man totally dedicated to his wife and to their marriage and to their bond, a woman with a one-track mind on the happiness afforded her by her husband. Suddenly this all changes. In the 60 seconds it took for someone to mistakenly identify Andrea for somebody else, Noah's life forever changed.Death is devastating enough without a lot of mystery shrouding it, and we all have to make peace in our own way. Noah was no different and had to find out why his wife was mistaken for someone else, with the loving support of his father and sister and the support of staff at his company he took the time and sought answers to avenge her murder. Through the efforts of a police detective's assistance and a quite unsuspecting duo of characters that Noah wouldn't seem to associate with, a suspenseful drama unfolds. Micah can best be described as a very mysterious woman and Bishop a cold ex-con with revenge on his mind. These three learn to use each other's strengths for mutual benefit and arrive at a successful conclusion for all three. They each had their own mystery to solve the involved the other. As you read, you will be caught up in the suspense as well as recognize true love. I was so enthralled that I read this book in an evening. I couldn't put it down. The technical accuracy of describing the scene isn't lost in this book either which shows the author is truly dedicated to making his book a wonderful representation."},{"Title":"Until Death Do Us Part!","review":"As an avid reader who has had the opportunity to read a wide variety of books by a diverse group of authors I must say that Mr. Simpson's book was quite a surprise.

His main character, Noah had me believing that love was something that was worth fighting for. The way he introduced Bishop and Micah was absolutely perfect in its pulling of my heart and emotions. I live in Atlanta and his descriptions of the city was right on point. Gregory and Until Death Do Us Part may be a first time venture but I am truly looking forward to his next venture. Bravo my brother, Bravo!"},{"Title":"Until Death Do Us Part!","review":"\\"Until Death Do Us Part\\" tells a story of a man's true devotion to his wedding vows as he, Noah, takes on the underworld to find an answer to the major question, \`Why my wife?'

I must say that it was 'WELL WORTH THE WAIT'. I had the opportunity to read your book while traveling on a field trip to N.O. with my son. I started reading it while riding to our destination, and I did not want to put it down. Upon going back home, I could not tell you how anxious I was to get back to the pages that were constantly on my mind. The evening was getting late, causing darkness to come. I attempted to read in the dark, not wanting to turn on a light in the bus. A booklight is a must. Because I know that the continuation of this 'stimulating read,' Urban Web Tales, will surely be as captivating as Until Death Do Us Part. The way that you write kept me anxiously wanting to know what was going to happen next. I could not turn the pages fast enough to find out what Noah, Micah, and Bishop would reel, (hook,line and sinker), me into next. From page one to one hundred and eighty four, I kept focused on your every word. You truely master the art of capturing the attention of your readers.

PS - Micah has inspired me to increase my workouts!"},{"Title":"Until Death Do Us Part!","review":"The author has chosen to use his story in book form as a means to provide an outlet for his own therapy (not to mention while getting paid at the same time). I think the book could have been better written -- dialogues and all. A soror sister in the ATL sent me this book and I cannot endorse it to my soro sisters in San Diego. I understand the author wanting to climb the band wagon along with E. Lynn, Marcus Major, Carl Webber, R.M. Johnson, Michael Baisden and such likes, but he has a long way to go. This is one of those stories that nearly every ex-married person can relate. Unfortunately, there is nothing unique about his. My advice to the author and those who suffer heartache and pain: Turn all your cares over to God because he cares for you. You may or may not find temporary relief in white pages and black ink---but you will definitely find permanent relief in Christ Jesus."},{"Title":"Until Death Do Us Part!","review":"I completed reading your book over the holiday weekend. For reference, I read 7 or 8 books a year. I probably start and don't finish another 4 or 5. I usually read non-fiction self-help books. What did I enjoy about this book? The first thing is that I appreciated reading a book that spoke to some of my thoughts as it relates to fatherhood and relationships. There aren't many books that I've read that are written by African-American authors that don't just depict us as lazy, drunks, whores, or thugs. 'It's okay to be a loving father and husband without the drama'. Woven into core of this novel is the fact that that good overcomes evil. We navigate through life with this hope. I appreciate you poring out your thoughts on life through this tale. It was a hell of way to express your thoughts without having to preach. I commend you for your creativeness.

The book gives very practical and valuable suggestions for enhancing relationships with co-workers. A major premise is that it is very important to give positive, meaningful recognition to co-workers. This will result in improved performance and a better work environment. Throughout the book are &quot;Try It Out&quot; exercises, giving the reader a chance to immediately put the suggestions to work. Many of the skills such as being a good listener and effectively giving compliments as well as critism are applicable to personal relationships outside the workplace. The pleasing graphics, the authors' down to earth writing style and their real-life examples illustrating how and how not to give recognition make the book very readable and enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Three Levels of Spiritual Perception: An Oral Commentary on the Three Visions (Nang Sum of Ngorchen Konchog Lhundrub)","review":"Having read many Lam-Rim Graduated Path texts from the Gelug-pa tradition of Tibetan Buddhism, it was a joy to read this approach from the late Deshung Rinpoche (but later reincarnated - may I have the karma to meet him!), a master and shining light of the Sakya tradition.This, like all Graduated Path texts, is a journey through the Buddhist path, right from the recognition of our life as having its basis in suffering, to the discovery of our own enlightened heart/mind, Buddha Nature.It would be difficult to read this book and not have a strong sense that life has a lot more meaning than that reflected by our modern society, which is a model of the path and result of the 5 defilements in many of its manifestations.A manual that should be a cornerstone of any decent Dharma-library. May countless beings be benefited by these profound, expansive and beautifully written teachings!"},{"Title":"The Three Levels of Spiritual Perception: An Oral Commentary on the Three Visions (Nang Sum of Ngorchen Konchog Lhundrub)","review":"I have read many spiritual books in my lifetime. This is the most comprehensive explanation of life, its purpose, karma and how to attain enlightenment I have ever seen. Not light reading, this book not only provides detailed information on meditation, worldly existence, suffering, the rarity of human birth, and the law of karma, but provides powerful meditations and spiritual practices to help us increase our capacity for love and compassion and to improve our ability to concentrate free from thoughts, so as to attain insights and ultimately enlightenment."},{"Title":"The Three Levels of Spiritual Perception: An Oral Commentary on the Three Visions (Nang Sum of Ngorchen Konchog Lhundrub)","review":"In The Three Levels of Spiritual Perception, Dezhung Rinpoche guides the reader through the Lamdre (lam=path; dre=fruit) system of enlightenment in the space of 56 lectures, originally given in NYC from September 1977 to February 1980. These lessons lead to the achievement of calm abiding and insight meditation which in turn results in the perception of the nonduality of clarity and emptiness. A tall order, but it works. Jared Rhoton's translation is easy to read, and Dezhung Rinpoche's excellent teaching style is straightforward.A prerequisite to deep understanding of this commentary on The Three Visions is David Jackson's in-depth biography of Dezhung Rinpoche: A Saint in Seattle. When you begin to understand this truly great lama, where he comes from, what his obstacles and hardships were and the immense compassion he believed most strongly in, you will have a much better chance in becoming a part of the audience who first heard these teachings simply because of your loving confidence in this exceptional teacher."},{"Title":"The Three Levels of Spiritual Perception: An Oral Commentary on the Three Visions (Nang Sum of Ngorchen Konchog Lhundrub)","review":"It feels like you're actually sitting there and receiving the teachings.

E. Kunga Tenpai Nyima, Ven. Deshung Rinpoche III's (1906-87) oral commentary @ Jetson Sakya Center NYC 9/7/72-2/26/80 on Ngorchen Konchog Lhundrub's 1543 CE The Beautiful Ornament of Three Visions. Lhundrub also wrote an advanced Sakya Vajrayana sequel, The Beautiful Ornament of Three Continua, unavailable in English. p. 491: \\"Lhundrub says...this teaching is meant for the student who has just undertaken the Mahayana path &...masters ...trying to help their students progress along that path & p. 315: is based on the teachings of the sutras, although there is some Vajrayana mixed in with it.\\" Yet, the p. xxxiii: \\"Lamdr&eacute; system is derived from the Tantra Trilogy of Hevajra.\\" It's 522 pp., readable, preliminary--but with some good insights. The 3 visions are: non-Buddhist, on the path; & enlightened. The author is ecumenical: p. 136: \\"It makes no difference whether you undertake practice according to the Sakya school or one of the other Tibetan orders. You will find identical teachings in them all, pp. 143-4: There is no real difference among the schools in terms of philosophy, systems of practice, conduct, or ultimate result...only minor variations in emphasis due to the tradition & history of their arising, & p. 261: In essence, the Lamdr&eacute; doesn't differ at all from the other meditation systems that were practiced in Tibet, such as the Mahamudra doctrines of the Kagyu & Gelug. All these doctrines & techniques of the Tantric path are authentic,\\" but you can't tell from this book. It has much dogma & mythology (unsupported information) e.g. extensive descriptions of hells--but later called merely creations of mind. As a discontinuous lecture series, chapters include redundancies but have intriguing poetic names. Topics include the 6 perfections, calm abiding, tonglen (says it's necessary to Buddhahood), Bodhichitta, compassion (but not the other Immeasurables) & thoughtful analyses of helping others & impure vision/mental filtering. He denies danger to tonglen (exchanging self for others) since \\"Karma is not transferable in this way\\" overlooking psychosomatic illness & ESP. He implies calm abiding requires being monastic & denies existence of self (e.g. p. 420: \\"The conception that a single entity can be made of countless particles is illogical\\" vs. set theory/statistics & displays the usual cultural gap with the West). However, he gives valuable insight into mind--p. 461: \\"There is no external Vajrapani, that Vajrapani is nothing more than the nature of your mind...When a student does her Vajrayogini retreat & recites the mantra, she is not meditating devotedly on some wonderful deity but simply on a recognition of Vajrayogini within who is nothing more or less than the nondual clarity & emptiness of her mind\\" & supports/references women & ch&ouml;d. I liked best--p. 17: \\"A yogi sees time as discrete moments or flashes of instants. He perceives things much more finely, much more subtly, & may be able to see that there is no real continuity of time. He would view the idea of continuity as a mere human conceptualization & would also see that instants of time are in themselves not only momentary but discrete; p. 26: by knowing one thing, you can understand all things; p. 263: Taking the result as one's path...\`The cause is the result, & the result is the cause;' p. 300: Mind Is the most important thing. It is mind that attains enlightenment. Enlightenment occurs through mental actions; p. 323: Train yourself in giving what is commensurate with your ability to give freely; p. 338: We have, as practitioners, to internalize the teachings that we hear or read about in books;\\" & most provocative--pp. 463-4: \\"The person who is enlightened no longer perceives beings or has a concept of himself as a benefactor of beings.\\""},{"Title":"Classical Deception","review":"For a long time there was considerable confusion about the authenticity of ancient coins. While considerable quantities have been found in the former ancient sites, and they have been collected since ancient times, few works were available to help the collector distinguish between the actual ancient works and fakes and copies made after. Works that are available are hard to find, usually specific to one forger and quite costly. I can safely say that this book clearly outlines the things to look for, from the commonest tourist cast copy to the advanced techniques used to fool the more advanced collectors.If you want to collect coins you should include this book as one of your first buys because it can save you many times its cost with the purchase of just one coin that is not right. This is especially true if you are buying on the internet from sometimes unreliable impersonal sources.The format is great with a show and tell approach, easy to use, and references to other works on specialized areas of counterfeiting.While it shows and concentrates on mostly ancient coins the information is valid for all copies. There are great plates of the fakes the average modern collector is apt to encounter now on the market. This book will help you acquire the basic knowledge necessary in collecting coins just as in any other facet of collecting antiques or art."},{"Title":"Classical Deception","review":"I enjoy reading Mr.Salyes' books and this one is no exception. He easily one of the best current numismatic authors. This work does a great job of covering the types of counterfeits along with their history and an overview of how they are created. It is a very good book for anyone beginning to collect ancient coins. One thing the book is not is a catalog of counterfeits nor a guide on how to detect counterfeits. These subjects are beyond the scope of any general work and are dealt with by various numismatic associations and their publications. So if you are only looking for a manual or catalog move on."},{"Title":"Classical Deception","review":"This book is a must read for those starting out in collecting coins, either ancient or modern. It explains the differences in the original minting of coins, and the \\"modern\\" reproductions, fakes and forgeries, even ancient forgeries. It is easy reading, and will give a good basis for coin collecting. It is worth the short time it takes to read, and it may save you from some embarassment."},{"Title":"Classical Deception","review":"This book is an fascinating read about classical coin forgeries. I'm new to the topic but the author seems to have done his homework."},{"Title":"Classical Deception","review":"The author clearly states upfront that \\"This book is not a primer on how to spot fakes [...] this is primarily a book about the history of ancient coin counterfeiting, forgery and reproductions.\\" Learning to spot fakes may only come with experience. Having said that, it is my conviction that knowledge of the history of counterfeiting is very helpful to start building a meaningful experience in spotting forgeries. Besides, the book does discuss many technical aspects of the subject, albeit without going too deep in the details. This, along with the select bibliography, provides a very good kick start for a more involved research and to start building experience in the subject. There are also some excellent pieces of advice in various parts of the book that could help many less experienced collectors avoid a potentially disastrous purchase.The book starts by describing the various methods used to produce coins in the ancient world as well as by modern and old producers of imitations. This is followed by the history proper of ancient coin imitations from the Renaissance till modern times. The most famous/notorious forgers and skilled reproducers are presented along with their work and the aura of mysticism that often surrounds their lives. Several forgery schools are also introduced. Then comes a series of topics describing the properties of imitations as well as some of the important examination and analytical methods used to help identify them. The involvement and influences of various numismatic associations, government regulations and the internet are also discussed.Last but not least, an important part of the book is a tribute to Peter Rosa, a well known producer of quality reproductions. Besides a brief biography, a complete, and quite possibly unique, illustrated catalogue of Rosa's reproductions is included.The main goal of the book - presenting a history of ancient coin counterfeiting, forgery and reproductions - is nicely achieved in my opinion. The series of introductions to various technical aspects, as well as the numerous bibliographic references, are of excellent value as well. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in ancient coins as a collector and/or from a historical perspective."},{"Title":"Classical Deception","review":"Learn something every day.

His influence by Marx and open sympathy for the socialism however are understandably likable even today by unscrupulous leftist lecturers driven by their agenda away from their first obligation to disseminate the truth.Free textbook?!

This will be the day when the majority of the people get through the smoke and mirrors of the statist-sponsored pseudo-economics that is currently taught at colleges and the people will finally realize how they are robbed by their governments more through credit expansion and inflation than through taxation.My conclusion is that this book is worthy only for someone researching the dead-ends in the economic science that laid ground works for today dominating Keynesian manipulations hampering and dismantling the free-market economy.

It was originally published, in three volumes, in 1909 and republished, in a one volume updated version, in 1937.The scope of his history is extremely wide. He begins with the land speculations of Dutch and British America, on to the shipping fortunes of New England, then trading fortunes (notably the Astors), followed by the railroad fortunes (notably Vanderbilt and Gould), the banking fortunes (notably Morgan) and finally the retail and industrial fortunes. The Rockefeller/Standard Oil fortunes are notably absent but that appears due to their lesser visibility at the time of the original publication.The two central themes to all of these stories is the corruption of the political process to obtain advantage and the exploitation of the workers. For example, just with regards to railroads, legislators were bribed to grant franchises, the railroads received public lands and monies, the promoters charged the railroads far more than the actual construction costs, the railroads \\"watered\\" their stock, the railroad insiders self-dealt, the railroads exchanged useless land for valuable government land, the railroads usurped government owned timber and mineral rights etc. Similar accusations are made for all of the other fortunes. While Myers may not be completely correct in all details there is no doubt that he has attempted to fully document his points, principally from government investigations and/or lawsuits. The writing in respect to the poor incomes, working conditions and benefits of the workers tend to be more \\"preachy\\" and less documented. While the book has appeal to anti-capitalists it should be noted that the politicians are equally venal.There are sections of this book where the style of writing has aged but overall it retains a powerful momentum. I would strongly recommend this book to anyone with interest in American economic history and open to consideration of alternative interpretations."},{"Title":"History of the great American fortunes,","review":"I have this exact copy. This is radical history at its best. Everybody in the established order hates this guy. But Myers has more documentation than anyone I have ever read other than maybe Gibbon.

I keep hunting for him at secondhand bookstores but even there they are usually more than I want to pay - but I haven't given up - and neither should you.At $5.95 plus shipping this is a bargain - get one before they disappear.Richard Edward Noble - The Hobo Philosopher - Author of:America On Strike - American Labor History"},{"Title":"History of the great American fortunes,","review":"Excellent book man is a Socialist but with the way of the world when this book was conceived and written it is understandable for him to beleve what he did.

Even people who are more skeptical of such claims about America, underestimate the level of class conflict in America before the Civil War and during the Colonial period. Myers heavily documented account shows how the great fortunes throughout American history, such as the Astors, Vanderbilts, Rockefellers were created by the use of fraud contary to the declarations of free market fundamentalists, the founders of these fortunes government depended on government aid and the exploitation of workers not just hard work and intelligence. Myers shows how the state and federal governments have repressed the poor and supported the rich since colonial times. He cites laws that imprisoned people for debt during much of the 19th Century, banning labor strikes using conspiracy laws and the murder of workers by police and the military when workers tried to organize to protect their rights. The book is a good source for obscure facts about American History and information about now largely forgotten financial aristocrats and working class leaders."},{"Title":"Peanut Butter and Jelly for Shabbos","review":"What a delightful read!

In this work he immerses himself in the world of hobos. It's one of his earlier works, and it's obvious that his style had not yet matured as it did in later works such as Newjack. He takes the reader along as he goes from being a college student, to being a hobo. Along the way he both shares the stories of other hobos he encounters as well as some of the inernal struggles he experiences. This book is a worthwhile and enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Rolling Nowhere: Riding the Rails with America's Hoboes","review":"I've read all of Ted Conover's books now, but I read this one, his first book, last. Perhaps I think this because it's most recent in my memory, but I think it's the best of all of them, and I think they're all worth reading. This is an experience which I hope to never experience first hand, but should I ever need to ride in a boxcar, I certainly picked up plenty of tips about boarding them, the etiquette of sharing a boxcar, and how to stay warm. The risks the writer took were extreme, and I commend his parents for not dying from worry. After reading this, I also look at homeless people a little differently, not more sympathetically, but with more awareness that they view \\"normal\\" people like me as another tribe altogether, and that given the chance many would not have any qualms about stealing from me or worse."},{"Title":"Rolling Nowhere: Riding the Rails with America's Hoboes","review":"Less a &#34;romance of freighthopping&#34; and more just vignettes of homelessness in various places.

That situation is being reversed...Go to Northbank Fred's website for some of the adventure."},{"Title":"Rolling Nowhere: Riding the Rails with America's Hoboes","review":"Living on the streets. Jobless. Homeless. Living in pure poverty, with no money. This is what most people think when asked about hoboes, but is this all there is to hoboes? Just homeless people with an ambition that is nothing but to survive, get a job, and earn their living. Through Ted Conover's novel, Rolling Nowhere, readers get a whole new perspective about the life of a hobo. Conover's novel completely defies the average person's thinking, by showing how even the unlikeliest people, who are thought to be extinct, can have the craziest of adventures. The author, Ted Conover, himself, delves deeper into the mysterious life of hoboes and breaks through all the superstitions or beliefs one may have about hoboes, through experience.Pete Seeger once said that, \\"Do you know the difference between education and experience? Education is when you read the fine print; experience is what you get when you don't.\\" True to this quote, Conover first-hand experiences the crazy action-packed world of hoboes first-hand, by traveling and living like a hobo for a span of about several months. From going to jail to jumping trains, Conover did it all. Leaving his old life as a \`civilized' man from the middle class, he goes out into the world of a hobo, beginning his first chapter with his first experience at jumping a train. Conover carefully captures each and every moment, every beat of adrenaline, and every movement onto paper. Through reading this book, it's as if the reader is watching over or even beside Conover as he tries wild stunt. Each chapter is a separate, little mini-story that leaves the reader hanging and wanting more.This book is refreshing experience that differs from the norm, mainly due to the fact that Conover experienced every step, making it possible for him to relate and describe his experiences better. Even though this is a great read for adults and children alike, I don't recommend that children under the age of fourteen to read it, due some vulgar scenes and non- age appropriate \\"swear\\" words. Other than that, I'd recommend this book to almost everyone and especially to those who would like to expand their horizons to those in the world that aren't mentioned in current news or other common websites, to a whole new group of people that live lives that differ from that of theirs.Throughout the book, Conover using the powers of imagery to successfully capture a scene and play it back to the audience, multiple times, as a result, this is one the few books where the author manage to make a connection to the readers. According to the Los Angeles Time, Conover's novel is \\"His vivid, sensitive account of this dreary, often humorous and always compelling odyssey explains life beyond the pale of comfort. Rolling Nowhere is a book that stays with you.\\" From simply reading this book, readers can gain \\"insider information\\" and a whole new perspective about hoboes that they never knew about before."},{"Title":"Rolling Nowhere: Riding the Rails with America's Hoboes","review":"Written when Conover was in his early 20's, the prose is at times raw and unpolished, but the stories of life on the rails are interesting and serve as important reminders of how the U.S. does not adequately take care of those most in need."},{"Title":"Rolling Nowhere: Riding the Rails with America's Hoboes","review":"I'm happy that there are still people like Conover who are attracted by good old fashion American wanderlust, a la Kerouac, Whitman, London, Woody Guthrie and others. Unfortunately, this is not as good a book as it could be. It's mostly a series of vignettes of life in the hobo \\"jungles\\", with the eccentric, often disfunctional beings who inhabit them between train rides. Conover brings to the book no small amount of naivete and bleeding heart idealism combined with a stereotypically jaundiced view of American society. He sounds like a little rich kid whose guilt leads him to make occasional forays into the underlife. To his credit, he kinda admits this. Plus,hopping freights is a tough life and Conover could have quit at any time and just gone home to warm showers and good meals -- but he hung in there. The vignettes of life in the jungle are interesting, but not fascinating. I don't know that they hold the book together. I think Conover could have spent more time telling us about the train rides and less about fairly dull fellow tramps in the jungles. In other words, more romance, less sociology. I'm trying not to be too critical here -- the book was interesting and informative and if you possess a strong wanderlust, you will enjoy it. I just think it could have been a lot better."},{"Title":"Rolling Nowhere: Riding the Rails with America's Hoboes","review":"This is one of the best works of non-fiction I've read. It reads like fiction in a Mark Twain sort of adventure, with the author putting himself carelessly in harms way. Many memoirs I've read left me wondering if parts of them were contrived to make them more interesting. I never felt that way while reading this book. If you've ever wondered what it would be like to live the life of a tramp, riding the rails, and living in a hobo jungle--you won't want to pass this up."},{"Title":"Rolling Nowhere: Riding the Rails with America's Hoboes","review":"first off, i love trains, the sound of rumbling trains in the night, anything to do with trains. ive always loved the idea of hopping freight trains. there aren't very many books on the subject. ive read hopping freight trains in america which is a great manual if you are planing on taking a ride. this book gave an inside view on what its like to live the tramp life. after reading this it made me want to ride the rails even more. great book."},{"Title":"Rolling Nowhere: Riding the Rails with America's Hoboes","review":"first he doesnt really identify himself as a hobo. i never had the feeling he did, even if he began to fit in. he always had to have a seperation which i thought sort of ruined the book. otherwise the book is pretty nice. a bit more details about riding and less about the people wouldve been nicer for me but i guess the average joe wouldnt enjoy that as much."},{"Title":"Rolling Nowhere: Riding the Rails with America's Hoboes","review":"An ok read but should have been titled \\"Suburban kid wants to dip his toe in reality\\". When you read, you see how awkward it is to have somebody from suburbia that has obviously never been beat down, shot a gun, seen a hooker, etc trying to fit into this life. It reminds me of the liberals in California throwing parties for the Black panthers thinking that they are doing some good, while all along the Panthers are blowing the money on dope and Cadillacs OR how white youth are imitating the miserable life of inner city black youth. I think people are drawn to that which they fear so that they can try to conquer it. Anyways, I give the author credit for trying to be a modern day Jack Kerouac. The book was a little light on delivery though."},{"Title":"Rolling Nowhere: Riding the Rails with America's Hoboes","review":"As a young man, in his early 20s, Ted Conover traveled on foot and by rail over most of the Western states, first with hoboes and then with undocumented farm workers from Mexico. In his travels, he discovered two itinerant worlds, sometimes overlapping, that are often misunderstood, and invisible to most Americans. In many ways nave and sometimes too trusting, Conover also discovered the limits of his middle class upbringing. His first two books, \\"Rolling Nowhere\\" and \\"Coyotes\\" were based on his experiences. Together they represent a kind of coming of age in America.With little knowledge of real hobo life, Conover left college in the East, jumped a train in St. Louis and headed west. In the months that followed, he crossed and recrossed 14 states, meeting and traveling with a dozen or more modern-day hoboes. He learned from them how to survive, living off of handouts, sleeping rough, avoiding the railroad police. And he learned about loneliness and loss of identity.There are moments of pure pleasure, a tin cup of steaming coffee on a cold high plains morning, the unbroken landscape gliding by open boxcar doors. And there are times when the romance of adventure disappears completely -- in bad weather and bad company. I greatly enjoyed this book and was often touched by Conover's youthful pursuit of independence and experience, often taking risks and crashing head-on into realities he does not anticipate. At the end, the romance of the rails has been pretty much stripped away; he's not sorry, but he's had enough.His book \\"Coyotes\\" is a great companion to this one, as it shows him a little older and somewhat wiser, on yet another risk-taking adventure that throws him into yet another marginal world."},{"Title":"Rolling Nowhere: Riding the Rails with America's Hoboes","review":"The hobo has been declared extinct many times, just asAmerica is always declared robbed of her innocence.However, it IS true, I can vouch as a freight-train ridermyself, that economic and legal changes have greatlyreduced the number of tramps in recent years. What Teddid as a very young man was to explore a shadowy anddangerous world that is full of unforgettable memoriesand vast scenic rewards and to come out the other endwith a great book. He captures the longing, the pain,the exhilaration of exploring the country in a way shunned by itsincreasingly organized and comfortable citizens. He capturesthe agony and durability of the (almost entirely) men whowind up in this underworld and manage to stay alive andsometimes even defiant. This is a great book. Along with&quot;Good Company&quot; by Doug Harper (1980), it is one of the veryfew testaments to freight-train riders to come from recent times."},{"Title":"Rolling Nowhere: Riding the Rails with America's Hoboes","review":"You've got to give Conover credit, the kid has guts. Discontent with his college studies, which seem a bit unreal and removed from real life, he decides to do some hands on research and give the life of a hobo a try. Predictably, things are not what he expects. The life of a hobo (more accurately known as a tramp) is far from romantic and most often full of hardship and danger. However, Conover also discovers a world of fascinating folks who, when push comes to shove, are not so different from the rest of us.There is Lonny, the eternal optimist whose head is full of dreams that never materialize, Pistol Pete with his injured hand and jealous sidekick BB who propose a 3-muskateers deal and then run off with most of his gear, Forrest and Bill with whom he discovers the depths of being a tramp, and Monty who is pursued by personal ghosts.Equally important to Conover's education is his personal transformation from a well-dressed, polite city kid to a rail smart tramp who won't let anyone take advantage of him. His hair grows, his clothes become dirty, layered and ragged, he learns to smoke and drink cheap booze, to scavange in dumpsters for leftover food and how to apply for food stamps. Even more revealing to him is how he is treated as his physical appearance changes. Suddenly people look away, a policeman finds a reason to arrest him for walking on a public sidewalk and he is treated with mistrust and even disgust when he goes into stores.Conover emerges from his adventures with a bad case of head lice but nothing worse physically. However, it is clear that his inner psyche has undergone a transformation. He has questioned the assumptions of his middle class upbringing and dared to immerse himself in the lives of one of our country's most misunderstood groups. In writing frankly about his experiences, he forces the reader to see hoboes for who and what they really are - people like the rest of us doing the best they can to get by in this world. Such a revelation is always a bit of a shock, but in this case it was also heartening. The people in Conover's book are full of life and memorable quirks. They are real characters in every sense of the word, who force you to respond to their lives. The book is not an appeal to save the downtrodden, a psychological dissertation on the causes of poverty or a condemnation of a society that produces hoboes. It is simply one man's quest to understand another way of life and himself in doing so. You'll come away challenged, touched and questioning some of your own assumptions about how life should be lived."},{"Title":"Rolling Nowhere: Riding the Rails with America's Hoboes","review":"This book is part of the \\"Vintage Departures\\" series, a group of travel books from unusual angles. Some examples are a book about gamblers and the gambling world, \\"back country\\" travel in the most remote parts of the world, inexperienced mountain climbers, and near poetry. This book tries to take a different look at our own country, as as seen through the eyes of a constant traveler, the railroad tramp.While it does indeed describe some of America, the author quickly loses focus on the aspect of seeing American through the eyes of the hobo to looking at hobo society itself. For the most part, he does this latter quite well, except where he finally intrudes and makes a bald statement of his opinion, and what he deems to be the reader's opinion, in the last page.Conover is refreshingly naive, in some ways, and not afraid to place his naivet&eacute; in what could be considered a work of autobiography. While I doubt someone could use this book as a manual for catching a ride on a rail, it does allow for enough detail to catch some understanding of the complexity and difficulties accompanied thereto. As a travel book, it's interesting and worth the time."},{"Title":"Rolling Nowhere: Riding the Rails with America's Hoboes","review":"While growing up, author Ted Conover was fascinated by the hobo lifestyle which represented freedom, independence and adventure. So, in 1980, he took time off from studies at Amherst to play hobo and ride the rails through the western states, ostensibly gathering material for a senior anthropology thesis. Hopping a freight in St. Louis, he went by stages to Denver, Salt Lake City, Pocatello (Idaho), Havre (Montana), Fargo (North Dakota), Spokane, Seattle, Portland, Eugene (Oregon), Oroville (California), Elko (Nevada), Oakland, Bakersfield (California), Los Angeles, Yuma, El Paso, and back to Denver. Along the way, he meets and loosely befriends those that wander from one place to the next in search of food stamps, discarded edibles and a safe place to sleep - an autonomy and liberty gained at the sacrifice of loved ones, comfort, security, and the income from a steady 9 to 5. The most interesting was 50-year old Sheba, the rare female tramp, who'd built herself a multi-room shelter out of old tires.Conover is a talented writer who deftly captures the \\"romance\\" of the rails in ROLLING NOWHERE.About the scenery from a boxcar: \\"A twisting chasm of waterfalls, spillways, gray rock, and isolated scrub trees hanging on to the canyon walls for dear life, the Feather River Canyon was inaccessible by car, but ... spectacular by freight train.\\"About the grunge: \\"Forrest ... scratched his scalp vigorously and pulled out a small something. He flicked it away with distaste toward the other side of the tree where I slept.\\"About the food: \\"I ... shared ravenously in the fare: a bottle of cold white port, a small, dirty Baggie of lettuce, and two brown bananas.\\" But hey, the chow isn't all bad. Evidence gathered by Ted suggests that dumpster diving in back of KFCs after closing hour yields a feast of mashed potatoes and fried chicken. And I love fried chicken. (\\"Say, Hon, what are we doing for our wedding anniversary dinner?\\" Am I a romantic devil, or what?)The author's youthful idealism is evident at the book's conclusion when he preaches for fairer treatment of hoboes by the society through which they wander. They are, after all, victims of the system. This is several pages after he describes his welcome of a fellow traveler trying to climb aboard his moving boxcar uninvited: \\"He was about to leap in when I set my boot down on his fingers, hard. With a yelp, he disappeared.\\" A nice touch, don't you think?While reading ROLLING NOWHERE, I was struck by the author's almost complete lack of humor in describing a journey that should have afforded more opportunities for such. This is a serious piece written in a deadpan style. I wish Ted had lightened up some. There were also so many instances of deja vu that I soon realized that I'd read this book before - probably back in the early 80's when first published. I need to write myself a note that twice is more than enough such that I don't pick it up again two decades from now. Instead, maybe I can find a book about vacationing in the garbage dumps of Calcutta."},{"Title":"Rolling Nowhere: Riding the Rails with America's Hoboes","review":"Although twenty years isnce it was first published, the book has a timeless aspect that is quite moving; essentially, Rolling Nowhere is an indictment of how the most wealthy, powerful and materialistic nation in the history of human civilization treats those who have fallen through the cracks. As taken in and enthralled as I was by the author's experiences, I was in the end more saddened than anything alse."},{"Title":"Rolling Nowhere: Riding the Rails with America's Hoboes","review":"This is the first of Ted Conover's four books available today. I am now reading the fourth. I recommend all of them. Rolling Nowhere is a fascinating look at a fading overlooked culture. Ted's compassion for marginalized populations is evident. I'd love to meet the author and talk about his other adventures that didn't become published books."},{"Title":"Rolling Nowhere: Riding the Rails with America's Hoboes","review":"Recently I developed an interest in freight hoppin' and the Hobo lifestyle and I began to look around for books to read. Out of the few I found here on amazon I'm glad I choose Conover's adventure.The meat of the book consist of a young Conover traveling across the west by freight meeting tramps (as they like to refer to themselves as, rather than \\"Hobo\\") He meets a variety of different individuals, and quickly learns tramp etiquette. He also learns how to survive off the system by using \\"Sally's\\" (Salvation Army) and \\"Willy's\\" (GoodWill) along with the missions and the availability of food stamps (Which most of the other tramps use to buy alcohol with)On one occasion he finds himself in an awkward position and is unfairly jailed because of his unruly hobo appearance. He remarks had he been neatly dressed he would of never encountered this problem. This really starts to give him an insight into the disadvantages hobos have with the law.I used to think of the rails as a romantic place to be. The sights from the trains, the freedom, and the adventure, but Conover's journey suggest slightly otherwise. Romantic as they may seem, the rails are a dangerous place to be...other tramps, bulls, kids throwing rocks, etc. After you've been riding them for a while you're hardened and the romanticism slowly dissolves away when you're fighting to survive.He wrote this in the late 80s as well. I imagine to hop a train these days, in 2007, would be close to suicide with the abundance of terrorism laws. It'd be interesting to see how the Hobo population has changed since then though."},{"Title":"Rolling Nowhere: Riding the Rails with America's Hoboes","review":"Kudos to Ted Conover for having the guts, shortly after graduating college, to spend time riding the rails in the western United States to learn about the lives of modern-day hobos. He is unclear about precisely how long he spends on this adventure; I think a few months. He finds pretty much what you would expect to find -- lots of drunkards and mentally ill men, plus a few women, who bristle at authority and prefer to spend their time riding from town to town. He quickly learns the ropes of how to get free food and sometimes money in various cities, and he takes great pride in acquiring sufficient expertise that he can identify others who are less skilled than he. Conover also takes pain to make sure we know he is more broadminded than other hobos, making friends with Hispanic laborers as well as white tramps.The weakest part of the book is Conover's occasional political analysis. The strongest is when he quotes Orwell's Down and Out in Paris and London, though the quotations from that fascinating book remind us just how much better a writer Orwell was than Conover.The book is a quick read, but I don't think many people will get much from it beyond that fact that Conover happened to take this trip and that the hobos were pretty much as expected."},{"Title":"Rolling Nowhere: Riding the Rails with America's Hoboes","review":"There's a certain kind of journalism/travel writing/ethnography that greatly appeals to me, in which the author immerses themselves in a culture or subculture that I find fascinating but have no desire to visit myself. This book is exactly in that vein, as Conover took a break in 1980 from attending Amherst College to ride freight trains as a hobo. I found his experience compelling enough to later check to see if he had written anything else, and only then realized that the naive 20-year-old who rode the rails grew up and spent a year as a prison guard as research for his critically acclaimed book Newjack: Guarding Sing Sing.As a product of a nice upper middle-class family and a student at a prestigious liberal arts college, he had to undergo a physical and psychological transformation to embark on his trip. And he began his hobo journey with the vague sense that riding the rails would both tell him something about America and bring meaning to his anthropology classes. One of the common pitfalls of such experience journalism is that the author has a somewhat silly romantic notion as to what awaits him. Fortunately, while Conover was somewhat naive, he did enough background reading to have realistic expectations about what he'd encounter.It's fascinating to watch him dive into the hobo way of life, picking up the tips and tricks that sustain the mostly male subculture. He runs the gamut, from literally jumping on and off moving trains, to spending nights in missions, dumpster-diving food, working welfare systems for food stamps, giving blood for money, calculating the cheapest way to get drunk, setting up camp in hobo \\"jungles,\\" working in the fields as a day laborer, and much much more. Along the way, his simple and clear writing conveys how he shed his notions of what to expect along the way.While he's generally sympathetic to the hardships endured by many of the people he meets, he's also honest enough to let their stories speak for themselves. And while some are certainly driven to the nomadic life by their economic circumstances, the hobo life seems to attract a certain type of man who has trouble living within the norms of society and feels the need for freedom from these norms. This psychological aspect of the hobo life is one area where Conover left me wishing for a little deeper insight into the people he meets. He does, however, spend a good amount of time grappling with other aspects of their psychology, especially the instinctual distrust they have of anyone, even those they get to know well.At the time of his trip, many people were surprised to know that freight-riding hobos still existed and had assumed the practice was long dead. Some 25+ years after his trip, that assumption seems likely to be more on target, if for no other reason than the post-9/11 tightening of all forms transportation security."},{"Title":"21204 MATH CONNECTIONS HIGH SCHOOL","review":"the book asks the reader a series of questions on a math topic/prthemitic, algebra and precalculusits good in that its not a tradiditionalmath book because of the line of questions the author asks..there ares somtimes more than a single answeras the question is not specific"},{"Title":"Our Joyful Confidence: The Lordship of Jesus in Colossians : An Exposition","review":"This is an excellent commentary on Colossians. I'm surprised it's not used by more pastors. The author gives an excellent treatment of the biblical text. He interacts with key commentaries but simplifies the technicalities and makes some great applicational points. This is a great combination of exegesis, theology, and homiletical helps. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Ink-Keeper's Apprentice.","review":"At first when I saw that someone had given this book two stars, I was amazed ... then I read the whole review and saw the person gave very appropriate reasons. This book is excellent reading for a wide variety of people; the author had a highly unusual childhood, essentially becoming unofficially \\"emancipated\\" from his parents and living on his own from early adolescence. We learn a great deal about the thoughts and experiences of a talented author and writer who saw into a number of unfamiliar and intriguing worlds.At the same time, I know what the reviewer means when she says there are a number of places in the story where events are scary or off-putting to many readers. The author isn't trying to write a shocker or a gross-out book, but he tries hard to be honest about his youthful life, and along with the delightful experiences he had in developing his artistic talents, there were some disturbing events that left him confused and hurt at the time. People who know his wonderful children's picture books might not be prepared for this one, in which not everything is \\"sweetness and light.\\" So the lone \\"two-star\\" reviewer has done an important favor in cautioning you what to expect.Nonetheless, young people looking for books that reflect some of the hard realities of life -- or who at least can read about them without being too discouraged -- can gain a lot from reading this powerfully account of the good and the bad in the life of a very unusual boy who grew into a very unusual man."},{"Title":"The Ink-Keeper's Apprentice.","review":"This is the best because the japanese culture is a whole new unexplored area for us 'Americans', we hardly know anything about anything in countries like Japan or China and this book displays almost the whole life of an average kid in Japan.

The book just made me keep reading and reading, and I couldn't stop. The topic it talked about was unique, a topic that I haven't ever read about before. Mr. Say seems to be able to capture a person in what he writes. The way he tells it makes what's happening in the book so real. I wish that I was Kiyoi, because one of the things that I always wished to be able to do was draw. The charactor that I liked the best was Kiyoi, partially because he was the main charactor and partially because he led such an interesting life. He seemed to be a friend that I would like to have.

I wish I was the boy who became the pupil of the famous cartoonist because I could become a little famous and I could draw and paint well. The character I liked best was Kiyoi because he was brave, nice, and when he got advice, he would learn from it quickly. He liked painting with charcoal, watercolors, and pastels.

It takes place in the Rocky Mountains, just post civil-war time. \\"Reb\\" is a young woman who is fearless. Born to a Mountain man's family, she was no stranger to the wilderness and was an expert with a rifle. Dressed in dirty buckskins,with short cropped hair, she passed as a boy, which is just what \\"Kincaid\\", the injured(but very handsome) man she rescued and nursed back to health in a remote mountain cabin, thought.He called 'the boy' \\"Rebel\\", which fit her to a tea, not knowing he was really being cared for by \\"Rebecca\\", and under those dirty old buckskins, a beautiful young woman was falling in love with him.Kincaid also has secrets.He was on a mission for the government and had plans he dare not let on about to this young Rebel who held his life in his hands.When finally the truth about each other is revealed, they realize they are overcome with the feelings they have for each other. But...Kincaid cannot bear to have a woman who lives such a life of danger(having lost his first wife tragically), and Reb could never leave her beautiful Mountain home for a \\"mindless Yankee tenderfoot\\". The dangerous and torturous situations they face together on their travels home may have them realizing they cannot live without each other.If you have read others of Miss Johnston's adventure/romance novels, you will recognize her definitive style of having the hero and heroine at odds with each other from the start. But what's nice and always different is the personalities of the main characters. In this case, she adds some humor to the mix, as the Reb and Kinciad are constantly bickering like children, and they will make you chuckle with their antics.Although Reb seems young at 17 to us, considering the time and place, she was probably considered a grown woman. .If this is your first Joan Johnston book, beware..you will get hooked! I especially love the stories that take place in the frontier time of history. The added danger and tension and the Western adventure of the time era she adds,makes for a gripping story.And of course, she has quite a knack for the romance side of the story as well, that gets a little steamy on occasion.I would also recommend Johnston's \\"Sisters of the Lone Star\\" trilogy starting with Frontier Woman, then \\"Comanche Woman\\" followed by \\"Texas Woman\\"(my personal favorite)for those that enjoy Western adventure/romance.Happy Trails and enjoy the read....Laurie"},{"Title":"Reference Manual for Office Personnel","review":"the book is old and outdated.

I hate it when people say 'X,' when they really should say 'Y.' &quot;Then Quinn's book came out and-- I think this is what did it-- it pretty much shut that whole thing down, for at least ten or fifteen years. (It's a job that's never finished for good, it's more ongoing, like weeding. Menken put in a fair amount of work on it, decades earlier.)Quinn's take on what the &quot;language sins people&quot; were proposing, and his demonstrations of the error of their ways, are always very amusing, often outrageous, and ultimately unanswerable. It's a very good book-- you will argue with it as you read it.He became a kind of &quot;language guy&quot; himself, in the process-- he was nicer to Safire than to the rest of them, and Safire still quotes him sometimes in his NY Times column."},{"Title":"Evolution and Culture","review":"I also read Evolution and Culture as a student (in the early 60's) and it has served me well as an anchor for my perspectives on national behavior and culture change ever since. Unlike the previous reviewer, I do not recall that Sahlins and Service specifically said any particular nation, such as China, would become the birthplace of a new dominant culture or civilization. Only that they suggested, from observations made on a number of historical examples, that the next rise of civilization would be carried on by some culture that was marginal and outlying to the currently dominant one. In their terms, the new rise to dominance would be accomplished by some group that is uninvested in the obsolete technologies of the past. I do agree that it is among the most important works of the 20th century and ought be on the shelf of anyone who gives thought to the current status of nations and why or how they change."},{"Title":"Evolution and Culture","review":"I read this book in 1967 while I was an anthropology student at the University of Virginia. I just found it again online and ordered it. I think that this book and Ludwig Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus are the two most important books of the 20th Century. I thought that the attempt to use evolutionary anthropological theory to make predictions about the future course of human societies was bold and approached brazen, but I have always remembered one prediction that has become increasingly evident with each decade. Fifty years ago Sahlins and Service suggested that the dominant country/culture of the foreseeable future would be the Chinese and that the US would be well served to position itself as the Greeks were to the Romans to maintain our influence during our period of declining power. Unfortunately, we seem to be enthusiastically pursuing a course of disparaging intellectual achievement rather than respecting and encouraging it and thereby squandering our heritage. Read this book.

She has a young daughter Sydney, 8-years-old that is off to spend her first summer in Mexico with a Dad who never wanted to know her until now, strangely enough. Geoff and Lindsey divorced bitterly once Lindsey became pregnant, and he did not want the child. So ever since that time, Lindsey has kept herself and Sydney in a \\"closet,\\" so to speak in their tiny apartment with nothing exciting happening.But there begins a turning point in Lindsey's life when she is called on a mission by her sister Laura to help recover stolen dinosaur tracks. And since Lindsey is a skilled palentologist, this is her field. So she drives 1,000 miles to Texas on Jubilee Ranch. She will also have to pose as a horse psychology patient, and it is there that she meets Zach, whom she is attracted to instantly. And whether she likes it or not, she can't stop herself from falling in love.In horse psychology class, Lindsey finds out about her relationships to people through horses. It takes awhile before she loosens up to a horse, Sleepy, and can put life in perspective.That is not the only thing though. Never having been a great animal lover, she encounters a stray dog, that automatically takes to her. Mr. Grits is a dog nobody loves-except maybe Lindsey actually will? The story tells this as you read.Toward the end of the book, Sydney's father brings her back to the ranch early. In shock at the vacation being cut short for Sydney, Lindsey wonders why and finds out that Geoff ran off again from his new wife because she was pregnant. Fatherhood was not in his plans-but there is a single event that changes all that and Geoff changes.Lindsey is truly afraid of new steps in her life, and once Syd comes back to her, she is all set to drive back to Colorado-for sure. She is afraid to take a leap of faith in new life challenges that will change life perhaps for the better-like it was meant to be."},{"Title":"Over the Moon at the Big Lizard Diner (Texas Hill Country Series #3)","review":"This is my first Lisa Wingate book, but it won't be my last.

Together, Laura and Collie hatched a plan to get Lindsey out of her rut ~~ and sent her to Collie's cousin's horse ranch undercover to find out what happened to the missing dinosaur tracks. Taking a class in horse psychology, Lindsey finds out what matters in life and falls in love with Zach, one of the locals.It is a fun book ~~ a fast read and enjoyable.

Prentice Hall 2000.The above text book is a 495 page book, ISBN number0-13-011493-6.The book provides a clear introduction to the world of insects. It talks about insect complexity and diversity and their influence on human and the ecosystem in general. There are several interesting concepts in the book but of interest to me was the defense mechanism in different insects. Insects like all organisms are eaten by predators. For protection, they have evolved morphological structures which permit them to bite, flee or sting the attacker. Other behaviors do exist to increase survival. For instance, insects like walking sticks have weakened areas at the trachnter that break under extreme stress. Such an act might occur when the insect is grabbed by a predator. Reflexes within the removed appendages cause the leg to twitch, which diverts attention from the escaping insect. Specialized membranes prevent bleeding and regeneration of the leg may be possible should future molts occur. Another interesting example is the defense mechanism in lady bird beetles and blister beetles. When threatened, some insects are capable of squeezing drops of hemolymph from specialized skeletal weak pints. The hemolymph contains toxic substances such as malachiines and cantharides or repellents. Other insects have the ability to feign death. Many beetles with hard exoskeletons feign death when disturbed and remain motionless for a few seconds or several hours. This lack of movement protects these individuals because many predators require movement of prey as an attack stimulus. Eventually the reflex subsides and then insect returns to normal. Some insects use chemical defense (allomones), a strategy common to insects with extended longevity hence longer exposure to predators and parasites. Although some of these substances are directed to specific predators, most are effective upon a broad spectrum of enemies. They are commonly released from exogenous glands in insects, however, some are present in the hemolymph and are leaked out between sclerites with increased blood pressure. Anal glands in many beetles secrete volatile fluids some of which are ejected with explosive force for distance up to 1 m. Predators react to such fluids as either repellents or irritants, although few are killed. Other insects like moths use sonic behavior to escape predation. Concealing coloration is a common mechanism. Insects blend with their background hence difficult to see. This is called concealing or cryptic coloration. Some like walking sticks resemble twigs while others like treehoppers resemble thorns. This is a successful mechanism unless the insect moves then the predator detects it.The book fully fulfilled my expectations. Reading the introduction was fun and this is what actually triggered me to read the entire book. The book can suit both young people and the old. The reason is that it talks about things in nature and things we can relate to. We all wonder how those insects in the wild are able to keep safe and this book provided the answer to all my questions. I'm sure it will answer many peoples question as well, therefore, I would most definitely recommend it to a friend.Top"},{"Title":"White Collar Slacker's Handbook","review":"I have really enjoyed reading this book.

After the Nazis take over their town and send them to a ghetto, Maciek-a young Jewish boy-and his family must to take on new identities in order to survive the German occupation. The family is forced to separate and only Maciek and his aunt Tania are left together, posing as a widowed mother and her son while they travel through Poland looking for refuge.I don't tend to dwell much on my ethnic background. I'm an American. I was born in America, as were my parents and my parent's parents. Still, if you ask me what nationalities I am, I'll tell you. I'm half Polish, with the other half being mostly Irish, with some English, and Welsh. I don't look stereotypically Polish or Irish, and both my families come from Christian backgrounds, so I don't look Jewish. I've never been to any of these countries, I don't speak their languages, and I'm not particularly well versed in their histories. I'm just your average American, with a very Polish last name, Zakrzewski. My family simplified the pronunciation to \\"Za-crew-ski,\\" though it sounds quite different in Polish. I'd like to know more about my family's background and what brought both branches here to America. I could ask my Grandmothers and I know they'd tell me, but it just isn't something that we seem to talk about in my family. Out of the two countries, I probably know the least about Poland. If my last named started with \\"Mc\\" or \\"Mac\\" maybe I wouldn't care as much, but since I'll always be identified first as Polish, I have some deep, unfulfilled interest in this nation.It's not everyday I read about Poland. I've learned about World War II, and the atrocities of the Holocaust. I know about Germany's invasion of Poland and of Auschwitz, but it's all textbook knowledge and documentaries from the Discovery Channel. Most of the information I know is cold and sterile. As someone who wasn't born until 1981, the closest thing I can get to a first hand experience is usually from a survivor of a concentration camp. Rarely does myself-or anyone for that matter-get a fist hand look at what it was to live during these times, outside the nazi camps and Jewish ghettos. Bagley does a fine job in showing us what it meant to be a Jew in Poland during World War II from a perspective greatly different from those poor souls who ended up in Hitler's death camps.Like Dante's pseudo-self in his Divine Comedy, Maciek-the hero of Bagley's tale-wanders around his own hell with his aunt Tania as a protector and guide. Just like Dante, Maciek is immune to the actual terrors of the German invasion, due to his forged documents stating he is of Aryan decent, and must travel through his ravished homeland as an outsider observing the atrocities committed by the Nazis. Since Maciek is only one person, the purpose of his journey isn't to change his homeland. His task is to inform the rest of his country, and the world, of what actually occurred in Poland, so that it can hopefully never happen again. He is merely a tool used to relate these horrors.As I've already said, I know very little about Poland and its people. Most of what I do know centers around the county's tendency to be conquered by other nations, but probably the most widely known chapter in Poland's history occurred during the Nazi Holocaust. Bagley's novel is the first time I've every encountered these events related from an objective view. This book has given me a better understanding of what actually transpired during the German occupation then any other source I've ever encountered. Wartime Lies not only gives us a chronological history of events, but also an emotional history of a person who lived through them. This marriage of history and personal exploration paints a more vivid picture then any textbook or documentary could.Even after the war, Maciek and the remains of his family still lived under false pretenses, fearing what still might occur if their Jewish heritage were discovered. While I have no fear of others knowing I'm Polish, in some ways I understand the feeling of not being true to ones background. While I don't attempt to hide my ethnic background, I make no strides in exposing it either. If anything, Bagley has not only kindled in me a desire to learn more about my own family and nationality, but his book has also given me a new perspective on events that I thought I knew all to well."},{"Title":"Wartime Lies","review":"Well, writing a questioning response to this book, especially this late in the game, isn't likely to make me very popular. Let me make this clear: the Holocaust was as real and as bad as you've (hopefully) heard, and there's no excuse for it.Still, the current image of the plight of Jews amongst Poles during WWII has reached such a point of apparent consensus, that few dare wonder aloud whether the situation in Poland was a lot more complicated than generally portrayed. The general population seems remarkably ignorant of many basic facts about Poland's occupation during WWII. First of all, according to the Nazis, it wasn't actually \\"occupied Poland\\" to begin with. That's because the Nazi Germans simply annexed western Poland into Germany right from the start. On the other hand, central Poland, which includes most of what people usually think of as Poland, was deemed the \\"General Government,\\" and this government was all Germany's; it wasn't supposed to be Poland at all. For Poles from those western areas, the Nazis immediately began either putting them into forced labor, or deporting them to the General Government.The Nazis weren't shy about stating what the GG was for: the staging grounds for the complete destruction of the Polish nation and its culture, the establishment of a vast pool of slave labor to serve the Germans, and the ultimate elimination of every single Polish person from that soil, so as to make way for the German immigrants. Of course, all of the Jews (the largest Jewish community in Europe), would be exterminated, as would much of the Polish intelligentsia. Poles in general, being Slavs, were deemed an inferior race, and valuable only as slave stock for the Reich and the German people. A relatively small portion of them, probably those considered to have at least some Germanic heritage, would be allowed to assimilate, whereas the others would eventually be removed in some way. The Nazis were more vague about just what that meant, talking publicly about eventually deporting the inhabitants to Russia beyond the Ural mountains. But in practice, when deporting unwanted people, the Nazis never \\"resettled\\" people anywhere. They either put them into forced labor, or exterminated them. Furthermore, there is plenty of good reason to suspect that those East Europeans forced into labor had really been given a very calculated slow death sentence via overwork and starvation. None of this should be surprising, really. Hitler laid out the foundation for this in \\"Mein Kampf.\\" \\"Lebensraum\\" was not only all about settling Germans in the East, but completely eliminating the Slavic natives. The assumption, and excuse, for all of this, was that they were supposedly inferior.There is no doubt there is and has been anti-Semitism in Poland, often virulent. But it wasn't always that way. At first, Poles were \\"notorious\\" for being unwilling to buy the hateful propaganda that some factions of the Roman Catholic Church in the West were trying to propagate in their country. In the wake of the great waves of the plague in the West, in which Jews were very cruelly persecuted, most of the survivors settled in Poland (and its partner, Lithuania), at the invitation of the kings. The anti-semitism would develop as a result of religious influences, of course, as well as ultranationalist feelings. Furthermore, Jews were often employed as tax collectors, which especially helped make them unpopular in Ukrainian areas.There should also be no doubt that some Poles, particularly in rural areas in eastern Poland and beyond, not only wouldn't help Jews, but actively persecuted them themselves. One factor not generally discussed: these atrocities were most often perpetrated in areas that had been under Tsarist Russian control just a few decades earlier. The Tsarist police forces were notorious in Eastern Europe for concocting ant-Semitic propaganda and rumors amongst the peasantry, which was generally very poor and isolated and had little or no education.But what about accusations that Poles should have rose up and liberated the death camps and do more to fight the Nazis? This is more evidence that a lot of people, especially in the West, are poorly informed. First of all, the Poles fought with tooth and nail against the Germans during the invasion. They essentially had no choice but to surrender after a couple of, weeks, because not only did this poor nation not have anywhere near the military capability of Germany (and what they did have was now largely destroyed), continuing to fight would only have meant the Nazis stepping up the rate of attacks on civilians, which had already been at a shocking level. Surrendering might at least buy them some time until their alleged allies the British and the French would finally arrive. They didn't. Meanwhile, the Soviet Union did liberate Auschwitz in the later years, but clearly had no intentions of helping at first; in fact, they had invaded Poland themselves. If the Soviet Union hadn't ultimately in turn been invaded by Germany, what are the chances that Stalin would have lifted a finger? Probably zero. He had made a deal with Hitler, after all, and was simply shocked that the Nazis broke it.So, with all this mind, they were somehow supposed to liberate the death camps, even though the camps were not only heavily armed and protected under an omnipresent evil regime that controlled absolutely everything? Oh, and where were the Poles supposed to get the weapons to fight these insurrections? Are you kidding? Arming ethnic minorities -- let alone majorities -- hostile to their regime is the very last thing the Nazis would have wanted, and indeed weapons for Poles were almost impossible to come by -- unless they improvised their own crude versions. Several villages were razed by the Nazis (and the inhabitants conscripted into forced labor) in order to build Birkenau, the largest part of Auschwitz, which was now politically located in Germany (not even the General Government), for what it's worth. Even if some of the remaining Poles could liberate some prisoners, where were they supposed to hide? It's all good to wax on about escaped Jews surviving in the forests in the East, but most of Poland was not well-suited to gorilla warfare and hiding, as it was mainly flat and cleared for farm land. There were Polish households that concealed Jews, but it came at tremendous risk: occupied Poland was the only place under the Nazi hegemony where harboring Jews meant the entire host family (along with the Jews) would be shot on the spot if this was discovered. This actually happened, too. And most perplexingly, it somehow escapes the observation of the finger-pointers that, for reasons mentioned above, the Poles were not able even to save themselves. In fact, until the Soviets marched in late in the war, no one else came into Poland to liberate Jews (or anyone else), either. This latter point seems to have been lost amongst self-righteous accusers elsewhere, including all those evangelical Christians who, belatedly, have declared themselves the most strident defenders of Israel, and Jews in general.Meanwhile, Poles in large numbers fought heartily in allied armed forces, especially for Britain, though they haven't always received a lot of credit for it. A significant number of them even fought with the Red Army, even though Stalin had earlier massacred many thousands of Polish officers and annihilated the intelligentsia, in addition to invading and grabbing Poland's eastern territories.But even considering the horrors Louis Begley undoubtably endured, and alludes to in this book, I still find it maddening that he says posing as a Polish Catholic implies one has \\"Aryan papers.\\" He is far from being the only one to refer to Poles as \\"Aryans,\\" but this characterization is absurd. Certainly, posing as a Pole (as opposed to a Jew) would have increased his chances of surviving, and who could blame him for that? But the Nazis themselves made it very clear that the Poles were far from being Aryans, and they were treated accordingly. Denying this well-documented fact is just another perpetration of WWII revisionism, even if he was there."},{"Title":"Wartime Lies","review":"Through the voice of an immature pre-pubescent boy, Maciek, LouisBegley illustrates the Jewish-Pole population of South Pole by dragging the reader through the horrible streets of his past. Louis Begley, having survived the turmoil of World War II reminisces of the familial bonds with his Aunt Tania and his grandfather whom he loved so dear. As an attorney of law in New York City, this is Begley's first novel and it is incredibly a portrayal of what was his battle with Nazi Germany during WWII. But, as the novel unfolds we are uncertain of where the narrator is going to take us, dancing into the dream that was his cruel past. Begley retells the events of his history in the form of a story, one which he remembers so clearly, one which he can't forget. Begley's descriptions are vivid and often remind me of things I was told not to say, 'out loud', conversation that boys and girls have alone. A fun young Maciek is no later spoiled by the brutal circumstances of Hitler and his army of destruction. His youth is stolen to the war and his only life is wiht his aunt. Aunt Tania, plays an essential role model as a maternal figure, while disguising both she and Maciek's true identities.The narrator tells the events in the form of prose, remembering so clearly that which has ailed his memories. The young boy, Maciek is the Jew that 'was not', concealing himself down to the foreskin, covering who he was, as well as protecting his life from eminent death. Tania and Maciek travel from the country to the city avoiding notice or recognition by a family member or colleague, perfecting native dialect and practicing safe word use and or communication. The bulk of the novel is simply the two main characters, Tania and Maciek, chasing down their fears, by disguising them, hiding from the government and its people.As Begley points back to the past, to Greeks, gods and goddesses, to the Aenied, he remains devastated by the tragedy which has befallen to him and many others. Being a Pole, he was of very few to haved survived to tell their story. Eating anything that was left about, or to spare and surviving many bouts with pneumonia and liver jaundice, this young man emegered to shed light on his sacrifices and let the burden of his truths be the past.Compiling a series of giddy childhood memories with obscene accounts of a genocidal war, Begley writes to tell of his \\"Inferno\\", the moments that he outlasted the damned, even as a criminal of the law he overcame the wrong doers. Although, I do find this type of history horrifying, I take very little interest in Begley's descriptions as they give too much silly detail and not enough truth or evidence behind the ordeal. The moral of the novel, is however,a poignant one, surviving the wretches of cold brutality may be overcome by emerging anew, unmasking the infection of such painful wounds releases the evil."},{"Title":"Wartime Lies","review":"This affecting autobiographical novel chronicles the life of a little Jewish boy and his family during World War II Poland. It is narrated by the now grown boy, who begins by reflecting on his adult life and his attachment to the Aeneid, whose eponymous character likewise escaped the destruction of the world he knew. But unlike Aeneas, who survived to found the city of Rome, Begley's narrator finds no new home for himself--all he had and, even all he was, was ripped away by the lies that allowed him to survive.Maciek, the little boy the narrator once was, is a Jewish child who grows up cosseted and loved by his family. The outbreak of the war changes all that, as the family's survival depends on moving from one place to another, always hiding their Jewish identity and blending in with the general population. One by one, most of his family die or vanish. Maciek and his Aunt Tania somehow survive, cautiously maintaining a fearful distance from those around them in order to keep from being discovered. But survival takes its toll--after the war is over, the lies have become protective coloration and aren't so easily disposed of. The little boy Maciek was is no longer.&quot;Wartime Lies&quot; has its moments of suspense, but those aren't what linger at the end. The true impact of the book comes from the child's matter-of-fact narration. Many of the situations in the book should be emotionally charged, but the flatness of the narrative doesn't reflect this. It's as if the adult narrator is talking about a different person, and in many ways he is. The distance between child and adult reflects the true tragedy of the story. In order to survive physically, the child's psyche has been irreparably damaged.All told, &quot;Wartime Lies&quot; is a stunning book, quietly moving. It is one of the best Holocaust novels that I have read."},{"Title":"Wartime Lies","review":"Louis Begley is able to convincingly write of survival as seen through the innocence and straightforwardness of a young Jewish boy. A boy whose life gradually becomes a web of lies and inward and outward loss. Loss which he will ultimately not be able to ever recover from. This is a short book with appeal to adults and young adults given the young protagonist and appropriate content."},{"Title":"Wartime Lies","review":"Louis Begley's Wartime Lies is stark description of one family's fight to survive in Nazi occupied Poland. It is told through the eyes of a young boy, Maciek. He is the youngest in his family and he tells with an innocent voice the story of his family and their struggle. His youthful perception of the Nazi occupation provides the reader with an innovative view of what life was really like. He describes the terror of a family slowly breaking apart, a life where death preferred over captivity, and a world where no one can be trusted.Maciek and his aunt, Tania find themselves alone in a world at war, with only each other to depend on. The story traces their struggle to survive as the lies they tell in order to survive become more and more complex. Maciek learns that lying is sometimes a necessity to live but as a child he struggles with the idea of right lying and wrong lying. Maciek manages to escape from the war but not unscathed. He continues to struggle with the idea of who he is and where he belongs years after the war has ended.The reader of this novel has the opportunity to learn from Maciek and Tania's lives. The most important lesson that this novel teaches is the risk a person takes when they hide their true selves. Through Maciek's example, the reader sees that the longer you pretend to be someone you're not, the harder it is to escape from the fantasy. When person pretending finds difficulty in distinguishing their true self from their pretend self is the point when they are lost to themselves. Maciek is lost by the end of the novel and Begley is trying to teach the reader to find who they are before that part of them is lost forever."},{"Title":"Wartime Lies","review":"It's heartbreak to realize that the late great filmmaker, Stanley Kubrick, came very close to turning this book into a movie in the early-to-mid 1990's that was to be called &quot;Aryan Papers.&quot; And then along came Speilberg's &quot;Schindler's List&quot; and he dropped the project.

This book has given me a better understanding of what actually transpired during the German occupation then any other source I've ever encountered. Wartime Lies not only gives us a chronological history of events, but also an emotional history of a person who lived through them. This marriage of history and personal exploration paints a more vivid picture then any textbook or documentary could.Even after the war, Maciek and the remains of his family still lived under false pretenses, fearing what still might occur if their Jewish heritage were discovered. While I have no fear of others knowing I'm Polish, in some ways I understand the feeling of not being true to ones background. While I don't attempt to hide my ethnic background, I make no strides in exposing it either. If anything, Bagley has not only kindled in me a desire to learn more about my own family and nationality, but his book has also given me a new perspective on events that I thought I knew all to well."},{"Title":"Wartime Lies","review":"Begley's book is a gripping, stark tale of a Jewish child and his young aunt struggling, and I do mean, struggling to survive and hide from the Nazis and unsympathetic Poles in Poland during WWII. Although there are many, many stories about this dark period in our history, rare is the one written in this book's unnerving style. Sparse, riveting and fluidly crafted, Begley's tale is told from the viewpoint of child with absolutely NO dialogue - just the child's probing inner thoughts and frightening depictions of the crumbling and menancing world around him. The lies and fabrications the young boy and his aunt weave to hide from persecution at every turn are unbelievably fragile, thereby creating a kinetic tension throughout the novel which gives the reader no hint of the outcome - is it tragedy or triumph? One must read to find out the truth behind these wartime lies"},{"Title":"Wartime Lies","review":"In a different turn of events, I am spending a year in a library book discussion club that concentrates solely on the Holocaust theme. We generally study several works by the same author in one session. &quot;Wartime Lies&quot; is the fourth session, and I judge this to be the best of all the works thus far. Primarily, because we find that the Aunt and the Nephew are scrapping to survive. A question that asks itself is whether it is less difficult for two to slip away than a whole village? Nevertheless, Tania exhibits traits of cunning and deviousness that serve her cause well. Protecting Maciek provides the drive that she needs, and she does it well. Also, the two of them are intent in reaching his Grandfather, which is another inspirational segment of the story. The telling of the non-Jewish Poles turning against the Jewish Poles is even more frightening; in our discussion group we have one member whose husband is a survivor of the Holocaust, and he has told her that exact situation. When he returned to Poland, he then had to escape again, from his own countrymen! Other questions that I wondered about; how was Tania able to keep valuables safely hidden away from the other starving people with whom they had to live? Especially once their Nazi protector was found out and killed. Later, as the group was being sent/driven toward Auschwitz, her confrontation at the train depot with the German officer, was high drama. Except for the much higher stakes in Tania's case, it could be a portrayal of any determined person going toe-to-toe with someone in a superior position, seeking redress in a stressful situation. Author Begley is clever by insinuating other figures, i.e., Dante, Ovid, Virgil, into a parallel discussion of the immediate story line. At the end, a reader supposes that Maciek has chosen to completely blank out any memories of who he was born, and has completely obliterated all connections to his Jewish heritage. How will he reconcile himself to that abandonment?"},{"Title":"Wartime Lies","review":"The detail provided in this book is confusing as characters moved from different towns, apartments and people fade in and out of their lives, but that is precisely the way it was. A very good read for those fond of the genre and time period."},{"Title":"Wartime Lies","review":"Short and intensely moving story of a Jewish child's experiences in World War 2 Poland. The first chapter describes a pleasant middle-class upbringing but ends 'less than one year later came September 1939 and it was all over'.From then on the family is split up with the narrator travelling through Poland with his resourceful aunt using false identity papers. Suspicious of everyone, careful of their every move, they pass themselves off as Catholic Poles and come close to losing their own lives on a number of occasions.Yet even in the last chapter when the war is over, the lies must be kept up. Pogroms continue in liberated Poland and as Begley concludes:'And where is Maciek now? He became an embarrassment and slowly died. A man who bears one of the names Maciek used has replaced him. Is there much of Maciek in this man? No: Maciek was a child and our man has no childhood that he can bear to remember; he has had to invent one.'"},{"Title":"Wartime Lies","review":"Louis Begley's Wartime Lies paints a vivid picture of the life of a nine-year-old boy, Maciek, and his aunt, Tania, during World War II. The novel snares the reader from the very first page. Maciek is representative of most pre-pubescent boys until the Germans begin to take control of his home. This novel unfolds like an adventure story, containing violence, suspense, and drama; however, the reader must remind himself that, although the characters are fictitious, the story remains similar to that of many victims of the Holocaust. The terror that plagues the hearts of the characters is almost palpable. Since Maciek narrates the story, the war is seen through the eyes of this young boy. He recounts the \\"wartime lies\\" he and his aunt had to fabricate in order to live and all the while confesses his guilt of being a liar and hypocrite. His innocence is both touching and heart-wrenching. \\"She and I had to get used to the idea that we were quite alone: Tania and Maciek against the world. This was not an easy lesson to learn, but probably the world would beat it into our heads.\\" And the world did. The voice of an adult Maciek concludes the novel. This man bears no resemblance to the child he once was. He is unable to speak of his childhood; rather, he prefers to keep it buried amidst the rubble of a past that he no longer acknowledges. Upon reading this powerful conclusion, the reader can't help feeling a mix of emotions. Maciek has survived the war, but what has his survival brought him? Wartime Lies should be read to not only teach about the Holocaust, but also to allow the reader to see, hear, smell, taste, and feel the Holocaust."},{"Title":"Duncton Rising (Book of Silence)","review":"Pick this book up and you will not be able to put it down.

In his first Duncton triology he has moles following the faith of &quot;the Word&quot; as his antagonists, in this book a mole is martyred and executed as Jesus Christ was. This book, like the others in the series, makes an excellent secular fantasy read - the plot is really captivating and the prose is excellently written. However, his plagiatism and blasphemy of the Bible is inexcusable - instead of creating a relevant faith for his moles he had to go and twist the Christian faith around. Other than this major blodge, this is a good read."},{"Title":"Tadao Ando-Vitra House","review":"I bought this book being a great admirer of Tadao Ando but found it to be of no help to me. The pictures are not well printed and I find them to be too grainy or simply out of focus. Some of the photos are far too dark or too bright and therefor details of the building are lost. It seems that the photographs are ok, not great, but are not well delivered in this book as they have a greenish hue."},{"Title":"Tadao Ando-Vitra House","review":"A nice gift for those that can appreciate minimalist architecture and photography.

I have a number of Wrox books and I know that they're nearly always on the cutting edge of new technologies. This book is an absolute must for anyone wanting to be on the fore-front of mobile technology. It is written in a way that is instructive without being patronising. The authors obviously know their stuff and this comes accross very well in the book. I would reccommend this book to all and everyone!"},{"Title":"Professional Symbian Programming: Mobile Solutions on the EPOC Platform","review":"There are only a handful of Symbian books available yet, and this one is the best of them. It is not a tutorial but a fairly good reference. It does a good job of explaining concepts as well, for instance I really like the discussion of descriptors in chapter 5.Those who have no Symbian background will find this book difficult (not because the book is badly written, but because Symbian is a very different platform). I recommend that beginners read documentation and whitepapers available at Symbian's website, take an introductory class and then buy this book for reference. Dont try to learn Symbian programming from this book. You'll be disappointed.I also think that the authors should revisit and work on a new edition of this useful book. There has been an addition of many new topics since R5, that require good reference material - authors could do the Symbian community a favor by providing that much needed reference material.This book deserves 3.5 stars now - and if the authors release a new edition, it will get 5 stars from me."},{"Title":"Professional Symbian Programming: Mobile Solutions on the EPOC Platform","review":"First, I should state that I know the author. I better say that in case anyone believes my guilty of bias. However, it must be realised that this book is an official Symbian publication, and as such is the definitive reference book on programming for EPOC devices. Personally I think Martin has done a remarkable job putting all this together. As an ex-Symbian employee I have not done any coding since the early development days of the Psion Series 5.Recently I have needed to get up to date and get coding again. On a brand new PC, with no EPOC utilities on it, with the help of this book and its accompanying CD (which contains ALL of the official Symbian Software Development Kits), I had genuine freshly-compiled programs running on my Psion Series 5mx PDA within MINUTES. Martins writing style is very accessible, and explains the advanced concepts behind EPOC in a manner in which anyone can quickly understand them.As an aside, the book is deliberately written so that it does NOT have to be read sitting in front of a computer. As a result, this book makes a fantastic tutorial, as it can be read on the train, in the bath, anywhere when you might have a few minutes spare.A &quot;must buy&quot; for any individual or company considering programming in C++ any EPOC devices (which will in the near future include both PDA's and mobile phones). Well done Martin!"},{"Title":"Professional Symbian Programming: Mobile Solutions on the EPOC Platform","review":"As an introduction to programming on the Symbian platform this book is excellent. If you require detailed information on C++ EPOC programming then it may appear a bit sparse. You can get the required information from Symbian/Psion directly. If you wish to start programming on this platform then this is a great introduction. After reading it you will be able to make the most of the detailed information from Symbian themselves."},{"Title":"Professional Symbian Programming: Mobile Solutions on the EPOC Platform","review":"Even as a professional software engineer, I found this book poorly organized and terribly written with numerous forgettable tangents on the history of EPOC, lousy application implementation guidance (even if you can get the examples to work), and a structure that assumes that you are reading the book front to back (remember - this is over 1000 pages). So, get ready for a few nights burning the midnight oil. The installation CD is truly a hacked together job. And don't plan on using the book as a reference for any EPOC Java work - it treats Java implementations as a minor afterthought. I hope the authors produced better documentation for their solutions than they did for this book. Save your hard-earned money."},{"Title":"Professional Symbian Programming: Mobile Solutions on the EPOC Platform","review":"I recommend this book to anybody who's interested in Symbian development.

If you're planning on spending just a few days in Vienna, then this compact little book will be indispensible in locating the famous streets and tourist sights. The maps are more than adequate and the walking descriptions to each locale are precise and accurate. There is also corresponding material on how to use the U-Bahn in the city and which station to take for each particular site. There is a separate chapter on the churches of the city with a brief ranking system for the nosiest places, the friendliest, the cheapest food, etc.If you're planning a lengthy sojourn in Vienna or if you already know the city well, then this book would not be as helpful. It is solely intended for the casual tourist and there is little, if any, information on the intriguing environs of the city. Many of the best sites are neglected because most tourists don't want to bother or simply don't have the time to stick around. Still, this is a thrifty guide you can stick in your pocket and consult when you need to find a restaurant, beer haunt or hotel. In short, if you're a first timer to Vienna, enjoy one of the greatest cities in Europe and be sure to tuck away Brook's guide."},{"Title":"Vienna (Eyewitness Travel Guides)","review":"As helpful and user-friendly as one has come to expect from DK Guides, this book on Vienna will help you track down key buildings such as the Hundertwasser Haus, the best coffeehouses such as the Cafe Sperl, and some interesting out-of-the-way places such as the Werkbundsiedlung that will make your trip more enjoyable. It also maps out the underground metro system and gives you an outline of the extensive trolley bus service. Of course, these guides are always subject to changes when it comes to hotels, restaurants, theaters and museum times, so one should check out the DK website for the latest updates. The maps key you into the districts of Vienna with beautiful illustrations, such as impressive cut-away sections of Stephansdom and other major buildings, along with photos of the buildings and quarters which comprise this great city. The guide also fills you in on the important dates and history of the city down through the ages to clue you into the meaning of the sites. It does lack a good overall map of the city, but these are easily available in Vienna. Best of all, you have a very nice way to recap your trip when you get home."},{"Title":"Vienna (Eyewitness Travel Guides)","review":"I picked up this guide for my trip to Vienna based on my perusal of all the Vienna city guides at my local bookstore. I had already booked an air and hotel package so was looking for a guide to the major sights, history, food and transportation. This book filled the bill quite nicely. Vienna is an imperial city with a rich history and the Eyewitness guides are well known for their depth in that area. Also useful was the star rating system for sights not to be used, and very useful information on the wonderful transportation system we had included with our Vienna Card. There were some good tips on dining, particularly in the Vienna cafes. One of my favorite features was the survival guide with lots of practical information on transportation from the airport, diagrams of bus, tram and subway lines, and more. If you don't need hotel information, this is probably the best guide for the money."},{"Title":"Vienna (Eyewitness Travel Guides)","review":"There are two kinds of travel guides, and both are useful: those guides that help you to plan your trip, and those to carry in your shirt pocket when the shoes hit the pavement. This Eyewitness Travel Guide is one of the best, if not the best, guidebook to use for planning your Vienna trip before you go. There is a tremendous amount of material, so the book uses small fonts and thin glossy paper; still, it has quite a bit of heft and may not be convenient to carry in your shirt pocket (and if you think this is thick, you should see the China guidebook). But I read about a lot of attractions here that I couldn't find in other reputable publications, and found more details in DK.If you want a quick guide to the sights while you are out and about the town, you may want to consider the compact DK Top Ten Guidebook. The two books have a great deal of overlap, but there's some information that was unique to the top ten guide."},{"Title":"Vienna (Eyewitness Travel Guides)","review":"The Eyewitness DK guides are beautiful books in their own right--you would enjoy reading them even if you didn't make the trip. The text is well organized and extensively illustrated with artwork and 3-D pictures of the major tourist attractions. The directions are excellent and they direct you to the important things to see at each location.A particularly helpful feature is a section with specific instructions on how to use Vienna's extensive public transportation system including a description of the various types of tickets and pictures of the ticket machines.This guide blows the competition out of the water."},{"Title":"Vienna (Eyewitness Travel Guides)","review":"Vienna is a fascinating place to visit and this is a great book to use. For once I did not find the subdivisions as useful in this book. Vienna can be a very confusing city to get around until you get the hang of it and sometimes the street maps in the book cut off in odd places. Despite that the recommendations of things to see and do and the smaller maps were top notch. I saw almost everything this book recommends within one jam packed three day weekend. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"Vienna (Eyewitness Travel Guides)","review":"My work has provided me with the opportunity to travel a good bit. I am the type of person who wants to get a working background for my destinations, both in terms of history and geographic layout. Because I work, I don't have a great deal of time to spend reading and studying different, often lengthy, travel guides before or during my trips.Because these guides are concise, beautifully illustrated, relatively compact, and impeccably organized, I cannot recommend highly enough the Dorling Kindersley Eyewitness Travel Guides! The DK Eyewitness Travel Guide is THE guide I buy for every destination. Not only do I get a quick history and background of the destination, but I also will be provided with a visual guide to everything. The visual detail is really what sets the DK Eyewitness Travel Guides apart.The street maps of common destination points are drawn in dimensional detail so you will visually recognize when you \\"get there.\\" This is particularly helpful when you don't speak the native language.The regional maps are colorful and concise. However, the DK Eyewitness Travel Guide really shows its stuff with the drawings associated with attractions such as museums. Their presentation of museum layouts allow the traveler who is short on time to quickly see the best of the museum within the time the traveler has to spend.Each DK Eyewitness Travel Guide has a good summary section in the back with practical information about where to eat, where to sleep, what to do, and how to get around.While I may supplement the DK Eyewitness Travel Guide with others for a more detailed travel guide, the other guide is only more to read, not more to see. Buy the DK Eyewitness Travel Guide first for any destination.Remember, no guide is perfect, and things change after printing. Sometimes paintings are stolen, loaned out, or being restored. Sometimes streetwork is being performed or buildings are being renovated. No other guide I know of updates information any faster than DK.

For example, the Benvenuto Cellini salt cellar is prominently illustrated in the section on the Kunsthistorische museum. Unfortunately, when I went there I found out that it had been stolen from the museum in May 2003. So much for the &quot;updated&quot; 2004 version. There are similar art items (such as the Vermeer) that have been loaned out to other museums for an extensive period, and should not have been listed in the 2004 guide.In addition, most of Vienna as of late June 2004 is being renovated, so you will find the exteriors of the Schoenbrunn Palace, the Staatsoper, the Kunsthistsorische museum, and even the Hotel Sacher in scaffolding, and the Parliament building's steps and fountains are a pile of rubble as they are being rebuilt. The Guide offered no warning for any of these.On the positive side, the Guide offers a good map of the underground and how to get to the city from the airport (the CAT train from the airport is even easier than the Guide indicates). It also offers a street map of the area most tourists would visit. However, the street I had to go to (Schikanedergasse) was not listed in the Guide map even though it was within the map area, and the seam in the book divided the map in an awkward fasion.The Guide also offers some good descriptions of the area within the Ringstrasse. However, some buildings that are a block or two apart are described in different sections of the book, so you may miss out on some of the sights if you only look at one section at a time.All in all, the book offered some help, but at times the information was vague or outdated. The next time I go to Vienna I shall consult another guide."},{"Title":"Vienna (Eyewitness Travel Guides)","review":"We bought the Insider guides for Prague, Budapest & Vienna after reading good reviews.

The only reason to not give more stars is the weight of the book, as it seemed twice as heavy as other guide books and this was a negative.

Because of the glossiness and number of pictures, it renders the guide slightly impractical (a little bulky and a little more tear-inducing to take scissors to). They could probably get away with a few less pictures if this is really a guide, not a memorial of your trip or advertisement to get you excited about going. After all, do you really need two pages of color photographs of Viennese foods, two more of desserts, and two of wine and beers? Are you really going to pull the guide out at dinner to make sure the Eierspeise or Mohnstrudel you've been served matches up with the book's photo?

But Vienna is wonderful too, in a very different way. What's similar is an ordered city centre with beautiful buildings and royal palaces. There's also the famous Spanish Riding School. We didn't have the chance to view that as you had to book and we had only 3 days for everything in Vienna. However, we did visit the adjoining palace and other beautiful buildings.Yet more of these anyone can see on TV - in the ballet sequences that are performed for the famous New Year's Day Concert with the Vienna Phil in the beautiful Golden Hall.The old city wall was taken down and is now a ring road but very different to the frenetic near-motorway that's the Peripherique round Paris. The Vienna ring road is just a road, wide in parts. Other fascinating places are of course the museums and the churches and the unusual St Stephen's Cathedral. Close to the ring road is the beautiful Mozart theatre - tours take place inside the theatre. From there we took two bus trips, one for a boat trip on the Danube and the other to the edge of the Vienna Woods.We stayed outside the centre in a pension that was once a convent and our bedroom was plain and simple but very large with a large vestibule. Nearby is the beautiful Schonbrun royal palace with extensive formal gardens and a little zoo, also a huge folly facing the back of the house below which they have summer concerts.Visiting the royal palaces and seeing the generalI value all my Eyewitness Guides - and Insight Guides too. I always buy whichever of these is available for places we visit, they are simply invaluable, and also I buy them for places I hope to visit someday, or even just because I'm interested even if I never expect to get there.

Outside cover is plastic coated card stock, doesn't soak up water when lying on the lunch table, easily cleaned. Glossy paper throughout its 288 information packed pages: a district map on inside front cover and public transport map on the inside back cover.\\"Introducing Vienna\\" is the first chapter devoting 60 pages to an overview Vienna from a geographical, historical and cultural perspective. Then brief descriptions of major attractions, even the brief descriptions take 20 pages because Vienna offers so much to the visitor.Next comes \\"Vienna by Area\\" with more detailed information on attractions with highlights of St Stephans Cathedral, the Hofburg area which was the Habsburg center of power now converted to civic and cultural uses, museums, palaces etc, too much to describe here as the book devotes 120 pages to guide the reader to sites, dining and maps.Next comes \\"Further Afield\\" with adjacent areas like the Prater recreation area with it famous Ferris Wheel \\"der reisenrad\\" and more museums. Schoenbrunn palace also in this chapter as are recommended day trips outside the city and along the Danube river. Concluding the chapter are detailed walking guides for self directed excursions.The section \\"Travelers Needs\\" has restaurants, hotels etc plus photos of local cuisine along with the German language name including the famous Sachertorte, it makes me hungry just looking at it.Closing the book are suggested entertainment venues, casinos, music theaters followed with practical information on exchanging money, public transportation, how to use public telephones, posting letters and cards, street maps and index.I selected this guide because it has plenty of information on sites and cultural attractions, its sturdy binding which will outlast me on the trip and its convenient size. I have travelled may places and a good practical guide is great for me, the explorer. I like to explore and discover on my own rather than join guided tours and be shown what others believe should interest me. This book givens me so much information I should not overlook anything major unless I choose to, and that's the point, I will choose for myself what to see and do. Vienna has so much to offer, the guide helps me sort it out.I intend to spend a full day at the KHM Art History Museum, watch an Opera at the world famous State Opera House, listen to a Mozart concert by the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra in the Music Hall, attend Sunday mass with Vienna Boys Choir, see Schoenbrunn, Belvedere etc. Still time in my schedule for day trips up the Danube to Durnstein to see the Castle where Richard the Lionheart was imprisoned and if my wife is up to it, a day trip to Budapest. Of course each day in Vienna we plan to visit pastry shops and coffee houses to get the full \\"flavor\\" of Vienna. A ride on the ferris wheel is almost mandatory.If there is anything more in the guide I could ask for, it would be more web site listings for music attractions as many of the venue tickets can be purchased in advance to be sure of getting seats. The guide has some web sites addresses, but a self planner like me could use more."},{"Title":"The Bishop method of clothing construction","review":"If you have but one book for clothing construction, this should be it.

Just a few thousand colonial troops, along with their Indian military staff and a handfull of top British government officials control a population of millions. But there is trouble ahead. Ghandi is busy raising the consiousness of the Indian population, and Afghanistan is poised to make trouble along the northern border.Ms. Cleverly immediately plunges the reader into a world where British administrators, like Lieutenant Governor of Bengal Sir George Jardine may as well be Rajahs. They live in mansions with a staff of servants, and continue to dress as they did in England, all the while living in a climate like that of Houston.The climate is the reason why the government repairs in summer to Simla, a mountain town which provides relief from the heat in the days before air conditioning. Scotland Yard Commander Joe Sandilands has been invited to visit Sir George for a vacation before heading back to England. Sir George sends a Packard limousine to pick Joe up at the railhead. This shows Joe packs some juice, since there are only four cars in Simla and Packard is the car of status in the years before the Second World War. Joe offers a ride to a famous Russian opera singer, who is murdered on the road to Simla.It turns out that Sir George has an ulterior motive in inviting Joe to visit. The beautiful Alice Conyers is the CEO of a successful trading company. A few months before, her brother, believed to have been killed in the war, had resurfaced. He was on his way to Simla to take over the family company when he was murdered (in 1922 the male heir still inherited, I assume).Is it a coincidence that Alice's brother and the opera singer were shot and killed at the same location? Is this a murder mystery? Anyway, Sir George asks Joe to investigate the murders, and Joe must be some kind of investigator, since he is a Scotland Yard Commander at a ridiculously early age. After all, the brilliant Adam Dalglish was middle-aged before he made Commander!All of the characters were extremely well drawn. All but Joe have distinctive, even colorful personalities. Even Joe might have a personality hidden somewhere, but this is the day of the British stiff upper lip.The plot is quite inventive, and features an early case of identity theft. The ending is fine, though the last ten pages or so draw leisurely to a close. But all in all, as the British say, \\"Well done!\\""},{"Title":"Ragtime In Simla (Joe Sandilands Murder Mysteries)","review":"In 1919 Alice Conyers reaches Paris, the first leg of her trek to India to take over the reigns of the Imperial and Colonial Trading Corporation. Since the death of her brother Lionel during World War I, she inherited 51% of the stock while her second cousin who she plans to marry owns the rest. However, their train falls into a ravine killing almost all on board. Alice continues on to India where she makes her firm a success.In 1922 Northern India, Scotland Yard Detective Joe Sandilands has finished up his tour of duty in India and is now the guest of Sir George Jardine, Lieutenant Governor of Bengal. He plans to spend a month in the guest cottage at Simla at the base of the Himalayas. Joe gives a lift to Russian opera singer Feador Korosovsky and witnesses his murder in the car driving them to Sir George. He reports the homicide and learns that Lionel, Alice brother died in the same spot with the same MO. Sir George asks Joe to help the authorities. He does finding all roads lead to Alice and that train wreck.Barbara Cleverly has written a fantastic historical police procedural at a time when India learned it was the equal of their occupier sand wants freedom from British rule. The exotic locale enhances the mystery and romance by adding an aura of danger to the westerners. The protagonist is an enigma who readers will not like; while the antagonist receives empathy though the choices that person made were criminal.

The book stands alone. If you did read Cleverly's first book, you'll like the second. You'll also notice some similarities.Sandilands is on his way out of India when the governor invites him to a holiday in the Indian hill town called Simla. On his way up to the hills, he meets a Russian opera singer, who is shot before Joe's eyes. Not so coincidently, someone else was murdered in the same manner and in the same spot one year before. Joe investigates the mystery in which nothing is what it appears to be.Cleverly's ability to capture the atmosphere of 1920's British India continues add a flavor to this book that you don't find in most mysteries. I spent some time in modern Shimla, so on a personal level, I enjoyed this book even more than the first."},{"Title":"Ragtime In Simla (Joe Sandilands Murder Mysteries)","review":"This is my first Joe Sandilands novel.The story starts out at a rapid pace, giving you a flavour of Simla during the British Raj. Towards the end however, the plot tugs at the bounds of credulity and it goes completely downhill.It is an entertaining story though, and well told one. Some of the dialogues are somewhat long-drawn, making it obvious that it's more for the benefit of the reader than something that two policemen would say to each other while discussing a murder.Although the story is set in Simla, all the major characters are British. Apart from some scenes set in the streets of Simla, there aren't very many colourful descriptions of India. The story may well be set in the Scottish Highlands or somewhere suitably adventurous.A few minor quibbles: Gandhi, when he is mentioned briefly, is spelled as \\"Ghandi\\" -- an irritatingly common misspelling by Western authors. Also, the father of one of the characters, Rheza Khan, who is a Pathan, is referred to as the \\"rajah\\". No Pathan chief would ever call himself a \\"rajah\\".Overall, it is a good read for a relaxing weekend."},{"Title":"Ragtime In Simla (Joe Sandilands Murder Mysteries)","review":"I found the plot of \\"Ragtime in Simla\\" to be fairly obvious very early in the book. In addition, the writing was not intellectually stimulating and the dialogue didn't strike me as being of either the period or the place.I had purchased this book because I had recently finished Laurie King's \\"The Game,\\" which takes place in the about same time period and vicinity. Since \\"The Game\\" was definitely 5 stars, I was anxious to prolong the atmosphere with another book of similar subject matter and location. Unhappily, \\"Ragtime in Simla\\" was the wrong choice and so disappointing that I won't bother with any of this author's other books."},{"Title":"Ragtime In Simla (Joe Sandilands Murder Mysteries)","review":"This was one of the best mysteries I've listened to in a long time--I had the audio version which was well read.

Not for those infected with modern day political correctness."},{"Title":"Ragtime In Simla (Joe Sandilands Murder Mysteries)","review":"\\"Ragtime in Simla\\" is the second Joe Sandilands historical-mystery by Barbara Cleverly, a series of books set in the 1920s and that take place in various settings within the Indian British Empire. Joe Sandilands is a likeable detective, though perhaps a little too good to be true, and Cleverly's mysteries are full of surprising twists, vivid characterizations and an attention to historical detail that provides many fascinating tidbits of information.It is 1922 and Joe Sandilands is traveling to Simla as the guest of the Governor of Bengal, his friend and superior, George Jardine. Simla itself is a British settlement in the Himalayan Hills that exists as a strange microcosm of England whilst infused with the culture and wildlife of the Indian people that surround it. On the train, Joe strikes up a friendship with a Russian opera singer called Feodor Korsovsky, and offers him a ride into Simla. However, when the two men stop to take in the view at Devil's Elbow, Korsovsky launches into song, only to be shot dead by a sniper right before Joe's eyes.On arrival at Jardine's house, it soon becomes apparent that the man has an ulterior motive for inviting him to stay in his guest house when Joe discovers that there has been a near-identical murder at Devil's Elbow a year ago. Allied with Superintendent Charlie Carter, the two men make a good team as they begin their investigation into the deaths. The trail leads straight to the captivating business-woman Alice Conyers, who is incidentally Cleverly's best character.\\"Ragtime in Simla\\" is a mystery that involves fraud, murder, blackmail, smuggling and betrayal - all that juicy stuff, set in brothels, antique stores, s&eacute;ances, theatres and the Indian wilderness. As always, there are rich descriptions of the time and place, creating a vivid setting for the mystery to unfold in. The story does drag on a bit toward the end, with a rather long, convoluted wrap-up, but \\"Ragtime in Simla\\" is a solid follow-up to its predecessor,The Last Kashmiri Rose (Joe Sandilands Murder Mystery).A word of warning through: the books in this series can be read more or less out of order, but \\"Ragtime in Simla\\" should certainly be read *before*Folly du Jour: A Joe Sandilands Mystery, considering that an enigmatic character that features here turns up again in the later installment. Their presence in \\"Folly du Jour\\" gives away any of their secrets in \\"Ragtime in Simla,\\" and so ruins many of the surprises presented here. I found this out the hard way, and as such, had much of this mystery figured out long before the reveal.Not my favourite in the series, but as always, an entertaining, fascinating read."},{"Title":"Ragtime In Simla (Joe Sandilands Murder Mysteries)","review":"If you want to read something purely for entertainment that doesn't require you to concentrate, this book may be all right. By the end, in fact long before the end, I became impatient with it. The start is very promising, lots of action immediately, then for about 100 pages not much interesting happens. The action continues to be really uneven and the plot is as far-fetched and improbable as anything I've read. There are a lot of twists and the characters are never who they seem to be, which helped hold my interest somewhat. I did not, however, get very interested in the main character (what is a Commander from Scotland Yard doing fooling around in the Indian hills anyway)? I also thought, that while the author did write good description in many places, I really didn't get the \\"feel\\" of India as I have from other books. To be fair, the author may have intended to show how the British tried to recreate England wherever they happened to be in the Empire, and ignored the surrounding environment. If so, this was done effectively. The title seemed like a mistake. Ragtime music was popular from about 1890 to 1910, by the 1920s it would have been passe, and it has nothing to do with this story at all. Did the author never hear of the 1920s being referred to as the JAZZ age? In fact, throughout the book, everybody is talking about and listening to jazz records, so the title is inappropriate. My rating on this book is just about neutral."},{"Title":"Ragtime In Simla (Joe Sandilands Murder Mysteries)","review":"This outstanding historical police procedural is as good a triumph of the genre as I've read in recent years. Barbara Cleverly is a masterful author and her exotic setting of Simla -- summer capital of the British Raj in the Roaring Twenties -- complements the solid development of a fascinating cast of characters. But, for me, the highlight of the book was the deviously creative plot, which twisted, turned and surprised me from page one till the end. Although there were one or two places where I had to suspend disbelief briefly, the book was a masterpiece. Cleverly is an outstanding author and this is only the second book in her Joe Sandilands series that I've read. I'm eagerly looking forward to the others."},{"Title":"Ragtime In Simla (Joe Sandilands Murder Mysteries)","review":"Once again a lovely Cleverly book, wonderful read( I love her Laetetia Talbot books too)! Though don't buy this for the mystery only, the mystery or plot is not always very strong. Its the whole effect of the book that works somehow and leaves you with a very nice feeling (you know the one you get after reading a good book) at the end."},{"Title":"Ragtime In Simla (Joe Sandilands Murder Mysteries)","review":"I had previously read Clevery's series with her heroine Laetitia Talbot, which I basically devoured, and was thrilled to find her other protagonist quite as addictive. I won't summarize the story, but it is set in India in 1922, which was a perfect setting, and Cleverly beautifull described it, giving me a sense of actually being part of the story. The mystery was clever, but not convoluted as many clever mysteries often are. Joe Sandilands is smart, charismatic, and charming, not at all the stiff war vet I was initially imagining he might be. I can certainly recommend this and others in the series for anyone looking for a mystery that is well written, researched, and plotted. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Ragtime In Simla (Joe Sandilands Murder Mysteries)","review":"\\"Ragtime in Simla\\" is the third Barbara Cleverly mystery I've read, and I enjoyed it the most of all. Lots of twists and turns, as you expect in a good mystery. Appealing characters, even the \\"bad guys.\\" A good picture of India in the 1920s, in the waning years of the British empire.

I found this novel much more appealing than the other and especially in the dialogue. Of course, it wasn't too hard to begin to put the villains in their places as time moved on. Still, I enjoyed the story as it was easy and rapid, something I look for in novels (for entertainment as I don't look for the \\"great literature of all times.\\" when reading.) I'll read more from this author. All in all I give this book a heads up for an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Ragtime In Simla (Joe Sandilands Murder Mysteries)","review":"Cleverly is always clever and always provides first rate entertainment.

I enjoyed every bit of it, and can't wait to read the other books in the series!"},{"Title":"Ragtime In Simla (Joe Sandilands Murder Mysteries)","review":"Barbara Cleverly writes books set in 1920's India and the golden days of the Raj. This is the second book that I've read from this series, and I am having hard time with them. The autenthic description of the days long gone are the best part of her books. The trouble starts when her wooden characters just aren't able to carry the story. She seems like a Regency novel writer trying to switch to a more lucrative genre. The plots are convoluted but contrived, and her twists leave a lot to be desired. Mystery just doesn't seem to be the natural field for this author."},{"Title":"And Now Let's Move into a Time of Nonsense: Why Worship Songs Are Failing the Church","review":"The book is very funny but embarassingly acurate. Many of my associates think that anything goes when it comes to worship, and I, too, acknowledge that there are times for unrestrained emotionalism.But the \\"meat and potatoes\\" of church music worship should be grounded in proper syntax and truth. Over the years, evangelicalism has been dumbed down to a level likely unrecognizable to generations past. Not that it has to be the reason to criticize bad poetry - but as a comparison.Nick Page rebels in a funny and articulate way that would make any level headed worshiper nod in agreement."},{"Title":"And Now Let's Move into a Time of Nonsense: Why Worship Songs Are Failing the Church","review":"Despite some UK-isms, this is very fine contribution to the question of quality worship music that is written and chosen to be sung by worship leaders. It is a very thoughtful critique, with an abundance of tongue-in-cheek humour sprinkled in. I feel there is a needed corrective to the abundance of thoughtless choruses that are produced today. Page advocates for the hard work and diligence that should accompany the writing, production and overall craft of worship. I think this book should be required reading for worship leaders and music pastors in order to keep a freshness to the question of what will best contribute to bring the congregation closer to God's presence while in keeping with good theology and an excellence in construction (melody, meter, etc..) I only give it a 4.5 instead of a 5 because of the slight diminishment of applicability beyond the UK - but this is slight and can easily be overlooked."},{"Title":"And Now Let's Move into a Time of Nonsense: Why Worship Songs Are Failing the Church","review":"The book is loads of fun to read and I enjoyed it a lot. It is, however, one man's opinion and should not be taken as the only way to view most modern worship music; although he does hit the nail on the head on many of the the opinions he expresses."},{"Title":"ABCs Naturally: A Child's Guide to the Alphabet Through Nature","review":"The photos in this book are great.

This is a recommended purchase for all those who enjoy reading with their children."},{"Title":"ABCs Naturally: A Child's Guide to the Alphabet Through Nature","review":"ABC's Naturally is so much more than just an alphabet book. It's an alphabet book, photography book and poetry book all in one! For each letter of the alphabet there is a beautiful colored photograph of something in nature that looks like that page's featured letter. On the opposite page there is also a little verse of poetry that relates to the photograph in some way. It is a book that just oozes with cleverness! Take the letter \\"L,\\" for example. Can you guess what plant might represent the letter \\"L\\"? Maybe the poem will help you out:If you brush against a spruce,It shares a spicy smell.Wet snow snuggles between its needles,Helping you see the letter L.Now you know it's a spruce tree! What about the M? Can you guess what that might be? Here's your poetic hint:Cattails grow in mucky marshes;Long leaves rise up from their stems.They look like bent and broken swordsAnd make a leafy letter M.For the nature-enthusiast, there is a section after the photography pages that gives facts and folklore about the items in the photographs. For example, did you know that some Native Americans used the cattail seeds to make diapers? That was new to me!ABC's Naturally is so much fun and inspiring! The final chapters called \\"Becoming an Alphabet Hunter\\" and \\"Collecting Your Own Alphabet\\" really helped our family to start seeing letters everywhere!"},{"Title":"ABCs Naturally: A Child's Guide to the Alphabet Through Nature","review":"My 3 year old son is obsessed with the ABCs. He's known the alphabet since he could barely speak, but now he enjoys finding the letters in everyday things. I think books like ABCs Naturally inspires him to do so! We went to the beach recently and he was constantly pointing out letters he found in trees, buildings, seashells, food, etc. Great book for any ABC lover!"},{"Title":"Moon: In Praise of the Silver Lamp of Night","review":"This is a wonderful little book for anyone interested in the moon in myth and art. Paula Rees collected proverbs, poems, and essay excerpts to celebrate the moon. Writers included: Robert Frost, Galileo, Walter De La Mare, Whitman, Poe, and Shelley. She also included a lunar calendar and a list of moon-gods from myth.The book is very small and short (83 pages) and is not intended as a thorough analysis of the moon's role in religion and literature. Anyone looking for detail should seek elsewhere. Rather, it's a tiny little book of ruminations, a compilation of what poets and visionairies and regular people have said about the moon over the years."},{"Title":"The philosophy of the enlightenment","review":"Ernst Cassirer was one of the more important philosophers of the 20th Century, although his work is less well-known in this country than on the Continent. Cassirer was also a Kant scholar who wrote an influential biography of Kant \\"Kant's Leben und Lehre\\" (Kant's Life and Teachings). This book, written in the mid-1930s, but not available in English until much later, is perhaps still the best serious survey of the Enlightenment, with more emphasis on the German Enlightenment than we are used to seeing. (The term 'enlightenment' itself comes from the German word \\"Aufklaerung\\"). Unlike many of the more recent writers on the Enlightenment, Cassirer is sympathetic to the Enlightenment enterprise and does not have an axe to grind (Peter Gay and Lester Crocker come to mind). Although well-written, and the subject is interesting to anyone concerned about the growth of the modern world, this is not an easy book: Cassirer presents a more nuanced view of the Enlightment and the philosophes than even most educated readers are used to and the reader must actively think about the arguments presented. The effort is absolutely worthwhile."},{"Title":"The philosophy of the enlightenment","review":"The historian Tim Blanning used the phrase \\"difficult but profound\\" to describe this book. Profound because of its insightful treatment of enlightment intellectual history, difficult because Cassirer employs a fairly technical and unfamiliar vocabulary and the often intricate analysis. This book, however, definitely repays careful reading. Cassirer believed in the Hegelian idea that the study of a period's philosophy allows definition of the distinguishing spirit of that period. Consequently, this is not a conventional chronological history but a thematic treatment of key areas. Cassirer treats the natural sciences, psychology and epistemology, treatment of religion, attitudes to history, what we would now call political theory and political science, and aesthetics. Each section is distinguished by Cassirer's remarkable erudition. In addition to analysis of major thinkers like Voltaire and Leibnitz, Cassirer discussion of now obscure thinkers to illuminate important issues. Another important feature is Cassirer's careful attention to the German enlightenment, particularly the intellectual tradition initiated by Leibnitz.Several key themes run throughout all sections. One is the importance of reason which Cassirer treats usefully as the use of analysis. Very much inspired by the success of Newtonian physics, analysis is an empirically oriented investigation of natural, psychological,and social worlds, the description of the dynamic processes, and the search for mechanisms. As Cassirer remarks, \\"the power of reason does not consist in in enabling us to transcend the empirical world but rather in teaching us to feel at home in it\\". The emphasis on reason/analysis is accompanied by a heightened sense of human capacities and the possibility of real human progress. Cassirer distinguishes these features from both traditional religious dogma and the deductive rationalistic systems characteristic of 17th century philosophy. The ironic limitations of this approach are discussed well. Enlightenment psychology, for example, leads to Humean epistemology with its limitation of certainty. Cassirer is also very good on how the Enlightenment tradition will lead to new developments that would generate the Romantic movement, particulary the Liebnitzian tradition in Germany. Cassirer's ability to situate the Enlightment in historic context is just outstanding. He shows, for example, the links between Renaissance humanism and the Enlightenment are discussed concisely but insightfully.This wonderful book also has a somewhat sad tinge. Published originally in Germany in 1932, it was written in the late 1920s and early 1930s, when these kind of ideals were under vigorous attack in Germany. Cassirer's sympathetic but objective treatment constitutes a powerful defense of enlightenment values. Within a few years of the publication of this book, Cassirer, the first Jew to be rector of a German university and one of the towering figures of German intellectual life, had to go into exile."},{"Title":"The philosophy of the enlightenment","review":"Ernst Cassirer's \\"The Philosophy of the Enlightenment\\" is an excellent historical overview of this period of intellectual history. He highlights the major themes that unite this diverse group of thinkers. I previously read and enjoyed Peter Gay's two-volume history of the Enlightenment, but I wish I had read Cassirer's book before Gay's. I would definitely have appreciated Gay's work more. I highly recommend Cassirer's work."},{"Title":"The philosophy of the enlightenment","review":"The previous reviews do not warn the potential reader that this is an \\"insider's\\" book. It may be suitable for those well-versed in philosophy but is a waste of time and money for anyone outside of the field of philosophy. It never gets around to offering a cogent review of the nature of enlightenment philosophy. I was disappointed because I had read that the leading figures in the American Revolution were well-versed in this subject."},{"Title":"The philosophy of the enlightenment","review":"Yes! Amazing how the eighteenth century is still here today, in our many institutions and political ideals. Cassirer's heady analysis of the culture, debates and ideals of the time informs our current cultural mosaic, where rap lives side by side with the Lincoln Center. I especially return to his synopsis of the debate about faith in the XVIIIth c., that centers on Voltaire's attack against Pascal. When the thoughts of moral titans collide, the sparks endure."},{"Title":"Moscow Madness: Crime, Corruption, and One Man's Pursuit of Profit in the New Russia","review":"This is one of, if not the most, entertaining business stories I have ever read. I have several friends from former Soviet Republics, including Russia, and the only thing they would find surprising about my reaction to this book, would be that I was surprised.The former Soviet Union and now several of the Former Republics always have fascinated me. As I have come to know some of its citizens I am less fascinated, but I am more interested, less perplexed, and find the future of these Countries great \\"what if\\" scenarios. A better-posited question might be when? Western Capitalists have found the hard way that just because the new name is \\"The Former Soviet Union\\" that does not mean 3 generations of dysfunctional Soviet practices disappear. The idea that generations that have grown up under Central Planning, artificial markets, and the rest of the elements that create a fictional economy are going to adopt and practice Capitalism instantly is absurd...former barriers fall, but they do not disappear, as many western investors were to learn, they were just replaced with new obstacles.I have nothing but respect for Mr. Rick Grajirena. To even attempt what he did is beyond the level of risk that 99% of American Businesses have taken or will ever take. His business did not just have the exposure of failing, he put himself at personal risk, and that is not something a Silicon Valley start up faces. In Silicon Valley a roof keeps out the weather, in the case of this businessman it keeps you alive. For in the Moscow he chose to do business with, a roof has nothing to do with a building.I think Mr. Grajirena is one of the world's great optimists, and a man who defines perseverance. Unfortunately these attributes are not what business is about in Russia or many of The Former Republics...The natural and human resources that are part of the former USSR are literally amazing. The wealth that could be created across the 14 time zones would be unprecedented... There are the predators and the prey. This is worse as these are not Countries without Governments; rather the Governments are the largest Predators of all.Breaking something is easy, but if you consider it took the better part of the 20th Century to damage these Countries, what is the most optimistic time period for them to be reassembled?"},{"Title":"Moscow Madness: Crime, Corruption, and One Man's Pursuit of Profit in the New Russia","review":"Would you buy a book entitled &quot;How I was trying to sell beer in a country X and blew it&quot;? Probably not. What about &quot;How I traveled with pirates, battled dragons, saved princess, selling beer overseas&quot;? In fact &quot;Moscow Madness&quot; promises on its cover jacket an adventurous tale in the latter style, while delivering for the most part a fairly mundane business story.Embellishment of one's foreign adventures goes back to times earlier than Marco Polo or even Homer. But what is remarkable about this book is that it is actually more honest, plausible, and conventional that juicy tag lines and excerpts on its cover. It is a story of some business successes and mishaps, cultural discoveries and misunderstandings, under the titillating wrap of crime, corruption and debauchery. Many of such stories could happen elsewhere, almost all of them - in any country during big transformation.What about the omnipresent &quot;mafiya&quot; and &quot;roofs&quot;? Contrary to widespread perception and come-ons of the book cover, one can find that Mr. Grajirena (the book protagonist) and his company weren't threatened by &quot;mafiya&quot;. A couple of times they considered doing business - on their own initiative - with shady-looking characters, and eventually declined. Most of the talk about &quot;mafiya&quot; in the book is a collection of keg party gossips and third-hand accounts. This doesn't mean that &quot;mafiya&quot; and corruption didn't exist - there were (and still are) plenty of them; it just wasn't completely unavoidable.It is a common knowledge that many western businessmen trying to do business in Moscow during 90's were in constant danger for their lives, right? Actually, statistics tells a different story. The only relatively high-profile American businessman killed in Moscow in a whole decade was Paul Tatum - co-owner of a luxury hotel complex. Tatum adopted &quot;mafiosi&quot; style more enthusiastically than any &quot;New Russians&quot;, surrounding himself with thuggish bodyguards and miniskirted bimbos, and swam in chaos and corruption like fish in the water. Even many of his fellow American expats said they saw it coming.A few years ago I witnessed (in US) an attempt to make a payment in a Russian-American business deal with a suitcase of dollars (the only time I've seen a suitcase full of cash in my life). No, it wasn't a stereotypical group of heavyset Russian &quot;biznismeny&quot; flashing piles of cash to the consternation of their American partners. Americans were the ones who brought the suitcase. The deal was in fact was totally legitimate, and neither side had any connections with organized crime How did they come up with this idea? Probably read too many stories about business in Russia, which supposedly operated only on bags of green banknotes.The book details the story of Rick Grajirena, a renowned yachtsman, who previously ran a modestly successful business related to his sailing hobby. Nothing in his resume, however, suggested he should excel in selling beer in Moscow. In starting a business in a foreign country it would be helpful to have a thorough knowledge of either a country or a business itself. Grajirena didn't know much about either Russia or beer wholesaling. This is not an absolute prerequisite, but neither did he show enough concentration, jumping for a while from one project to another. Miller beer distribution came up only by chance, after dabbling in some other semi-serious ventures without particular focus or expertise. Why did he feel entitled to success?Probably it had to do with the general atmosphere of the times. Many westerners in early 90's were attracted by a combination of the \\"new frontier\\" thrill, sense of self-important mission of \\"converting heathens\\", and expectation of easy buck along the line \\"these Russians are so clueless about business and capitalism, anybody barely able to operate a hot-dog stand should be raking in money&quot;. If this was ever true at all, it was quickly becoming less so as market reforms took hold.In 1990 one could ride in a taxi around Moscow for half a day for just a pack of &quot;Marlboro&quot;. It would be stupid to assume this will persist forever - and such attitude seems to be one of the causes of the First Republic eventual failure. In early 90's selling something with American brand name was easy. But the market rapidly matured. Hundreds of new consumer goods were appearing each month. The previous assumption that any western-made product will be snapped up instantly was no longer true. Prices, rents and salaries rapidly increased in dollar terms. In the beer market competition become very tough, with many foreign and new domestic entries available. Some problems they encountered were related to Miller Brewery itself. Once a large shipment of beer froze because Miller neglected to put it in insulated packaging.As the company, after many successful months, encountered difficulties (stemming, as evident in the book, primarily from increased competition, and only to some extent due to red tape, chaotic regulations or corruption) they invited American consultants to make recommendations for improvements. Author then pours scorn on these consultants - they seemed to lack credentials they claimed. Ironically, some of their advices seem quite reasonable. Basically their suggestion was for Mr. Grajirena to behave less like an arrogant colonialist expecting almost to be carried on stretchers by obedient servants.There is a story at the end of the book about young American lawyers - a \\"golden couple\\" with \\"bright future\\". The girl came to work in Moscow, was excited by its wild atmosphere and went into clubbing, drugs and promiscuity, left her husband, became addicted and even reportedly attempted a suicide. A stern warning - don't even dare to think that \\"bright future\\" can be anything other than working 80-hours week on some mind-numbing legalese and returning at night to a trophy home in a prestigious suburb. For many such wisdom will suffice, some others will still find more places around the world for adventure and \\"madness\\"."},{"Title":"Moscow Madness: Crime, Corruption, and One Man's Pursuit of Profit in the New Russia","review":"Moscow Madness takes you through Russian customs and then provides a forensic-like look into the business customs, chaos and cultural impediments facing American entrepreneurs seeking to be business pioneers in the new Russia. Tim Harper presents a compelling and original hybrid style of writing that is part novelist and part foreign correspondent. Moscow Madness gives new meaning to &quot;red tape.\\" The story is told chiefly through the entrepreneurial and cultural adventures of Rich Grajirena. Although Rich Grajirena never earns more than 100,000 in a year, despite years of complicated, creative, trans-Russian endeavors, his Moscow setting machinations provide the reader with a multi-million dollar look into the new Russia. What makes the book particularly appealing and easy to relate to is that the story concerns the frustrations of an individual seeking to traverse Russia's business terrain and not a difficult to relate to conglomerate. Moscow Madness offers microscopic-like clarity as to how difficult it is to start up a successful business, let alone one that requires the successful merging of two distinct countries, cultures and colorful characters. While most present day writer/attorneys are fixated on court room drama, Harper utilizes his foreign correspondent and legal background by painting on a much larger geographical and sociological canvas. Harper convinced me that while Russia may no longer be the evil empire Moscow Madness is real."},{"Title":"Moscow Madness: Crime, Corruption, and One Man's Pursuit of Profit in the New Russia","review":"Mr. Harper's narration of Mr. Grajirena's attempt to successfully establish a Western style distribution network in Moscow is a pleasure to read. Many of us who have tried to do business in Russia can relate to Mr. Grajirena's experiences. The book does relate one man's experiences, but in doing so it provides us all with a picture of what it is like to explore opportunities on the new frontier. The book is well written and informative. I have read many books about Russia and Russian business and this was as informative as any and the most enjoyable to read. Anyone interested in working with Russia will benefit greatly from reading this book and anyone merely interested in contemporary life and business in Russia will enjoy reading this real-life account."},{"Title":"Moscow Madness: Crime, Corruption, and One Man's Pursuit of Profit in the New Russia","review":"I've been &quot;on the ground&quot; in Moscow since 1993 and can relate to Tim's wonderful description of Moscow Madness.

The book, in my opinion, reads like an extended Harvard Business Case - concise, factual, and very informative. Besides learning the useful tips on living in Russia, dealing with Russians, you will get an insight into our Soviet culture. I think that the author did a really great job at understanding us, the former Soviets. What we now need to do is translate it into Russian and have it sold in Moscow - Moscovites will love it. :) Any other books coming out soon, Mr. Harper??"},{"Title":"Moscow Madness: Crime, Corruption, and One Man's Pursuit of Profit in the New Russia","review":"I really wanted to like this book, and stayed up late to finish it off. But it's hard to take a book completely seriously when it puts Sakhalin Island on the Atlantic Coast ( page 206 ).The book has many lessons for the investor. The first being, don't leave your circle of competence. Here was someone who had a lot of expertise in the sailmaking world, from a U.S. business perspective, but no expertise it appeared in Beer distribution or in actually basing business overseas.The second big lesson for the investor is - don't put your money into something until you see something concrete. Mr Grajirena seems to have made much of his money drawing a salary from schemes that have no sales! Much of his time appeared to be spent travelling to Russia on a vague hope of some outcome ( the set-up of EuroHealth ).It is interesting to note where Miller Beer is now with regards Russia. Miller Brewing has been sold to South African Breweries ( how many people know that Miller Genuine Draft is now NOT American owned ? ), and Miller Beer sold in Russia is now made in Russia. SAB has bought up old East European breweries, and refurbished them. SAB is now the world second largest brewer. Someone made money in Moscow.What comes through in the book is the level of arrogance of many Americans doing business overseas. An example of this in the book is when specifications are delivered in inches not metric. The American answer to the Russian complaint is that the Russians built a space programme copying, so why can't they change these measurements this time ?But the book does have the imagination running with &quot; what if &quot; possibilities when the Miller brand becomes established in Moscow. What if they had operated within their working capital and kept to a more reasonable business plan ? What if they had kept their expenses to a minimum from the outset ? What if they had properly organised their finances and had enough equity raised ?By all means read this book for insight into Russian business. But consider also the largely unconscious window it gives us into how Americans see the world ( as a subsidiary of USA Inc )."},{"Title":"Moscow Madness: Crime, Corruption, and One Man's Pursuit of Profit in the New Russia","review":"Journalist Timothy Harper has written an absorbing, detailed business saga. This intimate account chronicles the wild and frustrating adventures of U.S. businessman Rick Grajirena, an import-export entrepreneur in Russia's new free-market economy. \\"It was not difficult for Grajirena to find prospective partners and possible deals. Indeed, when it became known that he was an American looking to buy and sell in Russia, all sorts of characters - some seemingly reputable, many obviously not - came forward with one scheme after another.\\" In the midst of this colorful cast of characters, Grajirena shines as one of the \\"good guys\\" as he jumps into and out of the beer biz and ends up in health foods.

And I appreciated the author's followup on the alleged &quot;mysterious&quot; disappearance of the American restaurantur whose departure wasn't so mysterious afterall. Mr. Grajirena's &quot;can-do&quot; attitude when the warehouse walls collapsed was impressive. What else would an American have done.

Oh, the memories this book brings back. All of them only too true. I used to write my family and friends about &quot;what you don't hear on McNeil-Lehrer&quot;. Tim Harper's comment in his review section about the vodka-pouring driver and his car mirrored my own experience with my driver. Only he used a bottle of Turkmenistan cognac given to me as a gift while I was in Ashkhabad. However, the book also details quite well the dangers of doing business in Russia. I lost my first office to the mafia, was shot at during the '93 coup, and later put up with business offers of protection for a price.

Pakritov and Taking a Rest's (TAR) reviews are clear examples of the real issue businessman Grajirena faced: newspapers can never paint the clear picture of cultural differences between two countries. Pakritov defensively believes Grajirena went in with expectations of colonialism and ties such ventures with some kind of evil. TAR believes Grajirena went to simply make a profit and ties such a venture with some kind of benefit. Two distinctively different views that resound just as clearly in the book.My take is that Grajirena is a decent American by any standard. He wants to get rich just like any other American and has this idea that there is money to be made abroad. Newpapers and his contacts suggest the new Soviet Union is crying for market variety. He's not trying to exploit anyone so much as take advantage of what appears to be a clear opportunity to offer more than what a given populace has been offered in the past. e.g. They have two brands of beer circulating, he wants to add a third and make a decent living doing so. Little does he know how many cultural landmines he will step on as he tries to navigate a culture that is so removed from American models of capitalism as to be another planet. It's not just a case of 'the rules don't apply' so much as 'make it up as you go and try not to get thrown in jail in the process'.Was Grajirena naive? Absolutely. Could anyone else have done better with his resources? Doubtful. I'd really appreciate hearing other small business owners who actually tried to do so rather than the cowardly, pissy, 20-20 hindsight bashing from some of these reviewers, but armchair quarterbacks are a dime a dozen. Grajirena definitely gets points for bravery and blazing a trail countless unappreciative others could learn from, but what have we learned? Isn't most of the US's foriegn policy based on the same kind of naivete' that Grajirena brought to his first venture? When we suggest we can convert the middle east or Afghanistan to productive Democratic societies how many potential business upstarts imagine they'll be speaking the same kind of capitalism as the locals? How many large corporations have been told as much by 'expert' consultants? How many relived Grajirena's experience in India and China?The world is a small place, or so the news tells us. For Grajirena the difference in worlds couldn't be further apart."},{"Title":"Moscow Madness: Crime, Corruption, and One Man's Pursuit of Profit in the New Russia","review":"The book is ok but suffers from the fact that it is an 'as told to' book - one guy lived the story, another wrote about it.

The amount of information required of students, teachers, ministers, and professors grows with every passing day, and the amount available grows even faster. The Essentials Guides provide brief overviews with a good amount of depth and in easy-to-follow language and formats. Other Essential Guides I have read include Ron Allen's 'Preaching: An Essential Guide' and Justo Gonzalez' 'Church History: An Essential Guide'.As Neusner states in his introductory chapter, many (Christians and other non-Jews) see Judaism as the religion of the Old Testament, and often forget that there is a significant tradition of literature that follows from this. In the foundational period of the first several centuries C.E. (up to the sixth century, according to Neusner), writings include the development of the Mishnah (the first of Rabbinic literature to reach a point of closure, according to Neusner), the Tosefta, the Palestinian Talmud, the Babylonian Talmud, and other writings of importance for theology, biblical exegesis, legal commentaries and wisdom.Neusner is writing this book primarily with a Christian audience in mind (or a student/readership audience that is primarily Christianity-centric in culture, even if not practicing Christian). He states there are three primary reasons why this audience might be interested in Rabbinic literature - first, it gives insight in the religious practices that date back to the time of Jesus and the New Testament figures; second, it helps to explain why the Jews remained 'the Jews' apart from the stream of Christian history; and third, it provides a means of comparison and contrast with a similar and related but not identical body of work. Neusner shows how the comparison and contrast can work with regard to parables, which show up both in Christian gospels and Rabbinic literature.Neusner's substantive chapters begin with a discussion of the Oral Torah, including the tractate Abot and the later expansion of Rabbi Nathan. The two longest chapters are on the Rabbinic Canon for Halakhah (Law) and for Theology (Aggadah), the second perhaps more appropriately called 'lore' or 'narrative'. The Halakhic part is organised around the Misnah, and the Aggadic is organised around scriptural writings. With regard to the later, there are seven primary texts that centre upon particular texts (Genesis, Ruth, Esther, etc.). Neusner gives overview descriptions of the composition and purpose of the texts, as well as outlines in most cases.Neusner's final two chapters are 'practical' in a sense; they each relate the corpus of Rabbinic literature to the more modern setting of present-day Judaism and Christianity. Neusner explores both Halakhic and Aggadic aspects of these relationships. The these two aspects serve to both set out the problem and present a solution.Neusner is a very prolific writer in the field of Judaic studies and topics; I have used his books, both as a student and as an instructor, many times in my classes. He has both clarity and precision in his writing, and knows how to balance the demands for detail with the need for breadth on such a subject in a limited space such as the Essential Guides provide.There is no index in the book, which is a drawback for those who might want to use this book as a reference tool. However, the book is well-written and concise, so making notes for one's own use in the back pages would not be a bad idea.This is a book designed largely for the busy person in mind -- the reading is simple without being simplistic; there are not too many names and terms to wade through, and the whole of the book could be read in but a few hours, making the subject of Rabbinic literature readily accessible to even the busiest of lay persons, and a refresher handily available for the busiest of clergy."},{"Title":"Rabbinic Literature: an Essential Guide","review":"Rabbinic literature is a complex and interwoven body of texts whose importance is extensive: it is, of course, central to studying Judaism; its texts are valuable for broad religious study and are crucial for understanding the background of early Christianity; and the history of biblical interpretation inevitably involves this quite immense and varied set of writings. There is no scholar more highly regarded as an authority on Rabbinic literature and Judaism than this author. And there is no educator better suited to explaining it in clear and concise terms, laying out the list of texts, their background and development, their content, the resources with which to delve more deeply into their meaning, and their importance for Judaism, biblical studies, and Christianity. This essential guide discusses all the texts in Rabbinic literature, including the Mishnah, Tosefta, Talmuds, and Midrash. With this guide, students will better understand the complex and unique world of Judaism and its significance for studying the Bible, Judaism, and Christian origins."},{"Title":"Learning the Basics of New Testament Greek (Greek Language Study Series) (English and Ancient Greek Edition)","review":"Hadjiantoniou's text \\"Learning the Basics of New Testament Greek\\" (revised edition 1998) does indeed suffer from many of the flaws--if that is what they are--enumerated in some of the other evaluations. These problems are especially daunting if (a) you have only tried learning other languages in an audio-visual environment or with lots of color pictures and a wide range in the types of exercises/activities offered, and (b) if your knowledge of English grammar--or grammar in general, really--is faulty. It is true that the text assumes the student has a solid command of English grammar, and without this, the text can easily appear opaque. It is somewhat ironic that the author notes in his preface (p. 1) that, \\"...it can no longer be taken for granted that the student who takes up the study of the New Testament Greek grammar knows his English grammar.\\" That is putting it mildly, and Dr. Hadjiantoniou does not at first appear to act on his own observation. Unlike Stevens' \\"New Testament Greek Primer\\", there is no appendix with lengthy explanations of English grammar which can be tackled before jumping into the Greek. This is a sink-or-swim text, but for those who know how to swim, it can be very effective.Perhaps those familiar with the old grammar-translation method used in earlier Latin texts will feel more comfortable with \\"Learning the Basics...\\". It may be true that much clarity is lost in the use of highly linguistic vocabulary, but the vocabulary exists for a reason, and if the student familiarizes himself with the terms, there is nothing particularly unpleasant about it. The would-be student should bear in mind that NT Greek is not easy in the sense that Spanish or French might be easy. A highly inflected language with a complicated verbal system requires work, and a fair amount of it. My experience is that if the student already knows Latin (or even a modern highly-inflected language like Russian), many of the difficulties vanish or are significantly reduced. But to a generation largely ignorant of its own grammar, this text can be frustrating. Not having a key to the exercises makes this worse, especially if you are trying to teach yourself.Having said all that, I have found the text to work very well for me. I have a background in several other foreign languages, and Hadjiantoniou's method is direct and clear. You need to read through the grammar sections several times (it is true that there are few clarifying examples until you actually jump into the exercises), but the vocabulary is good (largely based on NT word frequency) and the exercises give you a lot of practice translating from Greek to English, then the more difficult English to Greek. I have found that taking the sentences I translated into English, then back-translating into Greek (so that I could check my answers with the text) was very useful. The sentences to translate, though odd from a modern point of view (e.g., \\"The slaves took the small gifts to the temple\\") are perfectly oriented towards Koine Greek and the New Testament which, after all, is the primary reason for learning NT Greek.Finally, while Hadjiantoniou offers both Erasmian and the more Modern pronunciation options, I highly recommend the Erasmian. While probably less accurate than the actual koine pronunciation (and likely closer to Attic Greek), it is definitely easier to learn the correct spelling of NT Greek words using this system. The modern pronunciation, for all its advantages (and they are many), has reduced many vowels and diphthongs to monophthongs and thus gives multiple spellings for the same pronunciation.This text, then, is very good if you have a background in linguistics (and a sound knowledge of Latin goes a long way) and can handle the pedagogical demands of the author. If you do not find yourself in that position, another choice would be in order, especially if you are teaching yourself (as I did). Still, I think this book would also be effective with a good teacher."},{"Title":"Learning the Basics of New Testament Greek (Greek Language Study Series) (English and Ancient Greek Edition)","review":"I switched to this book from Ray Summer's book &quot;Essentials of New Testament Greek,&quot; and I'm glad I did."},{"Title":"Learning the Basics of New Testament Greek (Greek Language Study Series) (English and Ancient Greek Edition)","review":"I switched to this book from Ray Summers &quot;Essentials of New Testament Greek&quot; and I'm glad I did."},{"Title":"Cycle of the Assassin","review":"Reincarnation has brought the cycle full circle, bringing forth Cassandra Walker once again. She doesn't know why the panic attacks come, or why she has been driven unconsciously to flee Chicago, San Francisco, Baltimore. Each time, the panic attacks had driven her. During the attacks she knows she's being followed; that some malevolent force wishes her death. Fear of being traced leads to dead-end temp jobs and a lonely existence. Cassandra doesn't even know her own capabilities until a phenomenal act of self-preservation brings her gifts to the surface. She has always possessed amazing abilities with weapons and while memory does not reincarnate, ability does.Homicide detective Martin Harris was off duty when a call about a possible hostage situation comes over the radio. Since he was only five blocks away, Martin shows up at the scene. The cashier tells Harris that the lady in aisle three took both would-be thieves down. Harris believes the clerk's explanation is the confused meandering of a victim of severe trauma until he views the video tape. The woman moves so quickly that she's merely a blur on the tape. Impossible.When Cassandra returns to her apartment, a mysterious message warns her to run. Refusing to leave that night, Cassandra risks her life when a gremlin breaks into her apartment intent on killing her. Calling her names such as Demondancer, and the assassin, the gremlin nearly succeeds in taking her life until a surprise rescuer by the name of Merlin suddenly appears. He persuades Cassandra to leave with him, and they kill another gremlin in their escape. The police are not happy with the dead bodies left behind.Centuries of dealing with Cassandra's reactions to learning of her reincarnations make Merlin most adept in his methods of persuasion regarding her reincarnation. He's lived centuries, and has learned that what he says during her early stages of disbelief and rejection sound to Cassandra like the stumbling ranting of a mad man. His words are like a well-rehearsed script that coaxes a level of acceptance that, if not complete, is enough so that Cassandra does not flee his company.Merlin tells of a magical barrier that prevents the evil Lucefyhar from leaving his dimension and entering our own. The gremlins are his minion, followers who take over humans while in his service. Lucefyhar thrives on chaos and war, in some cases directly instigating them. Magicians constructed the magical barrier that prevents Lucefyhar from returning to this dimension. The spell has a single drawback. It requires that at least one member of the original coven remain among the living. Cassandra, the latest incarnation of Cassandra the assassin, must keep Merlin alive to prevent this dimension's destruction. She also must hunt down the black magician that aids Lucefyhar from this dimension.CYCLE OF THE ASSASSIN is the stalemate that continues until Lucefyhar manages to break through the barrier, or is finally defeated. Carried through centuries, incarnations had seemed just like every other cycle. They didn't change all that much from generation to generation until this one. Now Cassandra must dance the demon dance and bridge the gap if her world is to survive.The classic battle between good and evil, CYCLE OF THE ASSASSIN brings fresh nuances and entanglements that will engage readers of many genres, including fantasy and suspense. Indeed, this is a richly powerful book, with a full-bodied tale of evil poised for destruction, and the only woman who can prevent it. CYCLE OF THE ASSASSIN is fresh, as well, lacking the traditional love interest, and giving her strength and power seldom seen among heroines. Talented, intelligent, physically gifted, Cassandra is powerful and unique, yet vulnerable enough to be believable.Note: Unfortunately, the poor editing on this book, while not necessarily the fault of the author, does make for periodically confusing reading. I have the text version of the story, and there are sudden breaks in the middle of words, sentences and paragraphs that mislead the reader. Further, missing punctuation and lack of space between the changing scenes, to indicate the scene shift, also challenge the reader. Nevertheless, this is an excellent novel, and well worth the bit of periodic confusion. Indeed, I refuse to penalize the author in my rating based on something that may feasibly beyond the author's control. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"New psychic frontiers: Your key to new worlds","review":"Published in 1975, this classic treatise, written by Walter and Mary Jo Uphoff, is an outstanding introduction to 20th century psychic research. The book has an excellent bibliography and is extensively documented, so interested readers will find a wealth of reference materials for further investigation. The book flows easily, effortlessly transporting the reader through the various topics discussed. Beginning with a request to remain open-minded and reasonable, yet skeptical, the authors explore the full range of psychic phenomena (See topic list below for details). They further consider implications for religion and science and discuss how to conduct and teach psychic research. Many wonderful photographs and illustrations are included. Although Professor Uphoff was best known academically for his work in labor studies, he and his wife truly enjoyed researching and writing about psychic phenomena, as is readily discernible from this work. Interested readers should include this fine addition to their psychic studies library.Book's topics include: telepathy, clairaudience, clairvoyance, psychometry, mediumship, guides, trance, cross-correspondence, direct voice, precognition, chair tests, apparitions, ghosts, hauntings, poltergeists, psychkinesis, materializations, psychic photography, skotography, recorded voices, apports, astral projection, out-of-body experiences, reincarnation, possession, psychic and spiritual healing, automatic writing and artwork, and \\"far out\\" (as the authors label it) areas such as astrology, dowsing, the heironymus machine, radiesthesia and radionics, UFOs, witchcraft, and paranormal music."},{"Title":"It Was the Nightingale (The Pocket Classics Series)","review":"At the very point in which Philip Maddison appears to have found a true love in his life, tragedy intercepts it.

Expecting something either too dry or sensational, I wound up falling in love with Corwin's vivid, immersive writing style. It was a really pleasant surprise. He knows how to draw the reader into the world of homicide investigation, conveying the tedium of investigation without losing the excitement of the pursuit. He peels back layers of compelling detail on cases that were well-published by the press, revealing a flawed yet fascinating process of tracking down our most dangerous criminals. I felt like I was right there with him and the RH detectives he follows for the year. I couldn't get enough. And the way he portrays the detectives of RH who work tirelessly on these high-profile cases was truly endearing. (Maybe his portrayal was too sympathetic. Who knows?)I had a few maddening moments reading about the case for Robert Blake's wife with the perspective we have now. With little effort -- the case spoke for itself -- Corwin conveyed a powerful message about the influence of the media on our collective prejudices, as well as how helpless investigators can be when dealing with uncooperative witnesses. The book finished on this case, leaving me with not just a profound understanding of the homicide investigation process, but how our city has handicapped some of its most valuable law enforcement personnel.I wish Corwin would return to RHS and do this again.

I hated for it to end. A reader gets an honest feel for the rhythm of detective work, and realizes how months of work can be undone by a careless mistake (even one made decades ago in a long dormant case) or by a clerk who inadvertently destroys old evidence.The author is scrupulously fair to the police and gives a realistic snapshot of contemporary Los Angeles with its international mix of cultures. Several of these bizarre cases prove the old saw that truth IS stranger than fiction. Corwin is one of the best at putting you at the scene without calling attention to himself. I'd recommend this to anyone interested in police work -- or good journalism."},{"Title":"Homicide Special: On the Streets with the LAPD's Elite Detective Unit","review":"Would you like to be a \\"fly on the wall\\" inside a homicide investigation?This is an incredibly intriguing book that allows the reader to become familiar with all aspects of the LAPD Homicide Special division and the \\"ins and outs\\" of homicide investigation. It chronicles several real homicide investigations from start to finish, allowing the reader to identify with the investigators and the victims. (Some are even famous) The history of the LAPD, occasionally shady but never boring, is also narrated. Throughout the book the reader learns about everything from crime scene investigations to interrogation methods. This book is excellent.

Mr. Corwin is an observer of great sensitivity and transports the reader to crime scenes, interview rooms and crime labs. Tough, authentic, absorbing."},{"Title":"Homicide Special: On the Streets with the LAPD's Elite Detective Unit","review":"I live in the Los Angeles area and enjoy the mysteries of Michael Connolly, Robert Crais, and Paul Bishop, all set in or around the LAPD. This was a fascinating counterpoint to these mysteries, filling in details in some places and starkly illuminating reality like a Maglite at midnight.The book follows about half of the complement of Homicide Special, one of three units comprising LAPD's Robbery Homicide division. (Rape and Robbery are the other two parts.) I found it a fascinating look inside some otherwise pretty closed doors. RHD is the ultimate promotion for some LAPD detective-3s, who would otherwise have to become supervising homicide detectives in one of LAPD's stations. It's considered an elite unit, and the fiction writers sometimes make the tension between RHD and some of the outlying homicide units a plot element. That aspect wasn't really addressed in this book, but one hardly notices against the compelling twists of the stories.But even an elite unit has to put up with delays and shortages in the LAPD...schizophrenic heating and cooling in Parker Center (LAPD HQ)...delays and occasional inconsistent results from the Scientific Investigation Division, of O.J. trial notoriety...and uncooperative or missing witnesses.One element of the book not touched on so far in the reviews are the pictures of the homicide detectives. Only one is smiling, and he retired at the end of the book. This is serious business, treated seriously.Another part of the story, woven among the six murders covered in depth, is how the LAPD came to be the way it is - from early corruption, through the paramilitary but relatively clean 1950s, to the politically harassed department of the 1990s. This fills in the backdrop of the disparate backgrounds of the homicide detectives.Of the six murders, one resulted in a conviction, another in a guilty plea, and two were starting or in trial. Two remain unsolved, although one was a cold case nearly forty years old. (This is covered in an epilogue to the paperback edition, and I'm not sure if it is in any of the hardback printings.)What is there to criticise about this book? Not very much. I think readers outside Southern California might have benefited from a map. The biggest loss, though, is that the book is only 385 pages long (in paperback). I wanted more, more, more. Of course, rape, robbery, and homicide are the wine, women, and song of mystery fans, and this book is a banquet in those terms.I have the feeling that this is the way it really is. Highly recommended. Just plan on reading it on a weekend...it's hard to put down, and you *will* be up past your bedtime.OCTOBER 2004 UPDATE: One of the six cases was the murder of Robert Blake's wife Bonnie, for which Blake is currently standing trial. The defense lawyer has asked that the charge be dismissed because the presence of this book's author during a search violated Mr. Blake's constitutional rights. I can't see it, myself, but this book has suddenly been put in the limelight here in Southern California as a result. I recommend it even more now."},{"Title":"Homicide Special: On the Streets with the LAPD's Elite Detective Unit","review":"I will always find Los Angeles fascinating, and anything written about it is bound to be enjoyable to me. However, I had a very, very hard time putting this book down--not for its descriptions of Los Angeles and little vignettes of history as much as its ability to draw and keep you in its storyline. The events are all real--only a few names were changed to protect those most likely less than innocent. The backgrounds of the detectives are as fascinating as the suspects they chase.The book's greatest strength is how it lays out many of the unpleasant truths encountered in the course of the story. The thoughts and actions of the detectives are laid out plainly for examination, even though some of the things revealed are quite damaging when taken on their own. It very plainly attacks LAPD brass, the cult of celebrity, and many persistent turf wars the LAPD is only now reaching a level of truce on.If you're a fan of detective shows or gritty LA drama--put aside a few hours of your life before you finish a whole chapter of this book!"},{"Title":"Homicide Special: On the Streets with the LAPD's Elite Detective Unit","review":"Even if you aren't a fan of the police procedural novel, in which every detail of police work is explained, this true-life piece of reporting may prove engrossing because it reveals what really goes on in murder investigations. The author gets into what makes good detectives good and also what makes them different from one another. Although the members of the special homicide unit may dress pretty much alike on the job, they are widely divergent in their personal tastes and backgrounds. It's easy to consider the LA police force as an homogeneous group, but this book reminds us that no two people are alike. And it gives a good picture of the elements that make up a successful investigation."},{"Title":"Homicide Special: On the Streets with the LAPD's Elite Detective Unit","review":"Easily one of the top true crime books I have ever read.

The detectives' sense of humor and dark view of the underbelly of society is genuine and genuinely funny. Even the best fiction does not grab my attention like Corwin did.

He spent a year with the LAPD's elite detective unit, Homicide Special. They investigate organized-crime killings, serial murders, murders that involve celebrities, and cases that require great expertise or sophisticated technology. LA was once known in the 19th century as the most murderous town in the West. After LA obtained water from Owens Valley it expanded into a major metropolis. This increase was accompanied by a growing crime rate. Complex murders led to a specialized unit with the most experienced detectives. Since the O. J. Simpson trial Homicide Special was overhauled to bring in fresh talent.Part I, \\"The Valley\\" tells about the shooting death of a young immigrant woman. The FBI tap on her phone suggested organized crime, prostitution, and smuggling. Will they share information? The detectives interview people who knew Luda and get information. Will one suspect stand out? The story continues in the following chapters.Part II, \\"The Harbor\\" tells about finding the bodies of a woman and young child in the Los Angeles harbor. This is very unusual. The investigation continues until there is a break in the case. The prime suspect confessed. Chapter 8 has a brief history of LA crime. [Corwin misinterprets the problems in the O. J. Simpson case regarding the planted evidence.] Questioning the main suspects from Part I results in a near confession where neither party admits doing the shooting.Part III, \\"West L. A.\\" is about one unsolved murder from 1965, a \\"cold case\\". A sixteen year old girl was raped and shot in her home. Research into fingerprints turned up a new suspect. Can they use tricks to fool a suspect into confessing (p.197)?Part IV, \\"The Canyon\\" tells about the murder of Susan Berman, whose father was involved with Las Vegas gambling. She was down on her luck when she was shot to death at home. They interview people to learn what they can. Unlike TV shows, detectives wait month for the analysis of evidence (p.252). One suspect takes a polygraph exam.Part V, \\"Los Feliz\\" is about the rape and murder of a sixty-year old woman in her apartment. TV shows are dramas (p.262). Can a dog follow the scent of a killer? An ATM machine suggested a later time of death. Postdated? The detectives continue to investigate.Part VI, \\"The Valley\\" begins with the murder of Bonny Bakley and the questioning of Robert Blake. Bonny had an amazing life and swindled many older men. Child actors in \\"Our Gang\\" died tragically (p.339). [Corwin tells how Los Angeles acquired water from 233 miles away, and how a few rich men became even wealthier.] A fingerprint at that Los Feliz crime scene is the link to the suspect. He is tracked down and arrested.The \`Epilogue' tells about the results of these cases at the time this book was completed in 2003. There is no \`Index' to the names in this book. While months are mentioned, the years are not. The stories are interwoven in the text rather than completed in one chapter; I don't like that. This book provides a behind the scenes view of a part of the LAPD that you won't see on TV dramas. Are other big cities similarly understaffed?

Anyone who has visited (or plans to visit) southern Spain will be thrilled by the account of Irving's trip, but I'll go further: you need not ever go there to enjoy this classic work of history and humor.Irving stayed at the Alhambra for three months in 1829 and jotted down notes concerning its history and legends. Early in his visit, Irving was accosted by Mateo Ximenes, a credulous and indigent \\"son of the Alhambra\\" who soon proves a worthy and endearing companion, a guide to secret chambers, and a conveyor of whimsical traditions. A couple of years later, while in London, Irving wrote \\"The Alhambra,\\" describing his idiosyncratic hosts, recounting the millennium-old history of the Moorish occupation, and transcribing fresh versions of the palace's medieval legends and myths, many of which resemble stories from the \\"Arabian Nights.\\" The first edition appeared in 1832, a second American edition was published four years later, but Irving extensively revised and enlarged the book in 1851, incorporating material unavailable or unknown to him in the 1830s. This last edition is the one most commonly available today.The result is easily Irving's most accessible book, filled with wit and anecdote. Alongside the history of the Moorish kingdom of Granada, Irving intersperses tales (both historical and mythical) of enchanted caves, imprisoned princesses, and buried treasure. His admiration for Islamic heritage is obvious throughout: \\"The Arab invasion and conquest brought a higher civilization and a nobler style of thinking, into Gothic Spain.\\" And he regularly denounces the prejudices (both medieval and contemporary) \\"so strongly characteristic of the bigot zeal, which sometimes inflamed the Christian enterprises\\" and which have prevented his fellow Europeans from studying a rich and justifiably proud tradition.As Irving accurately summarizes, Moslem Spain was \\"a region of light amid Christian, yet benighted Europe; externally a warrior power fighting for existence; internally a realm devoted to literature, science, and the arts; where philosophy was cultivated with a passion . . . and where the luxuries of sense were transcended by those of thought and imagination.\\" Plus, the Islamic \\"occupiers\\" and Christian warriors certainly knew how to tell a good story. This book will delight both history and literature buffs."},{"Title":"The Alhambra","review":"I don't always like to read classics, but when a friend of mine suggested that I read this book, I decided to try it, and I am very glad that I did. Irving's words, though written so many years before now, still paint eloquent pictures of the Spain of his time. I could almost see what he was seeing. The stories and legends are also wonderful and fascinating. An antique copy of this book is one of my most treasured gifts."},{"Title":"The Alhambra","review":"Many Americans know Washington Irving as the author of \\"the Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\" and \\"Rip Van Winkle\\". Few realize that he was also a world traveler, scholarly fluent in Arabic and Spanish and something of an Hispanophile, to the say least.Irving's book is largely responsible for the widespread romantic image of Spain. It is a collection of observation, history, fairy tale, written in Irving's unique blend of romanticism and healthy skepticism. It is roughly framed by his journey to the Alhambra and his departure from it, an in between we are given a tour of the grounds and hear a few tales (including tales of Moorish ghosts on headless horses) which are roughly intertwined as in the Arabian Nights. Indeed, this little book is the 'Arabian Nights' of the west.Before visit the Alhambra read this book. If you are not planning on going, read it and you'll probably change your mind."},{"Title":"The Alhambra","review":"I ordered this as a gift for my Ma.When I visited her a few weeks later I saw something that looked likea high schooler had copied at kinkos.The type is blurry and smudged.Some paragraphs are unreadable.Will Amazon take it back?No, it been more than 30 days....40 days to be exact.I will not purchase gift books from Amazon again...better off going to Borders....get aclean copy and ship it yourself."},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"I've been reading Kurtz for years and like so many have been waiting for Kelson to find his bride. The story itself was fine, but what seemed missing was any real fleshing out of the character of his bride. She's only in about 5-10% of the book and never has any first person scenes. I would like to know more about her from her point of view, not from Kelson's vantage point.Otherwise the story was a good conclusion to Kelson's stories. It is a must read for fans of the series. Since it essentially seventh in Kelson's story, I wouldn't recommend to anyone who hasn't read the others."},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"Trite, pretty much sums up my feelings for this book. Kelson's saga deserves better... I got the distinct impression the author is tired of her character and wanted to tie up loose ends and be done with him. Kelson is my favorite character in the Deryni universe and I will continue to revisit the earlier novels, but not \\"King Kelson's Bride\\"."},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"I thought that this book by Katharine Kurtz was incredible, but what happened to the romance that I thought was going to be so much a part of this book??? The title is King Kelson's Bride so naturally i thought that much of the book would be devoted to Kelson finding and falling in love with his &quot;bride&quot;. Not so. Much of the book revolves around Liam's enthronement and Maheal and Teymuraz's treachery. I think that Kelson is a very honorable man but many of his actions and thoughts in this book were self serving. He constantly whines about how he will never get to be with Rothana, how he wants Nigel to accept Albin, he is so wrapped up with his own problems he doesn't even notice that Derry is being controlled by Morag and Teymuraz. Actually I don't really even think that he deserved Araxie!! She was so beautiful, gentle and sweet and all he could think about for most of the book was how he loves Rothana! Get over it! I really loved the Christian aspect of this book though. So often you read fantasy books and there are all these strange gods and such that it was refreshing to read a fantasy novel that incoporated real values and beliefs in it. When Kelson and Araxie did have scenes together it was sweet, but where's the passion, the true love? Both Araxie and Kelson claimed they were contented with each other but contentment seems sorta bland somehow. Ms. Kurtz should have made them fall passionately in love erasing from Kelson's mind all thoughts and regrets about Rothana and Sidana. I agree with another reviewer who thought kurtz should have given Araxie and Kelson an adventure together! She should have had Teymuraz kidnap Araxie and Kelson could have rescued her and realized how much he loved her. Another thing I really loved about this book was the descriptions of people and places. Everything was so vividly and realistically depicted, i felt like i was right there. I also liked how Kelson had this very close circle of honorable, sweet friends. So often in books it seems like the protaginist has every one againest him and no allies, but Kelson had some great friends. Something that really annoyed me was how Araxie was so accepting when it came to Kelson's love for Rothana. How could she not have been jealous at all? That just seemed a little unrealistic. And not only was she understanding of their relationship but she manipulated Rothana to come closer to court where Rothana would be in constant contact with Kelson! Overall, i thought that this book was great and i still feel very attached to it so i would recommend it to everyone!"},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"In Gwynedd, the State, Church, and citizens finally accept the Deryni, a race of people possessing powerful magical abilities, even thought they still fear them a little.

He becomes betrothed to a distant relative, who also accepts her duty to her country. They formally announce their betrothal before His Highness sails to Torenth to return the rightful monarch to the throne.Torenth and Gwynedd have fought many wars so no one is shocked when someone tries to assassinate Kelson. However, what stuns everyone is that the betrayers also try andd kill Torenth's rightful king. The two kings defeat the traitors, but one turncoat escapes, leaving behind the fear that Kelson's future bride is now the intended target.Although Torenth and Gwynedd are imaginary lands, they are based on Europe and the Nation of Islam during Medieval times. Katherine Kurtz makes her universe feel colorful and fills it with incredible detail that leads the audience to feel they are visiting a strange and exciting world. In spite of the myriad of description that paints the Kurtz universe, the story line is bold, loaded with action, and fast-paced. For over two decades, King Kelson has been a legendary fan favorite and the endless wait for this tale will seem worth it as the legion of Derynites will relish this story for decades to come."},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"Finally! Katherine Kurtz returns to Gwynedd to continue the story of the Deryni and the House of Haldane. Fans of the Deryni series will find that although the book does move some plotlines along too quickly, overall the story is a good read.New details brilliantly illustrate the Kingdom of Torenth and other regions surrounding Gwynedd as King Liam of Torenth prepares to assume his crown after serving as King Kelson's vassal for four years. The political tensions within the story are well crafted; Kurtz's decision to write the book from this angle was wise. This book could have easily degenerated into a sugary romance novel in the hands of a less skilled author.Those who are new to this series may expect to find themselves wondering why certain characters act as they do; the story assumes prior knowledge of past events--but there is no possible way that Kurtz could spend endless paragraphs &quot;catching up&quot; new readers to a series of this scope. New readers may find this book will pique their curosity about the series; they will find Gwynedd is worth visiting again and again."},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"Another boring book! And I thought the last one was boring! I should have waited for this one to come out in paperback - after all, if I've waited, what, 8-10 years since the last one, I could surely have waited another year for this one.There is little real action in this book, and very little of Deryni capabilities. Mostly the book has detailed descriptions of castles or land or other frivolities - I skipped pages of that sort of stuff - and little character interaction.It also ties everything up in pretty wrapping paper and a big bow. Come on, life is not like that! Even in fairy tales someone loses, and in this book no one loses, everyone ends up with what they want.It took me 4 hours to read this book. Course, it took me 4 hours to read the last one too."},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"Katherine Kurtz could write anything I think and I would enjoy it, and I did find many things to enjoy about King Kelson's Bride. However I think she caved in to fan pressure to hurry up and get Kelson's loose ends tied up. The whole book felt rushed to me, and I found it very hard to believe that Kelson is STILL carrying on over Rothana after 4 years! I would have liked this story to back up a little bit chronologically and evolve into a new trilogy, but I suspect that it is nothing more than a prequal that introduces (in the form of the children and Araxie) the characters in a series set later in Kelson's reign. I for one would love to see how he turns out in his maturity. As for the complaints about the absence of Morgan and Duncan, come on guys, give the poor fellows a break! They're coming back in the Childe Morgan series after all. God knows when Morgan was ever able have children with Richenda since he spent most of his time traipsing after Kelson; and Duncan has been excommunicated, suspended and tortured, can't he have a little peace and STAY AT HOME, for once? I was quite pleased to sacrifice Morgan and Duncan for a little more insight into Meraude, Rory, Jehanna and the babies! My recommendation: if you are not a fan, don't read this book. If you are a fan, read with an open mind because its NOT what you are expecting but it does have its moments!"},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"All in all, this is a nice addition to the series and it wraps up some of the loose ends from the last Kelson book. However, for a book about &quot;King Kelson's Bride,&quot; there is VERY little about the bride. Araxie, Kelson's cousin, shows up a third way into the book and then disappears for a few more chapters. She's beautiful, intelligent, very sensible, etc., but I was hoping for someone who would absolutely knock Kelson's crown off and make him forget Rothana. He spends too much of the book moaning over her refusal to marry him. I'd have liked to see Araxie very involved in the action as a heroine or to hear what she was thinking. On the plus side, it was nice to see Kelson's mother, Jehana, begin to explore her Deryni talents and the subplot about Kelson's ward, Torenthi King Liam-Lajos, was well done, even if it took up Ctoo much of the novel. Kelson's uncle Nigel and aunt Meraude deal with the two grandchildren left behind by executed son Connall satisfactorily, though one would think Meraude would be a little less fond of the man who chopped off her son's head, even if she knows Connall deserved it! All in all, a good effort."},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"Those of us who have read all the Deryni books have long observed how Katherine Kurtz loves to torture her characters. While it makes for excellent reading, it's also nice to see the good guys have good things happen to them on occasion. This latest installment of the popular Deryni series has all the excitement of the other books, but with a happy and satisfying resolution and lots of loose ends well tied up. Some of the major characters of books past are little more than background color, which is the only disappointing part of this book. If you are hoping to see a lot of Morgan, Duncan, and Dhugal, you won't find this book meets your needs. However, this is Kelson's story, and it truly fleshes out Kelson well. I just hope this isn't the last installment of the Deryni series; I'm still waiting for Childe Morgan!"},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"It's been a long wait for this one, the last month of which I used to read the others in the series. Now I sort of wish I hadn't done so. While rereading refreshed some necessary character and plot points, along with reminding me why I've so anticipated this novel, it also made me realize how weak this novel is in comparison. Not that it's bad; it just isn't as good. As one might imagine from the title, a large portion of the plot deals with Kelson's search, sometimes willingly sometimes not, for a new bride. The other half of the book deals with the political problem of Torenthi. Neither of these, however, had the same driving urgency or poignancy of Kurtz's earlier novels. Part of the problem, as often happens in a series so large, is that we've seen much of this before: the Torenthi danger, the unwilling bride, attempted assassinations, unrequited love, deep compulsions of betrayal set on humans, etc. To overcome this sense of &quot;been there done that&quot;, Kurtz needed to to distract us with the power of her characters or the dazzlement of her plotlines. Unfortunately, neither was quite up to it. None of the major good characters reached the heroic or humorous proportions of their earlier incarcations: Duncan and Morgan, for instance, were mere shadows of their prior selves. And none of the villains matched the depths of compelling ugliness of Loris or the regents. The good characters are models of good behavior and logic, but not particularly rousing. The evil characters are evil, but in a perfunctory fashion; they simply aren't fascinating enough. I miss both extremes. I also missed the sense of inner turmoil and tragedy from previous works. Jehanna could have played into part of this (the inner turmoil), but her confusion/conversion happened too quickly to suit me--a nod to a plot point rather than an exploration of character. And Kelson's pining for Rothana, to be honest, got a bit tiresome. After having suffered once more through the deaths of Rhy, Javan, Camber, Allister, and so many other previous characters, and having watched so many well-intentioned plans fall short of fruition, this novel simply didn't move me, either in its personal characters or its larger political vision. Is this a necessary novel? Yes, it moves the characters and plot along. It's well-written and decently plotted and it was a pleasure to rejoin Kelson and to get a look at how the other half (the Torenthi) live. And maybe it's unfair to hold it up to the standards of the prior works. But Kurtz has only herself to blame. She set the standard; here's hoping her next one comes a bit closer."},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"Having read all the previous Deryni books, I pre-ordered this one months in advance. I could hardly contain my excitement when it actually arrived, only to be severely disappointed. All the previous stories have been about the Deryni-human conflict. The struggle for survival, the often-tragic outcomes made for gripping reading.In this story nothing much happens. It starts with a discussion of all the prospective brides for King Kelson. This discussion is repeated about 6 or 7 times throughout the book. Then there are discussions about other peoples marriage plans, about how to restore Conal's two (one legitimate, one not) children to their rightful place in court and who will receive which noble title. This too is told again and again. Repetition!It seems that Ms. Kurtz wanted to have a happy conclusion for everybody. Liam, the 14-year-old prince of Torenth is returned to his country to become king despite his plotting brothers. Kelson's mother, Jehana starts to come round to the idea that being a Deryni is not sinful. And Kelson comes round to the idea that he will love the woman whom he is going to marry. That is the whole story! Bored me to tears!All the goodies survive (most unusual for K. Kurtz) and all the badies die, save one. I suppose this is just in case Ms. Kurtz decides to write another novel. If she does, she must try a good deal harder. If I were to rate her previous books, I would give them each 4 or 5 stars. One is enough for this one.I think that Ms. Kurtz had written about two chapters and then decided to call it a book. She then simply copyied and pasted whole paragraphs, changed the wording slightly and then knitted the bits together with endless descriptions of the countryside, what people are wearing and other non-events.Only devout Deryni fans will manage to finish reading this book. Moreover, knowing how fascinating her previous stories were, they will be even more disappointed because it is so repetitive and boring!"},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"The plot concenring Torenth and Liam was wodnerfully well done and enjoyable. This book is worth reading for this plot alone.The orther plot, about Kelson's marriage left me a little cold. The politicking around it was interesting, but thee fact that he's been pining for Rothana for three years and then marries the woman she suggests... first, his feelings for Rothana aren't love anymore, they're obsession and Araxia is just too perfect.Read the Toernthi plotline, skim through the Kelson's marriage plot.Don't these people have flaws?"},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"It's been a few years since I eagerly bought this book and read it, but it still leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I've been a devoted Kurtz fan since the early 80's when an Army buddy gave me a copy of Deryni Rising and told me to read it, I read the book in one night!This book left much to be desired, not enough Morgan for my taste and seemsed so wishy washy.....not up to her usually high work standard!I so wish she would go back and re-write this book, it just seemed so rushed and lacking the magic....FORGIVE ME KATHERINE!!!!"},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"I love the Deryni series, but this book was a disappointment. I think it center way too much on the marriage. After the 3rd or 4th times Kurtz stated why Kelson was marrying Araxie, it became annoying. It took up to 100 pages before Kelson set off to Torenth, which I know could have progress faster from reading Kurtz earlier works. The action was definitely lacking, and the political intrigue not fully developed. This book definitely was not written to par with the other in the series. What a disappointment :_("},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"Katherine Kurtz has been succesful once more. She has us involved in this world that is amazing for all its characters and stories and fantasy. This book is a must have for all those who have been entranced by the Deryni."},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"I did enjoy this book, until I thought about it after reading it. I agree with the review that said the characters, except for Kelson and his bride, were treated rather poorly. I was really disappointed that Morgan seems to have become a background character, far from the powerful Duke in The Chronicle of the Deryni or The Histories of King Kelson series'. Although it would be natural to see the younger nobility come to the fore, even they are not really given much. Dhugal is no more than a device to give Kelson a reason to voices his thoughts. Derry's role was always a bit of a mystery to me. Is he Morgan's aid/seneschal? There always seems to be more he should be doing.The part about Torenth was just enough to point out that they are different enough from Gwynedd to be an interesting enigma. I have always wondered, though, why do the Deryni seem to dominate the humans there, and not (except occasionally) in Gwynedd. Surely all the Deryni there are not as evil as the royalty. Speaking of which, I was not so much bothered by Morag's death, as by her seeming to second guess her long held hatred of her enemies. She even started to think of Morgan as noble!Still, with all this, I enjoyed the story. I just hope it is a platform for better things, and not just an all-in-one tying up of loose ends."},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"I've recently finished with the latest book in the Deryni series by Katherine Kurtz, King Kelson's Bride. As a long time fan of Mrs. Kurtz's writing, and especially of her Deryni series (this would be number 13 in the series, not including anthologies). So it was with great anticipation that I opened up this book.So what do I think of this book? Well, it depends. As a Deryni fan, I enjoyed re-entering the world of King Kelson and company. This book is quite a bit lighter than many of the previous books in this series. No horribly catastrophic events, and no killing off of central characters, which typify most of the Deryni books, occur in this book. As a matter of fact, most events in this book have favorable results in the end for the main protagonists (if you want further details, read some of the other reviews posted here). However, I expect some tragedy, adversity and heartbreak from a Deryni novel, and this one did not deliver it. Not that that is a bad thing, but this book just seemed bland compared to previous ones in the series. Even some of the characters seem to be shadows of themselves from previous novels. And the plot is unoriginal, just a wrap up of previous plot elements, with a few loose threads left for the next book. But in the end, I actually wanted to keep reading, and any book that can keep me interested can't be bad.If you are a newcomer to the Deryni series, I strongly suggest you do not read this book first. Not only will you be frequently confused, you will not gain a true appreciation for how good this series has been. But if you're an old hand to this series, I think you will, for the most part, enjoy a lighter return to the Deryni series."},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"I've been a fan of Kurtz's Deryni series (the less said about the Adept series, the better), so it pains me to have to give this book only three stars. But it just doesn't live up to the others.I agree with many of the other comments: it was nice to see women take on larger and more important roles in this book, Kelson whines on far too long and far too often about Rothana (and Sidana), Jehana's new way of thinking is welcome but far too sudden, as is Nigel's acceptance of his two grandchildren, and Duncan and Morgan (among others) are sadly underused/under- developed in this book. However, Matyas, Liam, Azim, and Rasoul have great potential for the future, as do the new alliances with Torenth and Meara. Araxie is a little too perfect, but I'm looking forward to seeing that relationship develop.I found that Kurtz repeated herself several times in this book. For instance, she tells us at least three times about the iron ring and what it does. It's not as though she mentions it on page one and then again two hundred pages later, either. Each explanation is only a couple of short chapters away. As others have said, she goes over the various choices for brides at least half a dozen times. And as much as I have enjoyed reading about Deryni ritual in her other books, I began to find the detail of all the religious rites (other than Liam's installation) tiresome. This time it felt a little too much as though I was in Sunday school or church.There was very little in this book that was new and intriguing. If I were just starting out with the Deryni series, I suspect I would not want to read others. I hope the next book in the Kelson saga has more action and more character development. This one felt like three hundred pages of set up for what's coming next. That's at least two hundred pages too long."},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"Being a fan I've been desperately waiting for the latest edition from Ms Kurtz which arrived over the weekend and I wasn't disappointed. More tales of magic and the middleages church which I digested in two days straight.Those who are already fans of Kelson and friends should enjoy this new tale with the added interest of further interaction with the lands set to the east.One small caveat, you'll most likely be left wanting the next book, but then I guess that's the mark of a good series writer.Thoughly enjoyable."},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"...but I did!Once again Katherine Kurtz has written an engrossing page-turner of a story, although I must admit that Kelson wasn't the main attraction by the end of the story.Since my main quibble with this series has always been that the women aren't very well-developed, I was very pleased to see Kurtz develop the characters of Meraude and Jehanna further, as well as the addition of the very clever and charming Araxie. She is finally writing women in the Kelson series who are as interesting to read about as Evaine and Rysel were in the Heirs of Saint Camber series.I would have liked to see this expanded into a trilogy as well, as I wanted to know more about Liam's uncle and what's happened with Dhugal, Duncan, and Morgan (who were almost non-existant in this story, hence the 4 stars). I loved the side story about Meraude and Nigel's grandchildren.Overall, it was a great read, but there are some loose ends left for another book in the future. Pretty please?"},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"While perhaps not as sumptious as the last books in which we saw Kelson, Morgan, Duncan et al, this is further excellent writing from Ms. Kurtz. The only downside (for me) was that I could not shake the feeling it would have worked better as 2 books, with a third book yet to come to tie up loose ends concerning a new adversary.Clearly, few write *better* than Ms. Kurtz. I just which she could write *faster*!"},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"I have been a fan of Katherine Kurtz since I first picked up &quot;Camber of Culdi&quot; in college. Looking at the various books, I saw her knowledge of medieval culture grow and her writing style mature.It is unfortunate that with &quot;King Kelson's Bride,&quot; Ms. Kurtz has so fallen in love with the trappings of royalty . . . the gowns and tunics and cloaks . . . the jewelry, the crowns and ceremonials (and on and on and on) that she forgot to write a plot on which to hang all this gorgeous pageantry. Furthermore, King Kelson and his colleagues have taken to speaking in the language of diplomatic dispatches and official court announcements -- even when they are having an intimate conversation in private.I was left with the feeling (upon reading the book) of an extravagant masquerade -- beautiful to look at, but devoid of authentic human emotion. The enthronement of a vassal king is the pivot around which both villains and heroes posture -- all of them dressed in the best medieval fashion."},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"A profound disappointment. This book reads more like an outline for a good series (say 3 novels). The story/plots moved way too fast and were shallow---very shallow. I am, frankly, surprised. Ms. Kurtz is an awesome story-teller. Can't imagine why she would turn out such work unless she was busy writing something else at the same time. I was hoping for King Kelson's Bride to be the first in a new series. I can only hope she refrains from this sort of writing for any future Deryni novels."},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"How I waited for this book to come! I confess I read this book today out of loyalty to a childhood hero. But, if I had read this book eight years ago when I finished The Question for Saint Camber the first time, I would have liked it much better.I felt that the intrigue was there for the sake of the author's avoiding to go into any detail about Kelson's bride, and all loose ends were tied to all-too-nice and pretty bows at the end.In eight years I have grown up a bit and feel much, much more could have been done for my childhood hero's bride; namely a script that is more befitting of a heroine of her integrity and status.First, I must thank the author for churning out a long awaited book. She took a long hiatus from Kelson and has since written other books of the Deryni, i.e. one of my personal favorites, &quot;King Javan's Year.&quot; I admit I relish in Ms. Kurtz's knowledge of Latin prayer and the well described rituals in the Deryni universe that are so related to the religious history of my Christian faith. Her talent for imagery and detail still entertains me....BUT... the story of Araxie, who now is a member of my Hall of Worthy Heroines, leaves much lacking, and gives too little credit to the brave little princess. Despite the title, the book isn't about her at all, but of Kelson's slow and painful-to-read transition away from his once beloved Rothana Nur Hallaj. I know that Kelson himself has great reverence for the Church and his Faith, but his unnecessarily prolonged affection for a nun left me groaning inwardly.In my opinion Kelson acts highly out of character. He has his weaknesses of course, but he has in the past proven to be wise and strong. Here, he is depicted as if he had just lost Rothana the day before yesterday.It mortified me to see a childhood hero reduce himself to a pile of mush. And a whiny one at that!He only slightly redeems himself when he sees Araxie's true worth towards the end of the novel, in a blunt, slightly stupid, and all too sudden realization completed in half a page.There is not enough evidence in the predecessors to this novel to imply that Kelson was so attatched to Araxie's predecessors. How long had he actually been in contact with either of them?In reality, most people can get over failed relationships in a few years, or at least come to accept that things don't always go as planned. Which is why I inwardly cringed when it seemed for the most part of the novel all Kelson could do was cry &quot;Rothana, oh my Rothana!&quot; Sweet Jesu!While I'm at it, let me point out that Rothana takes on a much larger role than Araxie, whom the book title salutes! She overshadows Araxie, which I thought was VERY unfair of Ms. Kurtz. Not only do we have to listen to Kelson moaning about Rothana, and Rothana's whining, we get more of Rothana than Araxie, when Araxie is the true heroine! How unfair is that!Ms. Kurtz gives far too little credit and attention to Araxie or her character development. As much as reading Kelson's thoughts and learning more of what happens to Liam is nice, the main focus should have been with Araxie, if not partially told in Araxie's point of view.Even after you finish the novel, you know NOTHING about how Araxie thinks and regards herself. Which leads me to feel that Araxie is merely another jewel in the king's crown, nothing but a pretty adornment in the story, but lacking the substance she deserves in the novel.And another thing, Araxie is a GODDESS for allowing that farce between Kelson and Rothana go on in front of her. Rothana only admits this once, in a small sentence in the entire novel, but by the time you finish the story, you are inclined to feel that Araxie deserves much more praise than Rothana was willing to give.It's terrible that Rothana and the other characters overshadow the more worthy Araxie, who is more deserving of both the spotlight and the king because Araxie is almost as saintly as Camber himself and completely unselfish, unlike Rothana. There is an impression that Rothana only used Araxie as her little puppet to fulfill a destiny she herself could not have, which is in part SELFISH, especially for a NUN.Thank God Araxie proves herself to be more than a puppet, and a far better Queen than Rothana or Sidana could have EVER aspired to be."},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"I really love Katherine Kurtz. I've been reading her books since 1983. Perhaps that span of time was a detriment to me when reading this one. It seems that it was 12 or 15 years ago when I read the previous books in this particular sequence, and it took me a while to recall what had last happened to Kelson in the books that preceded this one. I think perhaps some background/review at the start of this novel would have helped.Once I pulled out my old books and got back up to speed (which I *had* to do), this was a pleasurable read. (...) I don't know that this was one of Kurtz's better works. It almost seemed to me that this novel was a work she felt obligated to write - that she had left poor Kelson hanging too long, and needed to tell the next chapter in his life. I don't think it really advanced the story of the Deryni universe as a whole as much as it got Kelson (and half his family!) married off, finally.I'd recommend it strongly to anyone who has read all of Kurtz's other Deryni books, as how could you NOT read it? I would, however, recommend that anyone new to the Deryni world start with Deryni Rising or the Camber of Culdi series and work forward from there."},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"It was great for me to get back into the world of Gwynedd, and I appreciate that Kelson finally finds a bride."},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"As a long time lover of books about the Deryni this was another hit. Wish there were a lot more stories like this one out there to read."},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"Gentle readers, fellow reviewers, hear my tale of woe. Although I know that I am courting the deadly \`was this review helpful to you- not' vote, such is my disappointment in this novel that I feel I must continue. It is a testament to the excellence of the proceeding novels in this series that readers are so committed to liking this book that they are giving it 4 and 5 stars. Unfortunately I cannot agree that it deserves them. If you have read the other reviews you know the plot of the novel, but bear with me as here we go again, sort of.With much public weeping and knashing of teeth, our young king, Kelson, has spent the three years since we saw him last pining and brooding petulantly over a lost love. This bizarre behavior was so out of character that I never really recovered from the shock, and it was all downhill from there. Metamorphosising from a rational, independent and fiercely practical character in the proceeding books into a whiny and emotionally immature teenager, this book begins with Kelson allowing his former betrothed, Rothana, who betrayed him, to order him around. He passively and obediently proposes marriage to the woman she chooses for him, showing a complete lack of pride when he publicly admits to his friends and advisors why he has finally chosen to marry. This from a man whose resume includes, as per the previous books in the series, the following: With his father's murder, he becomes king at 14 by outsmarting his advisors. Upon learning that he is heir to illegal magical abilities, he accepts it with equanimity, using them to fight and win a duel to the death at his coronation. As a result he is rejected and abandoned by his mother, something he accepts and copes with. He is excommunicated by the church but triumphs over it, neutralizing those who wish to see him dethroned and reorganizing the church structure so that it is friendly to him by executing or otherwise eliminating those who oppose him. He chooses and protects advisors whom the bulk of his subjects would like to see burnt at the stake. He fights and wins a war against an invading country, and personally executes his enemies. He then forces into marriage the captive daughter of a family trying to take his crown, all the while planning on eliminating the rest of her family to prevent it from ever happing again. When she is murdered, he fights a bloody civil war that ravages his kingdom, again executing all that oppose him, or threaten to. He then revokes centuries-old laws outlawing magic, which most of his subjects like, thank you very much. Know that I but chip at the surface of the iceberg here. He does all this with great courtesy and much soul searching, but really with utter ruthlessness. To have this character become so passive and unfocused, and even squeamish at times made no sense whatsoever.Outside of this glaring flaw, I found the other story arc of this novel, Liam's return to Torenth, to be interesting and I too liked the bride, the Paragon of Virtue, Araxie. Yet I fail to believe that any woman in her situation, no matter how practical and self-sacrificing, could not end up at least a little jealous of her husband-to-be's former betrothed, especially when she is still front and centre in his thoughts for most of the novel. Also disappointing was the speedy and almost perfunctory final chapter covering Kelson's self-revelation that he likes his bride and is happy and content about the marriage, and the actual long-awaited marriage itself. Call me a voyeur, if you will, but with four whole books basically leading up to this moment, I would have liked this part of the book to be more than a quick footnote.In spite of all this, for me it is not so much the events of this novel that disappoint. What I enjoyed so much about the previous books in this series were the strong characterizations, the intimate interpersonal relationships, the vivid colour and feel of Ms Kurtz's alternate universe. In this novel, we never hear the character's inner voices, and as a result never learn to care about them. In general, I felt I was reading a novel with characters who had the same names as in the proceeding books, but they were completely different people. The old characters talked to each other and depended on each other, overcame obstacles and made difficult decisions together. The characters in this book are cardboard, walking and talking yet rarely interacting and as a result they have little substance. If I had not read other books in this series, I would have spent the 300+ pages of this novel in confusion, stopping frequently to say to myself \`Morgan - who is that again?' and \`Who is Duncan and what has he to do with Dhugal?\\". After finishing this book, over the next couple of days I kept picking it up and reading it at random, hoping that somehow it would resolve itself into a good satisfying book I could like. Alas, it was not to be."},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"Yesterday, I finished my first complete reading of Katherine Kurtz's new Deryni novel, _King Kelson's Bride_, which I had been eagerly awaiting ever since I finished reading _The Quest for Saint Camber_ nearly fourteen years ago. Katherine Kurtz fans may rest assured that this book was worth the wait! The only way this book could possibly be improved in my view is if it had been LONGER. In King Kelson's Bride, the reader travels with Kelson and his close friends, the Dukes Alaric Morgan and Dhugal McArdry McLain to the Hort of Orsal's exotic summer palace on the Ile d'Orsal, and then onto the Torenthi capital, Beldour. Both have been mentioned in earlier Deryni novels, but readers have only rarely glimpsed Torenthi court life, and have never visited the Orsal's court before. Now that his vassal, King Liam-Lajos of Torenth has come of age, Kelson travels with him to oversee his safe installment on the throne of Torenth. As the author herself has observed, \\"Things are different in Torenth.\\" Indeed they are, as the Deryni of Torenth have never been subjected to the same persecution Deryni in Gwynedd have experienced. Their magic is far more of an accepted part of Torenthi court life, even unto the installment of their Kings. Without giving away the plot, readers may be assured that there is plenty of danger, treachery and Deryni magic afoot on the day of Liam's royal ceremony. Regarding the Bride herself, in the beginning of the novel, we see Kelson is still in love with Rothana, but is fored to accept that they will never be able to marry. At Rothana's instigation, he proposes to his cousin, Princess Araxie Haldane on the night he visits the Ile d'Orsal. Araxie accepts him willingly if with some trepidation. But the love between them only has a chance to grow once Kelson returns to Rhemuth and gradually comes to appreciate Araxie for her intelligence and the sensitivity of her spirit. By their wedding day in the final chapter, Kelson has found a new love and far more compatible Queen than Rothana, his original choice. Many loose ends are tied up in this novel, including that of Kelson's mother Queen Jehana who experiences an epiphany regarding her Deryni heritage while Kelson is in Beldour. Also resolved are the fates of Kelson's cousin Prince Rory, and of Prince Nigel who is at last persuaded to accept his two grandchildren by the late Prince Conall. Readers new to the Deryni world should understand that this novel was written with Ms. Kurtz's already established fans in mind. Knowledge of the people and places of the Deryni universe is assumed on the part of the reader, and indeed is necessary to understand the events of the novel. But there is a happy solution to any confusion this newest book may bring to new Katherine Kurtz fans: Read the rest of the Deryni books!"},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"I admit it, I have a deep personnel connection with this series. I read DERYNI RISING during labor with my daughter, who is now married with children of her own. I was reading THE BISHOP'S HEIR while in labor with my son. That was fifteen years ago. And while labor and pregnacy can seem endless, NOTHING compares with the 10 year hiatus we have endured waiting for Ms. Kurtz to finish her story. Poor Kelson, our handsome, noble, powerful, kind, young, yadayada king can not hold onto a bride. Considering the title, I'm not giving too much away if I say that third time's a charm. There's alot that's really great about this book. Ms. Kurtz explores great new cultures and de-demonizes the Torenthi. The political intrique is intriguing, although the Liam's Torenthi uncle was clearly a good guy from the first. I really liked Kelson's new bride, mostly because Rothana and her guilt (and eternal whining) were really getting on my nerves. Kurtz does a good job of explaining why Rothana REALLY can't marry Kelson - not the nonsense she spouts about it. Problems? A few. I wish that Kurtz had taken a bit more time with the relationship between Kelson and &quot;his bride.&quot; Couldn't she have given them a bit of an adventure together? Jehanna's seachange is rather short-changed. After so many years of fananticism, ignoring facts and logic, she throws away &quot;salvation&quot; for a pair of eyes? I don't think so. Another thing, what happened to Morgan? He was so powerful and talented in the first three books and so whimpy and conservative in the last few. I know the focus has switched to Kelson but poor Morgan! Not to mention, poor Derry...the eternal bad guy's deus ex machina...the trusted, warpable human lord. Still, practically everybody's here and ending happily; the new countries are an intriguing patchwork of our world cultures and Kurtz's invention; most of the bad guys are punished and the heroes get the girls. What more can you want in a fantasy!"},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"As a reader who was disappointed by The Quest for Saint Camber for various reasons, I was somewhat reluctant to purchase King Kelson's Bride in hardcover, but having done so, I find myself fairly glad that I did. KKB delivers with a solid plot and a thorough depiction of an alternate culture. The storyline involving Kelson's ward, Liam-Lajos, future king of Torenth, is especially strong and resolves, for the most part, a thread that has been left hanging since Kurtz's first Deryni trilogy. Torenthi culture is also explored in detail--on occasion, perhaps a little too much detail. At times, Kelson and Liam's progress through Torenth, where they have journeyed for Liam's full investiture as king in his own right, the narrative occasionally resembles a travelogue, with the necessary stops at mosques and cathedrals.Somewhat surprisingly, the other main subplot--Kelson's quest for a bride--gets rather short shrift by comparison. The proposed candidate, Araxie Haldane, is only onstage for about a third of the novel. What we *do* see of her, however, is quite promising. While Araxie does possess the conventional virtues of sweetness and gentleness, she also displays a calm strength and a sure grasp of politics that may serve her better in her new position than the &quot;fiery&quot; nature that is fast becoming a fantasy heroine cliche. Frankly, I was more disappointed by the conduct of Kelson, who spends an inordinate amount of time obsessing over what he cannot have--namely, marriage to his former betrothed, Rothana, who has chosen a life of service over him. The revelation that Kelson has been carrying this torch for three years since Rothana made her decision seems more than a little self-indulgent, as does Kelson's incessant moaning over having to marry for reasons of state. I found myself reminded of a passage in Patricia McKillip's fantasy, The Sorceress and the Cygnet, in which the heroine, exasperated by the demands and importunities of a former lover, accuses him of clinging too hard to his memories and selfishly closing his heart to women who might have loved him freely and whom he might have loved in return. I rather wish someone had spoken so to Kelson about 100 pages before he finally experienced his epiphany about his future bride. Araxie, however, does show some spirit when she reminds Kelson that she, no less than he, is possibly denying herself experience of a grand passion by agreeing to marry *him*!Overall, KKB is a worthwhile read, though lacking some of the &quot;oomph&quot; that characterized even the earliest of Kurtz's works. Although her first Deryni trilogy was marred by the occasional roughness or awkwardness of style, there was an immediacy and urgency in the viewpoints of her main characters, especially Kelson, Morgan, and Derry. In KKB, by contrast, the viewpoint seems oddly muted and even remote, which blunts some of the emotional impact of events. We still get Kelson's point-of-view, but Morgon, along with Duncan and Dhugal, seems to have receded into the background. And Derry's perspective is never explored at all--a surprising choice given one of Kurtz's main plot twists."},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"Reading this book makes me glad I only borrowed a copy and didn't pay for it.First off, like a lot of people, I read the Morgan and Camber books around the ages of 13-14 and enjoyed them immensely. The people were fairly complex and the author didn't seem to be afraid to let Bad Things happen.As I grew older, the books faded into nostalgia for me; pleasant memories and an occasional re-read.However, with this book, I agree with all the other reviewers who spoke about King &quot;Never Met a Topic I Couldn't Whine About&quot; Kelson. Good Lord. I kept hoping that someone could invent Prozac and forcefeed it to him. Working through grief at a betrayal and the loss of the woman you felt you were in love with is one thing, but dragging about like Eeyore for *years* is quite another.There were too many new characters to allow anyone to be introduced beyond a basic sketch of their personality which then got repeated again and again. The appearances of Morgan and Duncan were akin to David Duchovny's contractually obligated seconds of screen time in most of the XF season.And Derry...yikes. Derry has been the most well-rounded human (i.e. non-Deryni) character in the Morgan/Kelson books, IMO. He's stuck by Morgan through thick and thin, believing in the tolerance and acceptance that they all seemed to hope for in human/Deryni relations; and how does Kurtz repay him? By letting him not once, but *twice*, serve as the deus ex machina of plot betrayal. It was effective in the first trilogy because, as was pointed out in an earlier review, she wrote it with no holds barred. This time, I could barely suppress the urge to yawn as Kurtz cribbed from her past plots to try and bring about some drama to this otherwise tepid tale of a depressed groom-to-be and the women that run roughshod over him.All in all, definitely not worth the years of waiting for something that reads like a sale from the Bargain Bin at Plots 'R' Us."},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"Let me preface my review by saying that Ms. Kurtz's other Deryni books are amazing, worth reading again and again. I strongly recommend the Camber series in particular.However, King Kelson's Bride lacked the rich detail, headlong pace, moral dilemmas, and compelling characterizations of her previous works.Only Kelson and his bride feel fleshed-out as realistic characters. Other characters who were dynamic in the past trilogies - such as Morgan, Dhugal, and the villains of the novel - have been sketched in as bare props, shoved into place whenever the plot needs a boost. These sketchy characterizations show up primarily in the lack of significant conversations between the characters, conversations which in previous trilogies could be moving, exciting, hilarious - in fact, one of the primary reasons to read the novels. Likewise missing were the soul-deep magical communications between the characters.The court and people of Torenth received equally patchy treatment. The landscape and the architecture are described in full (frankly excessive) detail, while many interesting questions are ignored. Do the Torenthi comunicate in the same style as the people of Gwynedd? Or were there subtle, or not so subtle differences, which created awkwardness and misunderstandings between Kelson and the Torenthi? Are court politics played in the same manner? Do Torenthi men and women interact together in the same manner as in Gwynedd? Do women and children have more or less rights? How do lesser nobility regard their rulers? Are the laws generally more harsh? Does their sense of morality differ shockingly? Many questions such as these could have been answered in this novel, yet the reader leaves Torenth having learned only of minutia such as the temperature, the color of the domes, and the manner in which they cross themselves. A whole new country long left mysterious in the trilogy has been visited - and largely bypassed. What a wasted opportunity!The plot of the novel seemed to suffer from lack of consistency. New threats developed suddenly, only loosely connected with the rest of the novel, and left insufficient time for the reader to become apprehensive. The subplots involving formerly peripheral characters such as Jehanna and Meraude were charming indeed, and perhaps one of the novel's strongest points - but alas, we mainly see the conclusions of these subplots rather than the development.The pace of the novel was oddly variable, approximating that of a limping snail when covering insignificant details, and stubbornly refusing to develop the parts most dear to readers. Kelson's long-awaited wedding was covered in the merest summary, while his wedding night - the perfect opportunity for Ms. Kurtz to tastefully expand upon the growing rapport and closeness between the two - was skipped entirely.I can only hope Ms. Kurtz's next novel shows all the talent of which she is capable."},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"It has been a long climb for the forces of the Light in the Deryni world of the Eleven Kingdoms, but the summit has been reached in King Kelson's Bride. From this vantage point it is easy to see the roles that the major characters in the Kelson series are to play out in their lives. As such, it is not anti-climatic, for Ms. Kurtz has written a book that carries a strong storyline and provides plenty of action and some suspense. In binding up the loose ends, I still was drawn through the book to the concluding lines and left the book with a satisfied feeling.I did feel that this book, coming ten years after the Quest for Saint Camber, carries strong influences from Ms. Kurtz's Adept series. She takes more time in describing the scenery and clothing. I will be looking forward to the next book, hopefully to describe the period 40-50 years prior to Kelson's coronation, to see how well Ms. Kurtz can put together a new trilogy.This is a recommended read for everyone wishing to complete the story of King Kelson and the restoration of Deryni fortunes."},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"Hard for me to believe, but I have been a fan of the Deryni series for about 25 years now, and I waited eagerly for this installment. I guess since I read about Kelson and company first, I enjoy those books much more than the Camber books (although the Camber books are probably better written). I have to agree with the readers who found King Kelson's Bride a disappointment. The book read more like a history, almost as if Ms. Kurtz has become so wrapped up in the genealogies of the Deryni families, and the history of Torenth (although I did find that kind of interesting), that she forgot to tell an entertaining story. Other folks have commented that Kelson seems like a whiny, love-sick teenager; I agree that he seemed more mature in the first series at the age of 14. Morgan is hardly more than a walk-on character in this book. And Derry -apart from the fact that the mind-control plot from High Deryni was rehashed (and less convincingly this time), when the heck did Derry turn into a babysitter for Morgan's kids? Not enough that the old favorites seemed like strangers, in my opinion, Ms. Kurtz made a serious mistake by killing off the two most interesting villains in this installment - Mahael and Morag. What was the point of this - just to introduce yet another Torenthi brother? Finally, the title of this book is misleading; it's hardly the story of Araxie, who actually grew on me (much more than the martyr Rothana) and seemed too good for the Kelson of this book. The final straw was Queen Jehana's lickety-split change into a Deryni-lover. I enjoyed her more as the harpy who was out to save Kelson from the &quot;evil&quot; Deryni influence. Having really grown fond of the characters in the Kelson series (and impressed by Ms. Kurtz's writing), it pains me to have to give this book such a poor review. Here's hoping the next one will be better."},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"I've been waiting for this book over 10 years but I figured the wait would be worth it (if only to read more of the adventures of the enigmatic, powerful, strong yet vulnerable Alaric Morgan and his equally magically powerful priest-cousin, Duncan).Kurtz' rich characters have been my all-time favorite fictional entities. But King Kelson's Bride left me bereft, sad. Morgan and Duncan are barely recognizable, when they do show up at all. Maybe because I'm over the age of 40 now, but teenage angst irks me. If I wanted a romance novel I'd have bought a romance novel.I'm hoping, praying, that Miss Kurtz will rejuvenate her beloved (our beloved) characters of old in her next novel. I'm so upset with this one I'm even considering sending it back (but my Katherine Kurtz keeper shelf would look a little bare without it there, I guess).Please, Miss Kurtz, bring back Morgan, Duncan and Derry. The original Morgan, Duncan and Derry!"},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"What a disappointment this book was for me. After waiting years and years for another Deryni volume to finally make it's way into my greedy little hands, it was a real let down. As other reviewers have said, the author spent more time describing clothing than action, rehashing the same details over and over again and giving us a plot so thin you could hang a cloak on it. In addition, I found that the entire plot was telegraphed over and over again so there were no real surprises. Basically, characters would sit and discuss what someone else might be planning to do and what they would do in case it did happen -- and then said things did occur. It also felt like she needed to continue Kelson's story but didn't want to waste the time really spending time telling it. Either she should have put in the effort to make this another trilogy or trimmed the excess to make it a better book.On the positive side, it was nice to see an expanded world and experience places and things we'd never seen before. As much as I enjoy reading about her fantasy Britain, it was great to see new vistas and learn about her fantasy Byzantium as well. The new characters were worth the introduction except perhaps for Araxie -- mainly because the whole situation seemed forced. Oh well, hopefully the next book (or 10) will be better."},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"This book, while fairly well written, is little more than a cheap and sappy romance next to the other books in the series. The undying love for rothana, and the budding romance with arexie turned my stomach, not to mention the sticky sweet scene with the children. The attempt to bring Derry back as a the great character he was in the first kelson series accomplished little more than rehashing an old plotline. i was disappointed. Katherine Kurtz is a great writer, but I think she may have sucked this particular universe dry."},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"or in poor Kelson's case, always a groomsman, never a groom. This is as wonderful a book as all of the others in the Deryni world. A world so detailed and complete, that one could imagine traveling there on vacation. King Kelson's Bride does cause a small frisson of fear however. There are so many loose ends tied up in this book that Ms. Kurtz's readers may be frightened that she intends to stop writing about the fabulous Deryni. Say it isn't so!!As in the more than a dozen works in this world that have gone before, the characters are full and real. We the readers sigh along with Kelson as everyone he meets tries to choose a mate for him. We feel Derry's panic as a trip to Torenth looms. We smile with Morgan at his charming little daughter.I for one, feel that Anne McCaffrey said it best: &quot;An incredible historical tapestry of a world that never was and of immensely vital people who ought to be.&quot;"},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"I just finished this book last night (actually this morning!) and I loved it! After reading all the other reviews, I have to disagree with a number of them. First, I know many lamented the bit parts assigned to Morgan, Duncan and Derry, but this was Kelson's story. Do they need major parts in a story about Kelson's path to the altar? I also don't really see this as an ending, as many of the other reviewers seem to. It does tie up some loose ends, but brings a few other into play. Ms. Kurtz didn't seem to completely flesh out the character of Araxie, but we know her as well as Kelson does, and hopefully there will be forthcoming books in which we get to know her.All in all, I thought it was a great book, worth staying up to read. The description of the places were good, and I thought all the major players were very nicely drawn. I might be biased, though, because I liked the fact that none of the good guys dies in this book! Yes! With all the death and torture in the other books, I was getting depressed, so I didn't even buy this one: I borrowed it from the library. I enjoyed it enough that I might buy this one. =-)"},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"It felt much as though the primary characters had done nothing short of sit in a dark hole for the three years between their last appearance and now. They had not changed or grown in those years. I got very tired of mopey Kelson, when his emotions felt contrived to begin with.Things that felt resolved in previous books were miraculously unresolved in this one. Rules about magic that have been previously declared inviolable were suddenly questionable. A lot of the intrigue felt like it was there solely for the sake of intrigue.I did like some of the parts of this book and it has opened the world a little more for further Deryni education and informational quests. I also liked the development of Jehanna."},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"A novel of the Deryni.I had thought, from the title and descriptions of the book, that this was going to be a sappy love story set in the Deryni universe as Kelson tries to woo a new bride to be his Queen. As such, I put off reading King Kelson's Bride for several years. The Deryni series has long been one of my favorites but I simply was not interested in a romance set in a fantasy world. I finally decided to read the book, if only because I knew that Katherine Kurtz had a new Deryni series coming out this year and I wanted to be caught up in case it was set in Kelson's time. King Kelson's Bride offered a pleasant surprise.This was a different book than what I expected. It turns out to be mostly a transition book (presuming that Kurtz does write another series after Kelson's era) to lay the groundwork for Kelson actually getting married and producing heirs as well as reconciliation between humans and Deryni. Out of all of the Deryni books, my favorites are the ones that are set the farthest back in the history. I prefer the ones dealing with Camber and his direct heirs (my favorite book is King Javan's Year). Part of the reason was the prominence of Deryni in the society. King Kelson's Bride is starting to rebuild the Deryni traditions in Gwynedd. One of Kelson's big projects is to try to rebuild the Deryni training schools which had been eliminated during the Heirs of Saint Camber trilogy. I love some of the ideas that are being put forth in King Kelson's Bride, but the execution of the novel itself was a little weak.Kelson is marrying for Dynastic purposes and the woman that he loves is entering a religious order. While the title of the book is focuses on the Bride, the book itself deals with the Bride more as an idea rather than with Araxie herself. Araxie has the potential to be a strong woman in the series to the level of an Evaine, but we are given very little to work with. Araxie is barely in the book, and while Kelson is portrayed as somewhat simpering over his lost love of Rothana, Araxie has strength and grace.King Kelson's Bride is a stand alone novel in the Deryni series (though by its nature it is connected to the two Kelson trilogies) and is perhaps weaker because of that. It feels like it only serves to present some ideas that may well appear in later Deryni trilogies. This was an average Deryni novel, and all it did was whet my appetite for a real Deryni book to be released again."},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"I'm agreeing with those who called this book a disappointment. I had not even heard it was on the way, but when I saw it on the shelves, I let out a squeal of joy and bought it, expecting a wonderful, nostalgia-filled trip back into Gywnnedd. I am sorry to say, I was mistaken.The entire book read like fanfic based on the series. I find it nearly impossible to believe that Ms. Kurtz wrote it, save for the amount of detail. The Derry plot was lifted from the first series. The Kelson I knew and loved, even as a teenager, knew that his first priority was to be king. The character in this book by the same name spent most of his time whining. As for Araxie, someone please please please tell me she dies in labor the next time we see her, because she's even more annoying than Kelson, if that's possible. I believe the other reviewers mourned the lack of Morgan and Duncan as feasible characters enough that I may only add a wistful sigh of my own.Yours in the belief that if we all simply refuse to believe that this book happened, maybe it'll go away ...MM"},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"Katherine Kurtz continues to enthrall with this further episode of the Deryni. Anyone who has read her previous books will enjoy this."},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"While still struggling to mend his heart after it sufered a bad break with Rothana, King Kelson must still continue searching for a bride a secure the Haldane line to the throne. He must also be sure to keep the Torenthi heir alive while doing it. Kelson must face serveral political struggles in Gwynedd, without neglecting his personal struggles with his heart. A tough task to be sure.This is a very touching, and well written novel that is a very fast read. I found it extremely hard to put down. There are many plot twists and countless surprises as you follow Kelson and his most trusted allies along on their journeys. Ms. Kurtz makes sure that you won't be dissapointed."},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"It was simply indescribable to be immersed again in Kurtz' fabulous deryni series. I hadn't thought that she was intending to write another novel about Kelson, but I am overjoyed that she did. this book ties up many of the loose ends left from &quot;The Quest for Saint Camber&quot;, though I won't spoil anything for you, and still makes an exellent story on its own. Full of romance, action and plenty of political intrigue, &quot;King Kelson's Bride&quot; is sure to satisfy your tastes no matter what they are. If you've read the other books in the series (if you havn't I HIGHLY recommend them) there is no way you can afford to pass it up."},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"The long awaited book has arrived. Book is fairly well written, Ms Kurtz definitely hasn't lost her touch with her world even after 6 years. She nicely resolves several ongoing plot lines from her previous books and opens at least one or two for future stories. While I can't say the book was worth the wait- the book just doesn't seem as tightly written as her second Kelson series, it is an enjoyable read and most fans should be pleased. Hopefully we won't have to wait another 6 years before she returns to this wonderful land."},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"The Deryni realm continues to be a favorite place for escape throughout the past 20 years. King Kelson's Bride (KKB) has been no different. Usually, Katherine Kurtz weaves tales of wonder amidst tragedy, however, this book really is a love story more than anything else. After waiting 10 years for more of King Kelson from the author I appreciated her willingness to let Kelson deal with getting a new bride and actually enjoying the process (for the most part). Gone is the utter unmistakably, heart-wrenching Deryni woes that we have often seen (and loved) in Katherine Kurtz's previous books, but this does not detract from KKB at all. In fact, it makes me appreciate the writing expertise of Kurtz more and more as she (and I) both grow older. This is, in fact, what we see in KKB in the characters as well. They are a bit older, wiser, and more crafty than when they were younger. This appeal assists their goals, ambitions, statesmanship, and provides us with a very enjoyable, wonderful conclusion (for the time being) of the King Kelson series. If you are not familiar with the Deryni universe, this would not be the book to start off with. If you a long time Deryni devotee, you will appreciate Katherine Kurtz's latest foray into the lives that we have all come to love. Keep 'em coming, Katherine Kurtz!"},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"A disappointing effort from Katherine Kurtz. She sloppily tries to tie up 3 or 4 plot lines from previous books about King Kelson, though suprisingly leaves this mess open for more Kelson books. That being said, I still devoured this novel greedily because of nostalgia for her earlier works. I found myself eagerly squeezing in moments of my day to read, but some things kept getting in the way of my full enjoyment. Here they are:1) The bad guys (Teymuraz &amp; Mahael) are really, really evil, about as scary as cartoon villains. The good guys are really, really good. King Kelson was nauseatingly earnest in everything he does. Some of the dialogue between King Kelson and Araxie practically made me gag. (see #3) 2) The dialogue: I think another reviewer said it best; the characters speak like diplomats or politicians. 3) The handling of King Kelson's betrothal and marriage to Araxie in a matter of about 60 pages. It reads like a Danielle Steele novel. Ick. 4) The tedious descriptions of clothing and the rituals, both Deryni and religious. I guess this has always been one of Kurtz's hallmarks, but I have less tolerance for it now than when I was 14.If you want to see Kurtz at her best, go back to the Camber of Culdi series, or even the Heirs of Saint Camber series."},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"In this latest installment in the chronicles of the young Deryni king, King Kelson is juggling problems on both political and personal fronts. His Deryni ward, Liam-Lajos of Torenth is ready to assume his throne, and Kelson plans to accompany him to the ceremony. The journey to Torenth, and the ceremony itself are dangerous as Liam's uncles are unlikely to release the power of the regency willingly. Kelson suspects treachery from Mahael, Liam's regent, and is uncertain whether to trust the seemly decent younger uncle, Matyas. In the midst of all this political intrigue is the ongoing pressure for Kelson to marry and produce an heir. All of his advisors are thrusting candidates his way, but Kelson is still pining for Rothana. In the last book of the series, Kelson fell in love with the Deryni princess, but when Kelson came up missing and presumed dead, Rothana married his cousin Conall. Conall was later executed for treason, but Rothana refuses to remarry, leaving Kelson bereft. As &quot;King Kelson's Bride&quot; plunges Kelson back into the marriage game, Rothana is still very much at the center of Kelson's marital plans, but this time as the matchmaker rather than the match. If &quot;King Kelson's Bride&quot; were the first Deryni novel I ever read, I probably would have liked it a whole lot more. It's an entertaining story, and anything set in Kurtz's richly detailed world of the Deryni is always worth reading. King Kelson's Bride's weaknesses, such as they are, are a result of Kurtz's wonderful characterizations. Her characters have been so real and so compelling in the earlier books, that when they didn't behave the way I've come to expect them to in &quot;King Kelson's Bride&quot;, I was disappointed. While it was inevitable that the younger generation, Kelson and Dhugal, would eventually become the focus of the Deryni series, I never thought that Morgan and Duncan, the heroes of the earlier books, would be reduced to the roles of extras as they have been in this book. Duncan is barely mentioned in passing and Morgan, while present and accounted for in many scenes, is nothing more than a prop without any personality at all. Even Dhugal is nothing more than a cardboard cutout in this book. All of this would not be so disappointing if the heroes of old were replaced by equally engrossing new heroes. But while King Kelson remains an admirable hero in his political activities, he becomes a far less appealing character as a potential bridegroom. Kelson spends MUCH too much time whining over his lost love with Rothana, transforming him from a self-possessed, noble young monarch into a pouting lovesick teenager. It is difficult to believe that the same man who managed to take the throne at fourteen and face all he did to keep it, would really be reduced to a pathetic puppy who hangs on Rothana's every word-including letting her pick who he is to marry. Even more annoying is Gwynedd's biggest busybody herself, Princess Rothana. She doesn't want to marry Kelson, but she has it all planned who should. I never really liked Rothana's character to begin with, but once she married Conall, her central position in the Deryni story should have been over. Instead, she's still right in the center of things, elbowing Kelson's true intended out of the spotlight. The future bride herself, Araxie, is portrayed to be smart and savvy. But if she's so strong, how come she puts up with Kelson and Rothana? Last of the less than compelling characters of the book is Kelson's mother Jehana. In previous books, she was always portrayed the same way-deeply guilt-ridden because of her Deryni heritage and fanatically against anyone else who is Deryni. She gave up the love of her husband and remained distant from her son because she could not reconcile their support of the Deryni with her beliefs. While it never made her the most lovable character in the world, at least Jehana had always been true to herself. I found it unbelievable that in &quot;King Kelson's Bride&quot;, she does a complete and surprisingly abrupt about face-not out of love for her son or in the memory of her beloved husband, but for a total stranger. If you can ignore all the out of character behavior from Kelson and Jehana, and the unfortunately in character, but annoying, behavior of Rothana, the rest of the story is quite enjoyable. The intrigue around Liam and his uncles keeps the plot moving beyond the constant marital whining and provides the expected twists involving Deryni magic. This is actually quite a good book; only by being spoiled by previous novels have I come to expect a GREAT book, and thus my disappointment. If you are a fan of the series, you will certainly want to pick up this book, follow the latest in Gwynedd and Torenthi politics, and see Kelson married at last. It isn't the best Deryni novel, but even a lesser Deryni novel is better than many other fantasies. If you have never read a Deryni book before, certainly do not start here. Go back to the beginning and start with &quot;Deryni Rising&quot;. Though Kurtz's writing style has matured since then, the early books are wonderful and you'll want to start from the beginning. You'll probably end up here anyway, because to start is to become engrossed in the whole series, but by then you'll be ready to settle for finally seeing Kelson married as well."},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"I've been a big fan of Ms. Kurtz' work since I was 13, when I picked up a copy of 'Deryni Archives', the short stories that go along with the whole Deryni Universe. I then had to go back and read the actual books that the 'Archives' stories fit between, and it was a joy and pleasure. I reread 'The Quest for St. Camber' at least once a year; it's my most favorite!Like the rest of her fans, I've suffered through the loss of many a good man or woman in the series, and hung on the edge of my seat when danger was afoot in the land of Gwynnedd. I was very happy to pick up this book after so long! However, if I could give it two sets of ratings--one for being yet another wonderful glimpse into this universe that's dear to my heart, and another for not quite being the satisfying read the others were--then I would.I count Ms. Kurtz among the people who inspire me most (I'm an aspiring author myself), and it was lovely to finally have Kelson get something he wanted, rather than watch it slip out of his grasp yet again (how many times can we torture the poor guy?), but the dynastic twists of the Haldane family and the equally befuddling House of Torenth bogged it way down for me. I liked seeing Liam come into his own (like a certain young Haldane at his age!), but I'm really looking forward to learning more about Queen Araxie. Maybe Rothana will finally find some peace, too.I understand that Kelson may not fall deeply in love with his Queen--kings and queens do not necessarily marry for love, you know--so I wasn't surprised that he is merely content with his bride, and is willing to learn to love her. Although, with the exception of Nigel and Meraude and Alaric and Richenda, bad things seem to happen to the couples who love deeply (witness Maryse and Duncan, Kevin and Bronwyn, Rhys and Evaine, Rhys Michael and Michaela, etc.)It's true; I was waiting for the moment I threw down the book and mourned for a favorite character, but it never came. It all seemed very nervous, however--that's the tone of this book, nervous. Nervous at the Torenthi situation, nervousness at the selecting and wooing of Kelson's bride.I know we all wished for Kelson to find happiness. Just goes to show you: be careful what you wish for--you just might get it!"},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"This book is dissapointingly unlike Kurtz's other Deryni novels. The intrigue, magic, style and depth and style of her earlier works is missing. At times I found myself wondering if Kurtz even wrote this book. That, or was just a contractual obligation and she didn't really want to write it? The earlier Deryni novels are much better written, and this one does not come up to the same standard. Kurtz's previous Deryni novels are like stepping into a whole other world. This one is a lot like stepping into a tired and trite romance novel."},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"Katherine Kurtz might not be the best living fantasy writer, but it's hard to come up with many names to put ahead of her. Kurtz's Deryni series is so good that when a new novel is published, I buy it without hesitating. Kurtz simply writes some of the best medieval fantasy on the shelves.Having said that, &quot;King Kelson's Bride&quot; was not one of her best efforts. For Kurtz, that just means it was good instead of great. The novel reads like a fairly long epilogue to the previous book &quot;Quest For Saint Camber.&quot; In the book, Kelson and company pretty much wrap up the lingering issues from the series and bring things to a mostly happy conclusion. While we have a couple of villains, none of the bad guys approaches previous evil doers like Loris or Gorony.The plot of the novel is two-fold. Kelson, the very decent and likable King of Gwenedd, needs to find a wife to beget heirs. This is a more difficult task than one would suspect because of the emotional and political reasons. Kelson's first two would-be brides were murdered and stolen, respectively. If the man isn't eager to try again, who can blame him? The second plot thread is Kelson's attempt to help his vassal and new friend Liam take the throne of Torenth from some scheming evil Deryni (sorcerers). No wars here, but some cunning and murder, of course.Part of the problem is after six books, Kelson has pretty much cleared the scene of good villains. Virtually every one of note left is tolerant and decent. Even Kelson's shrewish mother seems to be easing her prejudices in her old age. It is great to see characters we have grown so attached to doing so well, but an occasional battle and a few more moments of tension might have made this a more compelling story. But then, how many times can Kelson be jilted at the alter.If what I have written above leads you to believe this is a bad book, ignore it. This is a good book. I might even say a very good book. But if you have read any of the previous novels, you already knew that."},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"After two previous matrimonial disasters, Kelson Haldane, King of Gwynedd, *finally* marries in 'King Kelson's Bride'. His first fiancee was murdered at the altar. His second fiancee, Rothana, ended up marrying someone else, his first cousin Conall, then being widowed almost immediately. Needless to say, the young king has been under immense pressure to marry someone, anyone suitable, and procreate, given the unstable political situation. Now, he does. Who is she? That I won't tell you. Let's just say, she's 'suitable' and surprising. Kelson's friends and family members are all here too, with some other surprises along the way, and the Camberian council is muddying the waters in their unique fashion, to add more complications to the plot.Katherine Kurtz has done it again with a book that mixes realpolitik, magic and medieval Christianity. Her fans will be delighted. As I predicted, I stayed up all night to read this one. You will too."},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"The Deryni books and, in particular, the Histories of King Kelson were some of the most enjoyable fantasy I had ever read. Like many fans, I looked forward to this book, especialy after so many years of hoping that Kurtz would write just one more book about Kelson. Well. Sadly, it appears to be true that an author can spend so much time away from their own story that they simply lose touch with what made the story great to begin with. The high points were that Kelson is presented as maturing in a realistic manner and the descriptions of Torenth and Torenthi ritual are very well written. Rothana's motivations for her actions can be believed; she is actually interesting for the most part. The low points - everything else. Araxie is a bland, cookie-cutter queen, Nigel has a scene where we find out hey, he is just a softie after all...awww! Morgan and Duncan are pretty much absent. Does Liam ever have any second thoughts about the Haldane alliance? Dunno. The story could have been a lot stronger. The setup and structure of the story seemed to indicate early on that Kurtz did not intend this story to be just a bit of fluff to simply have the fans attend a nice wedding. I expected more and I am sad to say that Kurtz did not deliver at all with this weak story. This book is still on my shelf but will most likely never be read again."},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"I had written a dramatically negative review of this novel, but after reading it again just recently, I have to confess that it wasn't as bad as I thought. It's certainly well-written, but seems to lack the gritty texture of previous Deryni novels. I think one of the main problems with this book is that it takes place 3 years after \\"Quest for Saint Camber.\\" At the end of QSB, the readers are left with a sense of expectation for later action, resolution of the romantic tension between Kelson and Rothana, and the promise of more adventure with Kelson and Dhougal. I thought that Kelson and Dhougal would continue their search for Saint Camber artifacts and that Kelson had put aside his feelings for Rothana in order to seek out the truth. For instance, what was he going to do about that vision he saw riding with Dhougal in the last chapter? Was he going to look in Transha for answers? Were he and Dhougal going to continue their quest? When we return to Gwynnedd, in \\"King Kelson's Bride,\\" we discover that he hasn't done any of what he promised. Although he has begun to execute some of the laws that would create a new school for the Deryni and obviously continued his study and practice in the occult arts, he seems to have been mired by his longing for Rothana. As if his future has been on hold for 3 years, all because he wouldn't give her up. That is perhaps the greatest disappointment of this novel. Kelson's feelings for Rothana aren't exactly justified because we don't know how he allowed those feelings to linger during the past 3 years. Did he continue to court her, and did she somehow give him hope? Was she indecisive about her feelings also? Was that why she allowed him to cling to her for so long? Another loose end that wasn't tied up in QSB was the mysterious absence of Bishop Arilan when Kelson returned to Rhemuth and confronted Conall and his subsequent reappearance after the duel arcane. Could the mysterious Saint Camber vision have been a product of a very real intervention by a certain agency? I'm also disappointed that Dhougal, Morgan, and Duncan played such limited although relevant roles in KKB. The more characters and actions you add to a story, the more diluted the characterizations become. Sure, action keeps the readers turning pages, but in the end, we turned the pages a little quickly. The pacing was off at the end, too hurried, and the resolution itself was anticlimactic and all too pat. It's a happy ending, I suppose, so different from previous Deryni novels. But it just wasn't up to the level. Although there's hints of more story to be told, in terms of another evil Torenthi plot, the plot isn't as interesting. Since I'm pretty confident that it will all be resolved in due time, I don't much care how it happens. It's also rather strange how Liam started to sound like another familiar 14-year-old king at the end, so mature for his age. Kelson's rise to power was really quite unique. What was interesting about Kelson's Deryni stories were the moral complexities, the constant tests of conscience, the conflict between duty and desire. And there was something special about \\"Deryni Rising\\" that isn't quite present in this latest addition to the Deryni universe. It's as if our beloved characters have become secondary to the plot. I guess readers were waiting to find out how Kelson got married, but I think I would have been happier not knowing, instead just hoping, imagining his future, and savoring the special moments in the earlier, historically relevant texts."},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"It is always a pleasure to return to the world of Gwynnedd. I came to this series a few years ago, while I was in my twenties, and I was pleased with the matuirty with which Ms. Kurtz handled her themes and characters. That being said, one of the great attractions of the series, was the author's skilled descriptive style, and her clear appreciation for things medieval, mixed with mastery of the convnetions of heroic fantasy. These strengths continue in &quot;King Kelson's Bride&quot;. What is missing, however, is Ms. Kurtz's ability to starkly draw conflict. Her plot sails smoothly along, with King Kelson rather easily implementing all of his plans,with the almost universal compliance of every other character, both major and minor. Even the villains, seem curiously unexercised. In fact, they are overcome rather easily. All in all, everything seems to fall into place a little to conveniently for a Gwynned novel. I never had the sense that almost anything could happen, as I did in Kurtz's previous efforts in this series. Therefore, this lastest novel feels a little sweet and airy. A good read, but not up to her usual standards. If this is, in fact, our last visit with King Kelson, it seems an anti climactic and half hearted (if sweet) way to close out this series."},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"Fascinating.this offering from Kurtz reads fine as a stand alone novel.How can I mention, without sounding soppy, that I cried for CHAPTERS of this book? You will find yourself so deeply involved with the characters that tears are inevitable, but it is not a particularly tragic book. As I had not read the previous books for some while, I found myself more in sympathy with Kelsons proposed bride, than his &quot;one true love and soulmate later revealed not to be so true or so souly&quot;.So although in parts it leaves you dry throated and wet eyed, it has moments of glorious triumph and humor.You have to read it, if you haven't already."},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"I did enjoy this book, although I must admit that I hesitated to pick it up for quite some time. Being accustomed to frequent torture, death, heartbreak, and general grim reality in the previous novels of this series I felt the need to prepare myself for the next installment. Imagine my surprise when good things happened to the characters, not just once but throughout the book! Upon reflection, I would say that I enjoyed the book but found it to be quite a bit lighter than those that came before. The characters don't suffer; even Kelson's anguish as he selects a bride for logical rather than emotional reasons is a bit forced. Is this the final installation, the tying off of all the lose ends?"},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"It seems I waited forever to be able to purchase and read a copy of KING KELSON'S BRIDE...and boy, was I disappointed! The characters didn't seem as rich and full and vibrant as they had been in Katherine's previous novels. Morgan and Duncan, especially, were quite pale in comparison to their former selves in other novels, and even Kelson didn't seem to have much of a spark at times. The talk of all the royal marriages confused me after a while--I couldn't keep track of who was to wed whom. I liked the fact that Jehana has started to live again, rather than continuing to sequester herself away and be so morbid and angry all the time. All in all, I was quite unsatisfied by the time I finished the book, especially as I've feasted on the literary wonders from Katherine in the past and was expecting more of the same. Maybe her SECOND novel in this series will be better."},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"Yet again, Katherine Kurtz does a superb job bringing her Medieval-styled world and characters to life. In this volume, Kurtz skillfully weaves political intrigue surrounding the return of King Liam to Torenth with Kelson's inner turmoil over increasing pressure to choose the queen Gwynedd needs. The conflict between Kelson the man, who cannot marry the woman he loves, and Kelson the King, who must marry for the good of his realm, is a poignant one, but given that three years have elapsed since the \\"Quest for Saint Camber,\\" Kelson's despair is excessive. The first two-thirds of the novel are devoted primarily to the Torenthi angle, contributing numerous plot twists and developments to make for a page-turning tale leading up to an impressive climax. The last third of the book serves as the calm before the final storm, focusing on the arrangement of love-blessed, political marriages. While possibly important to future storylines, the negotiations themselves slow the novel, and it was the undercurrent of danger threatening to erupt which kept me reading. Unfortunately, the final climax failed to match the drama and intensity of its predecessor, offering only a brief skirmish that was quickly subdued. The novel closes with a royal wedding that finally breaks Kelson's bad luck with women (you could say he finally gets lucky!). \\"King Kelson's Bride\\" overall was engaging and well written. We are introduced to new characters and reacquainted with old ones, although some which featured prominently in prior novels (Morgan, Duncan, and Dhugal) play small roles here. Of all the characters, Kelson receives the majority of attention and is shown to be extremely capable (too much so for me): he is powerful magically, a skilled negotiator, handsome, honorable, intelligent, perceptive, and popular. He seems too perfect, and I disliked how he manipulated Nigel and Rothana to do what he wanted. Kelson's bride similarly beams perfection, although she came across as quite likable. I must confess to a roguish hope that she might have had a dark side! Quibbles aside, though, this was still a good book!"},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"Katherine Kurtz's King Kelson's Bride is wonderful, worthy of the tradition that began with Deryni Rising. SO MANY of the unresolved issues Kelson has lived with through six novels are dealt with in thoughtful, unexpected, and awesome ways. Of course, the flavor of the middle-ages continues to shine through, as the reader learns more about Torenth, moorish magic, and Haldane lineage. The only thing haunting the reader is the possibility that there will not be another Deryni novel...please let that not be true!"},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"I thought that &quot;King Kelson's Bride&quot; was incredibly well-written, more so than previous novels in the Deryni Chronicles and the Histories of King Kelson. I started reading the Deryni books when I was in high school and now that I'm in my mid-twenties, I appreciate how the stories and the author's craft have developed. I only wish I could read more. While I was completely satisfied with Kelson's bride, I felt that there is more to the story of Gwynedd's succession and its Deryni legacy. I wanted to know how Teymuraz suddenly appeared in Rhemuth, how he was dealt with subsequently, and if the wedding between Cuan and Gwenliad progressed as anticipated. It would also be increasingly satisfying to see Araxie be invested with the Haldane powers and to finally reach a resolution on the matter of St. Camber himself. Everything so far is left to the imagination. Readers can only contrive a world in which Camber's heritage is fully restored through the work of King Kelson, his bride, and his allies. We have yet to acquire access to the possibilities that would unfold if more novels were to be written. This novel is a tease, although a wonderful and endearing one. On the other hand, I think that if the novel had been longer by 40 pages or so to appropriately deal with the Torenthi traitor and satisfyingly build the climax to Kelson's wedding, then I wouldn't have needed another book in this series. There's just so much going on here, and Kelson is such an amazing character, that I'm a little bit disappointed in leaving him and his world so early."},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"There is only one word to describe this book--amazing. I haved loved Kurtz's books since I started reading them back in the mid-80s. King Kelson's Bride does not disappoint. The characters are very 3 dimensional and you come to care for them as if they were flesh and blood people. You don't even need to have read all of Kurtz's previous work to enjoy this--I confess to having skipped around a little myself--but after finishing KKB you will want to go fill in those blanks (at least I do!)."},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"It's unfair (a) that the book is such a quick read, (b) that the development of some new, and interesting characters, crowded out some additional, secondary character development, and (c) that parts of the ending were a bit telegraphed. Having said this, there's very little not to like about the latest Deryni installment, far less somber than the &quot;historical&quot; period that Ms. Kurtz previously focused on. Definitely hope that the next installment does not take nearly as long to press."},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"Unfortunately after such a long wait, I dont think anything could have measured up to my expectations when Kelson finally found a bride. My disappointment was much like that of The Phantom Menace, &quot;I waited all this time for that?&quot; There is too much going on in this book, as one reviewer said, it would have worked better as a trilogy. With the new villan brought to justice and a full fledged wedding at the end. There is alot to like in this novel, in fact any visit to the Eleven Kingdoms is welcome, but it was just a let down towards the end. I gave this a four star because there is no 3.5 or 3.75 and I feel the book deserves better than just a flat 3.0. A good effort, just not her best."},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"A page turner, I thought that this book was not as good as the original three. (true classics) It also lacks the byzantine convulutions of last three Kelson books, however, and was a very enjoyable read. As per normal, the subplots make the book.This books also does not try to rewrite the previous books, so characters from previous books show up with little or no background. I personally find this pleasant, as I hate reading summaries of prior books in a new book, but it makes this less of a stand alone book.Dave"},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"After a hiatus of six years Katherine Kurtz returns to her most well-known and popular Deryni series in King Kelson's Bride. The action in the book revolves around two simple themes, the selection of a bride for Kelson, and the return of young Liam to the Kingdom of Torenth where he will be crowned king after several years of fosterage in King Kelson's court. But in the Eleven Kingdoms, nothing is ever that simple. For Kelson, in addition to being a young king, is also a member of the race of quasi-magical humans known as the Deryni who have been honored, respected, feared, reviled, and persecuted at various periods in the history of his kingdom of Gwynedd.Having two previous unsuccessful, and in fact tragic, failures in finding a bride, Kelson is motivated more by a sense of duty to his realm than of any real desire for marriage. But the machinations of various individuals putting forth candidates, and the ensuing deceptions and maneuverings, are one of the pleasures of book. Everyone in the Eleven Kingdoms seem to have an interest in his choice - some benign and some malevolent.While all this is going on, Kelson and members of his court are traveling to the Kingdom of Torenth where his young friend, Liam, will be invested with the crown as king. But the Torenthi royal family are also Deryni with a vast array of abilities at their disposal, and with a ruthlessness uncommon in the Kingdom of Gwynedd. The young king's uncles, whose brother was slain by Kelson in a magical duel, are not sure that they want their nephew, brought up in the court of Gwennyd, to be king. Some may even fancy that role for themselves. Treachery abounds!The author has often been praised for her attention to historical detail which adds to the richness of her work. But Ms. Kurtz also excels in her characterization and scene writing. Scenes of confrontation and crisis are always well-done, and this book is no exception. She obviously enjoyed writing the book, and seems to hope that her readers will enjoy it as well. While an obvious treat for her many long-time fans who will pick up on every nuance and discern future plot-lines , new readers will be able to pick up the book and read as a self-contained story. It is not planned as part of a trilogy and any previous history is brought out in the book itself. I recommend it most highly for Ms. Kurtz's current and future fans."},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"Oh, dear. I fear Ms. Kurtz may be falling victim to the Ongoing Series Syndrome that has struck many of her fellow genre authors. I hope this isn't the beginning of a &quot;churning it out&quot; trend.Her writing style is still snappy, and there were sufficient times when I bounced in my seat on the bus, anxious to finish an exciting scene before I arrived at work. Writing craft like that does not evaporate overnight from someone who has it in such abundance as Ms. Kurtz.Unfortunately, this book lacked what I've always admired in the previous Deryni novels--unrelenting power. She pulls her punches constantly in this book, never really letting anything *bad* happen, not permanently. In most of her previous books, a major character has either been killed off or seriously jeopardized to the point of major personality changes. There are scenes from earlier books I can practically recite, the events were so powerful and made such an impression.Not so, here. Everything wraps up a little too neatly. I don't object to a &quot;kinder, gentler author&quot;; however, I would prefer not to be jerked around. I kept getting all wound up, expecting the worst and...it never happened. Everything worked out &quot;nice.&quot; Oh, how I hate that word, &quot;nice,&quot; but it is, unfortunately, the only word that really suits.(SPOILER ALERT: I'm sorry, but Derry should not have survived this book. I'd have cried my eyes out, but his neat and clean redemption was so unsatisfying, particularly after such play-up of the PTSD he was suffering. Oh, and on that point: his state of mind is mostly *told* to the reader, never really shown or felt. Compare with the scenes from his POV in *High Deryni*, where we really feel how terrified he is of Wencit, and how shattered he is by being controlled and made to betray Morgan and Kelson. Now *that's* no-holds-barred writing!)"},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"In &quot;King Kelson's Bride,&quot; Katherine Kurtz once again returns to the saga of Kelson Haldane, this time focusing on the ethronement of his vassal king, Liam of Torenth, and his search for a new bride.This book had several excellent points. The cultural details and depiction of Torenth are excellent. Those in the &quot;buffer states&quot; of Orsal, Forcinn, etc. are fleshed out. Matyas in particular was an interesting, well-drawn character, and Liam very believable. I also enjoyed reading about Jehana's progression.However. All of Ms. Kurtz's recent books seem to suffer from a major flaw - the heros are models of perfection, the villians, evil, scheming demons without one redeeming quality. Camber had his share of flaws, as did Morgan, in her earlier works, but not Kelson. Frankly, the character of Conall was incredibly believable to me - who wouldn't react against a pair of self-righteous noble demi-gods like Kelson and Dhugal? I was sorry when Ms. Kurtz killed him off. Also, with the addition of so many characters, familiar, well-loved ones were reduced to cameo appearances - did Duncan even *speak* until the end of the book?As the Deryni Chronicles have progressed, one can see Ms. Kurtz's growth as a writer and historian: incidents are more fully fleshed out, descriptions more interesting and detailed, situations more complex. Unfortunately, her characters and plots have grown correspondingly less interesting. A good book with a good plot, but, I have to say, I agree with the other writer who misses Morgan and Duncan in their heyday."},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"I don't read nearly as much Fantasy as I used to. At one time I would read anything that purported to be high fantasy of any type. Those days are done. Now I have to force myself to pick a fantasy novel even if it is one that I am sure I will love. This was the case with \\"King Kelson's Bride\\". I pre-ordered the novel as soon as I saw it coming out because of my past love for the Deryni novels. After the book arrived in the mail I set it on the shelf for three months until I gathered the gumption to read it.I was mildly disappointed in this addition to the tales of King Kelson. The story was adequately told but not in the same powerful way that I became accustomed to in the other Deryni novels by Katherine Kurtz. The book really felt like two stories that each would have been better told in a novel of there own. The quest to get Liam installed on the throne and the accompanying climax seemed rushed and blas&eacute;. The second story of Kelson's marriage and the surrounding chaos seemed especially poorly written. The characters were in this book in name but not in action. Morgan did not act like Morgan. Duncan was a stick figure and Derry, who was a central figure in the last half, was cast with a cursory literary brush. Very disappointing.I found myself not caring what happened in these books and that never, ever happened to me in one of Katherine Kurtz' Deryni novels before. If this is what ten years wait brings us I don't think I will wait another ten. I would hope that Kurtz leaves well enough alone if she can't add further to the series or is she doesn't have the heart to spend the type of time on these books that they need. Read this one if you must but don't use it as an introduction to the Deryni universe."},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"The worst of the Deryini novels by far. I hate to give one of Ms. Kurtz's Deryini novels a bad review because her work has given me great pleasure over the years, but this novel stinks. Any one of her others in the series I'd give a 4 star rating at worst. Even the look of the cover has a look one wouldn't expect from this author--a cheesy romance. She has changed publishers. Could this have anything to do with the turn towards the worse her writing has taken? Normally her novels are serious page-turners for me, keeping me up to all hours of the morning, but I had to force myself over the course of several months to finish this one. If you are a fan go ahead and buy it; if new to the series, don't bother."},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"I first happily discovered the world of the wonderful Deryni in 1979 and adored the rich, dangerous, loving, powerful, and enigmatic, deliciously evil characters of this very talented writer. The last novel, &quot;Quest for Saint Camber&quot; (1986!) was a joy to read and I've been on pins and needles ever since, awaiting this new installment. I felt that &quot;Quest&quot; was not a whole novel, more like a Part 1. So.....I'm disappointed. Kelson and Dhugal are terrific characters, but I was left wanting - wanting more from the characters that once drove me to distraction - the very complex Morgan and Duncan. And poor Derry! He's always been a favourite, but once again he's become the scapegoat and his torment and his previous trials and tragedy because of his allegiance to Morgan and his King is not explored - and once again he's left in the dark. He deserved more. And the once powerful, devastatingly dangerous yet gentle and loving (as per earlier portrayals) Morgan has given way to a wishy washy, mediocre shadow of his former self. And what happened to Duncan? He barely spoke in this one and it was these characters who were instrumental...no, *they* put Kelson on the throne.I felt that the introduction of so many new characters was unnecessary. This rich world of the Deryni didn't need *new blood* so to speak. The older characters just needed a *voice*. The chemistry between the characters I knew and loved isn't there in this one. I miss them.After I finished reading &quot;King Kelson's Bride&quot; I was a little saddened so I re-read &quot;Deryni Checkmate,&quot; &quot;Deryni Rising,&quot; and &quot;High Deryni.&quot; They haven't lost their magic for me.The book is well written. It's just not what I wanted."},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"Perhaps Ms. Kurtz has mellowed over the last decade. After book after book (most notably &quot;King Javan's Year&quot;) in which death upon death upon torture upon yet more death would occur, this book represents a startling move towards positivity. Marriages are based on love. Certain kingdoms that have hated each other for generations become allies. Few fear or speak against the Deryni. And for the most part, only bad people die!While I enjoyed the book immensely, I did have the feeling that after the blood, sweat and tears Kurtz characters usually endure to effect even the most minor of changes, things were falling into place a little too easily. While I think the character of Araxie (Kelson's bride) was fleshed out fairly well, her penchant for always doing exactly the right thing in every situation hampered her character's believability.If this book is the first of a new Kelson trilogy (I hope!) we will most likely be back to the usual death and mayhem in the next installment. In the meantime, it was nice to see good things finally happen to good people."},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"Always good to have another Deryni book, however, after just having read the Heirs of Saint Camber Series, I can't help but wonder if Katherine Kurtz is getting soft in her slightly older age. In all the other series, it seems as though Mrs. Kurtz goes out of her way to make sure that freakishly bad things happen quite haphazardly, and often, to our heroes any time things are going well (just look at the last thirty pages of Camber the Heretic). But now she seems to have fallen in love with Kelson and decided that he deserved a break or two; she allows him to sail through all challenges with Eddingesqe ease. The only real danger in the book is easily thwarted, although this allows for the most satisfying part of the book (see below).Funnily, there isn't much bride in King Kelson's Bride, and the only wedding is not Kelson's. Morgan and crew are mostly absent from the book, and three years later, Kelson hasn't investigated the Camberian artifacts. However, tantalizingly, we begin to see some hint of the &quot;True&quot; Camberian Council that is described at the end of the Camber series and that not perhaps less was lost than is commonly thought, and all is forgiven. I hope that we see more of that developed in the coming books. I've certainly been waiting long enough."},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"After waiting since 1986 for Kurtz to return to Kelson and the plot threads left hanging in &quot;The Quest for Saint Camber&quot;, this book was a disappointment. Instead of following up on the quest for Camber, Kelson gets married. Granted, after the tragedy of Rothana, Kelson deserves some happiness, but this book felt rushed, almost as if Kurtz decided to stop writing Deryni novels all together and wrapped things up in one fell swoop. Kurtz has shown that she has a knack for tragedy, notably in &quot;King Javan's Year&quot;, and the previous series on Kelson tended to mix in a good part of that. If she continues this into a trilogy, let's hope she gets back to what she's good at."},{"Title":"King Kelson's Bride","review":"Katherine Kurtz doesn't seem to have had her heart in the Deryni books for many years. This book, which was written and then &quot;left hanging&quot; (sans sequel), seems to prove it. Compared to the subtle plot twists, action, and adventure of earlier books, the plot is fascile and the pace is slow.Fans of the Deryni books will probably read this volume anyway, eager for anything new on the topic. They will then endure a recap of events they vaguely remember from books read over a decade ago. Following this, all the characters talk and talk about who King Kelson will marry. Then they talk about talking about it. After the inevitable &quot;surprise Deryni ancestry&quot; revelations, the usual pack of fanatics and evil Deryni will try and thwart the wedding and will be defeated. Then King Kelson will marry the woman who was discussed and discussed.I was so excited that I decided not to wait another long span of years for another volume and gave up on KK after 30 years!"},{"Title":"Night Walker","review":"Hard Case Crime's line of crime novels is not just entertaining; it's also educational. Reading each one as it comes out has broadened by knowledge of hard-boiled crime fiction considerably -- a field in which I thought I was already well-versed. Those looking for more than just the same names over and over again (Chandler, Hammett, Woolrich, Cain, Thompson, etc.), need look no further than the yellow ribbon. I look forward to each new entry with eagerness. Who knew that educating oneself could be so much fun? (But then again, who else thinks of reading a series of crime novels as \\"educational\\"?)Night Walker is a reprint of an early novel by Donald Hamilton (who will turn 90 in 2006); one that doesn't feature his most famous creation, secret government agent Matt Helm, who Hamilton wrote about for over thirty years in almost thirty novels.Those who only know Hamilton's work from the series of Helm films starring Dean Martin may be surprised by the lack of blatant comedy, but they won't miss out on any of the international intrigue in this standalone nail-biting suspense thriller with plenty of tension to go around.Hitchhiking his way back to active duty in the Navy after only five years off (WWII ended in 1945, Korea began in 1950), Lieutenant David Young is given a much needed ride by Larry Wilson, a man with some subversive politics and a plan that involves Young, involuntarily. By the time Young realizes that he is a pawn in another man's game, he has awakened in a hospital bed with bandages covering his entire face, and with a new identity: Larry Wilson.It seems that Mrs. Wilson had some plans of her own ....Featuring wonderfully naturalistic dialogue with just the right amount of stammering repetition and hesitant stops and starts (one could call it Mamet-ian, if that weren't shamefully anachronistic), Night Walker moves along at a satisfying pace. The plotline is nicely complicated, and shows a real feel for the period (though it is a little too politically focused for my taste).Hamilton also makes some interesting choices in Night Walker that make it more than just your average crime novel. First, he has all his major characters refer to each other by nicknames of sorts; \\"Sailor,\\" \\"Red,\\" \\"Honey,\\" and others are bandied about as if these people weren't being completely betrayed by each other left and right, leading to a familiarity that instantly connected me to them. Also, there's a fascinating MacGuffin that I was trying to suss out the significance of for several chapters. I thought I had figured out pretty soon (thinking I had an advantage due to my familiarity with acrostics), but which had nothing whatsoever to do with the rest of the plot.On a related note, the kinetic cover art by Tim Gabor seems at first to be a little ... well, silly (is that Claude Rains under there?), but it actually illustrates one of the more shocking scenes in the novel. Who that gun belongs to and its connection to the other characters is at the heart of what keeps Night Walker's pages turning well into the night and makes it yet another fine addition to the Hard Case Crime curriculum."},{"Title":"Night Walker","review":"Anyone well-versed in hardboiled fiction knows the name Donald Hamilton. Anyone who loves tough-guy fiction SHOULD know the name Donald Hamilton. Now Hard Case Crime gives you the chance to get acquainted with one of the giants of tough guy fiction. Hamilton, the creator of Matt Helm, writes prose that leaps of the page and stangles you!And Night Walker is no exception. Here you have a man picked up hitchiking who winds up in a hospital room, his face bandaged and everyone from doctors to family members thinking he's someone else. Hamilton keeps the tension high as slowly but surely the details come out and a deadly conspiracy unfolds. This taut little tale grabs the reader from the opening page and doesn't let up until the last line. A true classic of the genre too-long out of print!Don't let the hideously lame Matt Helm movies turn you off of Hamilton's work. Aside from the name and a few plot elements, the movies had nothing to do with the original novels. Hamilton is as tough as they come and Night Walker is a prime example of one of the all-time greats at his best. Night Walker is not to be missed!"},{"Title":"Night Walker","review":"This is the first book by Hamilton I have read. Despite wanting to love this book, it just wasn't very good. The plot is simple, the characters are weak, and the conclusion is, well, hard to believe. After reading the book, I felt as though it was a waste of time. There was nothing memorable or redeeming (or suspenseful, for that matter) about the book. I'm going to try some of his other works to get a more balanced view. Perhaps this was simply not his best piece of writing."},{"Title":"Night Walker","review":"With an unusually small cast of characters, Donald Hamilton's 1954 thriller still manages to deliver a taut and surprising climax. This despite the pedestrian nature of the novel's middle section. Although \`Night Walker' is never less than readable, it is not one of the better entries into the Hard Case Crime series.The novel's hero is David Young, a reluctant re-recruit to the US Navy. Having emerged from an attempt on his life to find himself in a hospital bed with his face swathed in bandages, Young is startled to find that he is being addressed by his would-be murderer's name. Furthermore, his attacker's wife plays nursemaid to him at her home where Young is taken to recuperate. While there, Young becomes more convinced that the man who attacked him still lurks close by.For a good portion of this story, the lead character's face is hidden by bandages. This adds to the claustrophobic atmosphere that the author evokes. Young's injuries preclude him from venturing very far; much of the story unwinds over a relatively small location. Unfortunately, these narrow margins have a stifling effect on the story. The main female character, Elizabeth, is the wife of Young's attacker. Naturally, during the course of the story, she and Young become quite close. This burgeoning relationship, although inevitable in terms of storytelling, is a little grating. She is from Georgia, a fact that is reiterated with monotonous regularity by her use of the phrase, \\"I declare.\\"I also found the baddies' motives to be ambiguous although this may just be a sign of the times. There are hints of Communist activities and treason, which, in 1954 may have had more sinister overtones than they would from today's perspective."},{"Title":"Night Walker","review":"I really thought I'd probably read this book the first time around. I certainly read a lot of Hamilton's non-Matt Helm books when they were first new, but this story didn't ring any particular bells for me. Nevertheless, it was enjoyable reading all the way through. Maybe having lived through that era of Communist paranoia renders the story more believable now, when other forms of paranoia are even more rampant.It's wonderfully well-written, with enticing, believable characters and a plot that makes as much or more sense as anything newer, so what's not to like? To be sure, I was a bit taken aback by the ending, but it's merely one variation of many that were possible. Really, I think it's a 4 1/2 star book.Kudos to Hard Case Crime for keeping these older gems polished and lively!"},{"Title":"Night Walker","review":"I would give this three and a half stars, if I could. This novel takes the Cold War paranoia and spy stories of its era and transmutes them into something more personal and more hard-boiled, with only the slightest nod to \\"Commies\\" or whatever. It also confuses the reader as to whether it'll be the kind of noir story where the hero comes through and ends the story alive, or the kind where he doesn't and he dies, so there was some real suspense in there, for me, as to how it would end. ...more I would give this three and a half stars, if I could.

The book isn't anything groundbreaking, it plays with great ideas but doesn't necessarily go anywhere amazing with them, but it's still definitely worth your time if you're a fan of the genre."},{"Title":"Night Walker","review":"A pleasant and distracting novel from Donald Hamilton, the creator of the Matt Helm series of novels (which were made into campy Bond style movies starring Dean Martin).The premise of a bandaged nobody mistaken for a US soldier who commited treason is intreguing and for the most part quite well done, but the pace of the novel is a little behind the times and you may find yourself trudging through character developement which would be quickly established in a modern novel, but if you can forgive this little minus, then you should have some fun reading ahead.As for the edition itself, I must nominate this for the worse HCC cover so far. Tim Gabor's style is unsuitable for the subject matter and unworthy to stand next to the other great covers in the series."},{"Title":"Night Walker","review":"As a matter of fact, he does, though he's not writing now. For those who cut their teeth on Matt Helm novels or any of the other great genre fiction which he produced, it's a great treat to have this reprint of a 1954 novel. Thank you, Hard Case Crime. Night Walker is a pure genre fiction confection--a case of stolen identity with a good-hearted, slightly tarnished hero, a femme fatale or two, and some vintage postwar baddies.There are also some classic Hamilton touches--his traditional views of and observations on female dress and makeup, e.g. and a climax on the sea. For many years Hamilton has purchased and refurbished boats as a sideline and he knows them well. While reading Night Walker I thought of an old Hamilton favorite, The Mona Intercept. Anyway, here's some fresh Donald Hamilton to savor. Enjoy. And for those of you discovering him for the first time--you have a real treat in store. Years ago I read that he had sold over17,000,000 paperback originals. Read Night Walker and learn why."},{"Title":"Night Walker","review":"While it's understandable that Hard Case Crime would eventually want to reprint a Hamilton novel due to his great successes in and out of the mystery field, Night Walker is just not up to par with previous titles in the publisher's catalogue.The story is slow, full of tremendous leaps in logic, and has areas of such lengthy exposition that the book grinds to a total standstill several times. The villain's explanation at the end of the novel, tying up every loose end of the plot, goes on page after page after page. The book also features a southern belle who starts nearly every bit of her dialogue with \\"Well, I declare!\\" Think I'm kidding? Count it up yourself, I bet she's got at least 100 \\"I declares!\\" in there. That's not characterization, it's just sloppy writing."},{"Title":"Night Walker","review":"A friend turned me on to Hard Case Crime books and this is the first one I read. I could not figure how a writer could write an entire book about a man with a bandaged face mistaken for a dead man while taken in by the dead man's wife. But Donald Hamilton pulled it off. I had trouble putting the book down and still keep thinking about it.What I also liked, beside the interesting characters, was the way the writer kept switching thing, neat twists and turns. I don't want to give away the plot any more but this is a very good book."},{"Title":"Night Walker","review":"I love this Hard Case Crime series, however... you just cant expect to agree with everything the editors piecing together these books decides upon.First of all, and foremost when talking about Night Walker, this is a cold-war/anti-communist thriller that comes from a simpler time. So you have to approach this story with your mind in an earlier era when patriotism meant having different values than today. All in all, Night Walker is a very simple story. A man hitch-hiking one night is picked up by someone who tries to off him and steal his identity. This is the first of several 'stretches' i didn't like. It would have been very easy for the protagonist, David Young, to have been killed here. Instead he miraculously survives and wakes up to have his face totally bound with bandages. Everyone thinks he is someone else.I wont give away the plot here, just say that its kind of silly, never taught with tension, and in the end you might be left groaning over its story line as was I.This is also the first Donald Hamilton book that I have read. Not sure I would pick up another if they are all like this."},{"Title":"Night Walker","review":"I like HARD CASE CRIME. I love it. I love that they not only publish superb new fiction, but also reprints of classics by such authors as Cornell Woolrich, Lawrence Block, and Charles Williams. Which is why I can't understand why they would reprint this very far-fetched and dated pulp about a guy who, very stupidly, gets involved with a strange mix of desperate characters with an even more desperate plot.Without spoiling anything (and it's hard to even use that term here because if you read the first 50 pages you can figure out the ending for yourself) I'll try to sum this book up for you. It seemed like Donald Hamilton tried to play off the big \\"red scare\\" of the '50s and incorporate this halfcocked premise into a thriller about a naval reserve officer (who isn't much of a hero or anti-hero, but just a guy thrown into a bizarre situation) who is hitchhiking to his base and wakes up in the hospital with bandages on his face and an annoying southern belle who's referring to him as her husband.The southern belle is easily one of the most poorly written characters I've ever read. You know how you know she's from Georgia? In NIGHT WALKER she says \\"I declare\\" and \\"I reckon\\" more times than Samuel L Jackson lets off f-bombs in his flicks. Apparently she's very dirty too (not sexually...of course she's a tramp, but she also wears dirty clothes and such)...not appealing at all. Less appealing is the other female in the book: a red-headed tomboy who doesn't let anyone do anything for her. Between her and the trashy southern belle who considers the kitchen her only TRUE place, I don't think Donald Hamilton had a high regard for women at this time.Considering the majority book is back and forth between the southern belle and the naval reserve officer, it's all very uninteresting until you get to the final three chapters and everything is revealed in the only action packed scene in the book. I honestly can't understand why this was reprinted at all. I'm sure one of Donald Hamilton's Matt Helm books would have been a more fitting and interesting addition to the line.The only plus side is I finished this one in less than a day, so it moves pretty quickly. Which is good cause you really don't want to stay with it for too long."},{"Title":"Night Walker","review":"The excellent, gripping first chapter of NIGHT WALKER is sadly the best part of the book. The tale slows down considerably and shifts into a rather muddled mess afterward. A Navy officer is called back to active duty and gets a ride while hitchhiking only to be attacked by his presumed samaritan. With a battered, bandaged face he is forced to play the role of his attacker, a ruse he goes along with for no good reason other than the fact that he just doesn't want to go back into the military.A vague mystery unfurls as he's drawn into a web of deceit by his \\"wife\\", a nefarious doctor, and his innocent neighbor who suspects the truth but doesn't know what to do about it. There's some hooey about communists, drop-off points for Washington attaches, and other dubious plot points, but the worst is the psychological hokum used to explain away a major contrivance."},{"Title":"Night Walker","review":"So far this is my least favorite of the Hard Case Crime books that I've read (of 12, I believe).

The information always quoted was to say the least, inspiring and insightful, so, I knew one day I would have to own Dr. Clarke's great commentary on the Bible. The unfortunate news of that the abridger, Ralph Earle, has removed extremely important information such as the correct order of chapters of the book of Jeremiah which is NOT the way it appears in our current Old Testament, and the 39 verses in 1 Samuel which are of doubtful authenticity and which didn't appear in the original text.

The unfortunate news is that the abridger Ralph Earle has removed extremely important information such as the correct order of chapters of Jeremiah (which are incorrect in our current Bibles), as well as the 39 verses in 1 Samuel which are of doubtful authenticity, and should not have been included in the Holy Bible account. The book get three stars because I wanted to give Dr. Adam Clarke his deserved praise, but not a five star rating because of the irresponsible job done by Ralph Earle. We should all seek out the original 3-book series, or if out-of-print, search for the unabridged version on CD-Rom."},{"Title":"Adam Clarke's Commentary","review":"This commentary is an insightful analysis of the Bible. It has given me a new perspective on many of the meanings of the books of the Bible, and of the background of the people whom God spoke through in writing the books of the Bible."},{"Title":"Adam Clarke's Commentary","review":"Adam Clarke was once considered a dunce, yet he learned twenty languages. He overcame his fears to become the most able biblical scholar of his time in the English-speaking world. When he died the Conference recorded in its minutes, \\"No man is any age of the church, was ever known for so long a period, to have attracted larger audiences.\\" Three times Clarke was elected president of the British Conference of the Methodist Church.Yet Clarke is known primarily for his commentary on the entire Bible. Before he began the commentary, he translated the whole Bible from the original languages. Unlike W. B. Godbey who dictated his random thoughts to a secretary, Clarke spent thirty years of hard work on his commentary.Milton S. Terry wrote in 1885 that next to Matthew Henry, no commentary of similar scope and magnitude \\"has had a wider circulation or is better known than the commentary of Adam Clarke.\\"From the first edition which quickly sold out in 1810, his commentary has remain in print until the present. However, in 1967, Ralph Earle produced a one volume abridged edition. Earle stated that dated or extraneous material was eliminated and I would concede that the commentary does contain extraneous material. My concern is that Earle has omitted Clarke's teaching at one significant point while claiming to allow \\"the great scholar to speak for himself.\\"In the Preface Earle claims \\"the actual words of Adam Clarke have not been changed, except to modernize the language and to abbreviate where appropriate.\\" Judge for yourself.At Ezekiel 36:27 Earle omits one half of one page, including Clarke's comment that \\"true Christians are those who are filled with the nature and Spirit of Christ.\\"Jesus said in John 3:5, \\"Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.\\" Clarke wrote,Reader, hast thou never had any other baptism than that of water? If thou hast not had any other, take Jesus Christ's word for it, thou canst not, in thy present state, enter into the kingdom of God. I would not say to thee merely, read what it is to be born of the Spirit: but pray, pray to God incessantly, till He give thee to feel what is implied in it! Remember, it is Jesus only who baptizes with the Holy Ghost. He who receives not this baptism has neither right nor title to the kingdom of God; nor can he with any propriety be termed a Christian, because that which essentially distinguished the Christian dispensation from that of the Jews was, that its author baptized all His followers with the Holy Ghost.Ralph Earle omitted this entire paragraph.Where Jesus teaches His disciples that the Holy Spirit is with them and will be in them (John 14:17), Clarke explains:It is certain the Holy Spirit was not yet given to the disciples so as to dwell in them; this St. John himself assures us, 7:39. And it is evidently of that Spirit and its influences, which was not given till the day of pentecost, that our Lord here speaks.Ralph Earle has omitted this paragraph.At Acts 2:28 Peter preached, \\"Repent, and be baptized everyone of you in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of sins; and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.\\" Clarke points out:In reference to the remission or removal of sins: baptism pointing out the purifying influences of the Holy Spirit; [and it is in reference to that purification that it is administered, and should in consideration never be separated from it. For baptism itself purifies not the conscience; it only points out the grace by which this is to be done. If ye faithfully use the sign, ye shall get the substance.]Clarke is making a connection between Spirit baptism and water baptism (see also Clarke's Christian Theology, 255). Earle omits everything bracketed which does not allow this connection to be made.Earle sees Acts 8:14-17 as an experience subsequent to conversion. He believes \\"unquestionably, the receiving of the Spirit was subsequent to conversion\\" [Beacon Bible Commentary, 7:353]. Clarke, however, said the gift of the Spirit was \\"certainly not for the sanctification of the souls of the people.... It was the miraculous gifts of the Spirit which were thus communicated.\\"Where Paul was filled with the Spirit in Acts 9:17, Clarke comments that prior to this point in time Paul \\"was not even a Christian; and the Holy Ghost, which he received now, was given more to make him a thorough Christian convert than to make him an apostle.\\"Earle omits this reference. However, Earle believes that \\"one is filled with the Holy Spirit when his heart is cleansed from all sin in the experience of entire sanctification\\" [Beacon, 7:305].When Cornelius receives the Spirit and is then baptized in water, Clarke again makes the tie between Spirit baptism and water baptism (Acts 10:47).These had evidently received the Holy Ghost, and consequently were become members of the mystical body of Christ; and yet St. Peter requires that they shall receive baptism by water, that they might become members of the Christian Church.Clarke concludes by noting that the baptism of the Spirit did not supersede the baptism by water, \\"nor indeed can it.\\"Earle quotes the paragraph, but omits the concluding note. However, in Earle's own commentary on Acts, he states the experience of cornelius is \\"commonly known as entire sanctification\\" [Beacon, 7:380].At Acts 11:16 Clarke observed that the promise of the Spirit's baptism was made to all \\"who should believe on Jesus Christ.\\" Earle let this statement stand, but omitted Clarke's closing comment, \\"Hence we learn that the promise of the Holy Spirit is given to the whole body of Christians - to all that believe on Christ as dying for their sins, and rising for their justification.\\"Two verses later it is recorded that at the household of Cornelius God granted the Gentiles repentance unto life. Clarke says they embraced the Christian religion. Earle omits this reference.At Acts 19 Earle does let stand Clarke's note that the Ephesian disciples \\"therefore were not Christians.\\" Earle, however, omits the following paragraph:And to this day the genuine disciples of Christ are distinguished from all false religionists, and from nominal Christians, by being made partakers of this Spirit, which enlightens their minds, and convinces of sin, righteousness, and judgment; quickens their souls, witnesses to their conscience that they are the children of God, and purifies their hearts. Those who have not received these blessings from the Holy Spirit, whatever their profession may be, know nothing better than John's baptism: good, excellent in its kind, but ineffectual to the salvation of those who live under the meridian of Christianity.In Earle's own commentary he states that those who have believed and entered the Christian faith still need to be filled with the Spirit as a subsequent experience [Beacon, 7:477].At Romans 8:9 Clarke can almost be heard preaching.God made man in union with Himself, and his heart was His temple. Sin being committed, the temple was defiled, and God abandoned it. Jesus Christ is come by His sacrifice and Spirit to cleanse the temple, and make man again a habitation of God through the Spirit. And when this almighty Spirit again makes the heart His residence, then the soul is delivered from the moral effects of the fall. And that this is absolutely necessary to our present peace and final salvation is proved from this: that if any man have not the Spirit of Christ - the mind that was in him, produced there by the power of the Holy Ghost - he is none of His; he does not belong to the kingdom, flock, or family of God. This is an awful conclusion! Reader, lay it to heart.Earle did not see fit to include anything cited above. At Ephesians 1:13 Clarke said:The Holy Spirit, which is promised to them who believe on Christ Jesus, was given to you and thus you were ascertained to be the children of God, for God hasnot child who is not a partaker of the Holy Ghost, and he who has this Spirit has God's seal that he belongs to the heavenly family.At 1 John 4:18 Clarke exhorts:Let such earnestly seek, and fervently believe on the Son of God; and he will son give them another baptism of his Spirit, will purge out all the old leaven, and fill their whole souls with that love which is the fulfilling of the law.This exhortation was omitted by Earle.Ralph Earle said he found it \\"difficult to understand the almost universal neglect in the Christian Church of the baptism of the Holy Spirit\\" [The Gospel According to Mark, 30]. However, he omits most of Clarke's references to Spirit baptism. This is probably because Clarke did not connect Spirit baptism exclusively to entire sanctification.Wesley Tracy concluded, \\"Clarke strongly emphasized the Holy Spirit in conversion.\\" In entire sanctification the believer is baptized with a great effusion of the Spirit, but Clarke did not connect Pentecost and the experience of sanctification \\"in any direct way\\" [When Adam Clarke Preached, People Listened, 124]. However, Earle does in his commentary [Beacon, 7:274].Who gave Ralph Earle the authority to edit out those passages which do not fit his theology and publish the results under Clarke's name? If the holiness movement teaches the same doctrine as early Methodism, why was so much editing necessary? How many people will think they are actually reading Clarke when they are only reading a sanitized version? Perhaps Clarke should have been abridged by someone who was more sympathetic to Clarke's theology.Thomas Oden has raised his voice against \\"modern Chauvinists\\" which he defines as:\\"those who have decided that there is precious little worth learning from any premodern voice. They assume the intrinsic inferiority of all premodern texts and the intrinsic superiority of all modern methods of investigation of those texts [Life in the Spirit, 469].In the early history of our nation the Lewis & Clark Expedition paved the way for expansion. However, the Earle & Clarke Exposition leads to suppression of the truth."},{"Title":"Adam Clarke's Commentary","review":"So if a NEW Abridged edition is $360.00 what is a hard bound 1825 volume iii and volume iv worth?I think I will stick with my originals and forego the new editions.

BUY THIS BOOK!!! Simple to read and filled with brilliant writing concerning the Gospel. His study shows how John Calvin got it all wrong. Man DOES have a free will! The eternal security doctrine has been wrongly titled, it is a doctrine of demons, which gives man the false sense of security and contradicts the Holy Scriptures! Read James 2:1-26. James 2:26 clearly states, \\"For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, even so faith apart from works is dead.\\" To believe in a once saved always saved mentality leads to a true false sense of security, and a license for many to openly sin and not worry about being held accountable. If you believe that you can do whatever you want after repeating the words another told you to say, then later turn your back on Christ for the rest of your life and still make it to heaven you are sadly mistaking dear friend. Don't fall for this demonic doctrine! Calvin studied humanism before his misguided Christian writings were popular, and was involved in a tragic murder, and was he really secure if he never repented of it? Scriptures open state that no unrepeated murder will have a place in heaven. (Calvinists, I challenge you to read: Hunted heretic; the life and death of Michael Servetus at http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/ashes.htm) .... Martin Luther stated that the book of James And Jude was \\"uninspired\\" (by the Holy Spirit) and worth only of fire! \\"All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work.\\"(2 Timothy 3:16-17, NKJV) Charles Stanley, and many other well intended Calvinistic men and women are misleading millions down the highway to Hell!

As a photographer, Nan set out to understand personal relationships and resolve her personal history. These photographs display different aspects of life, like Nan's relationships with social outcasts that we commonly overlook. She gets very personal with her subjects in most of the photographs, almost invading their privacy.The book begins with an essay introducing Nan Goldin and her theoretical approach, and then goes on to explain how Nan came to know photography. Also explained are the tragic and life changing experiences that influenced and pushed her to challenge documentary photography. Nan opened a door that changed how we see the world by showing us things that weren't normally seen in photographs. Previous photographers such as Larry Clark had suggested the possibility with his very intimate Tulsa collection. Nan wanted to understand people, relationships and where she stood in the world and this book is a small glimpse into her search for purpose.55 is a combined version of several different exhibitions and projects that Nan has done over the years. Although the book is small in size, the intensity of the images hasn't changed. Every photo is illuminated in color and accompanied by a caption that explains the individual photograph, as well as added details of the subject. This book is perfectly capable of standing alone in defining Nan Goldin's work and is also a short, beautifully written biography."},{"Title":"Nan Goldin (Stern Portfolio Library of Photography)","review":"I searched long and hard for an affordable and great collection of Nan Goldin's work and this is the winner.

This book is one of the most important books on Orisha Spirituality. For the first time, the author does not reflect or even touch the subject of Orisha sacred items, numbers, and all that other stuff than is found in many Orisha books these days. This gem of a book reflects on starting to honor the Orisha starting from within. The book focuses on self-reflection, healing inner pains, honoring commitments, mindfulness, honesty, and other true wisdoms that our found in the teachings of religions such as Zen, Buddihsm, and Hinduism.The book is written for the followers of the various Orisha traditions, but can be applied by any person no matter race, religion or sexual preference. There is a small section on Orisa Soul work, which again can be applied by anyone. A section on honoring ones Ancestors and creating a shrine for them.A most beautiful, and well-written book that does not dabble, with silly \\"how to do magic spells\\" or superstitions. But instead teaches how to work with ones inner spirits, how to seek blessings from the divinities within, how to find peace through meditation with the mysteries of the Orisha tradition. This book is a basic fundamental to the truth, beauty and wisdom that lie within the Orisha tradition.I have to highly recommend this book to all newly initiated Iyawo, it will bring deeper blessings and meanings to your first year in white. But I also have to recommend this book to all that are looking for their first book on Orisha Spirituality.Bravo and Ashe!

I really enjoyed the section where Ms. Correal explained the importance of worshipping and communicating with our ancestors. Everyone in the religion learns that \\"eggun come before the orisha\\". Even those who are not in the religion should take heed to how important ancestor worship is to our lives. Our ancestors guide us, protect us, etc. and even more so if we simply LET THEM. I also enjoyed how Ms. Correal described the different \\"roles\\" that some people play in their casas (houses of Ocha worship) (i.e. little sister, gossiper, the jealous one, the favorite, etc.) I too, have always wondered about this (thought that this was just my perspective) but was pleased once I read Ms. Correal's opinions on how one's Ocha family can be just like a real family with its dynamics (and dysfunctions!)LOLI think anyone & everyone who is either on the road to La Regla de Ocha or has already gone down this road should purchase/read this book."},{"Title":"Finding Soul on the Path of Orisa: A West African Spiritual Tradition","review":"American-born, with pilgrimages to Brazil and Africa, Ms Correal has become a priestess of of the Yoruba goddess Yemaya.

However, hearing about the path of Orixa from a feminist was refreshing and interesting. I would not reccommend this book if you want detailed info about each Orixa, practises etc. This is not what this book aims to do. There is a good bibliography and glossary and interesting information about establishing an ancestors altar, how to maintain and feed the dead.

My Guru, Yogananda, teaches that external ritual is moot without an inner attempt to commune with the Divine. I think Finding Soul teaches us that same truth.

Tobe Melora Correal inspires self examination and shares insights from her journey of discovering the authentic self; and does so respecting the diversity and readiness of the reader. Healthy skepticism is praised and viewed as an asset/tool with regard to power inbalance and struggles, making choices about what or whom to follow specific to self, individuals, collectives and communities that practice ancestor reverence and/or Orisa worship. Her naming patriarchy and acknowledging the power of men and women alike as balance and being in alignment with the soul on the path of Orisa is at the helm of this timely work of spiritual food. All is valuable. 'True soul can only be found when much of what our spiritual selves have to offer is anticipated, nurtured and valued.' Thank you Tobe Melora Correal for this book, a tool that I can pick up, read again and again, for guidance, validation and celebration of authenticity and reverence of those who paved the way for us on our paths. Praise to your ancestors, they are indeed smiling. Peace and Blessings."},{"Title":"Finding Soul on the Path of Orisa: A West African Spiritual Tradition","review":"I bought this book several years ago, and I return to read different pieces of it again and again. As I am getting ready to make santo in a few months, it has been an invaluable resource. Correal offers a helpful reminder that although there are many things to be accomplished before and during the ceremony- the initiation itself is just an amazing door that opens up onto a lifetime of work, reflection and commitment.It is by far one of my favorite books about this tradition (Vega's \\"Altar of My Soul\\" and Murphy's \\"Oshun Across the Waters\\" coming in tied for second place). Correal gets real about some of the difficult aspects of these traditions, like elders who lose their humility, or people who try and use the hierarchical structure of the ile to get power over somebody else. She reminds us that whether we are Santer@s or aleyos, we are all worthy of respect. She points out the ways that iles can become places where people act out their own issues (and anyone in these communities knows that can happen big time!!!) and challenges us to look deeply into those patterns and work through them, so that we might continue our work in becoming the vessels through which the divine breathes.What I appreciated most about this book is the explanation of the Yoruba WORLDVIEW which is admittedly often a difficult concept to explain. Almost every other book I've read tends to focus on smaller building blocks of the tradition, like \\"Oshun takes yellow\\", and \\"Obatala's eleke looks like this\\" etc. Of course, anyone who has opened their hearts up to Orisha knows that these small details do not nearly begin to do justice to explaining the immense power of the Orisha and the spiritual worldview in which they are rooted. I love the Correal doesn't waste paper with \\"love spells,\\" and instead shares with her readers a small book in which every page is densely packed with challenging questions and her own deep wisdom."},{"Title":"Finding Soul on the Path of Orisa: A West African Spiritual Tradition","review":"Note to all readers, this is not a \\"how-to\\" manual on working with the orisha. There are few specifics, and the reader is meant to already know these specifics. If you do not know, the book says rightly to find an elder or use one of the books in her reference list. That said, it is a beautiful and necessary book for all orisha worshippers. As the author writes, in trying to be our highest selves, the best \\"we\\" we can be, we may at times fall down. But in the trying, the effort, getting up off the mat, we crown our heads.Working with the orisha takes daily effort, and is not something we can do by rote. We cannot sit on the couch and watch TV and ask the orisha to do all of the work in our lives. We must become clean, clear vessels for the sacred ashe to flow through. That sacred ashe flows through all things, even those whose outward appearance may be one we may not like.The author also provides some wonderful advice on working with our ancestors, the egun. While other authors proscribe specific rituals for this work, Tobe reminds us that this is spiritual work that does not mix well with \\"going through the motions\\". She gives you general ideas, and encourages you to find your own rituals for working with your ancestors. And for those of us who've had \\"issues\\" with our ancestors, she understands more than the reader might have guessed. The topic of ancestor relationships is tackled with grace and humility.This is not for the beginner; if you seek specific information and patakis regarding the orisha, I recommend Baba Raul Canizares' works on them. However, if you are already on the path, and seeking more information on how to incorporate the orisha and their divine ashe into your life, this is a wonderful book on the topic."},{"Title":"Finding Soul on the Path of Orisa: A West African Spiritual Tradition","review":"This is the best book I've read about the tradition.

I have rarely come across such a powerful book on the Orisha tradition. This book absolutely blew my socks off.Correal's teaching joins the ranks of John Mason and Awo Falokun Fatunbi as a pinnacle body of work that Orisa devotees will read for generations to come! I was so impressed with the book that I have referred elders to read it. When I am blessed enough to have my own God children. I will make this mandatory reading before seeking out the path of spiritual development of Lucumi.Most books that I read were fluff, magical, and Hollywood mysticism. The many books on Orisa worship do not do the faith justice and keeps it shrouded in veil of mystery and occultism that keeps the religion in the dark ages. The most insipid effects of those types of writings can often lead to the misconception that all things African are evil and nonsensical. Anyone who knows anything about African religion knows that there is popular belief in Western culture (spawned by racism) that Vodun and Santeria are somehow related to satan worship. What most do not know is that Africans only believed in a Supreme being and the devil is not viewed as a polar and equal opposite. In some African faithes, the Devil did not exist at all until the influence of missionaries who brought evil to the continent.Correal's substantive writing on the subject of egun (ancestral worship) and Orisa begins the revelation of truth about African religion as a valid and beneficial path to spiritual liberation. She also reveals some of the important rhyme and reason behind these all encompassing aspects and concepts of the faith.Correal gets to the core of the faith which is development and evolution of mankind. I won't give the whole book's contents away but, suffice it to say that anyone who purchases it WILL ABSOLUTELY NOT REGRET IT.ALL I can say to Correal is THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Finding Soul on the Path of Orisa: A West African Spiritual Tradition","review":"This book has a very refreshing perspective about Orisha and Yoruba Tradition.

You need this book if you are serious about Orisha Tradition, and want to grow in wisdom."},{"Title":"Finding Soul on the Path of Orisa: A West African Spiritual Tradition","review":"Finding Soul on the Path of Orisa by Tobe Melora Correal is a much needed scholastic piece of literature whose time has come. Explorations of both the Orisha Religions AND spirituality make this book indespensible.Initiates will find this author's writing clean, clear, and consice. Non-initiates will appreciate Correal's vivid imagery and literary illustration as it relates to Orisha worship/spirituality.This book really puts things in perspective in regards to clarity and truthful information without revealing cult secrets.

Most of the content directly related to my personal experiences with Yoruba, and in addition, it sheds insight into the various levels of spiritual growth and development so that you can better understand yourself and others and most importantly, how God works within humans. I found the book to be remarkably well written, concise and to the point and refreshing for the mind. Thank you for having it available at a time when I needed it the most and could not find it anywhere else."},{"Title":"Finding Soul on the Path of Orisa: A West African Spiritual Tradition","review":"When I first read the description of this book, and paged through the preview, I felt Correal's words to be very recognizable to me. I felt that this book, perhaps more than the many others I have read about The Religion, was one I could connect with intimately. And that is what happened.I am a white American woman, on a spiritual journey my whole life, one that started with Judaism, moved into Wicca, back to Catholicism and then to Zen Buddhism. And I think it is because of my years of study with a Roshi that I did connect with Correal. I wonder if she is aware of just how much her mother's Buddhism has become the lens through which she experiences The Religion? At least, I see that connection very clearly. She does allude to it, but I sense it is stronger than she realizes. I have never heard any of the Santeros, Santeras or Babalawos I know speak quite like this.This is a great book about the spritiualism that informs The Religion. So many other books do an excellent job of introducitn us to the Orishas or to rituals or to their own experiences. But this one, for me, is the link to spirituality that I haven't yet found in other books."},{"Title":"Finding Soul on the Path of Orisa: A West African Spiritual Tradition","review":"I purchased this book because I wanted to get clarity on what Yoruba was all about.

I recommend this book to anyone, regardless of faith, you wont regret it."},{"Title":"Finding Soul on the Path of Orisa: A West African Spiritual Tradition","review":"Finding Soul on the path of Orisa is truly one of the great books available on the market today. Out of all the books written about Traditional African Religion available, this one truly has something special that speaks to the self, to the soul of the reader. I have barely begun my own journey finding soul, but I feel this book helps one to be better able to make that journey.

Soon as I got it I opened it and started to read it. And I haven't put it down! I was into reading two other books at the same time, but once this book came in on Lizzie Borden-story about her ACCUSED of brutally murdering her father and stepmother back in the 1800's. I LOVE this book and haven't picked up the other two books yet! I had never bought anything online, but thought other friends and family have. So what the heck' I'll give it a try. And I have purchased more books since then. But Amazon has made it easy! And this book is a keeper! I was never into my history class, but I love to read about history \\"true\\" things that have happened. Lizzie Borden book should keep you interested!!!! Thank you so much Elizabeth Engstrom who wrote this great book!!!!"},{"Title":"Lizzie Borden","review":"I found this an entertaining novel. I came into it with 0 expectations. Therefore, Engstrom's writing and creativity were a pleasant surprise. She's very good at creating mood and (reader)empathy with her words. The plot moves along at a steady and interesting pace. For me, the highlight of the book was Enid's mipulation of Andrew in order to get money for her sons' education. The writing surrounding this plot element is fantastic(humorous too)! As far as the story, my only disappointment is no detailed recreation of the murders. I thought this would be a bigger part of the book but was only afforded a few sentences. Big letdown for me after waiting 300+ pages for the main event. Overall, though, I'd recommend this book and give it 4 stars for a job very well done. I look forward to reading another one of her books."},{"Title":"Lizzie Borden","review":"I loved this book and couldn't put it down. I was very intrigued at the access we were given to each character's inner thoughts and desires. These characters really came to life and we got a chance to understand them. Lizzie is a complicated character, which makes her more real since people ARE complicated. This book is a great item for anyone who is interested in the Lizzie Borden case or likes to read books based on factual events."},{"Title":"Lizzie Borden","review":"This book is billed as a suspenseful novel about Lizzie Borden. The only suspense I felt was in trying to stay awake. The book was incredibly boring, none of the characters were sympathetic, just pathetic."},{"Title":"Lizzie Borden","review":"I picked up this book one day while looking for a study on the Borden case. It was only after I started reading it that I realized it was fiction. The book kept my interest and I read it through. The author definitely researched the subject, offering an analysis of the characters and living arrangements of the Borden household. But for someone like me who wanted to learn more about the history of the crime, a novel will not do. From Lizzie's odd relationship with her father to her sexual experimentation, it is a very disturbing account. Engstrom's version of the crime itself, I'll warn you, is very homoerotic. It was a little much for my tastes."},{"Title":"Lizzie Borden","review":"This novel is similar to Evan Hunter's \\"Lizzie\\" in that Lizzie is portrayed as having lezzie tendencies. In the Hunter book, she goes off to Europe to have a lesbian affair with a wealthy and amoral Englishwoman, while in this book she has a lesbian affair with Bridget, the maid. As has already been pointed out, Lizzie is over-sympathetically portrayed here. Overall, I rather enjoyed it.David Rehakauthor of \\"Did Lizzie Borden Axe For It?\\""},{"Title":"Lizzie Borden","review":"i read the lizzie borden book and i felt like i was there b/c it kept u off the edge of ur seat and never let u off any other detail it always had u there and let you feel like u weere bridget or whoever and i felt that way i recommned this book becasue it is a good book if u like crimes but i dont like killing and i still liked so but it is all about this girl that hated her parents and they were rich and wealthy but were cheap and they always ate mutton like old sheep so then lizzie decided to kill her parents when she does she tells every1 else that she didnt do it like anyother crimneal would and then in the end she gets caught goes to jail and now the house they are living in is a bed and brakfast bye bye bye and i hope this helped out people"},{"Title":"Lizzie Borden","review":"Before reading this book, I had just read Arnold Brown's factual account. Ms. Engstrom did her research down to the details and those that differed I assume she changed for the sake of the story. I always find it intruiging to imagine what may have gone on in the minds of actual people, to delve deeper into a true story in my own imagination. Since we know so little about the Bordens other than what came out at the murder trial, I found this novelization interesting and entirely in keeping with the picture the actual testimony presented of the various people, while at the same time rounding them out and making them human. Andrew Borden has been called a &quot;despicable miser&quot;, but this author shows him as a man with feelings, good and bad. Emma, Lizzie's sister, is made into a dynamic character rather than a nonentity. And while there is no indication Lizzie ever had a friend such as Beatrice, the book points out the dangers of dabbling in the unknown (here, definitely the occult) without knowing what one is doing, as a person can lose control over what is happening. I dont want to give away anything, but Lizzie's experience's are not brought on or controlled by her, but arise spontaneously. As anyone who has had it happen will know, this can be pretty scary. I thnk Ms. Engstrom must have at one time or another to describe the feelings so accurately and I recommend this book for anyone interested in the case, just to get another slant on things."},{"Title":"Lizzie Borden","review":"Loved it, couldn't put it down. Fascinating format puts you in each family member's head individually; especially interesting when one member's perspectives are explained or contradicted by the other. The characterizations are excellent and memorable. Part horror novel, part mystery, part psychological drama -- and completely recommended."},{"Title":"Lizzie Borden","review":"&quot;Lizzie Borden&quot; is a novel about Lizzie Borden, the accused axe murderess from 1892's Fall River, Massachusetts. The book deals with Lizzie and her life in the 'house of hate' with her father, step-mother and sister, Emma. Most books about Lizzie Borden mention the house as being bland, without 'modern' conveniences, closed-in, locked up, but they don't go into detail. Ms. Engstrom's book does an excellent job of making the reader feel that claustrophobic building around Lizzie and, therefore, giving us a better understanding of Lizzie's real life character. The character of Lizzie, however, is portrayed as &quot;too good&quot; - I was waiting for her to be made into a Saint at the end of the book. The character of Emma was made into an alcoholic slut who took mysterious trips to a nearby town, coming back with bruises on her covered face. The book suffers much from Emma's far out characterization. Ending with the murders, we are left with one of those politically correct guilt trips. Yeah, Lizzie did it. But it's OKAY!"},{"Title":"Lizzie Borden","review":"Having been like alot of you, I've been fascinated with Lizzie Borden since Elizabeth Montgomery so aptly portrayed her in the movie. The movie, like the actual case, left us with many unanswered questions. Ms. Engstrom has cleverly filled in the missing parts of the story. According to the author, she has done much research of the case, therefore, her rendering is fairly believable. Do I believe everything she endeavored to answer? No. But her attempts are plausible. I would like to know what facts she discovered to reach her conclusions and what are really facts and what is the author's imagination. If you are interested in this bizzare case, you will enjoy this novel."},{"Title":"Lizzie Borden","review":"I really loved this book. I was really interested and really famillar with the Lizzie Borden case way before I had even heard of this book. I hadn't even thought that there was a fictional book written about her. I went searching one day and I bought this book. I couldn't put the book down it was so interesting. I read it non stop for three days and when I was finished I was exausted from not sleeeping, but I was satisfied. Plus if you like suprise endings you'll love the ending in this book. I heard some where that there is three parts to a story, a beginning a climax and an ending. Ms. Engstrom's book has a beginning a climax and another climax/ending. Very exciting!"},{"Title":"Lizzie Borden","review":"This sounds like an interesting novel to read about this famous case since it is based on facts.But you should read Arnold R. Brown's &quot;Lizzie Borden: The Legend, the Truth, the Final Chapter&quot; and David Kent's &quot;40 Whacks&quot; for background information."},{"Title":"Lizzie Borden","review":"This was the first book I read about Lizzie Borden and I loved it! Ever since this book (though it may be considered fictional) I have thought of Lizzie in an entirely new light. I truly believe this emotional and physchological approach could have been real in Lizzie's case. It makes me more sympathetic and understanding when I think about her. Taking a trip to the actual house in Fall River MA, this book was echoing in the back of my mind. I could see, in person, some of the places that the author described. Taking this author's input and putting it into your own thoughts about this case surely will make a difference on how you will see the murder case!"},{"Title":"Lizzie Borden","review":"I like this book alot.

Ground Zero covers proliferation, star wars, weapons systems, general history and of course, the effects of a nuclear war. Everything is explained at a basic level so the reader need not have any expertise in the subject beforehand. But the book is sufficiently comprehensive that the epilogue states the reader now knows as much about nuclear issues as any US president.I wonder, though, if the authors are really as non-partisan as they claim. I would bet they are far more afraid of war than of any foreign foe."},{"Title":"Nuclear War: What's In It For You?","review":"I highly reconmend this book. It will provide you with some basic facts about nuclear weapons, their use, and their results. The chapter that lays out a few different fictional storylines leading up to the use of atomic weapons is frightening.Another chapter on the first nuclear war (between the US and Japan in 1945) is instructive: In history's only conflict fought with atomic weapons the nuclear power (in this case the United States) used every atomic bomb (2) in it's arsonal, giving lie to the notion that nuclear weapons can be used like any other weapon. This book will give you a lot to think about."},{"Title":"Divided Union: The Politics of War in the Early American Republic (Cornell Studies in Security Affairs)","review":"The other reviewer didn't adequately explain what this book is all about. Silverstone is a scholar in International Relations, exploring why it is that states go to war with each other. He theorizes that one reason democracies do not go to war with each other involves their internal domestic politics. Specifically he examines the U.S. pre-Civil War to prove his thesis.He considers regional divisions within the U.S. to be primary in explaining why the U.S. often backed down from using force at times when it seemed like a reasonable course of action, such as in 1807 against the British, or in the 1850's against Mexico. Sectional divisions between north, south, and the northwest prevented many wars that benefited some sections more than others. The northwest, for example, strongly supported war against Great Britain in 1807, while east coast politicians worried that it would hurt their state's economies too much.If I could make any criticism of this book, it would be that Silverstone does not pay adequate attention to the institutional transformations within the U.S. occurring during the era he speaks of, such as the gradual strengthening of the presidency. But overall this book is well-written, with a good sense of history and well-developed theories."},{"Title":"Divided Union: The Politics of War in the Early American Republic (Cornell Studies in Security Affairs)","review":"Siliverstone has completely destroyed John Gaddis's thesis that unilateral and preemptive attacks were part of nineteenth century American foreign policy. Silverstone writes that the American presidency was handicapped in implementing agressive foreign policy designs due to a decentralized party system. Silverstone writes that from 1800-1812, the American government was relunctant to declare war against Great Britain due to oppostion from Northeastern polticians. In the 1840s Polk was forced to concede to the British over Oregon due to opposition in his own party from politicians in the Northeast and the Southern Coastal regions. Although Polk was able to declare war against the Mexicans, Northeasterners were able to limit the amount of Mexican land annexed by the Americans. These internal divisions prevented the United States from taking over Cuba in the 1850s. The only weakness of Silverstone's book is that he ignores the case of Andrew Jackson unilaterally taking over Florida and skims over how Polk pressured the Congress into declaring war with Mexico. But overall Silverstone has managed to discredit Gaddis's thesis that there was a set plan of preemption in American foreign policy during the nineteenth century."},{"Title":"Dubuque on the Mississippi, 1788-1988","review":"This lavishly illustrated book is aa source of delight to anyone who has a feel for local history, and will be enjoyed by all who have any connection with Dubuque.

The book shows you step by step how to draw cat-girls (beautiful) and cute tropical girl/chibi/cat-girl and other adorable creatures.

While Hart covers the creation chibis from the ground up, some experience with figure drawing is recommended for the catgirl section.

I am reminded that Tolstoy once marveled at how Mark Twain could tell such concise stories, and I think a lot of American writers who stretch stories to half a thousand pages while Duranti (and some others like Sarah Dunant and Penelope Lively) use a fraction of that could learn a lot by reading this book.The story is about what it means to have a personal identity, and what it means to lose it as the main character does when her ex-husband -- who had robbed her of both years and possessions -- comes back to remove the nameplate on her front door. This is not a \\"chick book,\\" as this brief description may suggest, but a serious, beautifully written story about finding out who we are. Who any of us are.The book is written as an interior monologue, mostly talking to herself, but switching at times to imagined conversations with her mother or ex-husband. It is a very clever tactic but not one which makes the writing style dominate the content.I think she is an amazing writer. Perhaps one of the best of our times, and I will read anything she writes."},{"Title":"How to Keep Koi: An Essential Guide (Interpet Handbooks)","review":"We are starting to keep koi, and I have been shopping for a couple of good koi books but it's been tough going... most pet shops around here don't have much, and the bookshops don't either -- either they have books that are too simple, or too complex. There is a lot of detailed categorization and medical information available for the serious koi breeder, but for many of us, too much information is worse than too little. After a lot of research I settled on this title and one other, and I also upgraded to the complete online viewing edition of this title at amazon. Wow! This is a great book... there is clear and interesting text about the history of koi, how they are handled, their anatomy (with diagrams) and the different color patterns.

Dr. Luther elequently examines Paul's epistle to the Galations with one sole question on his mind: What does this verse mean? His notes on the verses are structured to answer that very question throughout Paul's book.I have in my ownership...one of the old editions translated into English - dated 1796. On the inside cover there is a quote from John Bunyan (the infamous writer of \\"Pilgrim's Progress\\" and \\"Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners\\") which reads as follows: \\"I do prefer this book of MARTIN LUTHER upon the Galatians, excepting the Holy Bible, before all books that I have ever seen.\\" That there speaks volumes of the value of this commentary.It is considered by many theologians to be Dr. Luther's greatest work. It is a valued book on this Protestant's bookshelf and would highly recommend it to any believer. Sola Scriptura!"},{"Title":"A commentary on St. Paul's Epistle to the Galatians","review":"This is, in my estimation, the greatest non-canonical book ever written.Luther expounds Paul's epistle to the Galatians with an insight, power and depth of emotion which is sorely lacking in modern commentaries. He is not concerned with the various potential interpretations of \\"problematic passages\\" that fill the pages of other commentaries. From the very first page Luther cuts to the heart of the epistle-the doctrine of justification-in the way that only he can. His bold words and plain-sense interpretations result in a work filled with much of the same force and passion that characterized the epistle itself. The grace of God and the love of Jesus Christ cling to every word like the scent of a precious perfume. I cannot recommend this work highly enough.This is the very essence of the gospel as understood by the one who \\"rediscovered\\" the doctrines of faith and grace as he teaches us from the words of the one to whom God first revealed those doctrines. If you are looking for an up-to-date critical commentary or a greek-focused exegetical work then you will not find it here, but if you would hear a plain declaration of the power and wisdom of God then you will not find a better treatise apart from the Bible."},{"Title":"A commentary on St. Paul's Epistle to the Galatians","review":"This review covers the Flemming H. Revell Commentary on St. Paul's Epistle to The Galations. This version is based upon Luther's lectures at the University of Wittenberg in 1531 and the translation is based upon the \\"Middleton\\" edition of 1575. This is the best version to my knowledge, but it is written in King James english. On the positive side, it reads very poetic, but on the negative, it is harder to follow. I personally like this writing as it is closer to the language of the 16th Century. This book was considered by Luther to be his favorite, and history rates it highly. To summarize, it has a number of messages, (1) Galations shows that a person who is in true faith can fall away if they are negatively influenced by false teaching - a real problem in today's world. (2) That Biblical teaching must be solely based upon Bible scripture, and anyone who teaches man's doctrines using random Bible passages to support his/her sermons is most likely not a trustworthy preacher. (3) That even faith is a gift of God, and not a decision that a person makes. (4) That \\"Justification\\" is based upon \\"faith alone. (5) That Mose's OT law condemns mankind, and that anything a person tries to add to God's grace in the way of works or self rightiousness,denies what Jesus Christ did for mankind on the cross - Galatians 5:4. (6) That good works result from heart felt faith, and that good works do not preceed or contribute to salvation when it comes to \\"Justification.\\"The world needs this teaching to be more prevalent; however, the world does not like to hear it; therefore, it is almost lost in today's religious teachings. This work is a masterpiece with few peers if any, and is highly recommended to a person familiar with the Bible who desires to grow in their faith and understanding."},{"Title":"A commentary on St. Paul's Epistle to the Galatians","review":"This edition is written in an old English style and my eyes bugged out trying to translate on the fly, so I gave up.

There were many things this book explored. West Indian Blacks in America. Relationships between older and younger generations. Race relations. The list is endless.Silla the mother (THE mother) was an absolute gem of a character. I kept wavering on my feelings toward her. Love, hatred, sympathy. All of these emotions swelled up as I became better aquainted with her character. Some of her actions left me shocked and angry but at the heart of all of her deeds (some an aliance with Satan himself), she did what she had to do for her family.I also loved Deighton. Actually I felt so bad for him. My heart felt all of his frustrations and grief.Ina and Selina, two such very different women. Ina more like her father and Selina a carbon copy of the mother. I wanted Ina to develop a backbone and do what would maker her happy. Selina, my goodness what a complex young lady.

I never was a little girl growing into womanhood either. It does not give the men much credit, but perhaps that's the way it is in that part of the world."},{"Title":"Brown Girl, Brownstones","review":"In this book Paule Marshall blends an overly expressive and even awkward narrative with an almost incomprehensible and pretentious dialogue. Marshall wrote the dialogue of the Barbadian characters with an unrealistic slang. It used some words or phrases that had actually been used by Barbadian immigrants of the 30's and 40's, but she overused them. This and her unreadable colloquial spellings made her dialogue quite bad. The juxtapostion of her nonsensicle dialogue and her failled attempt at an elloquent narrative make this book an annoyance to read. The writing wasn't good, even though it did have it's moments, but what was even worse was the characters, every character in this book, including Selina to some degree was completely flat. Silla was bitter and underhanded, Deighton was lazy and after he joined the cult he was a souless religious fanatic. Ina was weak and Selina was independent, confused about growing up and immotionally strong. What made things worse was, none of these characters were likable at all, apart from Selina. However Selina was not likable most of the time because she seemed to be rebelling against Silla while at the same time Silla was the only reason Selina was remaining well and not dying of starvation. Besides being ingrateful to her mother she was completely unaware of what she stood for. She was a rebel without a cause (how original). In conclusion, besides having a depressing and exasperatingly slow moving plot, the book was so badly written that I couldn't wait until it was over. So, Paule Marshall, I apologize if you may have been offended by any of my statements in this review, but it is the way I feel. This book did had some good moments, but it was still not my cup of tea.No Hard Feelings,Andrew Nisinson"},{"Title":"Brown Girl, Brownstones","review":"This is one of the best books I had ever read"},{"Title":"Brown Girl, Brownstones","review":"Brown GirlPeer ReviewTo my Peers:I would recommend Brown Girl to all of my fellow peers. This is a story that shows many problems. One was that most of us do not have positive remodels to look up to. Therefore, we just go about our life without anyone to look up. To the same exact way, the character in this story grew up also. However, always someone came so that we can look up to. However, that does not always happen to us. So there are certain times or situations that are not the same as our life but most of the time we can relate to the work. As a person in life. So we can really understand what the character was going through so we would be able to say that we would have done the same thing. Therefore, we would under stand the story a lot better. In addition, like in the story, we could do better in receiving feedback and using it in a good way .so; we can use that to improve our selves. This would show that we understand what we are doing.

Or should I put that statement in words the author would use? &quot; The heartbeat of the book was buried under an ever so faint pile of descriptive nonsense that tore away at the very lining of my soul and left me empty, with only remnants of an unbridled fear of a sequel to bide me...&quot; And really, no matter how you look at it, the book is just that, descriptive nonsense. It was so hard to follow that I felt like I was reading a book that was written in French. The characters? Flat, each and every last one of them, especially that misguided Selena. There was no exploration into the motives of the characters whatsoever, for the life of me I can't understand the relationship between Selena and any of the characters, it was almost like the whole thing was a rough draft, and none of the characters and their paths were clearly established. And talk about boring! What exactly was the point in reading this? What in the heck was Paule trying to say through her novel? That Barbadians are similar to this? That this novel was somehow representative of Barbadian adolescent girls coming of age in New York? I sure hope not. I have written better things in my sleep. In the end I've read better, try The Bearnstein Bears, that is literary art at it's finest, this chick and her story can't compare.Oh yeah, the ending... What ending?"},{"Title":"Brown Girl, Brownstones","review":"This is a worthy and ambitious debut novel about the Barbadian immigrant experience in Brooklyn, New York, by a little known African-American author, whose own parents emigrated from Barbados during World War I. The author herself grew up in Brooklyn. She attended Brooklyn College, graduating Phi Beta Kappa in 1953, a time when most Americans, much less a black woman, did not attend college. This drive to succeed is a testament to her Barbadian heritage.It is from that heritage that the author drew in creating her characters and developing their rich mix of personalities, as she re-created the early Barbadian immigrant experience in post-depression era Brooklyn. The book focuses on the Boyces, a nuclear family consisting of Silla, the ambitious, hard working, ever striving mother, Deighton, her charming, pie-in-the-sky dreamer of a husband, and their two daughters, Ina, the older and more passive one, and Selina, the bright, rebellious one. The novel follows the fortunes of the Boyce family from the late 1930s until shortly after Word War II. It tells of their lives, their hopes, and their dreams.The book beautifully details the experience of the early Barbadian immigrants in Brooklyn and their adjustment to their new environment. They brought with them their own ideas, their own ways of doing things, and a work ethic that is hard to beat. Quite frankly, Barbadians revitalized areas of Brooklyn that were dormant. Theirs was an almost traditional immigrant experience, but for the racism that they were to encounter here. Still, they did not allow that to stand in their way from getting ahead and going for the American dream.This book neatly encapsulates that immigrant experience through the Boyce family. One gets a very good sense of what the experience of the Barbadian immigrant was like through the interactions of the Boyce family with others in their community, as well as with each other. While Silla Boyce typifies the Barbadian community in terms of goals and work ethic, dreams and desires, with its focus upon material acquisition, her husband, Deighton, does not. Their separate dreams and desires conflict and act as a catalyst for a tragedy that would mar intra-familial relationships.It is also a coming of age story, as Selina struggles to find her place in the new society and rich community her people are creating. She also struggles to find her place in the larger community, as well, stepping out of the insular one into one where racism is a factor. She is also interested in exploring her roots and heritage. Still, being who she is, the reader believes that Selina will not founder. Though Selina would hate to admit it, she is the one who is most like her mother, a fact of which she is not cognizant throughout most of the novel. She is truly her mother's daughter, in thought and deed.This is a richly satisfying novel. The author captures the \\"Bajun\\" way of speaking in all its rich, expressive cadence. While some may find this \\"Bajun\\" dialect, which is interspersed throughout the novel, difficult to follow or distracting, it is this richness of language that give this book its very distinctive feel. Moreover, while the author may sometimes get too bogged down with overly descriptive detail, she paints a vibrant picture of a segment of society that has too long been ignored in literature. Those who like reading about the immigrant experience will enjoy this book, as will those who are interested in discovering worthy authors that have receded from public memory."},{"Title":"Brown Girl, Brownstones","review":"This book deals with an aspect of the African American experience which gets very little notice outside of the black community, namely that of the black immigrant. We hear a lot about immigrants from Europe who came here and helped build america. However, immigrants also came here from places like Barbados, Jamaica, Trinidad, Panama, etc. Most whites will identify themselves as irish, polish, italian, german, etc ancestry. However, African Americans seem to be allowed only one ethnicity. It's as if in the darkness only one variation can be discerned. Like most immigrants, the Barbadians described in this book are highly motivated towards material success for themselves and their children. As seen in this book, sometimes this quest occurs at all costs even at the expense of outward expressions of love and affection. For example, Silla is referred to as 'the mother' throughout. As in many families, the ambitions of the parents for their children don't coincide with the children's as seen in the conflicts between Selena and her mother. Unlike white immigrants, their ambitions also run afoul of racism.I found the narrative sometimes overly descriptive, especially in the preoccupation with sunlight and shadow. The brownstones and the streets often seemed like dark and brooding places.My maternal grandparents were from Bardados, while my paternal grandfather was from St. Eustacia. I also grew up in Brooklyn (in a brownstone). Therefore, the landscape and the characters were very familiar. In fact, Claremont Sealy and Clive Springer are probably my cousins! A most enjoyable and thought provoking book. I look forward to reading more of Ms Marshall's book."},{"Title":"Brown Girl, Brownstones","review":"To all of the misguided souls who slammed this beautiful book, I feel sorry for you. Brown girl, Brownstones is a wonderful book for so many reasons but too many to go into now. Paule Marshall's piece is unique in that it gives a voice to a community so often left out of fiction writing: the Caribbean community in the United States. As a first generation Caribbean-American who grew up in Brooklyn, I was blown away the first time I read this book and found such startlingly familiar portrayals of the culture I claim. The dialogue flowed naturally and, although the chracter portrayals of some (esp. Deighton and Silla) might strike some as too extreme, my own experiences and even the testimony of sociological studies show that Marshall was right on the mark. The fact that the book didn't have a bang up ending is totally natural in that the book is a coming of age story of a young woman (how many people have a conclusive grip on who they are at 18) who must figure out her multipe identities as a young woman, a Black woman and and Afro-Caribbean woman not tied to her parents' homeland but not completely of this country either. Marshall's work is too poignant to be dismissed at first glance. I would encourage all those who couldn't find the beauty in Brownstones the first time to give it a second chance. To dismiss this book is not only dismissing the premiere work of Paule Marshall but also to miss out a rare glimpse into the dynamics of a community that is within our gates."},{"Title":"Brown Girl, Brownstones","review":"i'm horrified at these reviews. marshall has put together a brilliant novel rich in prose and dialogue, an amazing work overall that should earn her the right to be identified with among the most important writers in the last half century. its funny how so much of our society is dumbed down to the point that a work of art is trashed because either people cant relate to it or dont grasp or understand it. if they dont understand words that the writer uses, they call that writer 'pretentious'. if the writer uses the language to its fullest capacity, they call the writer 'overly descriptive'. its quite a grim state of affairs when only these kind of comments prevail for such a transcendent novel. in today's lazy Western world of drive-thrus, TV dinners, and condensed 30 minute television shows with commercial breaks, people only want things easy, straight to the point. this is why our society is calcified.if you dont understand what Marshall is doing here, either take your loss silently and move on, or, better yet, research! read more! try and understand lyricism and poetics, the beauty of creatively accurate description. that's just the thing; we're so a-creative these days its opprobrious. to the self-professed white jewish girl in the suburbs who will probably never return to read this, there are cultures and worlds outside of your own that in fact do affect you. anyone who walks around thinking otherwise is foolish. immigrants havent played a role in the development of modern America? please. Brown Girl, Brownstones is not only important for its beauty, but also for its capturing of Barbadian immigrants in Brooklyn around the time of World War II. the dialect and cadence of their speech is vibrantly bottled in the novel; someone said its hard to read. thats because its a transcription of a different dialect! if you take the time to read it, you'll eventually hear it in your head. the ability to transcribe different accents and dialects is quite a skill, and one that Marshall is not without.anyways, if you're a true lover of amazing prose and writing in general, you'll appreciate this novel. if you aren't, at least dont embarrass yourself by haranguing others with ignorance."},{"Title":"Brown Girl, Brownstones","review":"A terrifically heartwarming story about a young girl's coming of age as first generation American from Barbados. The &quot;silence&quot; of Marshall's main character, Selina, resounds in this coming of age child of immigrants tale unfolds. Partially based on Ms. Marshall's own life, the story holds warmth, humor and tragedy for almost anyone willing to explore the human condition.A definite must-read for post-modernists."},{"Title":"Brown Girl, Brownstones","review":"Browngirl, Brownstones by Paule Marshall is a book about a young girl that grows up to be a beautiful woman not knowing exactly what she wants to be but as long as its not what her mother is she is okay. She lives day-by-day learning something new, but not able to trust her own family. Her father has always been her role model no matter what people thought about him not even what her own mother thought. It must be sad to know that your mother treats your father mean. Selina and her mother never did get along that well because they have so many differences that separated them day by day. Selina's mom is a strong woman and does not let anyone nock her down! She sets her mind to what she wants no matter what gets in her way. Selina's mother just wants what's best for her daughters Ina and Selina.The book is straight out forward to the reader there are some words that might be hard to understand, but you can always us the dictionary. It's sort of a long book, but it's easier and can go faster than shorter books. At the beginning, it's somewhat hard to understand what's going on because the writer is explaining the background of where Selina is at as well as what she is looking at.My interest in this book goes very far because it teaches me many things to always be what I want to be and not someone else wants me to be. Never let anyone stop you from accomplishing your dreams even if you feel like its taking up most of your time. Also, that you shouldn't rely on some one else because your not always going to have them around to help you."},{"Title":"Brown Girl, Brownstones","review":"This is an interesting look at the hurdles a young girl faces in New York City in the 40s and 50s.

Still, they did not allow that to stand in their way from getting ahead and going for the American dream.This book neatly encapsulates that immigrant experience through the Boyce family. One gets a very good sense of what the experience of the Barbadian immigrant was like through the interactions of the Boyce family with others in their community, as well as with each other. While Silla Boyce typifies the Barbadian community in terms of goals and work ethic, dreams and desires, with its focus upon material acquisition, her husband, Deighton, does not. Their separate dreams and desires conflict and act as a catalyst for a tragedy that would mar intra-familial relationships.It is also a coming of age story, as Selina struggles to find her place in the new society and rich community her people are creating. She also struggles to find her place in the larger community, as well, stepping out of the insular one into one where racism is a factor. She is also interested in exploring her roots and heritage. Still, being who she is, the reader believes that Selina will not founder. Though Selina would hate to admit it, she is the one who is most like her mother, a fact of which she is not cognizant throughout most of the novel. She is truly her mother's daughter, in thought and deed.This is a richly satisfying novel. The author captures the \\"Bajun\\" way of speaking in all its rich, expressive cadence. While some may find this \\"Bajun\\" dialect, which is interspersed throughout the novel, difficult to follow or distracting, it is this richness of language that give this book its very distinctive feel. Moreover, while the author may sometimes get too bogged down with overly descriptive detail, she paints a vibrant picture of a segment of society that has too long been ignored in literature. Those who like reading about the immigrant experience will enjoy this book, as will those who are interested in discovering worthy authors that have receded from public memory."},{"Title":"Brown Girl, Brownstones","review":"I probably wouldn't have ever heard of Brown Girl, Brownstones if it hadn't been assigned for the African American Literature by Women course I'm taking this semester. However, it has a deserved place among novels about the immigrant experience and coming of age.Brown Girl, Brownstones follows Selina Boyce from girlhood into college. In this time, Selina struggles over her allegiance to her father, Deighton, who romantically tries on careers in which he has no realistic future, and her mother, Silla, whose pragmatic obsession with purchasing their leased brownstone causes her to act ruthlessly. Between them and the outspoken cast of supporting characters, Selina has many options for how to model her own life.The pages of Brown Girl, Brownstones fly by quickly, assisted by the realness of the characters' voices. I especially enjoyed Marshall's use of Barbadian dialect, which helps to locate the novel in a particular time and place.Brown Girl, Brownstones is certainly a good choice for teenagers, but also for adults who are interested in stories set between the depression and the '50s."},{"Title":"Brown Girl, Brownstones","review":"Given as gift to young girl.

Beginning with Lord Kitchner and ending with Pope John Paul II, the lives of men and women who graced or plagued the last two centuries are chronicled with an elan that can scarce be found other than in that great newspaper.From the age of Empire to the opening years of the 21st Century, here the reader will find a collection of notables from the world of arts and literature, politics and the professions. Here are inventors and originators, as well as those who cast lengthy, sinister shadows across the years. The lives of the 'beautiful' are recounted (Marilyn Monroe, Jackie Onassis, Princess Diana, and The Queen Mother), as are the lives of the 'damned' (such as Lenin and Stalin).It is agreeable to see how thoughtful chroniclers evaluated each of these luminaries, just at the moment of their death. Some had left the world's stage long before their demise, so their obituary's assessments are tempered by the passing time. As a result, their obituaries can be read as the 'last word' on their subjects.Others, who were at the time of their deaths viewed as having found their place in history, have, since their obituaries appeared, come to be reevaluated. The study in contrasts, between how they were viewed then and how they are viewed now, is valuable.The turns of phase are lovely, from the observation about Sir Edward Elgar, \\"A tune of two bars or a progression of two chords is enough to reveal him\\" (page 46), to this, about the novelist, \\"But so far as Virginia Woolf was concerned, she would have done honour to any district.\\" (page 54).Those who find irresistible the personalities of their own and every age will consider this a remarkable compendium of the movers and shakers of the recent past, as well as the shapers our own time.If you find this review helpful you might want to read some of my other reviews, including those on subjects ranging from biography to architecture, as well as religion and fiction."},{"Title":"Times Great Lives","review":"A classy, authoritative British anthology demonstrating that obituary writing is best delivered by the anonymous, omniscient instant biographer."},{"Title":"The Essential Rene Magritte (Essential Series)","review":"This is a great introduction to Magritte's work.

Since he works in this respected and respectable capacity, it is safe to assume that he studied the issue of placing weaponry in space extensively and objectively prior to writing on it.Within this article, Mr. Lambakis addresses the arguments for and against placing weaponry in space. First he states the reasons popular writers and philosophers have attempted to dissuade policy-makers from placing weaponry in space. These reasons include the possibility that weapons in space would cause an instability that would provoke another Cold War-esque arms race, that weapons in space would ruin U.S. foreign relations by causing potential allies to feel threatened and coerced, and that other countries' governments (Russia and China) have stated to the public that they desire treaties preserving the use of space for peace.Second, Mr. Lambakis addresses the reasons that putting weapons in space would be prudent, simultaneously deconstructing the imprudent assumptions upon which anti-space-weaponry proponents base their cautions. He uses the historical fact that provocation of wars rests on a coincidence of many cultural factors rather than a single event/technology, the known behavior of prior enemies to develop threatening technologies while negotiating a ban thereon with other countries, and the note that not all U.S. allies feel that satellites and space weaponry are necessary to their defense strategies, so they would not always feel threatened by intra-satellite wars in HEO.This article gives balanced consideration to both sides of the space weaponry argument, then sides with the pro-weaponry faction.

Almost everyone knows the tale of the man who murdered his father and married his own mother. The only question is, which translation do you read? Bernard Knox makes an excellent case for his prose translation of Sophocles classic. This is a version designed for the a filmed version meant for the classroom; as such, it is remarkably smooth and easy to read. There is little poetry left in it; if that is what you seek, look elsewhere. This edition comes with a nice set of introductory essays on the background of the play, the theater, and Sophocles. All in all, a nice little edition."},{"Title":"Oedipus: The King (Washington Square Press Enriched Classic)","review":"The central statement of Greek tragedy is that Man can not control his Destiny; that there is an ineluctable Fate, preordained and inescapable. No matter how much the poor humans fight against it, it must be fulfilled. And there is no character as tragic as Oedipus in all literature. In this play, we see Oedipus as a successful man who has become King of Thebes, happily married to an older woman named Iocasta. As the play unfolds, we can feel the proximity of something terrible indeed. When the blind sage Tiresias starts to unfold the true story of Oedipus, we can creepily feel the sheer horror that grips him, as he learns that he has killed his father and married his mother, unknowingly. I have no notice of any other plot that can be described as more tragic than this one. Besides, it is one of the main sources of our culture, as with all true Classics. Oedipus summarizes some of our worst fears and traumas: the need to &quot;kill the paternal figure&quot;, the &quot;dependency on our mother&quot;, the &quot;impossibility of control external forces that shape our fate&quot;. It is horrific and fascinating, and there is simply no way to be indifferent to it."},{"Title":"Oedipus: The King (Washington Square Press Enriched Classic)","review":"Warning to all those who are reading this for a school assignment: you may think that an \\"enriched classic\\" is simply the text with commentary also included.

W. KnoxPages: 110.Time spent on the \\"to read\\" shelf: Probably a year or so.Days spent reading it: One afternoon while getting the oil in my car changed.Why I read it: I read this play in high school and was interested in reading it again. I enjoy Greek plays. Especially tragedies.Brief review:The story of Oedipus is well known to us today. Oedipus unknowingly kills his own father, marries his own mother, and in the process becomes King of Thebes. What I found interesting in the reading the introduction to this play was that all Greek plays would be fairly well known to the audience. The playwright would be honored for skill in telling the tale and in their poetry. And in the case of Oedipus some of the greatest artistry is in the dramatic irony of Oedipus's words.What I love about Oedipus the King is the constant struggle of Oedipus to reveal the truth of who his father's murder is (and eventually his own history) and his stubborn refusal to accept the truth when it is told plainly. The first major conversation Oedipus has with Tiresias captures this conflict perfectly. Oedipus asks Tiresias to tell what he knows. Tiresias understands who Oedipus is and what he has done. So Tiresias refuses to tell Oedipus. Oedipus promises it will be alright, just tell the truth. Tiresias tells Oedipus that Oedipus is the killer of the previous King, Laius. Oedipus rejects the truth, and rejects Tiresias. Over and over again, Oedipus wants the truth, but rejects it until all the evidence cannot be ignored any longer.The other element of Greek tragedies that I have long enjoyed is the idea that in attempting to avoid our destiny we fulfill it. For example, Oedipus left his \\"home country\\" to avoid killing his father (who he thought was the king of Corinth, Polybus). So he wanders to Thebes and kills a man at a crossroads. Who is, of course, his own father. Classic.I enjoyed reading Oedipus the King. It was a short read, but it has some profound moments in it. I look forward to reading some more Sophocles once I get through some other books. Oedipus continues his story in Oedipus at Colonus. And we hear about his daughter in Antigone (which I read in High School). If you enjoy tragedy, this is a must read!Favorite quote:\\"Time, which sees all things, has found you out.\\" -ChorusStars: 4 of 5.Final Word: Sobering."},{"Title":"Oedipus: The King (Washington Square Press Enriched Classic)","review":"I had to read this book for Literature.

Usually plays should be seen and heard, not read. &quot;Oedipus the King&quot; by Sophocles is an exception to this rule. Why do booksellers hide this play in such unappetizing categories as &quot;literature&quot; and &quot;drama&quot;? With the violence, gore, sex and new-age prophecy and paganism in &quot;Oedipus the King&quot;, it should be placed in a better-selling category, such as mysteries, thrillers, horror, or sword and sorcery.We did become concerned when we read one scene early in the play. After a priest tells King Oedipus how a plague has ravished his kingdom, Oedipus responds with a speech that boils down to &quot;I feel your pain.&quot; Whenever a head of state sounds like a certain notorious cat owner, we get nervous. Fortunately for the plot of this play, if not for Oedipus himself, once he became a suspect accused of patricide and incest, he did more than just claim that he had never inhaled."},{"Title":"Oedipus: The King (Washington Square Press Enriched Classic)","review":"I had to read it in school for a class and I loved it.

One might call it a fight for self awareness. You must admit, after reading this novel you feel a little remorse for the main charcter, Odeipus.

Chris ends up marrying Maribeth and Bobby's Vegas marriage is annuled. That brings us to this story, 'Unforgettable Bride' where Bobby again runs off to Vegas to marry a woman he just met in a bar. This time, however, Bobby is doing it for noble reasons. Casey Carmichael is eighteen and her rich and powerful father has arranged a marriage for Casey to a man that she not only does not love, but he has a girlfriend and a child. Casey runs away in the middle of the night and finds Booby at a bar and tells him her story. Casey begs Bobby to marry her, so that she can get the inheritance that her grandfather left her and hopefully escape marriage to the man her father wants her to marry.Casey and Bobby believe they are doing the right thing, but they have no idea what waits for them when Casey returns home. Booby also figures that since he has done this once before that this time should be no different. He is unprepared for the feelings that he has for his new short term bride. The question is what does he plan to do about it?Not only do we get a great love story with a rocky beginning, but if you read the Daughters of Texas series than you will be pleased to know that Maribeth and Chris play important roles in this story as well.

The peculiarity of the Spaniards concentrated there was that they came from the devastating Spanish Civil War, and to the depressing and terrible need for exile they had to add their capture while fighting against Nazis in France during IIWW. Paradoxically their previous experience of war, suffering and organization in Republican Spain contributed to their possibilities of survival. But the real centre of the book, at least for me, was that it shows that solidarity, moral principles and complete identification with the destiny of the rest of their fellowcitizens and some other non-Spanish prisoners allowed them to face up to the depravity and iniquity of their Kapos and SS officials without any loss of dignity or self-esteem. Besides, several of them managed to keep proofs in the form of photos, files and other documents that were of enormous help in the Nuremberg processes.Yes,Hell,Horror and eventually Death can be faced up without condescending to cowardice, self-degradation or despair."},{"Title":"College algebra- trigonometry: Examination section, questions and answers (College level examination series/CLEP)","review":"A pathetic waste of money!

She is one of the greatest poets of all time, and should be read by everyone who loves poetry (and even those who don't).That said, this is a terrible edition. I was shocked when I opened it in a bookstore, looking to show a friend one of her poems I had just been talking about, to discover that the punctuation had been completely modified. The meanings of some of her best poems hinge on varying interpretations of Dickinson's eccentric punctuation, and to change it seems to me one of the great crimes against poetry.

However--I must say--that I am sorely disappointed with this edition of selected poems. As one of the other reviewers has stated, this edition has been greatly tampered with--the editors have reworked the punctuation and capitalization stylistic genius of Dickinson and bastardized it to accommodate the modern reader--but, honestly, to do this severely detracts from Dickinson's so very unique voice. Particularly, the editors employed the comma as a replacement for her frivolous usage of the dash, which left me squirming in distaste--it nearly ruins the poems in my opinion. To \\"fix\\" a poem--punctuation or otherwise--is to change the very essence behind it--I was very surprised the editors would take such strange liberties in modifying these poems. If you're a stickler about poetry, this is not the edition for you.

The division of the poems employed here , and in many of the older collections (\\"Life,\\" \\"Nature,\\" \\"Love,\\" \\"Time and Eternity\\") are not Dickinson's, and are not very useful in experiencing the poems. In my opinion, this volume omits many of Emily's best poems and includes some of her least interesting/ daring. Of course, there can be many varying opinions as to what Emily's best work was, but since all of her poems are collected in one manageable volume there's no need to let someone else decide that for you.

It starts right from the basic and touches the core of any topic. This book is all about precise and minute detail (Which actually makes the small topics look really BIG).In the context of exams this will always be my first recommendation to all computer and IT students. In fact class mates often asked me how I had that EXTRA peice of information at all the times. I topped the DBMS exams this year (and; Yes sir, full credit to C J Date) thanks to the reference of this really wonderful book.This is a best buy for both Graduate + Under Graduate students. In fact learners can also get a great deal of insight into this really interestiing subject. It is important to get a good start into DBMS; because this is a very boring and dry subject &quot;At First Sight&quot;. Others authors had made this subject eeven more dry and uninteresting.OVERALL:1) Every students MUST have.2) Every learners MUST have.ALSO3) Good reference for teachers and lecturers."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Database Systems","review":"This is a tough book to read but certainly worth the time spent. The pages cannot be skimmed through. This is no pulp fiction ( neither is database theory). Once you finished reading , the payoffs are immense. The book has a mathematical bias. And realworld database practitioners may find this aspect disconcerting. It is advisable to use your intuition and coomonsense for database design, even after reading this book. The book forces you to focus on sound design principles. A very good way to verify your work. Great book, worth the price.."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Database Systems","review":"This is one of the better books on the theory of database systems design. It is not meant to be a book on applications, rather it is a commonly used textbook in upper level undergraduate and graduate classes on the subject. However, this latest edition has reorganized the material somewhat and has added to its sections on XML and SQL in an attempt to show the theory through more real-world scenarios.The book is divided into six parts. The first section sets the scene by explaining what a database is and why database systems are generally desirable. Next a general architecture for database systems is presented that serves as a framework upon which all subsequent chapters are built. Next is a broad overview of relational systems and finally there is a chapter that introduces SQL and explains how it works and why it is not a perfect language.The second section, on the relational model, is rather long. This reflects the fact that the relational model of database systems is the foundation that makes the field a science. The author does a good job of presenting the theory along with examples of this theory as practiced in SQL. However, remember that the SQL examples are to illuminate the theory, not vice versa. The author does an exceptional job of explaining the relational calculus.The third section is dedicated to database design, and specifically relational database design. The database design problem can be stated very simply: Given some body of data to be presented in a database, how do we decide on a logical structure for that data? This section does an exceptional job of explaining and illustrating one of the more difficult concepts in database design, that of normalization and normal forms. Database normalization is a process that eliminates redundancy, organizes data efficiently, reduces the potential for anomalies during data operations, and improves data consistency.The fourth section, on transaction management, will be familiar to those who are involved in operating system design. This section includes methods of protecting the database against non-deliberate threats such as a system crash in the middle of program execution that leaves the database in an unpredictable state, two programs concurrently executing that interfere with one another's operation therefore producing incorrect results, and updates that might change the database in an invalid way.The fifth section, entitled \\"Further Topics\\", tackles a number of subjects that could be the topic of a complete book by themselves. This includes protecting databases against deliberate attacks, building optimization into databases so that they work more efficiently, handling missing database information, object-oriented concepts, and logic-based databases.The final and sixth section of the book adds information on a subject that has been missing in past editions - that of object-oriented databases. This section includes some relevant information on the use of XML in database design.I learned database design theory from the sixth edition of this book ten years ago with no prior database design experience. I found that edition to be a clear and adequate textbook but lacking in the discussions of alternatives to the relational model which has been corrected in this eighth edition. I highly recommend this book to students and professionals who are interested in learning about the theory of modern database design.

The relational model of data is a scientific model and Chris Date is at pains to expound this fact. Although the relational model is credited largely to Edgar Codd (interestly if you look up Codd in the index of this text you'll see the entry \\"Codd, Edgar F., passim\\") Date takes the theory and outlines it in such depth and clarity that this text essentially has become the bible in regard to the topic. I urge all database practioners to get a copy of this book and at least review the opening chapters. No Oracle, SQL-Server, DB2, XML, or other text will outline the fundamentals in such a comprehensive way. One of my bones with current trends in tertiary and industry education is the obsession with \\"product training\\", unfortunately too many graduates are leaving our institutions with a vague at best understanding of arguably the most complete, elegant, and instrumentally reliable model of data - the relational model (and calling themselves DBA's). Date is a credible contemporary theorist in a distinguished line including Codd, Quine, Church, and Russell and Whitehead. The direct relationship between the theory, model and the practical is undeniable - critics are simply ignorant!"},{"Title":"An Introduction to Database Systems","review":"This book demands re-reading and bears it well. It has been very satisfying to see the progress of CJ Date's thinking since the third edition. After 25 years or so, I detect that he is coming far closer to the essence of his subject than others have. I imagine he could have put this down on one page but that wouldn't be a book!The details are great and some are so striking as to seem profound. How many people know that there are relations that have no attributes? Date also apologies for past misconceptions. It is gratifying to know that he now agrees with what some suspected - an relation attribute's value can be another relation, if we want it to be. The book is full of wisdom like that.Just like the author, I wish the builders of so-called relational systems would pay some attention to this thinking (which he freely admits is not all his own). Then they might spend less time refining ideas which the reader of this book will realize are clearly wrong, like not separating the physical from the logical. If they also read his 'Third Manifesto', co-authored with Hugh Darwen where his personal opinions shine through even more, they might see ways to simplify further as well as apply the ideas in new and useful ways and take databases to a new level.This book is not for anybody who only wants a 24 hour, or even a 21 day, treatment, although those are OK as far as they go. It is for anybody who is interested in the field, but perhaps not for some who only want a job. But i think this book has to be read to understand why!I would pay more for an even longer book with more detail on some of the early papers by others such as those about normalization. These papers are now very hard to obtain.The best book i've read on database (perhaps i should say relations and THEIR foundations) was Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy by Bertrand Russell, written in 1917 no less! It also bears re-reading."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Database Systems","review":"This book is excellent and it is very clearly written. English is my second language (I live in Ecuador for crying out loud, I don't even get to practice my English that often), and I can read the book without pain or suffering of any kind. Yes it is huge. Yes, for some of you it might be too much theory. But you will understand every aspect of data base systems: Date's pedagogy and methodology is just that brilliant. Plus you'll get your hands dirty with some interesting topics that Mr. Date has decided to include, for example: Distributed Databases, Relational Calculus (not incredibly necessary as Relational Algebra, but it is nice to have a reference to go to when need arrives), Security and Object Databases.The author may seem pretentious when he uses Latin phrases or words like: a fortiori, per se, a priori, mutatis mutandis, etc. But who doesn't really know this? And if you don't, Google it up and you'll get the result in seconds (I had to Google a fortiori). It just doesn't seem to be that much a deal, at least not to give the book a mere one star, when it is clearly a classic and an incredible demonstration of how textbooks should be written. Another reviewer said that there was little content. I just can't believe this, seriously. For a book that boast \\"introduction\\" on its title, it goes way beyond introductions in my opinion (compare this book against others that have nothing to say about the TransRelational model!). If you know Database Systems and the relational model and the theory behind it, you shouldn't be reading any introduction books on the topic (or reviewing them like they should do something else other than introducing the subject). In my opinion, any serious computer scientist or professional IT should read this book and keep it close at hand. But that is just my judgment.*sigh* I can't believe this book has an average of 3.5 starts. I really can't."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Database Systems","review":"I only read the first few chapters. But I found it to be very thorough and interesting. I'll probably finish it at some point. Probably a great reference."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Database Systems","review":"This book really taught me the basics about database. I really had a new understanding and it's a great reference book."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Database Systems","review":"This book is more for students who wants to learn the relational database theory. It's important to know the fundamentals, and this book shows all theory. Otherside, if you work in the database real world, this book is very hard to read and booring. If Chris Date puts more real world examples the book would be a five stars. I don't use this book for a quick reference in my work, but if i want to learn o remember more about a concept, then i use it."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Database Systems","review":"This book introduces the fundamentals of database systems by emphasizing the relational data model, and that a database is really \\"a collection of true .. propositions\\". Although his use of Tutorial-D (rather than SQL) may seem odd, Date emphasizes thinking about data rather than an implementation. This book provides great fundamental thinking about relational variables (relvars), domains, relational algebra, and data normalization.The further topic of missing information contrasts to Codd's four-valued logic, and even if your particular database system supports different Nulls the chapter helps when thinking about your own data. Whether or not you agree with his thinking about object-oriented databases, his \\"Two great blunders\\" are a challenge to any software vendor. His chapter on decision support does not provide much of an introduction to such broad topics as warehousing, OLAP, and data mining, but there are other sources. This is not an easy read, but working through it will pay off when coupled with product training."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Database Systems","review":"Date's treatment of database systems is heavily weighted toward the foundational principles of the relational model. If that is not what you are looking for, this text is not for you. If you want to learn SQL, get a good SQL book. If you want to play with MS-Access, by all means, do so. If you have a five-minute attention span, this book isn't for you. If, however, you wish to understand the foundational principles of database systems and what makes for a \\"good\\" DBMS, this is the text for you. If you can't understand the theory in this book, you have no real business calling yourself a database professional.I had never really looked at database theory before picking up this text, and I had avoided using DBMSs (as being one of the more boring aspects of computer science.) Spending six weeks wading through this book changed my mind on that. Date shows the beauty of the relational model clearly and precisely (I will grant that the emphasis is on precision rather than simplicity.)Date shows the flaws of SQL as well as its power. In this new 7th edition, more than in the earlier edition, he proclaims the way database sytems should be structured, rather than accepting the SQL status quo. He also points out clearly how the so-called object model really isn't a data model at all, and could lead us back to the \\"bad old days\\" of ad-hoc DBMSs with no theoretical underpinnings (and hence no verifiability.)"},{"Title":"An Introduction to Database Systems","review":"I received the fourth edition from my father way back when I was in school. Yes it is hard to read if you don't want to take the time to understand the mathematics and don't want to learn the theory. But 13 years later this is still the book to read if you really want to understand the foundation of relational databases. Don't read this book first if you're learning about relational databases. Read it when you have the time to devote to understanding the concepts and theory. If you understand the theory this book presents, you can and will be able to see and solve problems in your designs that others cannot.All theoretical technical books are meant for you to fundamentally and intuitively understand the subject so you can solve problems and performance issues that sometimes even the vendors can't. If you don't have those problems or you have someone else solve them for you, then don't buy this book. Otherwise consider this book as a must have for relational database design."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Database Systems","review":"In our courses we need a mix of theorical and practical approaches. I found this book to be excellent in academic environments, as well for any person looking for the formal basis of the relational database systems. This book will give us all the formal foundation to start our courses (and more). The author goes beyond the pure formal maths, and introduces us in a wider concept of the database world as a science, unlike other books which performs a more superficial approach. This book will give you a substantial change of your point of view when dealing with real world databases, the answer to many of your questions will be found here. This year (I'm writing this in July 2001) we'll strongly recommend it to our students. I read the spanish version, translated in Mexico, and found the language pretty academical. Far from being a downside, I think this is an advantage in our case. We are talking about science, and perhaps we need minimal language to deal with science. Under this scenary, this book is certainly the way to go. And outside that scenary, in the so-called real world, if you're a daily user of any RDBMS, or programer, or system developer, or DBA, etc. you'll do yourself a big favor if your read this book. Next time when you get involved into a casual discussion with your colleagues, many concepts from Mr. Date's work could take you to an unmatched position when exposing your points of view. Very recommended, indeed."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Database Systems","review":"There is not a more thorough book on the market today that better covers the topic of relational databases, as well as touching on object-oriented systems, and their relationship.

In this point,Date has done the job excellently. I strongly recommend it to the one who already has some practice experiences with DBMS, andwant to go deep in this area.

Date should give technical writing classes to other authors of textbooks. His writing style is extremely readable, and he understands his audience. As previously stated here, this is not a practical guide by any stretch; it is a glimpse into the theoretical basis of databases in general.One particularly clever feature is the author's use of footnotes. Since most of the theory springs from academic wells, Date will cite academic references, and provide some commentary on them that aids in reading the references; this turns out to be an invaluable tool if you are interested in researching the subject in more detail from the original sources.This book was not intended to be a complete discourse on relational theory, nor was it intended to mask any of the details of relational theory -- it was intended to introduce the student to it."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Database Systems","review":"OK, I love this book as the relational model is explained in a good mathematical language. Everybody who wants to know more about the mathematical relational model, this is a very good book for self study. It has exercises at the end of each chapter, and some answers too.There is one big BUT about this book: every ten pages Date is howling about the SQL-92 standard. And this annoyes me very much. It must be some personal frustration that this respected author becomes so low in his disgust of SQL. He tells us in the book that it is a mistake to allow nulls and duplicates in any relational database. But mister Date should know better, there are disadvantages and advantages on every such decision and the way we do it now it relational databases is the most flexible one. If you do not want to use nulls and duplicates in your databases, that is possible. Date, please stop howling and do not write your frustration in your books. Joe Celko writes in SQL for Smarties: &quot;Date is also a vocal opponent of the ANSI/ISO SQL standard efforts, although he has never attended a committee meeting or submitted a paper for consideration&quot;.But if you do mind or do not mind his SQL comments, it still is a very good book."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Database Systems","review":"As one of E.F. Codd's closest associates Chris Date has long provided the world with some of the most insightful writings on the relational model of data management. Much to their proponents chagrin, he also writes incisively about the various &quot;improvements&quot; to the relational model.Those who are looking for a cookbook approach to any specific DBMS platform will be sorely disapointed. This book will not help you obtain your MCDBA, OCP, or any other alphabet-soup certification. However, for anyone looking for a firm foundation of data management fundamentals and the practical implications of such, this is THE book to read.Chris' style of writing tends to be a bit academic and precise. This quality does turn some folks off, but it is this quality that makes his writing so valuable. Read it, re-read it and learn this stuff! No one can seriously consider themselves a data management professional without a good grasp of the material in this book. This is the book that other authors refer to when they want to get their facts straight."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Database Systems","review":"Any professional who has worked for long in the relational database area knows this is the best reference around. It is an exceptionally well done explanation at the professional level of the results of research in relational database theory.

I finally found a book which matches the Software environment Module of the NCC Advance diploma in Computer Science (UK). It not only matches the syllabus, but also give in-depth information of all the topics covered in the NCC notes. I have recommended the book to hundreds of students of my class, but they are not available currently. They do not stay long on our shlves here, in Mauritius, as our University students use it also."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Database Systems","review":"This book is not good for anyone that wants to get into the practical applications of Relational Databases immediately. This book is geared to people interested in learning the theoretical analysis of Relational Databases stemming from mathematical analysis. This approach is highly impractical for real-world applications and will remain as conversation material for academics. This book is frustrating to read since the author constantly makes references to material that is not addressed in this book, illegal use of SQL (utilizing the &quot;#&quot; for illustration purposes) and not indicating clearly how his examples have deviated from the way it is &quot;traditionally done&quot;. The author is frustrated and spends too much time berating other people's work, and his attempt to explain SQL is poorly illustrated. This book is mistakenly referred to as the bible of relational databases and the only explanation I can think for this is that it has been around for so long and read by so many people that are endeared by the unreachable tone of his writing, that they assume this is how it should be written. After seven editions I would expect perfection, and this book is a far cry from it. Spend your money and desire to understand the theory behind Relational Databases somewhere else."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Database Systems","review":"I was recommended to buy this book as a source of my graduate study... but after I read this book, database system was confused more in my mind. that's WHY I withdraw a complete course.

Buy another book that simply explain database is better than buying this book.No one will understand any thing"},{"Title":"An Introduction to Database Systems","review":"The book is (was) considered a classic, so I decided to read it.I have about 10 years data base experience. I'm not a hard core DB developer, but I've seen my share of databases and written a fair amount of complex SQL code.I wanted to learn more of the fundamentals and theory of database architecture and design.I found the book painful to read and got little out of it. I would have been sad to have had this as a college text book. Its not thats its theoretical, I just got nothing out of it. There are other database design books I found much more interesting.I will instead read a broad range of database design books based on some of the reviews here on Amazon."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Database Systems","review":"I also started reading this book with hopes of discovering the &quot;bible&quot; that everyone was raving about. After struggling with the first three chapters I came to realize that Date is a &quot;genius&quot; who simply cannot construct a simple, intelligible sentence! I'm sure the author is &quot;brilliant&quot; and that this work is a &quot;masterpiece,&quot; but frankly, people who can't write simply shouldn't be published! Not at all recommended."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Database Systems","review":"I cannot believe so many people gave this book such high ratings.Date has no clue on writing structured English. The man has more than 4 clauses per sentence and this is not including the clauses in the brackets.Publishers need to pay more attention when editing.Only logically conclusion is that Date thinks in SQL and hence his English looks like SQL.Waste of money."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Database Systems","review":"This book is an introduction to database systems as seen from the application developer. It covers the basics of databases (most importantly the relational databases), SQL (and variants) normal forms and many other things from ther viewpoint of the application programmer. It explains why things are done like they are. It does not provide a good guide on how to design database applications or databases, nor does it help you implement your own database system. It is mostly just a theoretical text book to give an introduction to database theory. However all in all it does contain some useful information.Unfortunately this extremely poorly written and uses far too many words to explain so little. In fact, I often found myself almost falling asleep while reading it and then missing important information when it finally was there.This book are constantly updated to new editions - and this shows in a bad way. It is full of notes, asides and footnotes and the structure is terrible. One place it has a foot note that spans over three pages. This is unacceptable!In the end I cannot recommend this book. It is way to long, not focused and extremely dull. There are much better books on databases out there. Avoid this one."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Database Systems","review":"Based on the title and the price, I expected the book to be a matured (8th edition), undergraduate-level text that introduced the reader to databases, complete with color diagrams. It wasn't. After reading the first 8 chapters (250 pages) I've learned nothing of any PRACTICAL use (note that I've learned a few things, but they can't be applied directly to my job). In fact, if this were the only source on databases I'd ever read, I would be less prepared for my job than if I had simply read a &quot;Teach Yourself ...&quot; type book: one would be much better off with one of those books if he/she wanted an introduction to databases. And for those who appreciate the use of full-color graphics to help explain concepts, forget about it. There are only a handful of diagrams and they are black and white, simple renderings: the rest of the figures are mostly just text set off from the rest of the page. Also, it uses so called &quot;Tutorial D&quot; language throughout, so you have to learn it in order to follow the discussions. The book is too formal for an introduction and would lose readers not already familiar with the topic. If an &quot;introduction&quot; book is going to be formal and an??-retentive, it should first teach the reader the concepts by analogy or by simple example or by some other intuitive means, and only then introduce the equivalent formal discussion. This book doesn't do that.The author does know the subject, and the book does has worth...just not as an introduction to databases or as the sole means of learning about databases."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Database Systems","review":"This is an absolutely horrible book. It is in NO WAY an &quot;Introduction&quot;. I found that the text is so dense that I can only read for 10 minutes at a time.

I am returning it and will purchase an alternate book."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Database Systems","review":"I dislike this book. A lot.It seems like it could be a nice reference guide for some middle manager who needs to know &quot;the lingo&quot;, but that's about all.One problem is that it has WAY too much stuff in it to be an introduction book. This alone is enough to make me look the other way. However, add to that the fact that this book covers almost no SQL (seems that Mr. Date doesn't like SQL--he even says so) and you have a pretty usless book.I have a &quot;real world&quot; job where I work with databases (and SQL) regularly. I deal directly with &quot;real&quot; database people. I have never heard any of them use the terms Date dreamed up in this book. Instead of sticking with the common terms (table, row, column, etc) he has to make up new words.He also is not a very clear writer. I'm certainly no english major, but I would expect a published work to be written better than this! Especially since it's a technical book! Clarity is key in this situation, and he just don't deliver.I'm all for theory-based courses and books, but this book causes more confusion than any other text book I have ever had to use. There is very little connection to the way the real world works and to me that is simply the wrong way to approach a subject. Luckily I have real world experience with databases, or else I would be totaly lost.

I got a problem I am running out of $$ to buy the book!!"},{"Title":"An Introduction to Database Systems","review":"I read an earlier edition of the book back in the mid 90s. At the time, that was the first serious book on relational database theory I read. I thought the earlier edition was a great introduction to the topic. It was a tough \\"college textbook\\" read, but well worth it.I would no longer recommend the latest version as an introductory text. One gripe is Date's introduction of his own language \\"Tutorial-D\\" to explain and illustrate concepts. There is no one place in the book you can go to for a comprehensive description of Tutorial-D. Instead, snippets of it are peppered throughout the text. Another gripe: he can be long-winded and pedantic, and he uses phrases like \\"mutatis mutandi.\\" I understand he is a man with a mission to be exacting and precise. But somehow, he seems to have overdone it in this edition.The latest edition has many new chapters on object-relational, temporal databases, logic databases, and decision support systems. These are very convenient overviews, as always, filtered through Date's unerring and zealous devotion to the underlying relational theory.I think if you already understand relational theory and you are a practitioner in the field, this is still a comprehensive \\"must have book.\\" But if you are starting out, you will want a kinder-and-gentler introduction. The \\"love-it-or-hate-it\\" reviews seems to support this viewpoint.I rated it 4 stars because (1) it is a classic (2) it is comprehensive (3) it is a reference work that any serious practitioner will want and (4) it has extensive and well-annotated references at the end of each chapter.I withheld the 5th star for the gripes I mentioned above."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Database Systems","review":"(Note this review applies to the sixth edition of this book).If you wish to quickly jump into database design without a full and rigorous knowledge of database theory (by no means a bad thing) then this book is not for you. If, however, you want a thorough grounding in the principles and practice of database theory considered from an academic standpoint, then this book is highly recommended.Date is one of the giant figures of relational database theory, and this masterful work covers, in exhaustive detail, all the elementary principles of the subject. The book commences with an overview of database systems and management, before moving on to introduce the relational model. Part II of the book covers in great detail the relational model, introducing the relational algebra and the relational calculus (and then showing the formal equivalence of the two). The SQL language is introduced.Part III discusses database design, with special emphasis on the vital topics of nonloss decomposition, functional dependencies and normalisation. For practical database designers this is perhaps the most valuable part of the book. Part IV covers data protection from the standpoints of integrity and implementation in practical systems.Part V gathers a miscellany of related topics such as optimization of queries, a discussion of the 'NULL' problem and an introduction to ditributed (i.e. client/server) database systems. Part VI is an introduction to object-oriented database systems, with an examination of the problems faced by traditional relational systems when faced with object-oriented problems.It is important to note the target audience for this book. This book is first and foremost academic by nature. Rigour is not sacrificed for conciseness or simplicity. It is textually dense, especially parts II and III (far and away the most important parts). The reader will have to put in a lot of work to fully grasp the details of the concepts. For example, Date's definition of third normal form (3NF): &quot;A relation is in 3NF if and only if it is in 2NF and every nonkey attribute is nontransitively dependent on the primary key&quot;. To appreciate in detail the significance of this definition requires substantial effort. However, this effort will pay dividends when the time comes to actually design a real-world system. Failure to understand the principles of database theory at this level of rigour lies behind many failed implementation attempts. Not every database designer needs this knowledge, but a manager of a large database project certainly does. I would not recommend this book as an introductory text for an undergraduate course in database design, due to the large quantity of material covered and its highly theoretical exposition. I would, however, strongly recommend it for students at a higher level, professional database designers and implementors of database management systems."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Database Systems","review":"This is not a how-to, it is a how-to-understand. I own multiple editions of this book starting with the 3rd, when many of the examples referred to RBase. It won't tell you, with simple color diagrams and cut-and-paste examples, how to optimize your Oracle SQL queries or tune your DB/2 engine, but it will teach you the underlying principles of relational databases, from which the serious professional will be able to extrapolate. If you have the intelligence and stomach for it and you actually read it, it will serve you much better than the SQL in 24 hours picture books that some reviewers seem to be looking for -- it is a timeless and effective conceptual work on the subject that spans the evolution of commercial product implementations. Dilitantes and desperadoes, head for the Dummies aisle -- this one's not for you."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Database Systems","review":"Sorry, no full-color graphics, and no included disk full of fill-in-the-blank examples and wizards to build your contact list. This is an old-fashioned academic tome, not a how-to book or thinly-disguised marketing tool for some commercial database system.I suppose the biggest criticism I could make of this book is that it overestimates the target audience. Unfortunately, many who see the title of this book assume that it will teach them how to work with current database products such as Oracle, or maybe SQL Server and Access. No, this book doesn't show you how to create an invoicing system for your bicycle shop, or a web content management system. What it will show you is the conceptual underpinning of the relational data model, how to understand relational database systems in general (not everything is SQL, you know), and provide some heavy insight into how relational databases should be designed.In that sense, it can be considered an &quot;introductory&quot; book for software engineers, who might themselves create a new database management system. It can also be considered introductory for database administrators and systems programmers who are looking to expand their knowledge beyond the product-specific practical methods they have been exposed to. In other words, if you just want to know &quot;how things are done&quot; in your industry, don't read this book. If you want some insights into how things COULD be done much better, you might want to read this book.So, while I might not recommend this book to a junior programmer tasked with creating his/her first web-based ordering system, I might recommend it to the company DBA or systems architect. Even more, I would recommend this book to anyone studying C/C++, and looking to start a career in software engineering, possibly to help create new database systems. This book doesn't discuss specific implementation in C++ or anything like that but it provides an excellent target feature set and language spec for development, as well as a clarification of the formal logic behind relational database management."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Database Systems","review":"An introduction to Database systems is an excellent work and to call this work an introduction is misleading (Date explains in the preface why he chose to call it an introduction). The work is theoretically extremely dense and it requires a lot of effort to fully understand all the concepts that Date treats really exhaustively throughout the book. The book gives in-depth insight into database design concepts and it breaks every term and concept down to the bone.The style in wich the book is written makes for pleasant reading and Date's use of the English language is brilliant. Date is certainly a master of database theory and I can recommend this book to everybody who is serious about the underlying concepts of the relational database model. As an academical textbook - this book is not intended for undergraduate study but for post-graduate study it is a winner.If there is one thing that I can complain about it is that the book sheds too few light on the theory of database optimization. I hope that the 8th Ed. will also cover this topic more extensively."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Database Systems","review":"This is the best technical book I have ever read (and I have read many). This book was required for a graduate school database class at Carnegie Mellon. Although I read the class required chapters, I found little time to really read the book while in school. Since graduation (I am now a consultant) I have returned to this book constantly. It is the perfect text for those who want a solid and analytical background in the subject of relational databases. I have spoken with other classmates from CMU who feel it is the most valuable book they have. C. J. Date, one of the leaders in this field, covers relational theory, relational algebra and calculus, database design, ERD's, as well as SQL. I would encourage readers to set up the sample SUPPLIER-ORDERS-PARTS database to really leverage the examples used in the text. This book will have a longer life than any other technical book you ever purchase. A must have."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Database Systems","review":"I suppose there are two potential audiences for an introductory database book. The first audience consists of developers who need to know the very basics about databases to design and implement a database computer application. For that group I would recommend Date's book, but only upon having sufficient \\"computer science maturity\\": i.e. having taken one year of programming, and possibly a course in discrete mathematics and/or data structures and algorithms. Without this maturity much of what Date writes will be very hard to appreciate if not comprehend. True, he gives numerous examples that are quite understandable, but he also spends many paragraphs discussing somewhat abstract issues to the novice that will make him or her want to skip ahead. A good example of this is the notion of thinking of a table as the current value of a relvar, or the importance of closure in the relational algebra. The paragraphs he spends on these subtle importances will frustrate the uninitiated reader.For someone who does not believe that he or she has the maturity to handle this book, and simply wants to develop an application that requires a database, I would recommend buying a more \\"down-to-earth\\" book possibly covering the RDMS that will be used. For example, if it is MySQL, then one might want to purchaseWelling's \\"MySQL Tutorial\\" (ISBN: 0672325845) for a much gentler and user-friendly introduction (or better yet the PHP and MySQL web development book if a web application is desired).The other audience for this book are the professionals who are in charge of managing a database and/or using a database server for an industrial-strength application. In this case, Date's book is mandatory reading. May be not all of it, but certainly Parts I-IV. Reading these parts will give the professional the needed perspective on all the considerations required for successfully using or managing a database system.In the world of database systems, Chris Date is one of the few authors who understands the importance of every minute detail involved with successfully using and managing databases. He proves that in this book, in a style that is not only academic but also quite useful and practical (especially his chapters on the relational algebra and calculus)."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Database Systems","review":"Date's seminal work is critical to understanding databases - a step mostly forgotten by those who believe every concept can be taught using commercial products with brain-dead examples in under 24 hours. Date teaches the logic and theory that underlie all successful practice.

I now actually understand the basis of complex database topics such as cursors, data models, and concurrency/locking topics that previously are skimmed over in other books and training guides. Best book for a beginner and yeah its a bit dry and academic but CJ Date writes clearly.

I actually asked for this book as a Christmas present last year (call me a geek...it's ok), and I have pushed my way through quite a bit of it. I have 3 years experience in RDBMS only on MS SQL Server. This book is important because it suppliments everything that was originally intended to be the definitive RDBMS design from the master E.F. Codd. Now, you could look at this book on the surface and say it is &quot;usless,&quot; but trust me you'd be making the wrong judgement. Every senior DBA that I have worked with over the past 3 years studied this text in earlier editions. Trust me, they have all been gurus. My current manager even worked at Sybase for a while. You will be doing yourself a disservice if you push this book aside without giving it its due treatement. The word &quot;introduction&quot; is ambiguous. It's not really an introduction at all. If you are an MS DBA like me remember this important point: a Microsoft DBA can have it easier at times because of the care MS has put into make it's RDBMS fit into NT or 2000. Life can seem pretty fundamental or &quot;real world&quot;(whatever that means) in the MS world. Date's lessons might not seem valuable up front. If you put just a little thought into it you'd realize that what's being discussed in this book suppliments the life of a &quot;DBA.&quot; Remember, the &quot;A&quot; is for administrator. If you're an administrator a system, you're not going to find this book extrememly useful. However, start designing a database from scratch even in SQL Server, without abiding to Codd and Date and I wish you good luck. Be careful when you evaluate this book.

I believe she was working for a better world."},{"Title":"Constantinople in the Age of Justinian","review":"Glanville Downey was a major American mid-twentieth century scholar of Roman history and most especially the Roman Near East. Search in Amazon under books for \\"Glanville Downey - Constantinople\\" to find all of the various editions of this book that are available. The Dorset reprint in hardcover is generally the most available and least expensive. This work is a short and selective consideration of its topic. However, by his choice of material and its arrangement, the author has been able to accomplish a great deal. Downey states that this work is aimed at a non-specialist audience, however, to glean the most from this study some background in Byzantine history would be helpful.First, the historical Constantinople is covered followed by a description of Constantinople in the time of Justinian the Great. The contemporary emperorship is then described with a very insightful explanation of Eusebius's religious justification of a Christian emperor. This justification provides for a smooth intellectual transition from the pagan past to the Christian present. The immense legal reforms and codification of Justinian are then covered and their significance is explicated. A short section on the expansion of the Empire follows. A major consideration of Justinian the builder is provided. Interestingly, the last third of the book deals with religion in one way or another. The consideration here is magisterial in my estimation. The divine liturgy then current is described in detail followed by a very clear, if not overly detailed, explanation of the post Chalcedon problems with the maintenance of Christian orthodoxy and Justinian's efforts to solve those problems. That this explanation is understandable to any reasonably literate reader is in and of itself a major achievement. Lastly, the transition to Christian education is covered.In describing Constantinople of the mid-sixth century and Justinian the Roman emperor, Downey leads the reader naturally into his contention that religion was most pivotal to the events of the era. And, he more than adequately supports that contention with fact and interpretation. A picture of a strong, industrious, impatient, and pious Justinian emerges. The narrative is vivid and flowing but dense and full of meaning. Carefully reading this delightful book will provide the reader with a clear image of both the city and the emperor along with his court and to a lesser degree the empire. Byzantine art and architecture are not covered. No notes are given, but a useful select bibliography of sources prior to 1960, the date of original publication, is provided. For any reader with more than a casual interest in the Byzantine empire, this is a must read. I believe there is something to be gained here by all but the most advanced specialist in Byzantine history."},{"Title":"Constantinople in the Age of Justinian","review":"Ever since Gibbon spent several volumes dismissing the Byzantine Empire as a mass of oriental conspiracies and ridiculous religious conspiracies, numerous scholars have spent pen and ink to rehabilitate successor to the Roman Empire. The Eastern Empire has much to recommend it. It lasted for nearly 1,000 years after Rome, combine the heritage of Rome and Greek learning in a Christian context but never really abandoning its pagan heritage as much as sublimating it following Theodosius I's decree forcing Christianity on the Roman world whether it liked it or not. This book examines the Byzantine Empire under Justinian when it was at its zenith. There is much to recommend this era as Glanville Downey demonstrates in this work, part of the University of Oklahoma's Centers of Civilization series. While not as learned as Ostrogorsky or Vasiliev, or accessible as Norwich, this is an excellent overview of the empire at its heightThe thesis that Gibbon advances in \\"The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\\" is not without its factual basis. Both Justinian and his empress Theodora were on opposite sides during the wasteful Momophysite dispute over the exact number of natures of Christ, which Theodora, the former Hippodrome performer, hiding people who held that Christ had only one nature in the palace. This dispute would lead to Egypt and Syria embracing Islam in the future, but Justinian did not to cope with Islam as a rival monotheist religion.Downey examines a number of aspects of the empire under Justinian and here he has the advantage of the various books written by Procopius, two of which celebrate the achievements of the age in both architecture and warfare, the third the various scandalous goings on in the palace with particular attention paid to Theordora's theatrical career which generally involved cavorting on stage naked and with a number of domestic animals in attendance.Along with the Justinian's buildings, which included Haigia Sophia, widely acknowledged as the wonder of the time, it was perhaps his ability to achieve a kind of synthesis of both Jerusalem and Athens, which gave his age its character. The design of the church was based on an old Roman model and its construction forms a major section of the book. However it was the ability of the Byzantines to integrate the classical Greek heritage into the Christian era, which gave the age its strength. It probably would be impossible to consider Justinian's legal reforms without the heritage of Plato, Aristotle, Herodotus and Thucydides to back it up.Downey also explores the political culture of the age which has far greater implications than just the Byzantine state. Anyone wishing to understand how Russian political culture has developed might wish to read the chapter that addresses how the emperor was regarded and the roles that commentators laid out. It does not matter whether one is examining the Great Prince of Kiev, the Grand Duke of Muscovy, the Tsar, the General Secretary of the Communist Party, or the presidency of New Russia, the origins of Russian's autocratic culture lie on the shores of the Bosporus.Justinian's foreign policy was to attempt to recapture all the lands of the former Roman Empire and he was successful, at least in the short term. However the Byzantine Empire was always to be short of resources when it came to defending its interests and the conquests did not long last the death of Justinian. A resurgent east following the creation of Islam and a growing west would bedevil Justinian's successors much as two sides of vice and in the end destroy this remnant of Rome.This book by Downey is intended to form a kind of trilogy of the late classical cities of the Eastern Mediterranean to include Gaza and Antioch and their role as centers of civilization. If these works are as good as this one, then they will prove to be interesting indeed."},{"Title":"Casanova's Homecoming","review":"Arthur Schnitzler is today a fairly obscure Austrian novelist and playwright of the early 1900's. He's received some attention recently because his novella \\"Dream Story\\" inspired Kubrick's \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\". (\\"Dream Story\\" is also excellent and can help you understand the movie.) \\"Casanova's Homecoming\\", if you can find a copy, is well worth reading--compact, simply told, carefully plotted, thoroughly thought-provoking. It relates a fictitious episode in Casanova's life when he has become an old man of 53. Most of his charm and all of his money are gone, but his cravings and amorality remain. Quite by chance, he comes to visit the home of an old acquaintance who is much indebted to him, and immediately sets out upon a dark seduction. It is a story about growing old, about how one's struggle to remain young can become pathetic and ugly even when it succeeds. Schnitzler likes to write about sex, dreams, coincidence, free-thinking, and deep mysteries of the soul--\\"Casanova's Homecoming\\" gets you thinking about all these themes, mainly because it's very hard to ascertain Schnitzler's attitude toward Casanova--does he like him? Loathe him? Pity him? Does he have any feeling toward him at all? After reading this, you may find yourself asking many such questions. This may have been the author's intent: his writing seems designed to provoke questions rather than provide answers.

For those of us working on older cards (i.e., pre-Fleer/Donruss) these monthly price guides will give you prices, but are not much help in terms of determining what cards you need to complete your set. So if you are trying to finish up your 1953, 1966, and 1967 Topps sets, then it is necessary for you to know ALL the cards so when you hit the card shows you are prepared for dealers who organized their cards by numbers, players, or random piles. With the &quot;Beckett Baseball Card Price Guide 2003) you have your best shot at finding out exactly what is out there for the set(s) on which you are currently working. In practical terms the prices quoted are going to be more valid the farther back you go, but the key thing about these Price Guides is that they list all the cards, including all the extras, inserts, special sets and the like from Bowman, Diamond Stars, Donruss, Fleer, Goudey, Play Ball, Score, Sportsflics, Topps. Upper Deck and whatever other companies have sprung up that I cannot remember off the top of my head in all their infinite variations. Beckett continues to be the Price Guide I use to put together my want list for the next card show or for checking out on line auctions. This is especially important when a set has numbers missing (it happens), so that you can avoid desperately searching for cards that are not there (e.g., the 1953 Topps set has 274 cards from #1 Jackie Robinson to #280 Milt Bolling).

Some statements are opinions, but some of the statements are actually errors. I would like to respond.1. When I bought the property in October 2001 I continued (but did not initiate) the opt out of the single contract with HUD. The previous owners had begun the process, but had not informed the tenants. I met with the tenants immediately and explained the opt out process, and their rights to have Enhanced Vouchers, giving them special rights to STAY at the property.2. One basic and essential right of Enhanced Vouchers is that the tenant will NEVER pay more than 30% of their income, no matter what the contract rent. The contract rent had no bearing on what my tenants would pay.3. Anyone who was evicted for non-payment was opting not to pay the normal family portion of 30% of income. Less than 5 tenants were evicted. Some tenants left to take advantage of the Enhanced Voucher to relocate outside of central New Haven, to be in a less urban environment, or to be closer to their now grown-up children.4. Since 2001 I have continued to operate the building adhering to my goal of having a mixture of different kinds of tenants, from many different races and nationalities, and I have kept my promise to retain the original tenants, many of whom are \\"overhoused,\\" that is, living in a multi-bedroom unit as a single person (their family having grown up and moved away). Since HUD offers a subsidy for ONLY ONE YEAR after it is aware of overhousing, I took on subsidizing the difference for these tenants by accepting a ONE bedroom contract rent for the TWO and THREE bedroom apartments the tenants were inhabiting. Ovella Watts is still a tenant in the same apartment she has occupied all these years, even though she technically would have had to move if I had not stepped in and accepted the lower rent.5. Although it is difficult to make improvements to occupied apartments, I have offered to each of my long-term tenants to choose an improvement they want (which is in addition to appropriate maintenance). One section 8 tenant recently asked for a hardwood floor to be installed in her living room, which we did.6. I have an excellent relationship with all my tenants at 65 Dwight Street, especially my section 8 tenants whom I have now known for over 6 years.7.

The book highlights their spirituality and explores their experiences and missionary activities in the light of the challenges posed to church and society by third-world women today. The chapters not only discuss the lives of these women disciples but draw our attention to the all-too-similar experiences of discrimination, prejudice, injustice, and oppression which form a disturbing and poignant parallelism between these biblical women and their sisters today. As a way of deepening the reader's spirituality and Christian commitment, each chapter also includes suggestions for prayer and reflection as well as for Christian praxis. -- from book's back cover"},{"Title":"Tarascon Pocket Orthopaedica","review":"I got this manual about a year ago as a gift, and I have really gotten a lot out of it. It's filled with very useful information, and it'll save your neck on a daily basis, at least. Ever since I got it, many of the other residents in my hospital have been buying it, and the consensus is that it can make your life a whole lot easier. The anatomy section is probably one of the most consulted ones, with a very good table with the origin and insertion of every muscle in the body, along with innervation. Of course, the handbook isn't really complete, as there are many omissions, especially in orthopaedic ailments. The trauma section is quite good, but there are many fracture classifications missing.Obviously, no handbook of this size can ever include every single item you'll need at one point or another, but this one does a good job of covering all the bases, and it's a tool no ortho resident will want to go without (and probably many attendings, as well)"},{"Title":"Tarascon Pocket Orthopaedica","review":"Tarascon Pocket Orthopaedica initially looks like another attempt at fitting both useful and trivia information (which the bosses seemed to always ask even though its trivia) in your pocket; except it IS thin and small enough for most pockets and it is full of ORGANISED data.While certainly not for exams or sorts, I use it for the 5 minutes break in between cases and a quick lookup on anatomical stuff (I really like the muscle lists).

Enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Mountains of Spices","review":"Before I begin the review, I would strongly recommend that you read \\"Hinds Feet in High Places\\" before this book.Mountains of Spices is a wonderful allegory of the various plants mentioned in \\"Song of Songs\\" and assinging them various qualities, which are in fact the qualities of Christ and parallel the Fruits of the Spirit (Galatians). In the prologue, Ms. Hurnard talks of seeing the ninefold Fruit of the Spirit and the nine spices mentioned in the \\"garden enclosed\\" and the \\"orchard of pomegranates\\" in \\"Song of Songs.\\" She does point out that she takes artistic license with some of the qualities she assigns to the spices, but is overall very faithful to the Bible verses that inspired the story.The allegory of the people - in a similar fashion to Hinds' Feet - is more aspects of our personalities and how the Shephard can mold us, through Love. Much-Afraid (now named \\"Grace and Glory\\") yearns to return to the Valley to comfort her relatives who were too afraid/proud/etc. to go to the High Places. She learns from the Shephard on the various Mountains of Spices how she herself can be an ambassador of Peace.I can strongly identify with the people who are transformed by Love in its many forms and feel so inspired by this little book.

How wonderful to see the Shepherd give new names to replace their old ones. See how the Shepherd is able to develop Hind's Feet for those who cannot physically journey with Him to the High Places. Learn also about the nature of the fruits of the Holy Spirit. I read this book with the same inner joy and excitement when I read Hind's Feet. Before I read this book, I was hoping for a sequel to Hind's Feet when God answered my prayer.

I like it very much. However my favorite part by far is the corresponding chapters on the fruits of the Spirit, and I often go back and read them. In each one the King takes Grace and Glory to a new mountain of a ring of nine, each representing a different fruit of the Spirit & teaching it by comparison with spices listed in Song of Songs (or someplace). She describes how that plant corresponds to that Spirit, and He teaches her about it. Then she goes down into the Valley for the days work. He teacher her a song for each one. One of my favorites is something like this:Love must give and give and giveLove must die or shareOnly then can true love liveFruitful everywhere.(from Gentleness I think, also the following:)'The King and Grace and Glory came, just before sunrise, to the Mountain of Calamus, where the spices of gentleness were cultivated...she stood still in delighted surprise, for stretching before her were fields of slender reeds, swaying in the breeze and tossing lightly in rhythmical motion like waves on a slightly rolling sea...He pointed out to her the exquisite grace and lovely, unresisting meekness with which they bowed themselves before the wind, sometimes right to the ground, only to sweep upward again without effort when the wind had passed over them...'They know how to be abased and how to be exalted' ..she realized that the lovely fragrance that exuded from them and which men call gentleness, sympathy and loving understanding was developed by the daily practice of bending submissively to life's difficult circumstances without bitterness, resent or self-pity.'etc. etc. etc. It's really quite good.I've had this book for fifteen years and still go back and read the fruits of the spirit parts regularly (as God seems to be teaching me about that fruit!) It was originally published in 1977 - not many books stay in print for thirty years."},{"Title":"Mountains of Spices","review":"This book is an excellent follow-up to Hinds Feet on High Places.

Hana Hannard's style of writing bring forth in a simple and plainly understandable way, the working of the fruit of the Holy Spirit in the life of the believer."},{"Title":"Mountains of Spices","review":"I bought this book after enjoying \\"Hind's Feet in High Places.\\" It continues the story, which is very explicit Christian allegory. The writing is not particularly good, but the first book was thought-provoking in its message.I found the message of this book troubling. It seemed to confuse sacrificing yourself for another's good with enduring and accepting their abuse. Allowing others to abuse you benefits no one. You can and should love the abuser -- God does -- but you should not enable or empower abuse, whether it is towards others or towards yourself. It is not the Christian duty of a wife whose husband beats her to stick around for a second helping; it is, arguably, her duty to prevent this from happening, not just for her own sake, but also for that of the husband and of the children.Notably, Jesus did not yield to every form of abuse he encountered. He fled from those who pursued him (Luke 4:30, John 11:54). He told his disciples to buy swords (meaning of this is debated), and to flee (Luke 22:36, Matthew 10:23). And He was very vocal in protecting others from abuse, including women and children (Mark 10:14, Luke 17:2, John 8:7)."},{"Title":"Mountains of Spices","review":"This book is a great sequel to the book by the same author, Hinds Feet On High Places.

Brandon is intrigued even if a little unsettled with Sash, he finds himself believing her, and while the kidnappers changing demands seem to keep them from getting closer to Sweet, the pressure of those demands binds the two of them ever closer together.Brandon had to call on his friend Sinclar Reasoner from SIN for a little assistance, I was glad Crystal let us peak in at Nedra and Sin, that is a couple I hope she gives us more of in the future.

Sash boldly assaults one kidnapper. Eluding his grasp, she searches the house for her brother only to realize he has been moved to another location. She makes good her desperate escape, seeking out a name she overheard spoken by the kidnappers.When the strange woman approaches him, Brandon Plaine thinks she is crazy. There is no connection between this unemployed law school graduate and himself. Fame brings out all kinds of kooks, and he assumes she is just one more, albeit an attractive one. Then Sash mentions a few key words spoken by the kidnappers, and the situation becomes extremely personal.Author Crystal Rhodes pens a fascinating romantic suspense in SWEET SACRIFICE. Bold and sassy, Sash allows no one to intimidate her in her quest to rescue her brother. She and Brandon initially clash; she does not like him and he does not trust her. Their clashes add a delightful tension to the narrative that neatly underscores the dire situation in which they find themselves. Sash does occasionally appear ungrateful, however, for Brandon's aid. Nevertheless, her tension and irresistibility are easily understood with her brother's life on the line.

I did not have chronic illness at the time, but I thought that such a day might come. In January 2005 I began using this as part of my quiet reading each day (the book goes from January 1 to December 31). I quickly realized that this is not only for those with chronic illnesses; it is also for those who work with others who are afflicted with some ongoing condition, be it physical, mental, or spiritual. This includes family members and friends, clergy and social workers, nurses and doctors, teachers, and even those who work a cash register in a retail store. In short, this book is for anyone who wishes to discover a deeper level of life and learn not to be afraid of that which we cannot control or limit.The brief quotes alone are worth the price of this little book. These come from Greek philosophers and poets of old as well as from contemporary writers. Each day begins with a quote that underscores the topic for the day. Here are two: \\"Nothing has a stronger influence psychologically on their environment, and especially on their children, than the unlived lives of parents\\" (Carl Jung). \\"Just because everything is different, doesn't mean anything has changed\\" (Irene Peters).The author arrives at the heart of the matter in each day's reading.

Why would a person criticize a book aimed at helping kids? It's a great book and very insightful. i would recommend that parents and youths read it. Everyone would benefit. Read it with an open heart &amp; Mind."},{"Title":"Please Don't Tell My Parents:: Answers for Kids in Crisis","review":"Chances are this book will be used a lot as a last straw of hope. Some kids will listen - some won't. It's value is with those who are close to the edge. Those over the edge may just react with anger and chuck it. But, it's worth a shot."},{"Title":"Please Don't Tell My Parents:: Answers for Kids in Crisis","review":"This book is very good in it's purpose and it's text. It gives the stories of teens in crisis and the author offers solutions on how the teens can get out of their mess by trusting in the Lord and realizing he is the answer, which I have done personally. Although things get long-winded, it is very helpful. I encourage anyone with questions to get this book"},{"Title":"Please Don't Tell My Parents:: Answers for Kids in Crisis","review":"This book was given to me by a relative in the hope that I'd clean up my act. Guess what! I didn't, the book made me gag. Thank you for trying to tell me God loves and to be a good little girl, but no thanks, a lot of the answers I rejected because they sucked. The answers on dating were stupid, and reaction to pre-marital sex was laughable. All in all, don't buy this book unless you're at gunpoint."},{"Title":"Studies in Ch'an and Hua-Yen (Kolowalu Book)","review":"This is a valuable contribution to the field of Chinese Buddhist studies. It contains important papers from leading Buddhologists such as Luis Gomez. Also, any article by Robert Gimello is worth reading, as he is an extraordinarily careful scholar. Unfortunately, the typeset is quite unattractive. Still, it is a great addition to any Sinological or Buddhological library."},{"Title":"Followed by Heavy Rain: Over-Forties Travel, Romance and Adventure","review":"Followed by heavy rainI was amused the way Chris and Cec decided to write this book. They probably said, &quot;well we experienced everything together so let's write together but from our own point of view&quot;. So, this they did, each taking turns in describing events along the way and what a long way they went. I found myself experiencing what they were feeling. Chris in her own zany way, self indulgent I thought at first but I later accepted her graphic gripes as trying to help the reader feel what she was feeling and this did come out in lots of amusing anecdotes and stories and confirmed to me that this was an enjoyable but difficult journey . Cec though, a different kettle of fish. He was more rounded in his descriptions, seeming more to take it in his stride but find later that it is a mere facade and there's a lot more going on underneath. His writing is comfortable and concise and feel there's a lot more he could achieve with this medium This is a good read and feel I shall enjoy the book on the second read. They were brave to do what they did. I truly appreciate all that they achieved knowing I could not have done so. They have given me the feeling that I have been on the journey with them but without the hassle. Well done!Neville Morley"},{"Title":"Dead Glamorous: The Autobiography of Seduction & Self-Destruction","review":"This book is genuinely mean-spirited. The author is full of her &quot;poor little gorgeous me&quot; self-pity, which she amplifies with cardboard characterizations of her unliked relatives and tiresome references to old movies - not that she brings any original insights to these.The great sin of this novel is that the writer/narrator sets herself up as a diva of pain. It takes a while for you to realize that everyone in the book except this woman is in pain. She it seems is thin, rich, happily married and scornful. All those around her are fair fodder for her cruelty. And while I daresay the childhood she describes was awful, her total lack of interest in anyone other than herself serves as an effective dampening to your pity.I'm a very non-critical reader and I love almost all books. I hated this."},{"Title":"Dead Glamorous: The Autobiography of Seduction & Self-Destruction","review":"This book is genuinely mean-spirited.

In the first part, the author reviews the definition of a well-written paragraph before focusing on 4 types of pragraph: cause-effect, classification, compare-contrast, and descriptive. In the other part, 4 corresponding types of essays are covered with detailed intructions, samples and writing practice. As an ESL student who wants to improve writing skills, I find this book very intriguing and rewarding. The instructions are concise, clear and easy to follow. The samples are carefully compiled with detailed explanations of how a word is used.

She is going to marry Dane Grover, the man of her dreams, as soon as her aunt Louise Marlow arrives tomorrow. Her roommate Anita Bonsal is secretly jealous of her fortune. Anita is having an affair with a married man who is getting a divorce. Anita goes to visit him, Carver L. Clements, but leaves earlier so they won't be caught together. When Carver doesn't show up, she returns and finds him dead! Now Anita prepares a diabolical trick: she will give sleeping tablets to Fay, and a lesser dose to herself. It will look like an attempted poisoning, Anita thinks. Aunt Louise arrives early and upsets this scheme by calling for Perry Mason, and then a discreet doctor. Louise know Della Street from their home town.Note how the circumstantial evidence of Fay's clothing can lead to a \\"logical deduction\\" that is really an assumption about how the clothes got into room 702. Lieutenant Tragg interprets this as proof of Fay's guilt. Dane Grover puts his trust in Fay's innocence (Chapter 7 ). Could the lipstick kiss on Carver's forehead be a clue? What about the glass? It is a little known fact that the wrinkles on a person's lips are as individual as a fingerprint. The crimson kiss was not Fay's (Chapter 9)! Perry surmises whose lips kissed Carver's bald head, and how Fay's clothes were put in Carver's rooms. The guilty party confesses from the witness stand.This 1948 story has fewer pages than others. It is as if it was prepared for a magazine, or a film script that covers the dramatic scenes and highlights. Voiceovers could be used to connect these scenes."},{"Title":"The Floppy Sleep Game Book : A Proven 4- Week Plan to Get Your Child to Sleep","review":"I bought this book/cd combo to give me some quick tip and tools to get my 5 year old out of my bed.

This book is full of child development and psychology insight. It offers strategies on how to deal with anger, anxiety, phobias and more. I was amazed!

They want you to track your child for a week, every detail from food to bathroom breaks to sleep habits. I dont have the time for that working full time. I returned the book, thankfully Amazon is amazing about returns.We have talked to our daughters pediatrician (my daughter is 6) and she now takes 3mg on Melatonin before bed time, some people do not produce enough, apparently my daughter is one of those people. She now falls asleep beautifully, and Melatonin is a vitamin, all natural so i feel good about giving this to my daughter, and not a drug.

Now, the age range is 3-8, so I knew I was at a cusp, but it was much too complicated for him to follow. He did enjoy the stories and visualizations, but the physical stretching/breathing was more challenging than soothing for him.I do like the book; it just wasn't what he needed at that time. I do think it could be useful if he has issues when he's a bit older or possibly for a sibling, so I'm hanging on to it.

We have tried everything we can think of and read every sleep book. We have a bedtime routine, no TV, a weighted blanket, tryptophan-rich foods before bed. Even Benadryl does not help! Needless to say, I bought this book with a high degree of skepticism. At the time, I had an appointment pending with a pediatric sleep specialist. My son is frequently unable to translate instructions he hears into action for his body; he processes more like a younger child. After the musical intro and reading out the floppy sleep game, my child was asleep within 20 minutes! Compare to 2 hours! This has gone on night after night after night. We don't even need to do it anymore. We recently went out of town--always a sleep disaster--and he did great! He even took a nap one day! (completely unheard of!) It seems to have helped him recognize when he is tired and to respond to that with relaxation instead of resistance. He welcomes sleeptime and last night even told me he was ready for bed and did not want to stay up and watch a movie for a special treat with his brother! I can't say enough good things about the book. I wish the CD had more relaxation/intros because all my kids, 7 yr old son and 2 yr old daughter included, really like moving and stretching and doing the yoga-style poses. We did not do the entire program, but it all looks pretty good. Now we include reading or telling a \\"dream\\" after our bedtime reading every night. In addition to Teel's book, which we love, we also use \\"Moonbeams\\" and \\"Starbright\\" two books of meditations for children. We adapt those to meet our needs. I even told the sleep specialist about this book. One recommendation the sleep doctor had was to put a couple of drops of oil of lavender (the relaxing variety, not the stimulating one) on a cotton ball next to his bed at bedtime. (This seems to be helpful despite seeming flaky.) I hope Patti Teel comes out with another CD!"},{"Title":"The Floppy Sleep Game Book : A Proven 4- Week Plan to Get Your Child to Sleep","review":"I was a little skeptical about this book and cd even though I had read some positive reviews. I bought it used and spent under $7.00 bucks thinking it was worth the try. The reviews were all on children much younger than my 10 yr old daughter so that was another reason I wasn't sure it would work for an older child. My daughter has always had problems falling asleep alone and I was starting to get impatient because this was taking alone time away from me at the end of each day. Well I am so impressed with this cd. We have only had it for 2 weeks but every night she falls asleep alone earlier and earlier in the cd. Our next step is to get her to sleep through the night. I haven't finished the book but so far it has taught me alot. I highly recommend parents with the same issues to give this book/cd a try. My daughter asked me what the recommended age was for the cd and I was able to come up with a quick answer of 0-99 yrs."},{"Title":"The Floppy Sleep Game Book : A Proven 4- Week Plan to Get Your Child to Sleep","review":"After a disappointing 2 year check-up when our Doctor informed us that we needed to take away my son's bottle and let him cry it out in bed rather than rocking him to sleep, I was desperate for an option. I found this book and liked that is gives very specific, step by step instructions on exactly what to do at bedtime. I love her idea of relaxing stretches, deep breathing and using your imagination to go off to sleep on your own. You will actually teach your child how to fall asleep, instead of just leaving him to figure it out on his own. Brilliant and much kinder than that horrible Cry-it-out method. My son is 2 and we have adapted the book to fit his age and understanding, some of the ideas are a little old for him right now. But it does work! This is 6 weeks from starting the book and we now use the CD for the floppy game stretches and the story. I stay in the room to help with the stretches, but can walk away after the story and he will soon fall asleep, on his own, without me in the room! A huge change for us!! I can take a wide awake 2 yr old who doesn't want to go to sleep, lay him in his bed, use the CD and then leave him in his room awake and he will fall asleep on his own without crying!! That's worth more than gold to this Mama! (Getting him on a good consistent nap schedule has been important too - floppy game works for naps and bedtime!)I just wanted to add that it is now almost a year later it is still working!! My son will be 3 at the beginning of July. He was never a good sleeper but now he can fall sleep on his own without us in the room! We have a bedtime routine of bath, read 3 stories (short board books), say a prayer, give hugs and kisses and then he climbs into bed and we play the floppy game with the cd. After the game ends, my husband and I leave the room and he listens to a story on the cd and falls asleep. My son is very happy and full of energy all the time so at bedtime he is still laughing and talking and jumping around when he gets into bed. But the floppy game relaxes him enough to start yawning and by the end of the story he's usually asleep. If not, and he calls us back, one of us will talk to him and he usually asks to hear the story again. If he hears the story a second time he is always asleep afterwards. We use it at nap time and bedtime. If he complains and says he doesn't want to go to bed or nap we just say Sorry but it's time for the floppy game and then start the CD right up. If he doesn't get quite right away we tell him he as to be quiet and listen to the lady so we will know what to do. He sleeps very well and even puts himself back to sleep on his own. Very rarely (maybe once every couple of months) he isn't able to go back to sleep on his own and calls us back to his room. All we have to do is talk to him a little and start the story for him and he's right back to sleep. This even worked once after a really bad dream. He woke screaming, cried in my arms for a couple of minutes. After we got him calmed and consoled, I asked if he wanted to lay down and hear the story again and he said yes and went right off to sleep. This book is a life saver for us and we will use it on our second son when he is old enough. I love the floppy game and tell parents about it all the time!"},{"Title":"The Floppy Sleep Game Book : A Proven 4- Week Plan to Get Your Child to Sleep","review":"I bought this book/CD with very high hopes. My 3 year old has had trouble going to sleep in his own bed and sleeping through the night for about 2 years. Every night, I lie down with him anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours, or until I lose my patience. Then, when he finally does go to sleep, he still wakes at least 2 times duirng the night. My husband and I have tried everything. I was eager to try the Floppy Sleep Game with the movements and meditations. Our son is really quite mellow and I thought that these would be an effective way to get him ready for bed. On the contrary, he seemed MORE awake when we finished the exercises. It took even longer than normal to get him to sleep after listening to the CD each night. I'm glad that this has worked for some parents (I was really hoping to be one of them!). Alas, I will try something else.

We tried everything, but nothing worked. She would lay in bed, unable to hold still, starring at the ceiling. I knew that if I could just get her to relax, she could fall asleep. I had to do something because her little brother was due a few months later. I found this book and decided to try it. It worked beautifully! After only one week, she was already learning to fall asleep in half the time. By three weeks, she no longer needed help. This book, the accompanying CD, and both her father and I taught her the skills she needed to use in order to relax each night.

Patti Teal, the author, provides insights into what children like my daughter are going through, with both a sympathetic and pragmatic approach. My daughter is responding positively to the accompanying CD. I couldn't get her to do yoga exercises before, I guess it was too regimented, but Patti Teal makes it fun and helps children establish a bedtime routine that is more calming rather than one ridden with anxiety.

I used the CD only a couple of times-- it seemed to annoy my daughter more than anything. Instead, we used the relaxation techniques, followed by the visualizations.
