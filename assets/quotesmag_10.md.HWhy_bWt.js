Hall (Large Print))","review":"I just had to read the source, or rather one of the main sources, that gave birth to the vampire genre. As a long time fan of the movie, I was excited about this book. Reading it, however, was less exciting. First though, I'll talk about what I liked. This novel is told from many perspectives, which I loved. Stoker uses diaries, memos, newspaper articles, and letters to piece together the narrative. It's brilliant, well, mostly. Like those shaky video cam movies where supposedly \\"lost footage\\" is found and edited together for the audience, some of the things recorded and how they are recorded are too convenient and rushed. But for the most part, it's a great way of telling this story and it also gives you an intimate glimpse into each of the major characters. You really start to understand and care for them. Unfortunately, that's also a disadvantage.We never get to really \\"meet\\" Dracula. We see him as the other characters see him, but we don't understand him or why he is what he is, and how he feels about it. The movie is superior in that regard. Another thing that puts a barrier between the reader and the story is the language. It's written in very old English. But even Shakespeare knew how to talk *to* people and not at them. The Van Helsing character, in particular, comes across as very pretentious and unrealistic in his speech. He's a philosopher, but you have to really read his parts more than once to truly digest it, and it's difficult to believe that the people he's interacting with understand him so easily. But maybe that was just me.Besides that, the descriptions were very good, although sometimes the language was repetitive. Some of the characters' reactions didn't ring very realistic to me. I also had an an issue with the way the author discusses masculinity and femininity, it was annoying and pronounced enough to make me roll my eyes more than once. Looking past that though, the plot was fairly engaging, there's a lot going on. The suspense about where it is all heading was gripping up until the end. Unfortunately, for me, the climax did not justify the build-up. I expected a lot more, and was disappointed about how quickly everything ended."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

Let's just say that, when I retired for the evening, I checked my closet and under my bed."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Read: 1/13Rate: 4/51/13: Bram Stoker will always be famous for penning Dracula, and nobody knows what else he did in his life. That's his legacy. We have him to thank for the countless vampire pictures, novels, games, costumes, and whatever. Back to his original story, it is one of the greatest detective murder mystery novels written. Everything is told in a series of diaries, newspaper cuttings, monographs, and letters. There isn't a single non-epistolary account to advance the story along. Hence, the book is done ex post facto to piece the mystery together to allow the readers to understand how all of the epistles are interrelated. From the beginning, the readers will feel the prim Victorian naivety and prudishness surrounding the characters. As soon as the evilness of Dracula creeps in their way of life, the characters start experiencing death and decay, forcing them to change their thinking and accept the existence of unholy, hence the Gothic. It is almost a reverse of Christianity. That's why Dracula is a brilliant work for its unrelenting terror. However, the last 50 pages or so are tough to get through because it's literally a trudge to get to the climax. Sometimes, I've questioned the intelligence of these characters. For example, why leave Lucy alone when her room was first fitted with garlic? Obviously, it didn't work because nobody laid watch upon her overnight. Also, why did it take so long for the characters to kill Dracula? What took many days can be accomplished in a few. While Mina was describing her early symptoms, it was evident that she was becoming like Lucy even though she was made aware of what had happened to Lucy by reading the beforehand accounts of her transformation. Although Dracula claims to have \\"commanded nations,\\" how can he be so stupid to kill rich, prominent English citizens? He should have, like all serial killers do, targeted prostitutes, bums, and degenerate winos to keep a low profile. All in all, despite the stupidities of the characters, Dracula is still an excellent read."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"I read this book 50 years ago and enjoyed it.

Hall (Large Print))","review":"I guess it is only famous because it created the monster in the first place and gave birth to the genre! =PI am approaching the end of this book and have been confronted with one simple recurring problem: I have no idea what half the words mean as I'm reading his stuffy 19th century prose. I bought a little notepad and started jotting down all the obscure words I came across and looked them up on Google. As I kept going, the list kept getting longer and whenever I got through another chapter, the words from the previous chapter that I had looked up I had forgotten already. I decided to have fun with it and play around with putting the words I looked up into a modern context. I leave you with the most humorous sentence I came up with before losing interest in that activity:\\"The vulpine shoe salesman, Al Bundy, had so disarmed his prospect with his badinage that she found the sale to be most beneficent when in fact Mr. Bundy was ripping her off to pay store rent that was in arrears.\\"Just to give everyone an idea, I will say that I have a bachelor's degree in the liberal arts and yet I had to look up all these words so far (starting at chapter 6):viaduct, expostulate, cerebration, scuppers, lanthorns, wolds, inquest, obviate, reticence, cormorant, boudoir, defribinate, trituration, zoophagous, impressment, arrears, decoction, beneficent, badinage, quondam, vulpine, solicitude, simoom, stertorous, gout, drouth, chaplet, urbane, intestacy, ague, sexton, furze, physiognomy, cicatrised, fakir, tussock, fretsaw, portmanteau, cerements, adamantine, interstice, missal, ploughshare, paucity, nostrum, pabulum, scions, coeval, importunate, militating, hobnails, lugubrious, obliquity, inquietude, arrogate, appositeness, celerity, trephine, aquiline, countermining, exigency, odium, sinuous, mews, capstan; and many others I knew but were used in a bizarre 19th century manner that I wan't sure of in its context.The other big flaw to the book is that it is all told in the form of diaries, journals, telegrams, and newspaper clippings. Someone should really try and write a novel of that film \\"Blade\\" using the same vocabulary and style as this book. Stoker's \\"Dracula\\" may be the father of all vampires but if you want a good old-fashioned vampire-fest just read \\"'Salem's Lot\\" by Stephen King.

Hall (Large Print))","review":"What else is there to say about Bram Stoker's Dracula other than the one word: terrifying. I did expect terrifying - it is Dracula, after all - but I really didn't realize what I had gotten myself into when I started the book. Dracula begins deceptively dull, so much so that I wondered whether or not I should continue reading it. However, the story picks up as Jonathan Harker, one of the main characters, discovers the nature of Dracula, his mysterious business client and host in Transylvania. Then the story moves from Transylvania to a beach town in England, where the soon-to-be Mina Harker and her friend Lucy Westenra are enjoying time together. That is, they enjoy their time until a ship carrying cargo from Transylvania runs ashore near the town. The crew of the ship is either missing or dead, and the captain's log gives details about a creature on board that was terrorizing the crew. Then the story really picks up.Stoker did an amazing job with Dracula. The book starts innocently enough, but Stoker continually adds to the suspense until, in my case, I couldn't put the book down, but I was rather horrified by the thought of what might be waiting for me on the next page. Stoker is able to transport the reader until he or she is Dr. Van Helsing or Mina Harker, and the book comes alive much more this way. Beyond being a thrilling horror story, Dracula is also an adventure. The battle against Dracula has unexpected twists that that kept me on the edge of my seat, and it takes the characters to their breaking points; challenging them in unimaginable ways. There's also fantastic imagery and descriptions, so there's no difficulty picturing the setting described, even if you haven't lived during the nineteenth century or visited Transylvania.I absolutely recommend Dracula, but not without a word of warning: it is scary. I expected creepy situations, but not the seeping dread that has kept me up for a few nights. Stoker is a genius when it comes to vampires, which is why this book has become a classic. But maybe get a night light or don't sleep too close to a window while you read this book."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

I could read this over and over and never get tired of this story and writing style."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Before the Twilight series there were stories about Vampires that actually were good. The most famous of these was the story of Dracula by Bram Stoker. Structurally it is an epistolary novel, that is, told as a series of letters, diary entries, ships' logs, etc. Literary critics have examined many themes in the novel, such as the role of women in Victorian culture, conventional and conservative sexuality, immigration, colonialism, postcolonialism and folklore. Although Stoker did not invent the vampire, the novel's influence on the popularity of vampires has been singularly responsible for many theatrical, film and television interpretations throughout the 20th and 21st centuries.This book was a long one and at times I admit to struggling with it. I was very interested in the origins of Dracula, but I think there was so much involved in this book that at times I don't think I enjoyed reading it. Overall it was a decent book but I wouldn't consider it a must read."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Bram Stoker's Dracula begins with a very interesting and compelling story as told by Jonathan Harker. I was haunted by the vision of Count Dracula in his many forms throughout the novel and felt true pity and concern for his victims. I literally had bad dreams about bats flying at me while reading this well crafted horror story. Van Helsing was my favorite character, being the knowledgable doctor of much fortitude and moral strength as he leads the quest to rid the world of this purely evil monster. I can now see why his character has emerged in movies of our time, although portrayed very differently than the character I began to love and cheer for.The novel is also very forward thinking for it's era (published 1897) in that it includes a strong female heroine. Mina Murray, who becomes Mina Harker during the discourse of the story, is very compassionate and kind while also not being relegated to the typical helpless role of Victorian women in novels of the times. Mina is a kind of savior to her own husband, Jonathan, and also becomes a pivotal character in the pursuit of Count Dracula.Dracula has been accused as being a treatise against infiltration and contamination from the influence of Eastern Europeans. I definitely made a connection that this was probably a protest against such immigration which in today's world is considered an intolerant attitude. However, I just read it for what it is, good period fiction about the first literary vampire which has inspired many many books, movies and T.V. shows although many of these modern depictions remotely resemble, the true victorian vampires in Dracula. Also, I have yet to see a movie that accurately portrays the true Dracula story. Dracula is far from the handsome, friendly and sparkling vampires in much of the contemporary literature and film.The one drawback of the novel is that it becomes longwinded in several instances and rambles on at times. This rambling writing style, however, seems to be typical of many authors throughout the 19th century, at least in this reader's experience. This edition also had quite a few errors in tense and seemed to be poorly translated from another language at times. That aside, this is Victorian gothic horror at it's best!"},{"Title":"Dracula (G.

Ladies were allowed all the pomp and fluff that comes with true femininity.Men were heroes and ladies always got saved with the exception of this story in which one of the damsels is not saved from distress. Bram Stoker's Dracula set the mold for all vampires that came after; a living example of true immortality.A true classic that everyone should read."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"\\"For the dead travel fast\\"Surprisingly \\"Denn die Toten reiten schnell\\" or \\"For the dead travel fast\\" is more than an opening line to this tale of love in the dangerous moon light. After watching several Drac movies and a few Nosferatu's, I pretty much though I had a handle on the genera. Little did I know what a wonderful world of mystery and suspense that Bram Stoker opened up for me.The story is told mostly third party though the papers, diaries, and phonograph recordings (on wax cylinders) of those people involve in a tale so bizarre that it almost defies belief. The general story line is that of a Count that plans to move to a more urban setting (from Borgo Pass to London) where there is a richer diet. There he finds succulent women; something he can sing his teeth in. Unfortunately for him a gang of ruffians (including a real-estate agent, asylum director, Texas cowboy and an Old Dutch abnormal psychologist) is out to detour his nocturnal munching. They think they have Drac on the run but with a wing and a prayer he is always one step ahead.Of more value to the reader is the rich prose chosen by Stoker as he describes the morals and technology of the time. We have to come to grips with or decide if we can perform the rituals that are required to eliminate vampires verses the impropriety of opening graves and staking loved ones. The powers in the book differ from the movie versions in that they are more of persuasion and capabilities to manipulate the local weather. At one point the Dutch Dr. Van Helsing, is so overwhelmed by a beautiful vampire laying in the grave that he almost for gets why he is there and may become vamp chow.All in all the story is more in the cunning chase. And the question as to will they succeed or will Dracula triumph. Remember \\"For the dead travel fast.\\"Dracula"},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

Hall (Large Print))","review":"Bram Stoker's 1897 novel Dracula is a classic of horror, forming a pillar of the genre and becoming the standard for vampire fiction. This place in the canon of horror is well-deserved.The novel opens with Jonathan Harker, an English lawyer, visiting Castle Dracula in Transylvania to help the Count with purchase property in England, as the Count seeks to move to London, where he will have unlimited prey to feed upon. This section, with Harker trapped in the castle and subject to every manner of terror, might just be my favorite of the novel. The mood is as oppressive, spooky, gloomy, and frightening as anything I've read.From there, we follow Dracula's arrival in England, and the conflict between the Count and Harker's friends, led by Abraham Van Helsing, who is the only one of our heroes to initially suspect what they are really dealing with. The hunt to find and slay Dracula and undo his evil deeds is well-orchestrated, and Stoker definitely conveys a sense of desperation as Van Helsing and the others try to foil Dracula's well-laid plans.The novel is written in epistolary format, meaning that it is entirely comprised of journal and diary entries, letters, telegrams, newspaper clippings, ship's logs, and other documentation. This actually works very well, as it allows us to view the thoughts of each character, and even becomes important to the plot itself, as the vampire hunters eventually compare notes to piece together the clues to solve the mystery.The characters are generally well-done, with Count Dracula and Abraham Van Helsing both more than holding up their end of the conflict that defines the narrative. Mina Harker and John Seward are also very strong and compelling characters. Jonathan Harker and Lucy Westenra spend a lot of their time being the victims, and while they do that well, they aren't quite as interesting on their own merits. Arthur Holmwood and Quincey Morris mostly serve to round out the group of vampire hunters with the necessary resources and talents, though Holmwood's engagement to Lucy gives him some depth. The madman Renfield is entertaining when he appears.There's definitely a layer of Victorian propriety to the novel, but that is part of the tension and entertainment, as so much of the action actually goes against that propriety. The sexual overtones of vampirism certainly fits this characteristic, as does Mina Harker's strong active role in the story, contrary to gender expectations of the time. In fact, when the men try to keep Mina sheltered and in her proper protected place, things get worse for the group until she gets back into the action. For a novel written in 1897, that's pretty progressive.I listened to Brilliance Audio's 1994 production of Dracula, with Tom Casaletto as the narrator, Fredrick Scadron as Jonathan Harker, Sheila Hart as Mina Harker, Mary Beth Quillen Gregor as Lucy Westenra, and Michael Page as John Seward. Each reads the journal entries or other documents written by their character, with Casaletto picking up the other sources. Overall, the cast is strong and the production is enjoyable. My only problem with the production is that not a one of the readers could remotely approximate Quincey Morris' Texas accent.I recently read Mary Shelley's Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus and Robert Louis Stevenson's Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, two other horror classics. I really enjoyed those two books (see my Amazon reviews for my thoughts on those two books), but I would have to say that I enjoyed Dracula even more. Dracula matches or beats the other two for mood, but tops them in action. I recommend all three, but if you were to read only one, I'd suggest Dracula.Much like Frankenstein or Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, there are good reasons that Dracula has become such a fixture of popular culture, and is still remembered and adapted to film and other formats so frequently. Whether you're interested in the history of horror literature or just looking for an exciting and scary story, I can't recommend Dracula highly enough. Bram Stoker's novel is an enduring masterpiece."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Bram Stoker's \\"Dracula\\" was for me hard to put down for the first 100 pages but even harder to pick up again for the rest of the book. When I started reading I was delighted (and scared) to find exactly what I had hoped for: not just a story of horror and vampires, but a subtle tale of psychological tension between the main character and his terrifying but sophisticated and intriguing host.It wasn't without surprise that I then saw the story suddenly turn into something else altogether as it left the setting of the claustrophobic rooms of Dracula's castle for the more pedestrian environment of Victorian England. At this point the Count almost completely disappears from the story and we are left with a number of extremely flat, templated characters moving through a corny Victorian drama.At many stages, as I saw a character start a sentence with \\"Oh dear, dear Madam Mina, for the love that we all feel for you...\\" I immediately skipped through piles of Victorian filler fluff to the next period.What really bothered me in the second act of the story, however, is the superficially rational but ultimately goofy behaviour of the characters. Good narrators have their plot develop through the acumend of their characters who always find the smart next move in the chess game against their adversary. Bad narrators rely on the continuous blunders of both heroes and villains to make the story move in the desired direction. Errors, after all, are much easier to come up with than brilliant ideas. Where would spy movies be without villains who waste their chance to kill off James Bond and reveal him their plot instead? Or without air conducts from which conspirators can be easily eaves-dropped?[SPOILERS FOLLOW]In the case of this book, the level of stupidity in the characters' decision making almost breaks the suspension of disbelief, especially considering the apparently methodical intelligence through which at least one of them (Van Helsing) uses vague clues to formulate complex plots.As soon as it was mentioned that vampires cannot enter a house if not invited first by someone, I immediately wondered why the character had taken residence in the same building as a mental patient whom they knew was under the influence of Dracula. Inevitably, not many pages later, this proves almost fatal to their efforts. And why not place crucifixes and garlic everywhere in their house and always carry some on their persons? This, too, proved to be a major blunder congenial to plot development.But the real champion of goofiness in the book is Count Dracula, a demi-God with immense powers, unlimited time and the advantage of surprise, who somehow manages to do just about everything that would have been necessary for a company of four men and a woman to identify him as a vampire, discover his cove, chase him from London and eventually track him and kill him. Why would Dracula wish to kidnap and kill on Harker, the person who was meant to arrange his move to London? Once there someone would have certainly suspected something of the last person known to have seen him alive. Once he has escaped and is ready to expose the secret, why concentrate - for no purpose and without any intention on Dracula's part - most of his business on Harker's circle of friends (his first victim the best friend of his fiancee, his residence next to her doctor's, his henchman-wannabe one of his patients), so that traces upon traces are left, clues pile up and he is discovered? Wouldn't a recently emigrated, not well established vampire wish to keep a lower profile for a while at least? Especially one who is described as a being of high intelligence and a successulf strategist.Finally, the narrative device of diaries entries used to narrate the story towards the end - which served the suspense so well in the beginning when it was just Johnatan Harker narrating the events in Dracula's castle - becomes slightly forced as the characters seem to spend just as much time during the day chasing Dracula as they do writing surprisingly accurate accounts of the events in their spare time, even when they recently escaped grave danger or when presumably they would have better things to do. Once again, the story-telling device that worked so well in the first act eventually gets in the way of credibility when the scenario changes."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

It does not read as well now as it originally did due to the modern expectations related to vampire fiction. It is very atmospheric; but while its journal/letter style creates immediacy, it also makes for a choppy narrative flow. Some readers may find that disturbing. Despite its flaws, this book should be in any serious collection of classics or of horror genre."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Horror is not my cup of tea. I generally avoid horror films, though I've watched a few over the years and maybe even enjoyed one or two. But I don't seek them, don't rent them, don't get into them around Halloween. Though I am fairly described as an avid reader, meaning I read and take a break to read some more, I have never read a Stephen King novel. Not my cup of tea.But I just finished reading the original Dracula (1897) by Bram Stoker. I read this because I was recently given an e-reader for my birthday and on it discovered about 6 books installed for free. In this set was the eBook Dracula, a book now considered one of the classics. Since I recently decided to read a number of first edition classics I thought, \\"Why not start with the Count?\\"It was a strange book, bloodier than I expected given the date and times in which it was written. For me, Stoker made his characters spend too much time traipsing through the woods or road to who knows where. I skipped some of these passages. But there's no question the book is a classic for several reasons: original ideas applied to scary storyline, interposition of religion, the occult, and outright fantasy, sexual overtones that were at once twisted and common, a building run to the finish.Dracula has been adapted, presented, and re-adapted in story and film. Vampires in general are enjoying a new run in Stephenie Meyer's \\"Twilight Series\\" books and films, a storyline featuring youthful love and lust, vampires and wolves. And vampires lead the way in HBO's \\"True Blood,\\" a television series that tries to outdo itself in picturing the occult, blood and gore, fractured relationships, witches, other assorted odd creatures, and a huge dose of sexuality mixed in with all this in a manner that reaches beyond kinky to creepy.As I said, horror isn't my cup of tea. And I recommend Dracula only for those who want to experience a well-written story featuring distasteful topics. The Count is hateful and anti-religion. Indeed he is a satanic Antichrist archetype, and the book is filled with religious references, both respectful and disparaging.I have no favorite characters in a book like this, even the heroes of the story. All in all, I can check if off my reading list and let the book, like the Count himself, vanish into dust particles and out of my life."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

The book's been around forever, so the fact that books of this caliber are now in the public domain is an opportunity that the public should not waste.The book is a creative masterwork for its time, and in commercial terms, may be the most influential book ever written other than the Bible or the Odyssey.It is structured in a unique way, with the book present as letters and correspondence between the characters. In addition to its being a compelling story, its format is itself an interesting experience.One that you should definitely give a go at some point in your life."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"It's not often my 17 year old brother tells me I have to read a book. So when he does, I put it on the short list.I've had Dracula on my list for a while though. I thought it'd be a fun read after reading Frankenstein earlier this year, but Frankenstein did a number on me (it was not nearly as gripping as I had hoped it would be) so Dracula got put to the back burner. I should have known better.First of all - for those of you who have not experienced Dracula yet - it's an epistolary novel. Yup, all letters. These letters grow in intensity as the story progresses, making the book somewhat unique, especially when compared to other vampire novels.I grew up reading Anne Rice novels - none of this wimpy sparkling-vampire stuff for me. I love Buffy the Vampire Slayer (bonus points if you can name the season in which the good Count shows up there!), I enjoy a good, thrilling story that has me wanting to leave the lights on, and Dracula gave me everything I was looking for and more. Y'all, I actually dreamed of spider-like men crawling up my walls. It was awesome.Reading Dracula is kicking off a year of intense exploring of a genre I've always shied away from. Horror. I figured I had to kick the year off with a review of a class horror and fully plan to explore the genre more in 2012. It should be interesting - especially if this is the type of novel from which inspiration is taken."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Surprisingly \\"Denn die Toten reiten schnell\\" or \\"For the dead travel fast\\" is more than an opening line to this tale of love in the dangerous moon light. After watching several Drac movies and a few Nosferatu's, I pretty much though I had a handle on the genera. Little did I know what a wonderful world of mystery and suspense that Bram Stoker opened up for me.The story is told mostly third party though the papers, diaries, and phonograph recordings (on wax calendars) of those people involve in a tale so bizarre that it almost defies belief. The general story line is that of a Count that plans to move to a more urban setting (from Borgo Pass to London) where there is a richer diet. There he finds succulent women; something he can sing his teeth in. Unfortunately for him a gang of ruffians (including a real-estate agent, asylum director, Texas cowboy and an Old Dutch abnormal psychologist) is out to detour his nocturnal munching. They think they have Drac on the run but with a wing and a prayer he is always one step ahead.Of more value to the reader is the rich prose chosen by Stoker as he describes the morals and technology of the time. We have to come to grips with or decide if we can perform the rituals that are required to eliminate vampires verses the impropriety of opening graves and staking loved ones. The powers in the book differ from the movie versions in that they are more of persuasion and capabilities to manipulate the local weather. At one point the Dutch Dr. Van Helsing, is so overwhelmed by a beautiful vampire laying in the grave that he almost for gets why he is there and may become vamp chow.All in all the story is more in the cunning chase. And the question as to will they succeed or will Dracula triumph. Remember \\"For the dead travel fast.\\"Dracula"},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

Hall (Large Print))","review":"Written in 1897, Bram Stoker's Dracula is a classic of fiction, fascinating for its subject matter and still the subject of films a hundred years later. Count Dracula, the epitome of evil, is exotic enough to keep even the most jaded reader of his exploits interested in their outcome, and grounded enough in the reality of evil to make even doubters wonder whether evil can be transmitted from one person to another against one's will.The novel begins with the arrival of Jonathan Harker, a lawyer representing a London real estate agency, at the Transylvanian castle of Count Dracula to clinch the deal by which the count will move to a British estate. Details about Harker's arrival by coach, his greeting at the castle, which has no doors except the front door, his reception by the count (who has hair on the palms of his hands), and his instructions regarding where he may go or not go within the castle set the tone and establish the mysterious background of the count and a sense of dread regarding the outcome for Harker.By the time that Harker recovers from a long and mysterious illness and returns home, the count, already in London, has turned Lucy, a lovely ingenue, into a vampire. Dr. Van Helsing, a German expert on vampires hired by her family, saves her several times from what appears to be severe anemia and recommends ringing her room with garlic and making sure that she has crucifixes around her. When Dracula then turns his blood-thirsty attention to Mina, fianc&eacute;e of Jonathan Harker and friend of the unfortunate Lucy, the scene is set for a showdown regarding Dracula's power vs. the power of goodness and traditional religion.Stoker takes his story beyond sheer melodrama, eliciting sympathy for the afflicted victims of Dracula while also recreating the religious atmosphere of the period and the beliefs and doubts of average citizens. The novel is far more compelling than I expected, creating suspense at the same time that it develops the character of the count with his supernatural powers. The climax in which the forces of good are ranged against the forces of evil in the shape of the count, whose long history is detailed in the novel, is truly a conflict between traditional religion and evil in the form of Satan personified. Fun to read and surprisingly affecting. n Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Dracula is a book like no other. I first read it when I was just a little kid and thought that this is the kind of literature taht should be read through and through. The writing style is very different and at the same time very catching. Stoker works immaculately to bring in the first person narrative to life in this through a journals-like style of prose. This book has spawned the modern interest of people with vampires and inspired a horde of movies and other books as well. The modern dsay queen of vampires Anne Rice in whole her vampire chronicles fails to capture the magic of that creature created by a syphilitic irishman. Stoker truly created a legend. Many reports speculate that Stoker based his story on facts with regard to the existence of Dracula. Vlad Tepesh or Vlad the IMpaler was the ruler of Walachia in the middle ages and is still a legend in Romania till this day. His ruthlessness against the Turks brought much fear in the hearts of men. Vlad was the kind of guy who would feast in front of a thousand people being impaled in front of him. The other part was the fact that Stoker was said to have witnessed a psychiatric case in which a person was demented in that he had to drink blood to relinquish himself from pains he was feeling. A number of peoplehave pointed that vampirism is truly a disease, a form of a disorder called porphyria in which treatment includes the injection of fresh hemoglobin into the patient. Incidentally those patients are sensitive to light, which is true to Stoker's version of events. In any case, Dracula is among the best tightly packed book out there, with the best perspective and excellent prose. Stoker truly does succeed in taking the writer to the land of horror and simply created the most immortal legend of all. Bram Stoker's Dracula, the movie directed by Francis Ford Coppolla holds true to the book for those who haven't got the time to sink their teeth into an amazing book as this."},{"Title":"Dracula (G.

I remember first reading it in my teens, and while I loved it, I'm not sure I understood or appreciated all the nuances in the writing style. I suppose it's true, youth is wasted on the young.The word 'masterpiece' gets tossed around a lot (perhaps more than we should) However, in this case, 'masterpiece' fits the bill. It's hard to find flaw in the imaginative creation that is Dracula. Bram Stoker takes the reader on a thrill ride that is both captivating and equally terrifying. The characters, plot and descriptive narrative submerge the reader into a very real world of fright and evil.I would recommend Dracula to anyone who simply enjoys the craft of storytelling. In my opinion, this is a true masterpiece for this genre. If you haven't read it in a while, give it a try again, you may be surprised."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

Even if you can say yes to any of the above, going back to the original novel will be well worth your while. Although the vampire legend goes back centuries in many cultures,it took an obscure writer in late 19th century England named Bram Stoker to create the basis for the most enduring and pervasive of horror characters. At times, the dialogue is almost ludicrous (where in the world did Stoker get the idea of how Americans talk?), the plot drags a little in the middle, the language is often too flowery and ornate for 21st century tastes but if you read this novel with some suspension of our modern tastes (and don't play amateur psychologist and try to overanalyse it), it is a great story. Love, horror, history, culture, suspense, action - this book has it all and even the best movie, book and/or miniseries has yet to fully do it justice. The characters of the Count and Van Helsing are written so well that it is easy to see why they are classics, but most of the other characters - especially Johnathan and Mina Harker - are also memorable.

K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Unlike several other classic novels I have read, I actaully enjoyed this book just for it's own merits. A well thought out book of Dracula's quest for new lands and those who oppose him (though not for humanity but for their own wants). Stoker was well ahead of his time in the telling of this story. The use of journals, memos, etc. not only tells the story but is a great way to develop characters, their perceptions, thinking, personal views, etc. Just an amazing simple but powerful idea that is hard to follow even to this day. A different way to read something, but still enjoyable. And unlike most horror books, Stoker shows Dracula's power by implying, not really showing. Dracula creates fogs, changes forms, climbs spider-like down walls, etc, but does little in confrontations, he runs, showing his fears dispite his power. Some of the concepts were well thought out too, like the weak minded (insane) being throlls to evil powers and the taking of innocence/blood leading to damnation. Cool. I also liked that even though it an older book, it doesn't suffer (much) from over dramatization that is normally associated with older stuff, it's fairly fast paced and enjoyable and well worth reading.It's a shame to see such a great book turned into so many bad movies."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"When Jonathan Harker visits Transylvania to arrange for an English home purchase for Count Dracula, he becomes a prisoner in Dracula's castle and discovers horrific and unnatural facts about Dracula himself. Not long after, strange events occur in England--a unmanned ship beaches on shore, a madman awaits his master, and a young woman with unexplained puncture wounds on her neck becomes pale and ill. These events bring together a diverse cast of characters who tell the story through their diaries and letters and work to understand and to defeat Dracula. The diary-style narrative, although contrived and somewhat frustrating, makes the book accessible and swift flowing, and the book is of course a rich, classic horror text and a foundational vampire novel. Recommended to all readers, including those that don't generally read classics.A horror classic, Dracula is both an atmospheric, foundational vampire novel and an accessible, swiftly flowing text. The narrative is composed of a number of chronologically arranged diary entries and sundry letters and clippings that follows a cast of approximately seven characters through one united plot. The diary-style narrative means that the book is composed largely of many short entires within average-length chapters, and these short entries make the book accessible to all readers and make it flow swiftly. As such, this is a good book for readers that don't often read classics (and the footnotes answer any question in period locations and phrases). The letters and diary entires are also personal, honest, and detailed, building realistic characters and meaningful emotions. However, the narrative style has two weaknesses: it's contrived, although there are sections that describe how and why the entires were chronologically arranged, and more importantly it puts the reader in the position of knowing much more than the characters, especially in the first half of the book. This dramatic irony becomes quite exaggerated as the reader, overlooking the entire story, can clearly see the danger, while the characters still bumble about in the dark, constricted to their own points of view--and the more exaggerated the dramatic irony, the more obvious and more frustrating it becomes. On the whole, however, the diary narrative is an effective storytelling style.And the story itself is exceptional. Stoker intertwines the horror of the unholy undead with the draw of power, sensuality, and beautiful young women. He engages both in equal measure: his vampires are at once grotesque and amazing, from Dracula's pale face, garish red lips, and inhuman animalistic tendencies to the seductive and rawly sexuality beauty of his brides and the growing sensuality of the human women that he seduces and transforms. (Furthermore, the mythology that surrounds the vampires, from garlic to daylight, will be immediately recognizable to modern readers.) Alongside these inhuman forces is a cast of realistically conceived and motivated humans, originally brought together through love and friendship, ultimately united due to Dracula and in order to destroy him. Through the diary entires, the story moves at an equal pace through emotions and plot, the Victorian descriptions are rich and detailed, the horror elements are atmospheric and intense. This is truly a fundamental vampire novel.I'm glad that I finally got around to reading Dracula, and I was very pleased with the text. It is lengthy, sometimes predictable, sometimes (although primarily because of the narration) frustrating, but on the whole it is also a compulsively readable, detailed, atmospheric, and core horror text. I recommend it to a diverse audience: horror/fantasy/vampire fans, classics fans, and also readers that don't often read classics, who I believe will find the writing style approachable and easy to understand. The Penguin Classics edition includes supplementary material, including footnotes that help clear up confusion, and an introduction and appendixes that provide more information for the curious reader. Very high recommended."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"I was intending to buy a novel for my nephew, one which I had read unabridged and enjoyed immensely. Unfortunately, I didn't realize that the \\"editor\\" was in fact an \\"abridger\\" and that lots of the original text was gone. This abridgement was not listed under book details; I wish I had scrolled down to the reveiws. Now I have to go through the hassle of return, shipping charges, etc."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Written English-language stories of vampires occur as early as the 12th Century, and by the 1800s vampires had become the stuff of popular fiction. Published as a series of pamphlets in the 1840s, VARNEY THE VAMPIRE was a successful \\"penny dreadful,\\" and with Le Fanu's 1872 CARMILLA the concept reached the level of high art. But the ultimate statement on the subject occurred in 1897 with the publication of Bram Stoker's DRACULA.If you come to the novel from one of its many film versions, you are in for a surprise: Bram Stoker's story has never made it to the screen without major changes. In most cases, however, the basic thread of the plot remains the same. Jonathan Harker, a London solicitor, is sent to Transylvania to complete the sale of an English estate to a mysterious Count--only to find himself at the mercy of a centuries-old vampire intent upon leaving his ancient rural stronghold in favor of more unsuspecting prey in England. Harker survives Dracula's castle, but he is unable to prevent Dracula from establishing himself in England, or from preying upon his future bride Mina.The novel is presented as a series of first-hand journal and diary entries and the occasional newspaper article, a format that was popular in the Victorian era and which lends the unlikely nature of the story and unexpected aura of probability. Stoker is unexpectedly gifted at shifting between the characters in this type of narrative, his language is memorable descriptive, and even though the book is distinctly Victorian in tone it has a pace and drive quite unlike most other works of the era.It is also, in many respects, a subconscious portrait of all the Victorians feared. In matters of sex, Victorian society was hypocritical in an almost paranoid schizophrenic way, and DRACULA is rife with sexual hysteria. The vampire himself becomes a sort of symbol for unbridled sexuality, and once ravished by him even the purest of women becomes a wanton. The novel abounds with covert metaphors for venereal disease, bestiality, child molestation, and--worst of all!--sexually aggressive women, and although men are typically presented as the protectors of morality the novel is actually colored by a vague homoeroticism as well. Even without its gruesome story, DRACULA's subtext was enough to send any self-respecting Victorian into a fit of screaming horrors.Obviously enough, times have changed, and we have seen numerous and much more graphic vampire novels since DRACULA was published more than a hundred years ago. Even so, and certainly due in part to its covert sexuality, DRACULA retains an almost hypnotic fascination--and unlike most Victorian novels it remains highly, highly readable. With Bram Stoker, ideas about vampires reached a sort of literary critical mass, and it remains a cornerstone in gothic literature to this day. Strongly recommended.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Out of all the books I have ever read, Stoker's \\"Dracula\\" ranks among my favorite for several reasons.1) \\"Dracula\\" is, of course, a classic, not to mention the Queen Mother of all twentieth-century vampire/horror/gothic fiction literature. You feel good when you read it because you know that you are reading of THE Count Dracula, not some modern-day spin-off.2) The story and emotional content is developed far enough that the characters - the Count just as equally, if not more - become almost iconic, having exhaustingly defined personalities of their own that effect a sort of sympathy (or apathy) in readers' minds for them that is seldom seen in such depth even among classics, much less in some \\"modern\\" novels.3) Sure, it's no novella, but there are enough \\"side-quests\\" (to employ some video game nomenclature) to keep track of, that the plot moves along at just the right pace. The fact that the whole book is a compilation of various characters' diaries, journals, phonograph records, notes, memos, legal documents, etc. just helps to develop the story and characters further, yielding the ability for the reader to see things from multiple perspectives (though witholding any redundancy).If you're looking for something good to read that will keep you thinking, read \\"Dracula\\"; I had some time to kill and picked it up, then hardly put it down afterwards until I finished. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"...but this was an excellent, different read.

Oh what the hell, i said to myself, I watched vampires movies and they were scary a lot but can it be alike in a book. nah of course not! well people i was wrong. This masterpiece of Gothic horror is the story of archetypal evil and the eternal struggle between life and death. It is the lefend of the vampire, who feeds a diabolic craving into the veins of his victims while drawing from them the human blood that is his only sustenance. The hypnotic spell that Dracula casts over the reader will linger through many black and stormy nights. I recoon, i am not such a brave person i do get scared while reading horror books which are my favorites but believe me when i say, this book is worth it!!"},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"When solicitor Jonathan Harker was struck with superstition and a new belief of vampires, he had embarked on a journey to talk over a house sale with a Count in Transylvania. Bram Stoker's Dracula envelops the courage of newfound friends on a journey of a lifetime. As the mysterious antagonist of the story endangers these friends their very souls are put on the line. After the death of their dear friend Lucy her old friends gather together to solve the mystery of her death. Meanwhile Mina Harker (Jonathan's wife) is becoming weaker and weaker everyday. Only a lunatics dying words save her from becoming a horrible creature of the night. Through the theme that a group of friends should get together to kill this evil corpse and free it's soul continues. Told through the stories of his courageous characters Stoker portrays a wonderful realistic aura of both the men and women of the story. Giving facts to the story of vampires creates an edgy unexpected turnout to the book. Also showing a different world from which we know, Dracula still has an important common factor; money. Without it our brave heroines never would be able to live through the numerous dangers they come face to face with. With his macabre details and well-rounded characters Stoker succeeds in reaching his obvious goal of showing how far love can carry you.Sometimes in the book content you can catch the author messing with the characters consciences as though to make this book mentally enthralling as well as emotionally. Though always a part of the book Dracula has smaller part if to his action time in the story compared to the other characters. In ways this book has a lot to do with emotional damage. As friends, family, and loved ones are lost so is some of the control of reasoning through the characters minds. Perhaps the author created some experiences that he himself been through. That would explain his realistic texture and great understanding of some of the events he talks about, such as the loss of a loved one. Stoker's book has accomplished taking a morbid subject and changing it into an emotional roller coaster. Each character has his/her own \\"moment of truth\\" in which current events change how they view the world and life within it. This book could be considered drama, as well as a factual fiction, as throughout the book you learn increasing details on the fictional beings vampires. Bringing yet another view of Dracula this book talks more along the lines of his last months on earth where as other stories talk of different views of his long lived life. I believe this dramatized book would be very enjoyable to teenagers and adults, people who like the paranormal will find this book particularly interesting. Those with avis imaginations will enjoy the creativity involved in this book."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

The size of the book IS daunting, but once one is finished reading it, you get a better picture of the Count.There is one thing that a reader should NOT look forward to when reading Stoker's masterpiece and that is any sexual overtones. Francis Ford Coppola's version of the book took that concept and ran with it (although I love that version!). In fact, Mina couldn't stand the Count and played a very active part in his destruction (something that few movie versions, if any, address).Fantastic read!"},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

Think that Dracula and other vampires can't be out in daylight? Wrong--they simply have no powers during the day, which you'd know if you read this extraordinary book.Written in epistolary form (that is, as a series of letters and diary entries), the story is presented from the viewpoints of the main characters, from Jonathan Harker to his wife Mina to Dr. van Helsing. Rather than detracting from the story, this format breaks up what would otherwise be a rather long manuscript into manageable chunks and adds to the historical character of the novel.Modern film interpretations have presented Stoker's story through the eyes of each producer, director, and screenwriter, with nearly all making wholesale changes--Mina Harker, for instance, is NOT the reborn lost love of Count Dracula as Francis Ford Coppola would have us believe. Many others who have &quot;read&quot; Dracula have done so through abridged texts that distort the story through omission. Pick up and read the story that started it all in its intended format... Bram Stoker's Dracula. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

And I'm sorry I waited so long to find that out.The interweaving of the narratives, sometimes skipping back a day or two to have one character's perspective &quot;catch up&quot; to another's was masterfully done. No sooner is one moment of suspense reached than we switch to someone else's current adventure, and the tension starts building all over again.Some people think that the book wanders away from the action too much, but I didn't find that to be a problem. The characters and atmosphere are so well written that any &quot;background&quot; information blends well into the plot itself.The only thing I found that slowed me down a bit was Van Helsing's broken English. However, once I got used to his style of speaking, it wasn't much of a hinderance to the pace.One aspect of the book that I especially appreciated is the fact that Mina Murray Harker is such a strong character. In the (1931) movie, she mostly looks winsome and cries. In this novel, she's a much bigger part of the action, actively participating in the mission to destroy Count Dracula even as she falls under his spell herself.I'm glad I finally read this book and had the opportunity to experience &quot;Dracula&quot; as its author intended the story to be told."},{"Title":"Dracula (G.

But you might as well be warned as to what you are in for. The early chapters, where Harker is trapped in Dracula's castle, are truly great! However, once the Count gets to London, things start to slow down, or even become downright annoying. I had a particular dislike for the obnoxious Van Helsing and his band of effete upper-class male heroes. I would have been much happier if Dracula had turned the bunch into vampires, and it had been left to Mina, Lucy and Renfield to stake the lot. Shelley's FRANKENSTEIN holds up much better as classic horror fiction.I wish I could recommend a better vampire novel, but, sadly, vampire novels are mostly trash, and much of the genre is now devoted to sick pornography. Better, in some ways, are Steven King's 'SALEM'S LOT, Sheridan Le Fanu's CARMILLA, and and Anne Rice's INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE (avoid the sequels), but none of them have anything that can substitute for the opening chapters of DRACULA."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Bram Stoker's classic is truly an enduring piece of literature. Despite its heavy dating, it still horrifies to this day. The story is told through a series of journal entries and letters between the main characters. It is a unique style, one that, unfortunately, is extremely unrealistic considering the meticulous detail invested into each entry by each character. The text can also be, at times, quite wordy and occasionally moves at a grueling pace. However, the story provides a truly remarkable atmosphere. It is dreary and foreboding, especially in the initial Harker story that takes place in the Count's castle. It is one of the most frightening parts of the book, unfolding slowly, with a chilly shade of dread that rumbles beneath each word like a gathering storm. The book never quite reaches this peak of terror again, but this is not to say that it fizzles in any way. When we are introduced to the new characters, the novel's pace slows, and becomes much like a cat-and-mouse game between the characters and the Count. It remains consistently bizarre and frightening throughout. Its mood is that of a funeral, dreadful and hopeless. Its huge Victorian setting is alien to us now, putting it in its own world, one which seems almost fantastic today. Dracula is truly a classic of the genre. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"I had very mixed feelings after reading Bram Stoker's classic horror novel about the seminal vampire of modern literature. The first part of the story, in which English real estate agent Johnathan Harker is trapped inside Castle Dracula with the dread count, is riveting and so much better than I expected. Stoker conjures up a truly oppresive and frightening atmosphere.However, once the action shifts to England, the story bogs down and never really gets going again. Stoker uses the unwieldy device of telling the entire story through the journal entries of various characters--they must have truly extraordinary memories to reproduce the conversations and lengthy speeches contained therein. The characters themselves are paper thin; all of the men are brave and honorable and all of the women fair and pure. Stoker devotes page after page to conversations in which characters deliver testimonials to each other's sterling qualities, which grows rather tiresome very quickly. To make matters worse, Dracula fades into the background at this point and makes only a few appearances after that.There are a few effective moments and things pick up a bit by the end of the novel, but it is never able to match the horror of its brilliant first section."},{"Title":"Dracula (G.

I am normally thrilled with Amazon's service, but this is a glaring exception."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"I'd never read Dracula before, but with all the current fascination with vampires, I thought it might be good to go back to the original Bram Stoker tale. In looking for a copy to read on my Kindle, I found that a few of the free editions were poorly formatted or had typographical errors (possibly from scanners). Moreover, Stoker does occasionally use italics for emphasis, so if the electronic edition you're reading does not have italics at all, you're not getting the original book.Back in the days before the Kindle, I often bought the Modern Library edition of classic books. I ran a search on Amazon and was pleased to find a Modern Library edition of Dracula for the Kindle. Yes, it cost a little bit, but not that much, and after being satisfied with a sample, I felt it would be a good buy. As far as reading the book goes, the Modern Library is very nice. I -have- found a couple of typos, definitely from scanners, but this few in a book of this size is not a huge problem.As I was getting close to the end of the book, I had not had time to read it for a few days, so I thought I would turn on text-to-speech for the drive home. I was shocked to see that the feature was disabled. I confirmed this by looking here at this page. Random House, which is the owner of the Modern Library editions, often does not allow text-to-speech (anyone with a seeing disability should protest to Random House loudly, by the way).So, this really boggled my mind. Think about this for a minute. This is a book that has been in the public domain for decades. Why exactly would Random House not want to allow text to speech for -this-book. It makes no sense.I am offering four stars because the book is not speech enabled, which it should be. The story itself, surprisingly modern in tone, if by itself, would receive five stars from me. I highly recommend the story, regardless of which edition you get. If you don't mind the disabled text to speech feature, the Modern Library edition is a good one to own."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"I did it! Finally! After all these years, I read Dracula! It took me a long time for several reasons. First of all, the font is small in the book I own, which made it difficult to read. Then I downloaded it on my Kindle and that was better, but I was also reading other books at the same time. Another reason why it may have taken me so long is the way it is written. In today's world, we are used to fast paced novels while Dracula is detailed, the writing old fashioned and the dialogue long. The different style, the sometimes plodding pace, the archaic words such as \\"bestrewed\\" and \\"perforce\\" forced me to slow down, but it also helped me immerse myself in the story.Stoker never visited Eastern Europe, but within the first few pages it is clear he did his research. The food, the garb and the landscape of Romania are so detailed, that although it is a bit tedious to get through, I really got a feel for the country. I visualized the imposing mountains and their dark shadows. As I read about Jonathan Harker's journey to the castle, I heard foreboding music accompanied by howling in my head. I don't know if seeing so many movies let me imagine the story better, but it was very vivid in my mind. There is a sense of wonder when you travel to a place where you don't know the language, but also one of unease. The fact that Harker is a foreigner gave him more distance from his surroundings and made him more vulnerable.After getting through the first few pages of exposition and Jonathan's journey to the castle, it got juicy. The novel Dracula is much more messed up and scary than any movie version I've seen. I had a preconceived notion because of film and television, but the book is different and I feel like I discovered a new story, or rather learned the true story. When I told people that I just finished Dracula, they exclaimed, \\"That was a scary book!\\" I have to agree. There were quite a few OMG, eye-widening, heart pounding moments. Stoker drew out the tension and he created beautiful atmosphere.Dracula is told in journal entries and letters throughout by Jonathan, Mina, Lucy, Van Helsing and Dr. Seward, creating personal accounts that provides a window not only to their viewpoints but their attitudes, hopes and fears.I like Dr. Seward a great deal. He is melancholy and thoughtful. His character seems to reflect his difficult, gloomy work and the depressing asylum. Dr. Van Helsing is interesting, eccentric and sweet. He views his friends almost as if they were his own children. (But I couldn't help but hear Anthony Hopkin's voice when I read his dialogue and journals.) To me, Jonathan was a bit braver than many movie versions and Mina seems to be the glue that holds the group together. Although Quincy and Godalming have no journal entries I still saw their heartbreak, bravery and compassion through the observations of their friends.Now, onto Dracula himself. Bela Legosi made him iconic and a template for all other Draculas. For all other vampires really. This image changed and morphed and created offshoots of the \\"friendly\\" vampire, the \\"hot\\" vampire, the self reflecting vampire with a conscience. However, the physical description of Dracula is very different than the handsome brooding men who have portrayed him (although he can change his appearance to fit in more easily to society). Dracula is also much more evil than I expected. He is a sadist. He is cunning. He is diabolical.My favorite character is Renfield. Poor, crazy, damaged Renfield! He's being used by Dracula and he is a clue right under the protagonist's noses. I like him because his behaviors are so disturbing and frightening and there is almost no figuring him out. During his short period of lucidity he shows grace and regret, which make him even more tragic. But it is during his spotlights into madness that he is the most compelling.What struck me the most about Dracula is the friendships. To me, that is the underlying theme. The characters band together to defeat an evil threat, which is the basis for many horror stories. They trust, support and hold on to each other. They are devoted to their cause and in turn devoted to each other's well being. The loss of Lucy brings them together and binds them. When Mina is in jeopardy, instead of turning from her in fear, they re-double their efforts. And while their first intention is to rid their lives of this enemy, they know they are also saving mankind and are willing to sacrifice their lives for this mission. Their courage and tenacity is inspiring.It's been very daunting to write about this novel, because I mean, it's Dracula. What can I say that hasn't been said already? There is so much to discuss, analyze and learn about this novel, about the author and how it has influenced our culture. There are essays and books about the book itself! It was fascinating to finally sink my teeth into (ooh that was bad, yeah?) read this classic. I feel as if I have at last been indoctrinated to the mystery, mythos and beauty that is Dracula."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

Hall (Large Print))","review":"Having escaped from the horror of Count Dracula's castle in a secluded part of Transylvania, Jonathan Harker thought he had seen the last of the Count. But when his fianc&eacute;'s friend's health starts deteriorating with no apparent reason he soon realises that it was not to be so. As he uncovers the terrifying secrets about the mysterious Count Dracula, he realises that the only way to save his beloved, Mina from also falling under the Count's clutches is to put an end to this heinous being for once and for all.Vampire stories have been told since the time before Dracula. So, you can't actually give Bram Stoker the credit for being the creator of the vampire lore. But at the same time it is true that most of the depictions of vampires over the years have been inspired from Bram Stoker's Dracula. While talking about vampires one of the first names that pops up into mind is that of Dracula.Living in a time when vampires are depicted as charming, \\"gorgeous\\" and like \\"Knights-in -shining-armour\\", Dracula is something to turn to when you get tired of the sickly sweet and hopelessly romantic vampires of today. It gives you all the chills and terrors that the tales of these undead creatures are connected to. Though I rarely read books in the horror genre and have read just one other gothic novel, this was a book which kept me glued to it till the very end. While reading the book I could actually imagine the creepy music of the old horror movies playing in the background which is accompanied by a blood- curdling scream. Though the much awaited scream didn't come Dracula became one of my favourite books. Though I have read the book just once I can actually remember some of the scenes as clearly as something I would have read right now- I remember my heart beating at a lightning speed during some of the instances of the book.Though the book is dominated by male characters I thought Mina Harker character, the strongest of them all. With her brave, steadfast and caring nature she became one of my favourite characters of the book. And of course then there is the Count Dracula in front of whom all the other characters become quite bland. The mysterious and ruthless vampire continues to terrify and fascinate generations of readers .Favourite Quote:\\"Once again...welcome to my house. Come freely. Go safely; and leave something of the happiness you bring.-Count Dracula to Jonathan Harker\\"\\"Though sympathy alone can't alter facts, it can help to make them more bearable.\\"\\"Despair has its own calms\\"Overall:Thrilling, hair- raising and above all an entertaining book.Recommended?Yes, to those who love a good vampire story which remains true to the myths and, also to those who like gothic fiction."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Dracula is not a perfect book. It's not very well written and even for it's time period it seems a bit over the top. To top this off the book is filled with glaring inaccuracies even within it's own mythology and the scary scenes are so ludicrous it readily becomes apparent that only in late Victorian England could this book ever have sold enough copies to survive for all these years. And on top of all of this it is an absolute and complete feminist NIGHTMARE. Oh the hours I could spend going over the contradictions and utter foolishness that this book is so utterly set on feeding to it's female readers.And yet . . .When you take this as a product of it's time, when you take it with a grain of salt, if you are willing to simply relax and take this as a bit of self indulgent fluffy reading and are ready to set the best of your imagination into constructing the scenes Mr Stoker so lovingly creates in these pages, it actually becomes a very enjoyable read.There's a certain dreamy, sensual horror that permeates these pages that must have seemed utterly riveting and a bit terrifying to it's readers a hundred years ago, and while it no longer speaks the same concerns in the voice of a modern generation it does not loose it's power to captivate.Reading Dracula now is a bit like finding a goodbye letter from a bygone era that knew it's death knell was ringing. It sensed the onslaught of sexuality, women's liberation, the loss of religious ideal, the coming of eastern fascination and decided to give one last rage before going into the dying of the light. That isn't to say that this isn't a book that can't be enjoyed without a lengthy philosophical introspection afterwards about the dying of a dated ideal. Because it *is* an interesting read, I just think that to view it without the above context is to miss something in this story.One word of advice to readers approaching this for the first time from a horror perspective - many reviewers have commented that over the years the horror part has been the first part of the story to rapidly diminish in impact however I would say that to the astute reader who is willing to pay attention to details within the story you'll find that this isn't necessarily so. Take for example the recordings of Dr Steward. The entire book is told in the form of diaries from various characters and of all of these the doctor is the only one foreword enough to record his on wax cylinders which act as an early tape recorder - now think about what that means in context to the story. Here we have a desperate and forsaken man who is heavily self medicating himself as he does this (probably on opium or laudanum) making a diary recording in the dead of the night about the woman he loves who is slowly being ripped apart from the inside out by an unknown, supernatural force on a container of wax cylinders in an *insane asylum*. Anybody listening to a recording about an evil spirit with the howls of mental patients in the background is bound to get the willies. Just remember to put things in proper context in this novel and I think just about the most hardened of hearts will find something to shiver over."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"I would never have read this book had it not been for our book club! What a wonderful piece of literature. I would recommend it highly for those of you who love a good read!"},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"After having read the horrible Dracula The Undead by Dacre Stoker and my own mind and soul rebelling against the sparkling angsty fad that is Twilight I have decided to reacquaint myself with a true king of the night. I was not disappointed.First, let's begin with why this is not a five star review. The only reason this is not a five star review is that I am not a fan of Epistolary novels. I never liked epistolary style. Epistolary style is an artful attempt at realism by making a novel consist entirely of detailed journal entries, letters and fake newspaper clippings. This was a popular style in Victorian England with authors like Robert Louis Stevenson and Bram Stoker. In general if I am reading Victorian literature I prefer a straight forward narrative like Charles Dickens, Victor Hugo or Oscar Wilde. It is for this matter of preference that I give this classic novel four stars instead of five. But despite my dislike of the style I will admit this is a great horror story. This is a classic.People take for granted just how scary Dracula can be simply because our culture is over saturated with almost cartoonish caricatures of him. The poor guy can't even introduce himself with a Romanian accent without us wanting to giggle because of what we associate with him but let's forget the cliches and modern over-saturation for a bit and think of Dracula for who and what he is.Dracula is a pretty scary guy. He does what he likes and to Hell with the consequences. When he talks to Jonathan Harker it's civil but there's the under-current of menace. It's almost like listening to the double talk of a crime boss from The God Father. His wording seems cordial when he tells Harker that he wants him to stay for at least a month to improve his English (even though he already speaks nearly perfect English) but what he's really saying (and what Jonathan is detecting) is 'I'm not letting you leave here. I am going to make you lie to your loved ones about why and there's a very high chance I'm going to kill you.'Dracula has incredible powers and yet, apparently for the fun of it, he climbs along the walls of his castle, up and down, like a spider. Why does he do this? He does not have to do it. Dracula can turn into mist or a bat or a wolf but apparently it amuses himself to scale a wall with the ominous quality of lizard-like motions as if on an unconscious levels he wants to prove how NOT human he is.On his way to England Dracula kills the entire crew of the Demetre. He slaughters them one by one. He can walk about in day (though it leaves him weakened and limited in his powers). He does NOT sparkle. He can turn into a bat, a wolf, or a foul vapor. He can also conjure winds and terrible torrential storms. He's strong as at least ten men and can defy gravity. He has the senses of a wolf and he can move like an animal and can be just as savage. He can enthrall minds and make you forget what he wills you to forget. The films always make it seem like Dracula has a LOT of limitations but if you don't have some garlic, wolfsbane, or sacred object in immediate reach you are utterly helpless!I think reacquainting myself with Dracula was my own mind's way of rebelling against the Twilight fad to remind myself of when vampires were both dangerous, terrifying and sensual at the same time. You can be charming and suave and still pretty damn scary. Stephenie Meyers and a lot of modern writers seem to forget this.I can recall once watching a documentary on the History channel some years ago about the real Dracula castle (I believe it was Bran Castle) and what happened was the villagers complained of strange noises up at the castle so they sent some priests to bless the place (much like in the Hammer horror film Dracula has Risen from the Grave) but as they neared the castle a terrible storm hit and they had to do the blessing from over a thousand feet away. At that moment the door to my apartment creaked open and, though I had not realized I before, I knew, at that very moment, that Dracula was probably the most terrifying fictional monster in existence.Dracula is the only classic monster that can give me nightmares.So if you're into vampires and miss the good old days when they were both seductive AND scary or just feel burnt out from Twilight I strongly, strongly recommend this classic. There are lot of positive things I can say about it and only two bad things.1. Great story but I don't like epistolary novels for the style of writing. I feel it's jarring.2. I do not like Dracula's mustache. No one ever mentions it but he has a mustache in the novel and the visual is not something I like. I keep wanting to imagine him clean shaven for some reason. I guess it has to do with the cultural collective idea that Dracula is this cleanly shaved guy in a suit (or if it's the Gary Oldman version with a mustache and goatee together).And please, do avoid the so-called \\"Official\\" sequel by Dacre Stoker. It's not worth it."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"I have read this book multiple times, and it NEVER gets old.

I wanted to be able to help him understand the story when he had questions.As I started to read, I realized that I am enjoying it much more than I ever did 30 years ago. I am hoping it from worldly experience. And as my son asks question about the story, I am able to explain it to him much more easily than if I had depended past memory.I think if you enjoy this genre of book, you will like this one. It is a much easier read than Frankenstein (my son's 7th grade class started it and couldn't understand it. Frankly, it was a pretty hard read for me as well), and I think will be much easier to interpret to a modern culture.This is a true classic, and after reading it, you will know why."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"I have not read an abundance of horror novels before, but this was one very enjoyable. It is very easy to see why it has become a classic. I have never come across a book written in the form of journal entries that was enjoyable before this one, but Stoker pulls it off masterfully in this book. It is essentailly written as a colelction of journal entries from Jonathan Harker, Mina Harker, Dr. Van Helsing, and Dr. Seward. It is very interesting, as it is almost like having four main characters, and each brings different observations and emphases to the table. Definitely very ingenuitive of Stoker.It is very Victorian in nature, which I very much enjoyed. He describes Victorian culture excellently and the characters are VERY believable and fit perfectly into their setting. There is also an American who comes into the story, and he is a perfect incarnation of the American spirit of the time as well.Dracula himself is very well done as well. Few evil characters are really anything beyond bad (you know, they simply do bad things when they get the chance), and usually they end up hiding out and the good guys go fight him. In this book, Dracula comes to get the good guys, making for a much better horror book. The nature of his evilness is also much better (or worse) than evil characters usually are in other books. He is not blatently evil at first, but attempts to mascarade as Harker's friend. After Harker finds out what he is, Dracula begins to try, not to kill Harker as the evil character would in many books, but to turn Harkers friends, even wife, against him by turning them into vampires.There are a good deal of religous undertones in this book as well. The cross and communion bread are heralds of light, and are the only really effective means of stopping Dracula (the garlic is usefull, but not nearly as powerful as the Christian symobls). The main characters do not even attempt to kill Dracula with their own power. The whole book is about them trying to kill Dracula only by putting him in contact with Christian symbols. Their is nothing that they can do of their own to harm him, they must resort (mostly) to communion bread and crosses.Definitely a exciting read. It's very hard to put down once you start it. I highly recommend.Overall grade: A"},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Bram Stoker's Dracula is the original horror novel, personifying one of the most feared and beloved characters in the history of horror. Dracula has been a source of more rip-offs, movies, graphic novels, and all other sorts of paraphernalia - even lines of action figures.Bram Stoker himself was a energetic and brilliant man, having managed and acted in theater, engaged in lectures, wrote several novels, and finally published Dracula when he was 50. Set in old Transylvania, the story was progressive for it's time: it features surprisingly detailed accounts of violence, and a female protagonist with surprisingly strong character, while still possessing some of the era's flaws modern feminism looks down upon.The premise of the story is simple enough, and well known: Dracula, based in Transylvania, moves out and enters England in search of more and more fresh vitality. His encounters with several individuals lead to a banding together of several individuals who hunt down and destroy the monster. Despite this simple summary, Stoker's brilliant telling evokes a sense of mystery and wonder about this mysterious count.The driving purpose behind Dracula is readily achieved, though perhaps not as effectively as it once would have. Despite it's age and comparative \`tame' nature next to modern horror novels, it still retains an aura of mystery throughout that will leave first time readers suitably impressed. The books central theme of Good vs. Evil is so timeless that readers of any era can enjoy it. Characters within the book take on distinctive personalities, and Stoker possesses the all to real ability to make them interact with each other throughout the book in a believable manner. The only failing comes in the novel's sometimes slow pace and the format of letters and notes, which sometimes force Stoker to skirt around telling things directly.Despite a few minor flaws stemming from the temporal gap between when it was written and modern day readers, Dracula remains a compelling and rich read, full of dreary gothic horror of the most original variety."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Everybody knows the usual tales of vampires and the supernatural. Or, at least, they thought they did. Dracula, by Bram Stoker, is a collection of many accounts of the presence of vampires, and specifically, the infamous Count Dracula. The story starts out with Jonathan Harker, a solicitor journeying to sell Dracula a bit of property. An innocent representative of all that is good in the world, Jonathan soon finds out that he is in great danger. He says, \\"The castle is a veritable prison, and I am a veritable prisoner! (37). The Count Dracula, who seemed so polite, is truly quite frightening and is planning out Harker's death as he stays in the castle. Jonathan realizes he must escape or die trying.The story switches from Harker's diary to the journal of Dr. Steward, who works at an asylum near Carfax, the estate that Dracula bought. He tells of his patient Renfield, who is almost certainly insane. Steward also becomes involved with the illness of his former love, Lucy, who is a good friend of Mina Murray (Harker's fianc&eacute;e). Steward calls upon Van Helsing, his former teacher to assist in the healing of Lucy. After leaving Lucy unattended for a night, she is found to have a turn for the worse, and was thought by Van Helsing to have lost immense quantities of blood via two red marks on the throat. With Lucy's health quickly waning, Mina's fears about her husband's queer manner increasing, and the constant escape of Renfield to Carfax, there is no doubt that all these paradoxes can be related to the one and only Count Dracula.The strength in personality of every one of the characters is what makes this book a vital read. From Dracula to Mina, each character has a unique personality that shows itself thought their writings and actions. Dracula, who is described by Harker as being unusually and reassuringly polite, is doing so to hide his evil. Mina is an independent woman who is intelligent and can think for herself. Another strong character is Van Helsing. He is a very stern and mysterious man, though he will at times show his emotions. Dr. Seward notes, \\"Then when his face grew grave and stern, again I asked him why his mirth, and why at such a time. His reply was in a way characteristic of him, for it was logical and forceful and mysterious\\" (209).Another strong point of the novel was that one was never without suspense, even throughout the whole 450 pages. The book proves an excellent example of the literary device of a \\"cliffhanger,\\" for at the end of some of the accounts, the reader is forced to read on to discover the end. When Lucy says, \\"Goodbye, dear Arthur, if I should not survive this night!\\" (175) and Van Helsing says, \\"We can do nothing as yet. Wait and see\\" (195), the peak of my interests was reached. If that does not so obviously and commandingly tell you to read on, then I don't know what will!Though this is a quality read, man is not perfect, and neither is this book. The only thing I thought could be improved was that some of the newspaper clippings included in the beginning of the book could have been omitted. In a letter from Quincey Morris to Arthur Holmwood, Quincey says, \\"Won't you let this be at my camp-fire tonight?\\" (78). They are simply planning a get together, and it seems as if it has no relation to the other suspenseful action that is going on.In addition, the book started out a bit slow. When Harker started his journal, I was worried that the book was going to be a hard and boring read. With simple and somewhat trivial information, Jonathan began, \\"Left Munich at 8:35 p.m. on 1st May, arriving at Vienna early next morning; should have arrived at 6:45, but train was an hour late.\\" (7). These first words of such as classical book were a bit disappointing by my standards. Though I am sure novels are so often hard to get going, such a writer as Bram Stoker should have been able to come up with a better first impression.With such a book as this, I am completely willing to give up all critic remarks. Dracula is not a classic without reason, but a beautifully literary depiction of personality, fear, love, thrill, and intelligence. This novel is a must-read for anyone and everyone who appreciates literature and entertainment."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"First off, I would like to say that I thoroughly enjoyed Dracula. This classic tale of vampires is a great read. I normally read fantasy and sci-fi, but this book offers things I can't get from either of those. The old English in this book adds flavor, and the way it is written (a series of journal entries) adds a great change of pace. Many people read this book because they want to see the great-grandfather of all the Dracula and vampire media, I know that's why I did. However, there is a trick to this book. It is better to go into this book not expecting, and without thinking about all the things you think you know about vampires. If you do, you may be extremely disappointed. Instead, take the book for what it is; a great read that has a wonderful tale. The characters were rich and vivacious. The story was terribly well written, and was packed full of suspense. If you can learn to just look at it for what it is, I know you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Stoker's Dracula is in the unusual narrative form of the journal entries, news clippings, telegrams and letters between the unfortunate band of people drawn up in Dracula's wake as he attempts to trade in his life in the old country for the teeming streets of London. With its unusual presentation, this novel must have been the Blair Witch of its day and has thoroughly withstood the test of time. The journals blend seamlessly into short narratives and dialogues and, with the many voices and perspectives, build an undeniable tension throughout the book. The end lacks no potency just because you think you know who is going to win in the end.The movie form of Stoker's Dracula is close but no cigar. Though I sort of like the Hollywood added Dracula/Mina romance angle, it is not present in the book. Jonathon Harker, a solicitor from London and the fianc&eacute;e of Wilhemina (Mina), is trapped in Dracula's castle after delivering the papers involved in the purchase of Carfax Abbey by the Count. Whiling away the time until Jonathon's return, Mina spends time with Lucy Westenra, who is not quite the coquette she is made out to be in the movies though she does have three suitors: John Seward who runs the sanitarium that abuts Carfax Abbey, Quincey Morris (an American adventurer), and Lord Goldalming (Arthur) whose proposal she has accepted. When she falls mysteriously ill, Seward is called in who calls for his old mentor and professor, Van Helsing. Jonathon finally surfaces again in a foreign city requiring Mina's nursing, leaving the three former suitors and Van Helsing to battle for Lucy's soul against the Count. When Jonathon's journal from the castle is eventually integrated into the experiences of the four men, an alarming picture becomes clear and they are vowed to pursue and destroy the monster. Stakes rise when Dracula attempts to use Mina against the tribe and their failure would ultimately mean the forfeiture of Mina's soul. Pardon the pun but blood runs high as the men pursue Dracula even back to his own castle while Mina struggles to maintain her gentler nature.I was very impressed with how compelling a read this was given the narrative form and the differing conceptions of horror over the centuries. The eroticism has since paled, I think, as other authors have pushed that envelope a great deal farther since then but it seems an excellent snapshot of Victorian struggles against the baser natures of mankind."},{"Title":"Dracula (G.

I read this book the first time when I was 8 or 9 and it scared me so badly I piled all my stuffed animals over me in case Dracula came after me in the night. I absolutely loved it and to this day I enjoy it every time I re-read it. One reviewer complained about Stoker's \\"overwhelming message of women + sex = way too scary for any decent man to handle\\" being pretty annoying. The interesting thing about her complaint this is exactly what got the book written during the time of Queen Victoria and society was very repressed. Women were getting out of the house and beginning to be independent -- some of them actually took jobs. The concept of women and sex being scary today may seem outdated but when this book was written, it was a very real fear in Victorian society. Instead of finding this concept annoying it should be realized that it's very educational of a particular time in history. People really thought like this and this is some of what gives the book its power.Further, is this any different from the current batch of horror movies that always has the girl who has sex killed by the monster? Or clad only in a flimsy negligee? At any rate, Dracula is a truly terrific book and one of my all time favorites."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

In addition to the coolness factor that this guy has, the book is suspenseful, contains fleshed out characters with a kickin' storyline.

I think I enjoyed it so much because of the mysteriousness and horror of the book. I also enjoy reading classics. The way that Bram Stoker wrote this book was just very original and kept me intrigued.Jonathon Harker travels to Transylvania to meet Count Dracula. There he finds that Dracula is no ordinary man, but a vampire. He discovers that he is a prisoner in Dracula's castle, \\" But I am not in heart to describe beauty, for when I had seen the view I had explored further doors, doors, doors, everywhere and all locked and bolted. The castle is a veritable prison, and I am its prisoner!\\" Harker then decides to try to escape. Meanwhile, in England, his fianc&eacute; Mina Harker and friend Lucy begin to have encounters with Dracula not knowing what or who he is. Lucy is attacked by Dracula and later dies. Jonathon Harker returns and him and friends begin to discover more about Dracula. Dracula then possesses Mina. The men find that Dracula has come to England with boxes of soil from his homeland, and sleeping in them is the only way he can survive. They destroy the boxes, making Dracula return to Transylvania and they track him there. They then kill him and save all the people that were possessed by him. I thought that this story was extremely compelling and it kept my attention very well.In this book, I got to know each character very well. Each character has there own unique personality and characteristics. One of the reasons I think this book is so good is because each character is so unique from the others and they are so believable. The character that I liked the most and that I found most memorable Professor Van Helsing. He is one of the only characters that understands what they are fighting against and knows Vampire folklore so that he can defeat Dracula, \\"to rid the earth of this terrible monster we must have all the knowledge and all of the help we can get.\\" Because of this knowledge he becomes the leader of the group and is one of the main characters towards the end of the book. The author really makes you care about the characters because of the way he wrote this book. He presents the book in the form of diaries and letters. Therefore the reader really understands how the character is feeling and the experiences they are going through."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"From early childhood I have been both fascinated and terrified by vampire stories. I have an uncle to thank for this fear and for many a nightmare too. I would sit on his lap, whenever he visited, and beg him to tell me of Count Dracula's latest crimes, perpetrating evil against the people of the world. I even went so far, with my vampire obsession, as to ask my parents for a crucifix, to protect me against vampires. Since we're Jewish this presented a major problem, until my mother told me the Star of David would repel Dracula as well as a cross. I probably watched every film made about vampires and read several books on the topic, including romance novels where the vampire is the hero. So it is astounding that I never picked up Bram Stoker's \\"Dracula\\" until last week. Yes, I knew the novel existed...but I kept putting off reading it. WOW!! What a great book!! It's the mother of all vampire stories with Count Dracula as king! It is the quintessential gothic story of suspense and horror, and beautifully written. I am awed and so glad that I finally read the book.This is not the 1st novel about vampires. Three 19th-century works of fiction preceded Stoker's novel. \\"Dracula,\\" however, is a kind of allegory which presents a vision of evil personified in the Count, and goodness portrayed by those who thwart him. The story is set in Victorian England, where the centuries-old, bloodthirsty monster, who preys upon beautiful, innocent victims, represents the dark underbelly of the moralistic Victorian society. The characters are very well developed and are severely tested in their zeal to rid the world of the vampire. The novel is narrated by their different voices. Through journals, diaries, letters, newspaper clippings, the reader is introduced, firsthand, to these principal characters, all antagonists of the vampire, Dracula. Telling the tale from different perspectives is an effective tool for understanding the people who play such important roles and allowing for more nuanced characters and plot development.Stoker's vampire is based on the 15th century Wallacian warrior, Prince Vlad Dracule. The author visited Romania and Hungary to read original historic manuscripts and to research local lore in order to write this book.A young solicitor, Jonathan Harker, leaves his beloved fiancee, Mina, to travel to a remote area in the Carpathian Mountains of Transylvania. He makes the trip at the behest of a new client, Count Dracula, who purchased an estate in England and wants Harker's small law firm to represent him in matters of real estate, shipping and finance. Harker experiences unimaginable horrors at Dracula's castle and is fortunate to escape with his life.Meanwhile, Dracula travels to London, setting up multiple households with coffins in each, where he may sleep during the day and escape the sunlight, so lethal to vampires. Lucy Westenra, a close friend to Jonathan's fiancee, Mina, falls victim to Dracula's bloodlust. Her illness and subsequent death bring into the picture her own fiance, two other men who admired her and Professor Van Helsing, an expert in vampires. The presence of evil looms, pervasive and sinister, over the entire tale, creating an oppressive ambiance.Author Stoker's writing is superb; his descriptions of landscapes and people are extraordinary, even haunting at times. The plot is gripping, which is extraordinary as most everyone knows how things will turn-out in the end. I am extremely impressed by the novel and highly recommended it.JANA"},{"Title":"Dracula (G.

I did not think that a book written 100 years ago could hold such ground in today's society, but surprisingly it did. Its first person perspective from newspaper articles and journal entries adds a macabre realness to the novel. Stoker's use of the Count seems to emphasize the dual nature of humans; a sophisticated noble one minute and a blood sucking fiend the next. In addition it is mind boggling how someone could create such a character. I recommend this book to anyone interested. I will recommend this book to my grandchildren. It is a timeless classic that will never grow old."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

In Transylvania, Count Dracula is seen as a type of authority figure, for he has witnessed many historical battles and has lived many centuries through the fall and rise of his history and country; which has made his family considerably wealthy and noble. Apart from being the villain, Dracula is well-read, clean shaven (although he despises vanity), and civil-well, for a while at least.Dracula's Castle is marvelous, built of enormous dark thick stone, which keeps a steady chill and feeling of suspense in the air at all times. The endless hallways and corridors with hundreds of locked doors seem to blend with the vast staircases, giving you a choking sensation. The peculiar and most striking antique furnishings seem to have taken a drink from the fountain of youth; for they are flawless--almost too flawless. There are no mirrors to be found anywhere and the library, well one of them at least, is filled with books written in many languages and on various subjects. The bureaus there are littered with old newspapers, maps, and magazines. Why, the only soul living in the Castle is Dracula who for some reason doesn't seem to be among the living at all. For Dracula is sly and sinister. When you are first introduced, you notice that his canine teeth are remarkably large and protrude over his cherry red lips, while his presence gives you a malicious chill, along with a whiff of his rank breath. Vampires always appeared to me cold and collected, swift, smooth, and clean, not so messy like vicious hounds, and disgusting sea monsters, but don't get me wrong, there are very gory moments in the novel.Don't let the title \\"classic\\" cause your insides to rumble and make you want to run away and scream. Dracula is filled with those action-packed fighting scenes and the timeless heroic drama, which we all love, along with a side of being addictively scary. Bram Stoker's clever historical and psychological babble; is what makes Dracula seem so realistic. The novel takes its time to get you fully interested and alert, but once you get going you will find yourself being held prisoner in many interesting and grim predicaments. This novel, or collection rather, is composed of notes, journal entries, letters, telegrams, and newspaper scraps, written by some main characters in the story: Jonathan Harker, Wilhemina (Mina) Harker, Quincey Morris, Lord Goldalming, Dr. Van Helsing, Dr. John Seward, and Lucy Westenra. The five men try to save Lucy Westenra before Dracula embezzles her soul, but Dracula, uses Mina against the men. If they don't bring an end to Dracula the lives of both women are jeopardized. Let's just say that Dracula gives you something to dream about, but be warned, this book is under the category of horror for a reason."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Dracula may be an iconic figure in film and television, but his appeal is not diminished in print. This truly is a wonderful, absorbing read; I enjoyed it far more than I expected to. Stoker's prose is pleasantly easy to read (although the footnotes do come in handy for some of the more obscure references to medieval eastern European history).The narrative is generally well-paced, only occasionally sagging under the weight of unnecessary scene-setting and backstory. It is told from a multitude of viewpoints with an almost postmodern attention to point-of-view distortions. This device also goes a considerable way towards breathing real life into the engaging characters.The story is a familiar one, of course, particularly to anyone who has seen the 1992 film version. With Coppola's slightly salacious additions stripped away (Lucy is a giddy charmer here rather than a perpetually-tipsy flirt, for example), this is an often stark tale, redolent with folkloric eerieness, as fin-de-siecle scientific triumphalism battles vainly against an older, altogether darker set of laws.However many versions of the story you've seen, _Dracula_ remains a surprisingly rich and unnerving read - all the richer, indeed, for the cultural resonance it has picked up since it was first published. We have seen Jonathan Harker reach his slow realisation of the true nature of the Count countless times, yet this knowing shiver only adds to the creeping unease when Harker first enters Dracula's castle.This a gem of a novel, waiting to be rediscovered."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"The first time I picked up Dracula was at the age of twelve while on a Gothic Literature kick and considering the Coppola version of the film had just come out, expected to be sinking my teeth into a horror tale akin to The Vampyr. Only problem was Stoker wrote the book a few decades too late to be considered truly \\"gothic\\" and it isn't really a horror novel at all [despite what my teachers and minister kept telling my parents].Dracula is a love story at its heart. The romantic love story between Jonathon Harker and his sweetheart Whilamina Murray, as he escapes from castle prisons, fends off the advances of Dracula's Brides, and finally hunts down the lethal creature he unwittingly sets on Mina's scent. It is also the story of platonic love between a group that cover almost every aspect of Victorian Society as they come together to become not just the force that will destroy the Count, but the closest of friends. The Victorian Morality is rather thick, but rather than taking from the story as many books written during this same time it only add to the storyline. The way in which it is written as well - as diary entries and scrapbook clippings - also adds to the mood and drives the story on quite effectively. The tensions slowly build with every entry as you jump from Jonathon's journal to Mina's diary to John Seward's dictations and you find yourself wanting to read as fast as you through one character's words to find out what piece of the puzzle the next character will help you discover. To be quite honest, the Count himself is really a secondary character .... an evil for the lovers and their friends to defeat so they may save the Pure Miss Mina from the same fate as the other women in the novel.Those looking for a sexy horror novel might be disappointed by Dracula because it really doesn't offer much of either unless you're willing to read into the Victorian Politeness of the prose. However those looking for an inventive, well written classic tale of love, honour, friendship and a stirring battle against the powers of evil will not be disappointed with this book one bit."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Stoker's classic is unique for many reasons - the unusual method of storytelling, the slow, solid building of plot and atmosphere, the juxtaposition of the supernatural and the \\"modern\\" world, and the exquisitely crafted characterizations.The character of Mina, in particular, is worthy of noting. It is wonderful that at a time when women were thought of as weak and not particularly intellectual, Stoker created a such a strong and intelligent female character. (It is largely through Mina's efforts that Van Helsing and Co. are able to track and ultimately defeat Dracula.)Sadly, modern film versions of the book do not reflect this - Mina is either depicted as ineffectual and helpless, or as a gullible creature who quickly falls in love with the title character.Also, film versions neglect to emphasize one of the best parts of the book. Dracula is not only a story of supernatural horror; it is also a story of love, courage, and faith uniting a small band of heroes against a powerful evil."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Bram Stoker's only popular novel is also one that starteled me to my core. Based in 1800's England, five men, Jonathan Harker, John Seward, Dr. Van Helsing, Queincy Morris and Aurthur Holwood (later called Lord Godlaming) take up the harrowing challange of destroying the most evil being to ever walk this earth: Count Dracula.Very mellow dramatic and with stark discriptions, this book takes you through variaties of emotions and feelings, mostly about the female characters, Lucy Westerna and Mina Murray (later called Mina Harker).Although long and strenuous at times, you always wonder \\"what next,\\" even though you know the answer...maybe. The book is written in the form of several journal entries, which enhances the effect in the fact that you get each persons perpective in a varity of way and from each person, but also harbors it by limiting what each individual can think at certain times. Stoker brings you through feelings of pity for the victims of the vampires also, playing with the most basic of human emotions.The tone of the book increases steadly while the characters develop better than expected. My second vampire novel, it barely tops \\"Interview With The Vampire,\\" which also left me breathless."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Yes, the story has been done to death, but even the best movie pales in comparison to the original. The story is written as the diary of young Jonthan Harker, detailing his trip to East Europe on behalf of Count Dracula, the ship's log journeying from the Black Sea to England, and the encounters Harker has with the vampire upon his return to London.The story works on several levels - as a classic horror novel, as a love story, as a commentary on good and evil and the human condition - even as a travelouge (the places and routes taken by the characters are uncannily accurate). But it is as a horror / thriller that this book is at its best.Leave your expectations behind - the original is very unlike most of the films inspired by it (Coppola's \\"Brahm Stoker's Dracula\\" is the closest to the book) - I recommend you read it on its own merits. And with the lights on ... just in case."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Throughout my life, I have seen so many adaptations of this book on films, and enjoyed many of them. I'm not much of a reader, and only recently began to buy books because I have so few. This was due to Bill O'Reilly book 'The O'Reilly Factor.' He pointed out in his book that there are countless people he knows that have so few books in their homes. Well, this inspired me to go back out and buy some classic novels. I always knew that novels imitate life and vice versa. I bought this book because I already enjoyed the countless films of it. But was I amazed at how intriguing this story is and the format in which it is told. The theme between life and death, friend and foe, love and hate, good and evil religion and science, fable and fact, fear and hope; is so consistent throughout. Each account, i.e. entry, adds to the substance of how fragile life is and how honoring it is to be a small fraction of the whole. Existence is the key and morality is the door, how we conduct ourselves determines our fate and the fate of others. Bram Stoker's Dracula is a masterpiece. The facts and fiction play off one another so well, and style chosen to tell the story, is by far the most unique book out there. While reading this book, I often pictured the main characters like those in the original movie Star Wars. What I meaning is, how fate brings them together and they in turn unite to bring down the wrath of their opponents for the sake of good. To resolve the suffering from the evil that has been inflicted on others and risking it all to the very end. To say that Dracula is a horror novel, to me, is further from the truth. Dracula is a romantic action/adventure with gothic undertones. I feel that Stoker used this to tell a tale about good vs evil, and to stand apart from the countless other tales. But this is my opinion; and I see so much beauty and meaning written in Dracula, and may never again be able to thoroughly enjoy Hollywood's interpretation of it."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Bram Stoker's masterpiece Dracula remains a mesmerizing story. Even if it's over one hundred years old, it still plays with the of every child at heart that we are. When I started reading Dracula, I was a little distracted by the many changes of point of views. You start Jonhathan Harker's journal, then you have letters from Mina, Lucy... but after sometime I started enjoying it because it gave us a way to really know how the characters are feeling rather than just read what a narrator thinks. At one point, I understood that the author did so that we would have the same information as the characters did, that is they take the different letters, journal, telegraphs, scraps of papers and put them together. This is something that really makes you feel like you're one of the silent characters, you're there but not there, it's quite interesting.Even if there was many remakes of that story, in the movies, as well as in books, I think that Bram Stoker's Dracule will remain a classic for quite some time."},{"Title":"Dracula (G.

Hall (Large Print))","review":"Dracula has become a classic since its publication in 1897. Being drawn to the classics, I'm rather surprised this one slipped through without my perusing it until now. While I did like this book and can learn from it, there were things I found that irritated me. Like Lucy. There was just something about her that I couldn't stand. Whether it was that she was without flaws, or that she was *always* in distress, I'm not exactly sure, but I do know I couldn't wait for them to pierce her heart with that stake and cut off her head. She just bugged me. The other thing that bothered me, was the lapse in the Professor's speech. On more than one occasion, he spoke like he was a foreigner, while at others, his dialogue was no different than the others. While this didn't exactly pull me out of the story, it was noticeable. Other than those things, I pretty much liked the book. It was enjoyable and did hold my attention, and I did like the majority of the characters.

I was delighted to find the 1995 hardcover Konemann classics edition of Stoker's Dracula at my local thrift shop for a dime. (ISBN 3-89508-096-9, and it has an image of Bela Lugosi on the cover). Now I know why someone else wanted to ditch the book: it is chock full of ridiculous errors. Punctuation and grammar mistakes abound. Some words are misspelled, others are just plain missing. I tolerated it as long as I could, but on page 288 I found an \\"I'II\\" instead of an \\"I'll\\" in some dialogue and just about lost it. I'II? How do you even make that mistake?Avoid this version at all costs. Unfortunately, I cannot make a recommendation for a better edition (though I would think Penguin or Norton would have a proper version out there). The copyright page lists \\"Michael Hulse\\" as the series and volume editor, which is surprising. Hulse is a respected poet and translator (a number of German books translated to English), but in his role as editor keeping watch over this literary classic, he has dropped the ball dramatically. Apparently he is responsible for editing many of the Konemann Classics series published in the mid to late 90's, so I would advise that you avoid them at all costs, especially this poor misrepresentation of Dracula!"},{"Title":"Dracula (G.

Hall (Large Print))","review":"\\"Dracula\\" was not the first vampire novel, nor was it Bram Stoker's first book.But after years of research, Stoker managed to craft the ultimate vampire novel, which has spawned countless movies, spinoffs, and books that follow the blueprint of the Transylvanian count. Eerie, horrifying and genuinely mysterious, \\"Dracula\\" is undoubtedly the most striking and unique vampire novel yet penned.Real estate agent Jonathan Harker arrives in Transylvania, to arrange a London house sale to Count Dracula. But as the days go by, Harker witnesses increasingly horrific events, leading him to believe that Dracula is not actually human. His fiancee Mina arrives in Transylvania, and finds that he has been feverish. Meanwhile the count has vanished -- along with countless boxes filled with dirt.And soon afterwards, strange things happen: a ship piloted by a dead man crashes on the shore, after a mysterious thing killed the crew. A lunatic talks about \\"Him\\" coming. And Mina's pal Lucy dies of mysterious blood loss, only to come back as an undead seductress. Dracula has arrived in England -- then the center of the Western world -- and intends to make it his own...\\"Dracula\\" is the grandaddy of Lestat and other elegantly alluring bloodsuckers, but that isn't the sole reason why this novel is a classic. It's also incredibly atmospheric, and very well-written. Not only is it very freaky, in an ornate Victorian style, but it is also full of restrained, quiet horror and creepy eroticism. What's more, it's shaped the portrayal of vampires in movies and books, even to this day.Despite already knowing what's going on for the first half of the book, it's actually kind of creepy to see these people whose lives are being disrupted by Dracula, but don't know about vampires. It's a bit tempting to yell \\"It's a vampire, you idiots!\\" every now and then, but you can't really blame them. Then the second half kicks in, with accented professor Van Helsing taking our heroes on a quest to save Mina from Dracula.And along the way, while our heroes try to figure stuff out, Stoker spins up all these creepy hints of Dracula's arrival. Though he wrote in the late 19th-century manner, very verbose and a bit stuffy, his skill shines through. The book is crammed with intense, evocative language, with moments like Dracula creeping down a wall, or the dead captain found tied to the wheel. Once read, they stick in your mind throughout the book.It's also a credit to Stoker that he keeps his characters from seeming like idiots or freaks, which they could have easily seemed like. Instead, he puts little moments of humanity in them, like Van Helsing admitting that his wife is in an asylum. Even the letters and diaries are written in different styles; for example, Seward's is restrained and analytical, while Mina's is exuberant and bright.Even Dracula himself is an overpowering presence despite his small amount of actual screen time, and not just as a vampire -- Stoker presents him as passionate, intense, malignant, and probably the smartest person in the entire book. If Van Helsing hadn't thwarted him, he probably would have taken over the world -- not the Victorian audience's ideal ending.Intelligent, frightening and very well-written, \\"Dracula\\" is the well-deserved godfather of all modern vampire books and movies -- and its unique villain still dwarfs the more recent undead."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"DraculaBy Bram StokerSignet Classics. $4.95(Ages 14 and up)By Andrew McGDracula is a spine-tingling story filled with twists and. Like most novels there are really two stories--the one involving the characters and a symbolic one. The story involving the characters is meant to be exciting, mysterious, suspenseful and scary. The symbolic story is about good vs. evil, God vs. Satan, and restraint vs. desire.Bram Stoker (1847-1912) was born and raised in Dublin, Ireland. He spent most of his free time reading and writing. He began writing simply for his own pleasure, but his love for literature drove him to great success. He held various jobs in his life including a drama critic, a newspaper editor/reporter, a short story writer, and even a play manager. Stoker's most famous work, Dracula, was first published in 1897.Although Stoker's writing in Dracula was a spellbinding, verbosity was one of his biggest weaknesses. In several passages throughout the book, Stoker tended to provide seemingly endless detail which added little to the story. Dialogue and content is vital for a horror book, but too much makes the story slow-moving and less exciting. However, Stoker's vivid descriptions and attention to detail in many passages did make the characters truly come alive.The description of the carriage ride to Borgo Pass was quite good. The reader can feel the growing danger as they climb the mountain, the road becomes more dangerous, the night darkens and the weather grows colder and more blustery. The intense feeling of loneliness when Harker wakes in the carriage surrounded by a pack of wolves was chilling.Stoker does a good job of creating his devilish figure, making him appear in shadowy form in some cases and of course a bat in others. Dracula is pure evil. He feels no remorse and has no concern for the feelings of others. This is made especially clear since he lives on the blood of others, literally and symbolically stealing their life source. He lives seduces them with temptation or intimidates them with overpowering violence. Failure to resist can result in the loss of life and soul. Only faith in God can overcome Satan is his message. The cross and the stake become the weapons to defeat the devil; to overcome temptation again is the message. The effect is vivid, scary, and powerful.There are many strengths and weaknesses to Dracula. Stoker is very effective in presenting various points of view. Throughout the book, the story is told through the eyes of several characters. The multiple vantage points tell not only more about each character, but make more clear the different feelings and emotions characters have.Stoker's use of language consistently engages the reader's mind and imagination, making the story more enjoyable and thought provoking. It is scary to think about how strong we would have to be in the face of such evil and to wonder if we would be strong enough to resist and overcome the powers of Dracula."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

Dark and frighting, the cloying feeling of being trapped and helpless."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Ah Dracula... I hope I don't need to tell you about the plot for this one! The edition I read was a modern library classic and the introduction was extremely well done. As with most introductions to classics, it does carelessly share spoilers as though it's at the end of the book. I still like to read the intro first though, because I think I get more out of a book when I've read a little of the literary analysis first. The literary analysis in this book was interesting and very well done, but on top of that the author was actually very funny. The tidbit that stuck with me the most was the observation that Dracula could represent a fear of independent and sexually liberated women. And oh the sexual undertones! It was all very Victorian era and while the views of women were quite archaic, it was still a fascinating glimpse of past social norms.Although I wouldn't describe the sexual undertones as subtle, there was certainly never anything explicit. All violence was similarly vague and never described in gory detail. Having read several \\"sequels\\" and re-tellings in addition to the original, I think this is one of the main features that sets the original apart. It was definitely less creepy than the newer Dracula spin-offs, but I really appreciated the author leaving so much to your imagination. The subtlety was a refreshing change from the sensationalism of many of today's thrillers and horror novels.I also loved that the novel was written as a series of letters (in an \\"epistolary\\" style for you English majors). As the intro points out, the author often doesn't explicitly make the connection betwen events. Instead he trusts the reader to figure it out and by doing so, he engages the reader more deeply with the material. The author also does a great job giving each character a distinct voice. Even without labels, it would be possible to figure out who wrote each letter by tone alone.The characters are fairly flat, but they're also not really the point. This novel is driven by the suspense, not the characters. Fortunately for us modern readers, the characters are reasonably intelligent about their situation. I found their reactions believable, but they don't figure everything out slowly enough to be frustrating. Overall, this is less creepy than modern novels, but I enjoyed the book for both it's lack of sensationalism and for it's historic place in vampire mythology."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"_Dracula_ is by no means an intolerable novel. I enjoyed quite a bit more than I thought I might, actually. However, it's certainly not a great book, or one that necessarily deserves to be called a &quot;Modern Library Classic&quot;. The best part about this edition is the introduction by Peter Straub, by far the most interesting part of the book. Straub lays out a very convincing set of ideas about why the book is popular and what its meaning may really be. He is right when he states that film is what has kept this book in popular culture. It surely would be long forgotten without the countless cinematic efforts to bring vampire tales to a mass audience. The characters in the book are largely interchangable, with old Van Helsing coming in as the most irrating because of his hard to read accent. They also are rather shallow, and express thier emotions in a sort of child-like way. However, the opening chapters are exciting, and throughout the book well written patches appear at regular intervals. But let's be clear: this is a book that one should read for fun, and maybe to see what triggered the popularity of the vampire archetype, but not to find any deep meanings or real parallels with modern life. It's an idiosyncratic, Victorian horror novel with many good moments, but it is definately not a vital part of a discerning person's personal library."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"i thought the book was pretty sweet all in all. i would and will read it agian this was the second time i've read it. i like the part when Mr. Hawkins cutts himself shaving and dracula allmost bites him it was cool."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"In a class I took, I was asked to read a gothic novel. So, I decided to pick what I thought was the locus classicus. The format of the novel was the first thing that struck me; it is a series of diary entries, letters, telegraphs and so on. The format leads to a somewhat disjointed narrative as different characters will enter for 20-30 pages and give their own personal narrative of the day's events.As a Christian, this novel and indeed many in the same genre (e.g. Frankenstein), are often depicted as terrible, evil, devilish/satanic books. However, I would agree with the Christian Research Journal, that this novel unlike newer reworkings of the vampire story (those by Anne Rice) is quite Christian. All the narration is from the perspective of the &quot;good guys&quot; and Count Dracula himself only makes rather rare appearances. Furthermore, there are *many* referneces to God's will, God's providence and the like. Lastly, the Un-Dead (the novel's way of describing vampires and Dracula himself) are terribly vulnerable to Christian symbols (e.g. Crosses, crucifixes, Sacred Wafers &lt;- the bread of Communion).Stoker's way of revealing details about vampires (who and what they are, their abilities, their history etc) are very slow and gradual. I found myself wanting to know more about the history of Count Dracula (he was a powerful nobleman, centuries ago in Turkey/Romania) and how the race of the Un-Dead started and functions. It would have been more interesting to see the Count more often and perhaps have him contribute his thoughts (he appears in the first few chapters, disappears for a 100 pages, reappears, and then disappears for 150 pages).However, this novel does not lend itself to a fast read, in my opinion. I committed to reading 25 pages per day and thus I came to the end of it. The conclusion was rather abrupt and left something to be desired. I have not seen the film adaptation (Directed by Francis Ford Coppola; produced 1992).I plan on reading and reviewing Mary Shelly's, &quot;Frankenstein,&quot; in late 2001.Please note that I read the Penguin Classics version (ISBN: 0-14-043381-3)."},{"Title":"Dracula (G.

And i would fully recommend it."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Bram Stoker had absolutely no idea just what sort of monster he was creating. I refer not to his title character, but to the book itself. It is highbrow enough that scholars and literary types feel the need to include it (if, perhaps, toward the bottom) on their lists of exemplary 19th-century popular literature, yet lowbrow enough to interest the common reader. This is not a slight to the &quot;common reader&quot;; I'm one, too, and I tire of dense, obnoxiously self-important prose. Stoker's goal was not to write &quot;important&quot; books. He knew exactly who his readers were - real people, not literary critics. That he managed to rise somewhat above even his own expectations with Dracula is a testament to his often latent skill. Stephen King has benefited from the seriousness with which some critics have taken Dracula, by often being taken more seriously than he perhaps deserves. King knows this, too; he has often described himself, tongue in cheek, as the McDonald's or General Motors of horror fiction. Stoker, while never as consistently successful as King, might have applied a similar description to himself.Dracula, though written at the end of the 19th century, seems a fairly modern book, at it moves swiftly and employs suspense techniques often associated with more recent books and films (i.e., the shifting point-of-view, &quot;cross-cutting&quot;, if you will, between different first-person narratives to build tension). It works exceedingly well, providing a model and formula followed by many successors - though often with less impressive results.The central villain - Count Dracula himself - is quite rightly absent from the stage a good deal of the time, so that he may grow in the imagination of the reader as his invisible presence permeates nearly every page. He is always just on the other of the window, door, or wall, or just across the street - his nefarious intentions influencing events as the book draws inexorably toward confrontation with the monster.Dracula's flaw is also, in a way, its virtue: there are no evil human characters. Almost everyone is quite heroic and selfless in a sort of two-dimensional way. It is not that the characters are underdeveloped (as many complain), but that they tend to be representative of human beings' more enviable qualities, and therefor seem less realistic to the modern reader. But, then, one has to realize that the entire book is composed of diaries, letters, and faux-news clippings. I get a sense of subtle humor, of the &quot;unreliable narrator&quot; sort, from some passages of Dracula, as characters make themselves out to be more chivalrous, loving, and trusting than, perhaps, they actually were during the &quot;real&quot; events they describe. For example, one can only infer Dr. Seward's actual response to Van Helsing's request for autopsy knives so he can decapitate his beloved Lucy's corpse and take out her heart before burial! Reading between the lines, Seward's description of the event in his diary becomes darkly funny as he struggles to maintain a sense of 19th-century British decorum while relating the scene. His description of Van Helsing's anguish gives us a clue: Seward seems to suspect his mentor may be going off the deep end, and his expressions of blind trust in the old man may be a way of placating him.Dracula's greatest virtue, though, is its well-oiled plot. It's an impressive machine that still functions marvelously more than a century after its making. It is a mean, sharp skeleton fleshed out with numerous horrific digressions (the episodes with Dracula's &quot;brides&quot;, the log of the Demeter, the &quot;bloofer lady&quot;, etc.) that serve as tiles in a mosaic gradually completing the rather lean narrative that develops from them. Compare it with, say, Peter Straub's rather bloated attempt at the same technique in Floating Dragon, a rather messy and unsatisfying novel with isolated moments of brilliance, and you start to realize what a taut, precise engine Stoker really fashioned.What keeps me from giving Dracula five stars is that it's necessarily limited by its own goals. Truly great popular novels somehow manage to tell exciting stories while also reaching more deeply than they pretend. They reverberate on levels well above (and below) their apparent target. While many have read exotic psychosexual interpretations into Dracula, I find it shallows out rather quickly once it has served up its scares and menace. Yes, there is a genuine (and intended) erotic subtext, but it fails to be profoundly illuminating, since it was never intended to be. It serves its disquieting purpose, and then departs, rather than lingering. That's how Stoker designed his effects, and they work perfectly. He set out to write a good four-star novel, and he did.A hundred years later, it's still good four-star novel, popular as ever, as well it deserves. Excellent work, and worth a place in your library."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"This seems like a much more complete edition than those I had read in earlier days.

Little did I know what a wonderful world of mystery and suspense that Bram Stoker opened up for me.The story is told mostly third party though the papers, diaries, and phonograph recordings (on wax cylinders) of those people involve in a tale so bizarre that it almost defies belief. The general story line is that of a Count that plans to move to a more urban setting (from Borgo Pass to London) where there is a richer diet. There he finds succulent women; something he can sing his teeth in. Unfortunately for him a gang of ruffians (including a real-estate agent, asylum director, Texas cowboy and an Old Dutch abnormal psychologist) is out to detour his nocturnal munching. They think they have Drac on the run but with a wing and a prayer he is always one step ahead.Of more value to the reader is the rich prose chosen by Stoker as he describes the morals and technology of the time. We have to come to grips with or decide if we can perform the rituals that are required to eliminate vampires verses the impropriety of opening graves and staking loved ones. The powers in the book differ from the movie versions in that they are more of persuasion and capabilities to manipulate the local weather. At one point the Dutch Dr. Van Helsing, is so overwhelmed by a beautiful vampire laying in the grave that he almost for gets why he is there and may become vamp chow.All in all the story is more in the cunning chase.

There were times when I thought, \\"Certainly the first edition didn't use language like this, it's far too modern!\\"That said, I quickly became involved in the edited version all the same. There are so very many versions of Dracula out there that you have to be willing to accept that you won't get the original every time you encounter it.

I guess I was accustomed to the Dracula we see represented in movies, but this book presented a different light of him. Positives include the great description of how Dracula &quot;influenced&quot; his victims. How people were affected by what was happening to their friends and family. I enjoyed reading how the Professor and the Doctor tried to analyze Dracula and all the incidents.Two things I thought were minor negatives: One is that it was written in a journal format - several characters wrote journal entries to present the story and it was exciting to read them. But how can you expect people, after they've been through harrowing experiences and seeing their loved ones harmed, write every darn detail of that day into a journal? Maybe they were all very sharp and had great memories, but I could not expect them to capture every minute detail. I think Stoker should have included bits of story from a narrative perspective or at least makes these entries a bit more realistic. Also, this story is very very dramatic - maybe too dramatic. Obviously when it involves people and their loved ones, it is expected. The language is beautiful and deeply personal - I just thought it was overdone in spots.But I recommend this to anyone who wants to read a suspenseful tale.

However, as one of those consumers now, I feel that through so many different iterations and versions of the myth, returning to the source is not entirely fruitful.Stoker's satanic superman is unstoppable, until the time that he is stopped. The foundations of the myth are here, but no fun is had. Stoker is a middling writer; while he was popular in his time only his Dracula passes down to us. The characters are flat and uneven. The pseudo-epistolary form has many weaknesses if you want to fall into the story. The party's events are based on contrived coincidences.

Stoker used journal entries and letters to create this story, and this works not only to move the story forward, but also is an interesting way to paint the different characters as they talk of their interactions with Dracula.

HOWEVER, it all comes together in the second half and the charcter of Mina Harker is so ahead of her time, it made it all worthwhile!

The fear of Count Dracula will become your own, trapped inside his castle with no escape from an apparently eternal creature, vulnerable to his every move, and knowing that you might have just unleashed his horror upon not just yourself, but the whole city of London!"},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Of the many possible angles from which to respond to the book, two stand out in particular for me.Firstly, the style of characterization is quite effective. Stoker uses a classical device of epic fantasy, which is to unite diverse characters in an epic quest of earthshaking importance (Tolkien would use it some years later when he created the Fellowship of the Ring charged with the responsibility of destroying the evil ring). These characters form a band that has a remarkable chemistry and complementarity, especially since the team is made up of some familiar stereotypes. For instance, the elderly Van Helsing is the prototype strong hero, whose knowledge, charisma and strength of character are the emotional and psychological anchor for the other characters (and the reader) throughout the ordeals of the book. He is the Count's most formidable enemy, and provides unspoken reassurance for a modern audience that science, knowledge, discipline and courage are effective antidotes against fears of the dark and the supernatural.Secondly, the gender relations and sexual themes of Stoker's book are an interesting avenue to explore, having attracted the diverse opinions and guesses of Stoker's literary critics. There are wild theories about Stoker's necrophilia or sexual dysfunctionality which come from overly imaginative readings of his text, but then there is no smoke without fire. There are a few striking features of his portrayal of men and women. The men are always gallant and chivalrous, to the point of unnatural stiffness, and the women almost always virtuous and almost Victorian. However, Dracula and his bloodsucking appetites appear to have a dangerously seductive aspect, and it seems that his female victims cannot resist him. It is particularly disturbing that, as the book nears its ending, one of his victims (Mina Harker, the virtuous wife of Jonathan Harker) seems to feel a strange and intimate emotional connection to the Count, one that transcends her moral judgment and the physical distance between vampire and victim. There is rich material for the Freudian literary critic here.All in all, Dracula is an intriguing story, a product of a dark and brooding imagination which nonetheless maintains a steadfast faith in the power of science, of human courage against adversity, of common love and friendship, of spiritual faith, of man's unremitting fight against the forces of evil. The moral and theological dualities peppered throughout the text grip the conscience as well as the imagination."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Stoker's &quot;Dracula&quot; is the book that served as the foundation of the vampire legend that has since spread through the whole of western society. Written as a series of letters and journal entries in a quaint Victorian style, Stoker's work is heavily reminiscent of other authors of that time period, including Doyle and Poe.The vampire mythology that has sprung up over the last century has has greatly revamped the powers and weaknesses of Stoker's monster, the core remains. The dreaded Count Dracula leaves his Romanian castle to come to London, to search for the fresh blood he desires to quench his insatiable lust. A group of Englishmen must uncover the nature of the beast in order to destroy it and protect their loves.While the book seems somewhat more lengthy and wordy than need be, and its vampire seems almost tame in comparison to modern versions, it still serves as a great reminder how this all began."},{"Title":"Dracula (G.

Count Dracula is introduced in the beginning of the story, as Jonathan Harker comes to realize the true horror of this man (or thing?).

Oh, what music they make.\\" These lines have been seared into our minds thanks to Bela Lugosi's legendary performance in the 1931 film version of the novel by Bram Stoker. If you've only seen the 1992 movie starring Gary Oldman, Winona Ryder, Anthony Hopkins, Keanu Reeves, Sadie Frost, Cary Elwes and Tom Waits as Renfield, you are in for a shock. I have not seen the movie yet, but I read the novel in preparation for the movie. I like Gary Oldman, Winona Ryder, Anthony Hopkins and Keanu Reeves, having seen them in other movies (aside from being impressed with Francis Ford Coppola's production of \\"Mary Shelley's Frankenstein,\\" directed by Kenneth Branagh; see my review on it) and so I know how good they are. Instead of viewing the other film versions of this great novel, which take many liberties with the text, I recommend this version, which is \\"In many ways faithful to the novel, although Gary Oldman's Count had now become a romantic hero.\\" Same goes for \\"Frankenstein\\" by Mary Shelley. View the 1994 movie starring, produced and directed by Kenneth Branagh, which also boasts a star-studded cast and great performances, particularly from Robert DeNiro as the Creature, Helena Bonham-Carter as Elizabeth and Tom Hulce as Henry Clerval. I swear to God, I kept trying to imagine Gary Oldman as Dracula while I was reading, but I kept getting Bela Lugosi's face instead. Anthony Hopkins, Winona Ryder, Keanu Reeves, Cary Elwes, Sadie Frost and the others, I could easily imagine in their respective roles. Rated PG for some violence."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"While I have not read this exact edition, I have read the unabridged edition by another publisher. Dracula is my favorite book of all time for a variety of reasons, for its originality in presenting vampires, Victorian England, romanticism, adventure, intrigue, and some truly chilling passages. Not to belabor the story, it concerns the struggle between Jonathan Harker and his companions against Dracula, who is out to destroy Harker and all he holds dear. Forget all the Hollywood schtick you've seen...THIS is the real Dracula. And for the reviewer who claimed Dracula in the book is more like Max Schreck's character in Nosferatu than any other movie, you're wrong. Dracula is described as a stately presence, certainly not the cheesy tux-wearing artistocrat of Bela Lugosi, but not the deformed creature in Nosferatu either (otherwise, why on earth would Harker have conducted business with him and stayed in his castle anyway?). Here Dracula is a tall, gaunt, pale figure with white hair and a thin mustache who charms Harker but conveys the sense of something not quite right. Anyway, enough of the story-points...pick this up and read it for yourself. The story is presented as a series of journal entries and manuscripts and is riveting from the beginning to the thrilling conclusion. In short, get this. A finer novel you'll never read."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Dracula is fun to read. It is intense for young children, but if a child is made to know it is just a \\"story\\" and not real, he should enjoy it with no harm done.It is not and does not pretend to be great literature. But it is easy to read."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Bram Stoker creates a personal feel between the novel and the reader by the use of journal entries. Everything read by the reader is from one of the characters personal point of view. This is interesting because of the fact that Lucy writes in her journal and is being visited by Dracula. It helps the reader because they are able to see two sides to the story: those being visited by Dracula and those witnessing the effects. The reader is also able to discover the feeling that the character undergoes while being visited by Dracula which draws the reader into the story further, since they can almost be there at that particular moment and realize what is going on and how it feels. This particular form point, however, has its draw backs. The novel jumps from one persons point of view and experiences to another in an instant which makes the read not so simple, but more focused. It seems as if the novel is switching everything in one sentence which can make the read tedious. On the other hand, the structure does make the novel more interesting in the essence that the reader is able to explore which character they sympathize with most and which character they would like to be while reading the novel. The reader can choose to focus on the investigator, the lover, the businessman who stayed in Dracula's castle, or the oblivious women who is visited by Dracula at night. The author did a wonderful job at piecing the entries together the way he did and by capturing the reader with his interesting choice of structure in his novel. Overall, the novel is better in its entirety due to this use of structure."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Ah, \\"Dracula\\". Is there a single book in the English language the more people know better? Well, actually, yes, because the truth of the matter is people who think they KNOW everything there is to know about the story probably have never read the book cover to cover. I realized this about half way in. So much our culture \\"knows\\" about vampires and Dracula having nothing to with the text of the book, but originate from Hollywood.There's not a whole lot of reason to go into the plot too heavily. The basics have been done more or less in the movies: English real estate agent goes to Transylvania to sell a house in England to a mysterious count, Dracula. Dracula is a vampire, intent on finding new blood abroad. What follows is a mostly terrifying (but occasionally slow and dull) battle between good and evil, modernity and superstition, and faith vs. magic.However, \\"Dracula\\" is nowhere near a perfect novel. Bram Stoker, much like his contemporaries, tended to overwrite. In some instances, this approach works, particularly in Jonathan Harker's experiences in Castle Dracula. Here, Stoker is able to convey to the reader (even those familiar with the story from the films) Harker's genuine confusion and horror as Dracula's behavior quickly shifts between cordial and terrifyingly violent. The encounter over the mirror which doesn't reflect Dracula's reflection, Harker's near attack by the count's bride (and the surprising erotic overtones), the feeding on infants, and Harker's discovery of Dracula in his coffin, blood on his lips, as he lays \\"like some filthy leech\\" are vividly drawn and thoroughly frightening.Other excellent moments include the log of the ship Dracula arrives on (pasted, inexplicably into Mina Harker's journal). The desperation of the captain as his crew is picked off by some monster is truly haunting.Also memorable is the character of Renfield, the lunatic who somehow Dracula reaches out to. His need to eat his way up the food chain is darkly humourous and grotesque.Sadly, not everything about the novel is this well done. Abraham Van Helsing is a Dutch character. Stoker wildly overwrote his speech patterns and accent. Consequently, he often seems to be more comedy relief than the wise leader of the band of hunters (definitely an improvement in the films). Likewise, Quincey Morris, a Texan, often flirts with stereotype, but Stoker is able to keep the character serious, if not terribly well developed (which is probably why Quincey has only appeared in one or two films, despite his pivotal role in Dracula's demise). The various group meetings to discuss a plan of action and exchange knowledge often take on the quality of a superficial prayer meeting.What amazed me was how much we take for granted about the Dracula-myth was NOT borne out by the novel. Dracula seems comfortable wandering out in the daylight without bursting into flame.Still, on the whole Stoker succeeds. The novel is a rewarding one, and, despite its age, actually offers some genuine chills. If it's not perfect (which it's not), it virtues greatly outshine its flaws."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"This story is an excellent read, much more enjoyable and entertaining for those of us with vivid imaginations than any movie I have ever seen. I would imagine that in this day, many of people know of or have probably heard the gist of the story, although I could be wrong. However, I won't go too much into detail and bore you with some deep review. In his quest to feed his hunger and quench his thirst, Dracula's attempt to make new residence in London, fresh abundant territory, is foiled by Drs. Van Helsing and Seward, Lord Godalming, Quincey Morris, and Jonathan and Mina Harker. Upon the realization of what Dracula is, the Un-Dead, Dr. Van Helsing along with the others set out to rid the world of this evil menace so no one else, such as their beloved Lucy, falls prey to Dracula's bite. Count Dracula makes a hasty flee from London with the intention of returning to his castle in Transylvania. So close to home, yet Dracula meets his demise by the hands of the five courageous ones who have been on the Count's trail. I read a lot of different books to exercise my brain cells, and I highly recommend, what is to me, this classic.

Hall (Large Print))","review":"The first, and the greatest, horror novel of all time. Bram Stoker has crafted a timeless masterpiece that will make your blood run cold. Set in the Victorian era, four noble young men, a mysterious monster hunter, and a brave and brilliant young woman join forces against the greatest evil the world has ever known - the king of the vampires, Count Dracula.This book has some of the most enduring characters of literature, including the crazed Dracula disciple Renfield. His scenes in the insane asylum and his dialouge are some of the best in the book. Stoker was also ahead of his time with the character of Mina Harker. Unlike the fainting, male-dependent lass of the time, Mina is iron-willed, resourceful, and highly intelligent. In many parts, she outshines the men in mental capacity, and matches them in physical capacity. For example, during the long journey back to Transylvania, she took turns along with the men driving the horses through the mountains. On that same trip, she is able to hike through the snowy mountains carrying provisions.Some parts of the book are dry and boring, that is to be expected; the book was written in 1897. But the slow parts set the time and tone for the tale. I don't recommend reading it at night. The creepiness seems to set in the dark, quiet air all around you, and you cannot escape."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Let us suppose that it is 3:00 AM and you just can't sleep. You decide to get up and turn on the television for a little while still thinking that you might get sleepy. Don't be at all surprised if you find Count Dracula lurking on a local station or a cable movie channel. Among fictional characters, the Count has probably appeared in more movies and mini-series than have any of his fictional counterparts. It is probably not even close.Before Bram Stoker wrote this novel in 1897 he did tons of research. After learning all that he could of the vampire legends he combined the stories and married them to a very real 15th century figure named Vlad Dracula and a horror legend was born. Without Stoker and his work the modern fiction reader might well have never known Stephen King and Anne Rice. Even today, despite all of the fiendish characters that have flashed before us, no other character holds the lasting allure of Stoker's Count.Stoker tells his story by using the journals and diaries of the Count's protagonists. Those, along with some letters and newspaper clippings tell the whole story and the Count is never directly heard from. Actually, outside the first few chapters, the Count makes very few actual appearances in this book. His presence hangs over the book from the first to the last, but he seldom shows up himself.The story begins with Jonathan Harker as he travels to Castle Dracula to meet with the Count about some property the Nobleman has just purchased in London. At first all seems normal to Harker but soon he begins to figure out the astonishing truth. From there Stoker builds his story from climax to climax as the narrative slowly builds to a conclusion. Along the way there is little rest for the reader for each new climax starts to build just as the preceding climax is attained. From Harker's initial attempt to escape Castle Dracula, to the streets of London and back to the very shadows of the castle, the story builds to the final showdown with Count Dracula.I first read this book over twenty-five years ago and decided that with Halloween almost upon us it was time to read it again. Over twenty-five years one tends to forget parts of a book, especially if during that time one has watched a lot of movies that are only loosely based on that book. After reading Stoker's masterpiece again I am reminded that as of yet no movie has followed the true story line all that faithfully. I am also reminded that in this, as in most cases, the book as far better than any film adaptation."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"In 1897, Bram Stoker's \\"Dracula\\" was published in Great Britain. It was one of many Gothic horror novels of the day and, although popular, wasn't considered to be meaningful or timeless in any way. Yet, over a century later, the book has never gone out of print. Its title character, Count Dracula, is the quintessential vampire of Western literature and has inspired more movies than any novel. \\"Dracula\\" is sufficiently multi-faceted that writers and directors of film have been able to adapt it for their constantly changing times and purposes. In 1922, F.W. Murnau found in \\"Dracula\\" his Freudian-expressionist masterpiece \\"Nosferatu\\". Nearly a decade later, Dracula was transformed into Bela Lugosi's suave predatory aristocrat in Tod Browning's 1931 film. In John Badham's 1979 film \\"Dracula\\", the predator is a liberator of sexually oppressed women. In Francis Ford Coppola's 1992 film, \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\", he is a romantic hero. There have been at least 10 major films based directly on Bram Stoker's novel, and about the same number of plays.\\"Dracula\\" is a literary masterpiece by virtue of its influence and perhaps its ideas, many of which are only half-formed in the novel itself. The prose is not masterful. Bram Stoker wrote \\"Dracula\\" as a series of diaries and correspondence which, taken together, tell a remarkable tale of an evil that invades the characters' lives and threatens to prey upon the citizenry of London. Jonathan Harker is a solicitor from Exeter who travels to Transylvania, in Romania, to present a mysterious Count named Dracula with the paperwork involved in his purchase of a home in London. While visiting the Count, Jonathan learns that his host is not quite human and very dangerous, but is left in such an agitated state that he is unsure what was real and what was a nightmare. Hoping to put the ordeal behind him, Jonathan marries his devoted fianc&eacute;e, Mina, as soon as possible and returns to England and normalcy. Meanwhile, a former pupil of Mina's in London, Lucy Westenra, has just accepted a marriage proposal herself. But a strange illness has overtaken Lucy. She inexplicably loses large amounts of blood, her countenance is gradually changing. It will take her aristocratic fianc&eacute;e Arthur, her former suitors, psychiatrist Dr. Seward and wealthy Texan Quincey Morris, as well as an esteemed scientist from Amsterdam, Dr. Van Helsing, to save her from an unnatural fate. Destroying the source of Lucy's transfiguration will take an even greater effort.The use of letters and diaries to tell this story recalls the great 18th century French novel \\"Dangerous Liaisons\\" by Choderlos de Laclos. But where de Laclos' novel is one of its century's finest examples of French prose, Bram Stoker's \\"Dracula\\" does not do the same for the English language. \\"Dracula\\" isn't very literate. Of course, it is essentially pulp fiction and had no need to be. \\"Dracula\\"s letters are unnaturally detailed, often recounting long conversations verbatim and in heavily accented English. Not only is that unrealistic, it is unnecessary. \\"Dracula\\" needed a good editor to correct numerous inconsistencies in the text and to eliminate a lot of extraneous material. The novel alternates between sections of tedium and suspense, but the middle section of the book, situated in London, is the most effective page-turner, and Jonathan's experiences in Transylvania are the best at creating suspense. The last third of the book is generally poor. Dracula, himself, is cunning and erudite when we first meet him but little more a primal monster by the end of the story. \\"Dracula\\" is a triumph of substance over style.That \\"Dracula\\", a novel that probably aspired only to entertain middle-class Victorians, is entertaining a century after it was written is a great credit to its author. \\"Dracula\\" is certainly not a polished book. But it continues to enthrall readers, writers and directors, and there is no reason to expect that it will stop. It pits good against evil. It has a fascinating villain. It's infused with psychosexual overtones. Technology and mysticism battle for supremacy, as do Eastern and Western mores. \\"Dracula\\" is food for thought and a lot of fun. And Bram Stoker's concept of the Vampire is so ingrained in popular culture that \\"Dracula\\", the novel that started it all, is essential reading.Some of the Different Editions:All of the editions of \\"Dracula\\" that I mention reproduce the First Edition, published in 1897 by Archbald Constable and Company, London. The first American edition was published in 1899 by Doubleday and McClure and included some minor, but not inconsequential, changes. I have never encountered a reproduction of that edition, however. The Signet Classic mass market paperback is pretty spare (ISBN 0451523377). It offers no notes on the text at all, but includes an introduction by Leonard Wolf, in which he discusses the history of Gothic horror, the context in which \\"Dracula\\" was written, and some of the films based on the novel. The Oxford World's Classics trade paperback (ISBN 0192833863) includes an excellent Introduction by Maud Ellmann, selected bibliography, short chronology of Bram Stoker's life, and endnotes. The endnotes are limited to explaining terms found in the text. The Introduction discusses \\"Dracula\\"'s themes and many interpretations, and explains why the novel's clumsy style is its strength. The Courage Classics by Running Press hardback edition (ISBN 1561385158) includes an essay by Leonard Wolf at the back of the book, which is excerpted from the introduction to his book \\"The Annotated Dracula\\" (later published as \\"The Essential Dracula\\"). Wolf's essay in the Signet edition is better. The Norton Critical Edition (ISBN 0393970124) of \\"Dracula\\" contains more supplementary material.

One reason I did not like it very much is because it was written in correspondences and journal entries. I have not found any book written in this fashion to my liking. The other reason I feel this book was not that great is because I watched the movie long before I read the book. I guess I was expecting something more in the book than I received.

I really enjoyed Jonathan Harker's journals at the beginning when he first visits Dracula's castle in the Transylvania. After that, the thrill drops a lot, as it becomes more narative.One thing I did not like was that two main characters were named Jonathan, and were hard to distinguish when individual journals referrenced only \\"Jonathan.\\""},{"Title":"Dracula (G.

Probably it would because it is so innovative otherwise. But the rating of such a novel goes beyond normal considerations. The plot does pick up nicely though and who can argue with ze count overall and his permeating influence in modern culture.

I also remember not being very fond of it and putting it down about a quarter of the way through. Flash forward a decade and I'm giving the book a second chance. I'm glad I did because I can approach it with more of an appreciation for its style of horror. This isn't horror with the dial turned up to 11 this is a slower paced tale about good and evil conscientiously making their moves against each other. It gives the story an air of believability and in its own right there's something chilling about that.Sure, the tale bookended with sections that are as harrowing and tense as any modern horror tale, but the meat of the book is in its slow pacing. A lot of people might be turned off by the fact that things happen slowly and Dracula doesn't spend much time in the limelight, it's both an advantage and disadvantage at times. Lucy's inevitable death is all the more tragic because it's so long and drawn out. While at other times I did find myself wishing the pace would pick up a little.If you don't mind the occasionally businessman narration Dracula is a horror tale that not only cemented vampires as a preeminent horror motif, but one that has aged incredibly well."},{"Title":"Dracula (G.

The beginning catches your mind but in the middle you think \\"this is boring\\" but at the end somewhat satisfied. I would say it is a classic but not in the same sense as Jane Austen or Charles Dickens.Most people want speed, excitement and gore in horror novels. You will not be that satisfied if you are looking for death and gore. It is more of a drama mystery but is slow in some parts. The speed is what gets annoying. In some parts its just a bunch of nonsense and long winded. It takes somewhat patience and devotion to complete the book.I would not classify it as a true horror. Frankenstein is more of a horror and this doesn't have too much death but more of a tale. Also it is not a straight clear story it comprises of journal and diary entries. That is what makes it more of a drama because of the various perspectives.If you get this book beware you must have some patience to keep pushing yourself to complete the book. But if you complete it you will be somewhat satisfied on how the whole vampire folklore came about."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"This was a definate page turner.

Hall (Large Print))","review":"Dracula is told through the diaries, journals and letters of the main characters, as well as newspaper clippings and articles.Two things struck me about this book:1. the way that male and female roles are highlighted through Mina's relationship with the men and the part that she plays in chasing Dracula.2. The way that this story is so frightening. I didn't expect it to be all that scary but it is. The following is an extract that I found particularly disturbing (the extract does not contain spoilers):but my very feelings changed to repulsion and terror when I saw the whole man slowly emerge from the window and begin to crawl down the castle wall over that dreadful abyss, face down, with his cloak spreading out around him like great wings. At first I could not believe my eyes. I thought it was some trick of the moonlight, some weird effect of shadow; but I kept looking, and it could be no delusion. I saw the fingers and toes grasp the corners of the stones worn clear of the mortar by the stress of years, and by thus using every projection and inequity move downwards with considerable speed, just as a lizard moves along a hall.Bram Stoker begins Dracula as Jonathan Harker spends a few horrific days in his Castle Dracula. What follows is a true fight between good and evil."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"I was looking for something different to read. I read Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, then a collection of short stories on Van Helsing. Then I realized I never read the original Dracula. I was leary at first, since the book is well over 100 years old and thought the language might be difficult to get through. (Remember our college english days?)First off - make sure you get Bram Stoker's original - there are reprints out there that editors have essentially reworked. This book is so well written that the reader doesn't get hung up on Stoker's verbage.This was an excellent story and you can see why it's a classic. Stoker's book is written in journal form - so you get the perspecitve of all the characters in the book.I recommend this book to anyone who likes a good read, classic fiction, or has seen the many movies!"},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Due to various stories and movie versions of the Dracula myth, so many people are familiar with the story but have not actually read the tale that began it all. Bram Stoker's \\"Dracula\\" is a masterpiece of not only classic literature, but of gothic and horror novels as well. Over a century after it was written, a reading of \\"Dracula\\" can still produce chills down the spine and make the reader anxious to read it alone at night.Told entirely through diary entries and letters, \\"Dracula\\" shifts narrators numerous times; the key players are Jonathan Harker, his wife Mina, Dr. Seward, and Dr. Abraham Van Helsing. These four are drawn together through the unlikeliest and most unbelieveable of circumstances. Jonathan Harker begins the tale with his sojourn in Translyvania where he meets the enigmatic Count Dracula and arranges his affairs so that the Count can move to England. Yet it isn't long before Jonathan starts to notice strange things about the Count; he never sees him eat, he is only around during the night, he has no reflection. Jonathan worries that he is mad and risks everything to escape the Count's clutches; meanwhile, back in England, Mina's best friend Lucy meets her end at the hands of Dracula. Drs. Seward and Van Helsing are called in to treat her and make the unbelievable discovery that her death was the work of a vampire and that they now must do everything in their power to stop Dracula at all costs, before he takes another life of one dear to them.As the narrative shifts back and forth between these key players, all the elements of the mystery are present to the reader before they are to the characters. When they finally piece together the puzzle, they resolve to hunt the vampire on his own ground and destroy him before he can create more like him, including Mina Harker. Bram Stoker's \\"Dracula\\" is chillingly descriptive with an abundance of history surrounding vampire lore and ways to defeat the Un-dead. It is a mix of several different storylines that all tie into one. After such a momentous buildup, the novel's (and Count Dracula's) end seems a little rushed, but it completes the circle. Even though today's readers may be far more used to the blood and gore of horror stories than those in Stoker's time, \\"Dracula\\" in script is just as scary as Dracula in cinematic form; especially the descriptions of Jonathan Harker's experiences at Castle Dracula. \\"Dracula\\" sets the standard in the history of vampire myth and legend, a model often imitated but never surpassed."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Dracula is a book anchored in the Christian tradition.It portraits the battle between good and evil, black and white, sexual lust and love, between the Christians and the heathen.Dracula is the devil in disguise, the personification of evil in nature, the enemy of the Christian God, 'who commanded nations and intrigued for them and fought for them.'The book is an attack against rationality ('the unexpected always happens'), as the basic Christian dogmas are also not rational.However, its Christian precepts are to be taken 'cum grano salis': 'And to superstition must we trust, it was man's faith in the early, and it has its roots in faith still.'More, the end justifies the means: 'Thank God! This is the country where bribery can do anything ... Judge Moneybag will settle this case.'Finally, 'euthanasia ia an excellent and comforting word.'As critic Davis Rogers pointed out: 'Dracula is reactionary ... the group of manly men (who destroy Dracula) represent the restorative powers of traditional patriarchal rule.'But the book contains such classical scenes as 'the beautiful colour became livid, the eyes seemed to throw out sparks of hellfire, the brows were wrinkled as though the folds of the flesh were the coils of Medusa's snakes, and the lovely, bloodstained mouth grew to an open square, as in the passion masks of the Greek and Japanese.'All in all, 'even the sceptic who can see nothing but a travesty of bitter truth in anything holy or emotional, shall be melted to the heart.'Highly recommended, not only for horror fans.I also recommend highly Gustav Meyrink's, more rational, masterpiece 'The Golem'."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Everyone knows that Dracula sucks peoples' blood, lacks a reflection and has the strength of twenty men. The fact that he is unable to stand garlic, holy symbols and sunlight is also common knowledge to us all. When I read Bram Stoker's masterpiece, however, it wasn't this mythical being that captured my keenest interest but rather the character of Dr. Abraham Van Helsing. In the novel he assumes the role of the wise man, the fearless leader, the moral supporter and the scientific genius. His knowledge and genius are most notable, and his ability to combine science with superstition into the science of fighting vampires, makes him an effective sci-fi character. Van Helsing is recognized as one of the most advanced scientists of his day and is considered a world expert on obscure diseases. He is also a renowned philosopher and metaphysician. It is Van Helsing's unsurpassed knowledge of hard science and his interest in experimental science, as well as his skillful combination of the two, that allows for Dracula to be fought and ultimately defeated. Thus, rather than reading the text according to its title character, which would entail merely a fantasy world of vampires and maidens in distress, I propose that by reading Dracula with a focused eye on Van Helsing, the novel becomes firmly grounded in the genre of sci-fi."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Bram Stroker is most famous for Dracula but very few recognize the fact he appeared to be like the Stephen King of the late 19th century/1900's Edwardian pre-WWI Era. Other works attest to his fascination with the lurid and grotesque elements of Gothic \\"shock\\" horror and adventure - The Mummy appeared in his classic Jewel of the Seven Stars, Lair of the White Worm was about a predator insect woman, etc. In his time, it was likely this type of literature was classified as pulp fiction but its popularity and fame has endured for years. Many stage plays and film versions were made throughout the 20th century. Dracula is written in the style of an epistolary novel in which most of the story is told through series of letters by different characters. Jonathan Harker, a business agent from London, visits Transylvania, a region in Eastern Europe where he meets Count Dracula to discuss his transition to London. But Harker becomes Dracula's prisoner and becomes his victim. He is unable to tell his fiance Mina that Dracula is a centuries-old vampire who poses a threat to the people of London. Dracula and Harker, now a damaged man who eats insects, come to London. Dracula sets his eyes (or fangs) on the beautiful Lucy and other women. In this novel, Dracula is nothing more than a bloodthirsty monster in the guise of a Victorian Count. It is up to the God-fearing and valiant Van Helsing to destroy Dracula by stabbing him with a stake through his heart while he sleeps in his daytime coffin. This story has been told and re-told so often that modern vampire fiction authors find fresh new ways of telling it. In modern vampire literature, vampires have changed so dramatically one cannot recognize them as easily anymore.But critical study of the novel reveals more. Like other reviews state, this novel has sexual overtones, though not expressed explicitly or overtly. In Victorian England, decent upper-class, mainly Protestant folk who were fastidious about morals and etiquettes were sexually repressed. When their sexual drive surfaced, it often erupted in bizarre manners. For instance, Jack the Ripper was around at this time and committing horrendous acts against prostitutes. These murders were no doubt also sexual fantasies that entailed violence. Dracula ONLY bites women to make them into his slaves (this connotes male domination of women). Dracula only bites virgins of pure, uncontaminated blood who sleep in their white nightgowns. His black-clad figure is predatory next to their white innocence, a kind of suppressed Victorian male fantasy of deflowering virginal young girls. Blood can also be a sexual allusion since the act of sex includes the loss of blood (like breaking the hymen for a virgin). Religion, too, is a part of this story. It seems to be a story of paganism versus Christianity/Catholicism. Dracula is afraid of the True Cross and of daylight, typically considered Christian imagery. The act of vampirism is itself a blasphemous twist to Christianity which has at its core the Ressurection- in which Jesus rises from his grave or coffin much like a vampire. Jesus said: eat of my flesh and drink my blood. The vampires thrive in feeding each other blood. All this is a dark twist on Communion. All this is merely literary venting of frustration. It has also been suggested that Bram Stroker was a homosexual, which was a huge sin in his day and only practiced \\"underground\\". So Dracula is more than just a story about the world's most famous vampire, it is full of sexual symbolism and religious iconography. It is therefore very literary."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"I have watched several versions of Dracula but reading this book is the first time for me. Well, it has no close similarities with any movies I've seen except, of course, Bram Stoker's Count Dracula which has Hollywood spices in it. Compared to the movie, I felt the book's sense of the sensualities and Dracula's motivation in choosing his targets were less fluid and sometimes too coincidental. But I enjoyed the original hunting process more than the movie one, with treasured views from each man involved, not just Van Helsing's. My edition has the afterword which really helped to understand how the writing came to be like that but aside from all values it tried to represent, this is a referenced literature work everybody must not missed."},{"Title":"Dracula (G.

It is not a narrative like most novels. Instead, it is written almost as a documentary. Through the telling we read the notes of Van Helsing, Harker's diary, and letters written between Min and Lucy. These gives readers a perspective into each of the character's and their opinions on the situation and Dracula. Rarely do authors tell a story in this manner and Stoker is such a genius at it that the story is seamless. To tell it in the traditional sense would not have the same impact.You know the character...now read his story."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

Bram Stoker's descriptive writing is incredible, however, at times when dipping in during an entry by a character, it was nigh on impossible to decipher which character you were reading from because of a lack of differing registers amongst the characters.All in all, it was enjoyable, but I would advise caution to readers that are easily lost and would have trouble with the older style of language used."},{"Title":"Dracula (G.

At points in the book as your reading its very interesting and holds your attention, then next you know it goes into a lot of rambling that totally brings the interest point to 0. I found myself skipping pages especially towards the end. The ending leaves you saying \\"is that it\\"!"},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"This is the book that started it all - the one that spawned a thousand vampire stories, from sublime (Nosferatu) to... the not-so-sublime (Twilight). But does the \\"original\\" (not really, there were other vampire stories written before this one) hold up after more than a hundred years?Well, yes and no. As a plethora of other reviewers have stated, the opening part of the book, detailing Jonathan Harker's journey to and stay at Castle Dracula is classic: filled with foreboding, dread and a genuinely creepy atmosphere. The rest of the book, while not as good, is still readable and the ending gets the job done. The biggest problem (if one can call it that) with this book is that it is very *Victorian* and very grounded in its time. Now, I know what you are thinking right now: \\"Duh, dipwad! It was written in the Victorian Era, that's why it's 'Victorian!'\\" Yes, but this is really, *really* Victorian. This book is so dripping with Victorian mores and attitudes that Queen Victoria herself, had she read this, would probably have wired a telegram to author Bram Stoker asking him if he could throttle it back a notch. The book is racist, a given considering the era - Count Dracula is an EEEEEEEEVILL foreigner that comes to England to corrupt good English womenfolk. Makes you wonder how paranoid the British were about foreign men coming to the UK and sexually conquering their women. Answer: apparently, very. But that's alright, because the evil Romanian Count gets a stake in the heart at the end for his troubles (I hope I didn't spoil the ending for all two you left unspoiled). The other main Victorian hang-up this book has is its portrayal of those English womenfolk: they are sweet, completely innocent virgins whom *everybody* loves... right up until they meet, well you know. Then they become evil, undead, bloodsucking SLUTS! And on a related note, while reading this book you will get sick to death of every male character proclaiming his undying (yet chaste!) love for the main female protagonist Mina Harker (and her friend Lucy before her until, well, she becomes an enslaved vampire concubine). You will become so inundated with syrupy praise for the woman that you will want to go out to the drug store after reading this to get a blood meter to test for diabetes.Understand that I am not opposed to reading something written in another era... if I were I would be severely limiting myself. However, many works of fiction (and nonfiction as well) transcend their age, even when they impart the attitudes and views of that age (some of which can be seen today as... unenlightened). My problem is that \\"Dracula\\" is so saturated in its age that it is difficult to see anything else. It also doesn't help that it is rather shallow. There is absolutely nothing deep here, unless one wants to count the whole science vs. supernatural thing. None of the characters really *learn* anything or change - \\"Dracula\\" isn't very effective dramatically. Again, I don't need heavy drama all the time, but even a light, fun read can transcend itself if the author can work some small dramatic development in there somewhere.In conclusion, you should read this... once. It does have some genuinely frightening and creepy parts that will impress you but its ultra-Victorianess plus the shallow, sappy treatment of its characters will mean that rereads, if any will be limited. This is not great literature. This is not even great Victorian literature. This is not even great fantastic or horrific Victorian literature. If you want that, if you want great Romantic literature with a touch of horror that's deep, has a philosophical core and a *truly* emotionally stirring story, get \\"Frankenstein\\" by Mary Shelley. \\"Dracula\\" is an occasionally well written popular Victorian horror novel - which while of interest to those studying the era in history and literature, and those interested in the history of horror - is of little value to those looking for a good read today."},{"Title":"Dracula (G.

Unless you are a glutton for this type of work or a die hard vampire-phile, give it a pass."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"After all these years of my morbid fascination with vampires, shame on me for never having read this classic. What an extraordinary tale of horror. Vampires are to be feared, not admired as they are nowadays. It wasn't as grim or as raunchy as I expected it to be. Hollywood's movie version slandered it with explicit nudity and abhorrent bestiality. From the first few chapters Bram Stoker expertly sets an eerie impression. The introduction to Count Dracula's castle was the spark of it all. Dracula's greeting \\"Welcome to my house! Enter freely and of your own free will!\\" was utterly creepy. Another such comment he made about the wolves howling in the distance \\"Listen to them--the children of the night. What music they make.\\" Little details like his home being next to a lunatic asylum made it all the more rich with intrigue. The defining scene for me was Jonathan witnessing the Count's descent from his bedroom; \\"I saw the whole man slowly emerge from the window and begin to crawl down the castle wall over the dreadful abyss, face down with his cloak spreading out around him like great wings.\\" The imagery is so vivid. That scene was chilling. I am amazed at Stoker's imagination having created such a unique formidable villain that has stood the test of time. The original vampire in all his glory. It was interesting finding out Dracula's supernatural gifts: the strength of ten men, necromancy, directing the elements such as a storm, fog, and thunder, having command over rats, owls, bats, moths, foxes, and wolves, and finally the ability to transform into a wolf, a bat, or mist. Impressive.On a tangent, I wondered if the phrase \\"if looks could kill\\" originated from this novel? I loved the contrast of Lucy's transformation from sweet innocence to voluptuous wantonness with hellfire in her eyes. It was somewhat laborious reading at times due to the language of the Victorian era, however, the absorbing storyline quickly overshadowed that. Overall it was not outright terrifying; rather it was a subtle unnerving of sorts. I enjoyed Van Helsing and his abrupt nature and the mystery of Count Dracula. The cat and mouse chase between the two characters was like a chess match between two equally intelligent opponents. The build-up during the hunting of Dracula was incredibly suspenseful followed by an ending that sadly was swift and anti-climactic, yet it still thrilled me."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

It only took about four attempts. On each of my previous attempts, I never made it past Chapter Four. However, if I am going to claim vampires as my favorite monsters, I have to have read the book that started the phenomenon, right? I started this read-through determined to finish even if it killed me. I must admit that there were a few close calls along the way.Overall, Dracula is a decent read. Of course, the fact that it was originally published 115 years ago means that the writing style is completely different from modern works. Description is important to any book, but I run into problems with books that are overly descriptive - as Dracula is in places. Mina's description of her time in Whidby in Chapter Four is almost physically painful for me.The characters are well-developed which means that you come to care what happens to them. However, the dialect used for Doctor Van Helsing makes his passages extremely difficult to read, particularly when he gets long-winded. \\"The Count's child-thought see nothing; therefore he speak so free. Your man-thought see nothing, till just now. No! But there comes another word from some one who speak without thought because she, too, know not what it mean - what it might mean.\\" Really?However, reading the book that launched the vampire phenomenon left me with more questions than answers. How did Jonathan Harker actually escape Castle Dracula? Why is it common vampire mythos that they cannot go out in the daylight? Dracula went out in the day whenever he wanted to. True, his full powers were only manifest at night, but he most definitely did NOT burst into flames in the sunlight. Also, why did crosses and communion wafers keep Dracula from entering an area, yet his coffins were kept in holy ground? What marked the demarcation between the amount of holiness that he apparently required and that which he could not tolerate? Inquiring minds want to know. At least mine does."},{"Title":"Dracula (G.

Hall (Large Print))","review":"The definitive gothic novel, Dracula holds it's place not just as one of the key standards for gothic literature, but also as the chief progenitor of vampire lore as a whole. It may have been present before, but here Bram Stoker set the norm for what we expect from the realm of vampires.The text consists of a number of letters and journals arranged chronologically to form a narrative of events. The story begins with the arrival of Jonathan Hawker to the castle of the count, where he quickly begins to notice that things are not quite as they should be and the count is much more than just an eccentric client. It is the unraveling of this mystery around which the tale is based, taking the reader from the dark foreboding halls of the Transylvanian castle to the shores of England and back again.I'm somewhat hesitant to distinguish a central protagonist in this novel. The only centralizing figure in the book is Dracula himself, though Jonathan Hawker (despite being absent from a solid third of the text) probably stands as the primary protagonist (a spotlight he shares in the latter half of the book with Van Helsing and John Seward). Even as centralizing antagonist Dracula himself becomes almost a backdrop as the focus of the novel shifts from Hawker in Transylvania to Van Helsing, Lisa and Seward in England. Once gone from his homeland he becomes the darkness in the background, a catalyst for the progression of the plot who enjoys very little screentime.I believe it's safe to say that without this book we might not have the trends in literature which have recently arisen (or re-arisen), fiction's current fascination with the gothic undead. Apart from that the book is an enjoyable read, though it's not without its faults (which are discussed below).Memorable Quotes:-\\"\`I had heard that madmen have unnatural strength. And as I knew I was a madman, at times anyhow, I resolved to use my power.'\\"-\\"I suppose it is thus that in old times one vampire meant many. Just as their hideous bodies could only rest in sacred earth, so the holiest love was the recruiting sergeant for their ghastly ranks.\\"-\\"Ah, it is the fault of our science that it wants to explain all, and if it explain not, then it says there is nothing to explain. But yet we see around us every day the growth of new beliefs, which think themselves new, and which are yet but the old, which pretend to be young, like the fine ladies at the opera.\\"Specific CriticismsMy main criticism of this story is that it seems at various times throughout the text there is instilled what I call forced ignorance. This is that thing which occurs either when a character arbitrarily withholds valuable information from another, or a character simply fails to notice things which should be manifestly plain to them.More reviews at ellipsisomnibus.wordpress.com"},{"Title":"Dracula (G.

Hall (Large Print))","review":"\\"Dracula\\" was not the first vampire novel, nor was it Bram Stoker's first book.But after years of research, Stoker managed to craft the ultimate vampire novel, which has spawned countless movies, spinoffs, and books that follow the blueprint of the Transylvanian count. Eerie, horrifying and genuinely mysterious, \\"Dracula\\" is undoubtedly the most striking and unique vampire novel yet penned.Real estate agent Jonathan Harker arrives in Transylvania, to arrange a London house sale to Count Dracula. But as the days go by, Harker witnesses increasingly horrific events, leading him to believe that Dracula is not actually human. His fiancee Mina arrives in Transylvania, and finds that he has been feverish. Meanwhile the count has vanished -- along with countless boxes filled with dirt.And soon afterwards, strange things happen: a ship piloted by a dead man crashes on the shore, after a mysterious thing killed the crew. A lunatic talks about \\"Him\\" coming. And Mina's pal Lucy dies of mysterious blood loss, only to come back as an undead seductress. Dracula has arrived in England -- then the center of the Western world -- and intends to make it his own...\\"Dracula\\" is the grandaddy of Lestat and other elegantly alluring bloodsuckers, but that isn't the sole reason why this novel is a classic. It's also incredibly atmospheric, and very well-written. Not only is it very freaky, in an ornate Victorian style, but it is also full of restrained, quiet horror and creepy eroticism. What's more, it's shaped the portrayal of vampires in movies and books, even to this day.Despite already knowing what's going on for the first half of the book, it's actually kind of creepy to see these people whose lives are being disrupted by Dracula, but don't know about vampires. It's a bit tempting to yell \\"It's a vampire, you idiots!\\" every now and then, but you can't really blame them. Then the second half kicks in, with accented professor Van Helsing taking our heroes on a quest to save Mina from Dracula.And along the way, while our heroes try to figure stuff out, Stoker spins up all these creepy hints of Dracula's arrival. Though he wrote in the late 19th-century manner, very verbose and a bit stuffy, his skill shines through. The book is crammed with intense, evocative language, with moments like Dracula creeping down a wall, or the dead captain found tied to the wheel. Once read, they stick in your mind throughout the book.It's also a credit to Stoker that he keeps his characters from seeming like idiots or freaks, which they could have easily seemed like. Instead, he puts little moments of humanity in them, like Van Helsing admitting that his wife is in an asylum. Even the letters and diaries are written in different styles; for example, Seward's is restrained and analytical, while Mina's is exuberant and bright.Even Dracula himself is an overpowering presence despite his small amount of actual screen time, and not just as a vampire -- Stoker presents him as passionate, intense, malignant, and probably the smartest person in the entire book. If Van Helsing hadn't thwarted him, he probably would have taken over the world -- not the Victorian audience's ideal ending.Intelligent, frightening and very well-written, \\"Dracula\\" is the well-deserved godfather of all modern vampire books and movies -- and its unique villain still dwarfs the more recent undead."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"A student with a query about Dracula's Jonathan Harker came away unsatisfied a while back. It was not on my 'already read' or 'to read' list (in spite of trying to read widely, this sort of gothic horror thing generally falls firmly outside my genre). To please her I began reading, and soon connected with the narrative. The story is well known to all, a Transylvanian vampire/count comes to London for a supply of fresh female blood. Only with complete unity does a strange band of people, unified by their will to kill the vampire and their love for previous victim 'poor Lucy', manage to hunt down and destroy the enemy in the end.The multiple viewpoint was interestingly used, and the idea that the various entries and articles were gathered together as compiled by Mina Harker, was convincing, but for me: it prevented me from becoming sufficiently engaged with any one of the characters to really 'care' enough whether they defeated Dracula. Although the story engaged, the individual characters seemd slightly removed from the reader. The plot was a bit too obvious too, there was nothing to work out or puzzle over, but that may not all be necessarily Stoker's fault, but rather the fact that Dracula is such a well-known and established concept.It was enjoyable to read, but probably about 100 pages too long. The story would have worked just as well and been equally developed and engaging, if some of the irrelevant detail were omitted. Paradoxially, the climax at the end seemed rushed and not at all developed, I was left with a sense of 'was that it?'. The final action was brief, which was all the more obvious after the lengthy build-up that had been given.Yet overall, enjoyable, a classic, not least to be commended for the way it has stood the test of time, for the way it has used such ancient myth, and for the way it has inspired all kinds of media since."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"I realized after reading many different vampire novels, that I needed to regain the roots of it all. I understand now why they call this book a classic. This book is very \\"classic\\" in a sense of a thriller. Although all vampires portray scary beings; this brought it back to the very lurid and petrifying place it really needs to be. Dracula showed me where vampires get their raw sense of terror, but also where vampires get their passion. I feel that in some cases, vampires are more or less without feeling, when really they have accrued more emotion with time, than any human can really comprehend. I was a bit disappointed with the conclusion; I guess maybe I am so used to endings with a bang, but it really illustrates how this may have been based off of veritable events with an added touch of imagination. I believe that this is what frightens us most of all and what makes it such an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Having not read Dracula in years, I decided to read it again and compare it to a contemporary (1992) movie version...Coppola's \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\" starring Gary Oldman. When I initially read the story as a child, I focused more on my stereotyped \\"Dracula as performed by Bella Lugosi\\" and not Stoker's original version. Reading it again I was charmed by the writing style and mores of the times. It holds up well. I then watched Coppola's movie which was tarted up and sexualized for today's audience. While Oldman's performance was great fun to watch, the book is so much better. And if I were Stoker, I would be turning in my grave since the movie version barely follows the book and yet is \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\"."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"I'm not a huge fan of the horror genre or gothic fiction; but, as one of the most famous novels ever written, I thought I would give 'Dracula' a shot. It's reputation as a classic and the inspiration for numerous films sparked my interest; yet Stoker's work is for the most part dull, slow-moving, and (the worst sin of all for a horror novel) NOT SCARY. While it probably won't give you chills or keep you awake at night, Stoker's novel can still be appreciated as an exploration of the subconscious fears which plagued upper-class Victorian society - notably, fears about female sexuality and foreign influence. To a turn-of-the-century audience Dracula was no doubt frightening as a literal vampire, but also as a foreign invader who was bent on corrupting the \\"purity\\" of the English people through the intermingling of blood.As a novel for pure entertainment, the opening chapters are quite interesting as we follow Jonathan Harker's experience in Transylvannia and are introduced to the sinister Count himself, yet as the story shifts to England the novel quickly runs out of steam. Encounters with the undead in this novel are strickingly few, and Stoker's uninteresting male characters - who can only be told apart by their names - spend much of their time either waiting for each other or fawning over Mina and Lucy. As the story progresses, the covertly sexualized relationships which develop between Mina, Lucy and Dracula become the novel's saving grace. Dracula's hold on them is painted as something sinister, impure, and decidedly sensual, while the gallant chaps striving to \\"rescue\\" them worship them as beings of saintliness, chastity and purity (which is what any good upper-crust Victorian woman was supposed to be). Are the male characters really afraid that these women will become vampires or that they will loose their \\"rightful\\" patriarchal control over them to a more seductive foreigner?I know many will disagree with me, but as entertainment 'Dracula' is a highly over-rated work - worth reading only for it's historical significance rather than a classic in the suspense or horror genre."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Many may find it strange to describe a rather disturbing, scary book as \\"beautiful\\", but that's how it is. There are some things about it that are tedius, like the fact that there's a part where it just drags on and on, but it doesn't last that long, and suddenly, you just want to keep reading again. While yes, Bram Stoker is a bit too fond of drama, he describes everything very well in a creepy and intruiging manner.Dracula is the perfect vampire. All modern vampire stories have young, beautiful vampires. Dracula is not exactly young, but he can get younger. He has his ladies, and he hungers for the beautiful and for the intelligent. It's slightly seductive, in a way, and amazing.Just a suggestion. Not to be read before bed. Any other time, proceed, and with delight"},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Bram Stoker's novel created the legend of Dracula, which has seeped into our culture. That, of course, takes some of the suspense out of reading this novel. I doubt that the modern reader would find \\"Dracula\\" to be the suspenseful horror book it was to its Victorian readers. However, for someone who wants to know all there is about Dracula, this book is still worth your time.One cannot make any complaints about Stoker's style, as he uses vivid imagery and illustrious descriptions to give a gloomy, Gothic feel for his novel. Even London is cast in a mysterious, eerie shadow, as most of the action occurs in modern-day (1890s) England and not in Transylvania. It is Stoker's artful play with words that brings to life this legend ever so vividly. Also, his technique of using journals and letters from the various characters allows the reader to assume an omnipotent role as the perspectives of the different characters are presented to the readers, providing a more interesting and slightly challenging style to read.Stoker's \\"Dracula\\" is a complex figure. He is not just a fiend who will attack and suck any man's blood at will. Indeed, Dracula has a far more disturbing and foreboding goal - to corrupt the virtuous women of society and turn them into voluptuous, promiscuous she-devils. For if he can control the girls, then he can control the men who love them. This idea of corrupting the virtuous and pure women of society is a recurring theme. Indeed, for the Victorian audience, this would have been a shockingly wicked idea.My main complaint about the novel is the melodramatic depiction of women as fragile and weak creatures who must be shielded from all things unpleasant, as this point is driven home relentlessly. It's not that I necessarily object to this portrayal of women in this context, but the melodramatic tripe that is incessantly uttered becomes nauseating. Now when I read a book I always take into consideration the era and the context of the novel. But even for a Victorian novel, I believe this portrayal is over the top. The women in \\"Dracula\\" are self-abasing, helpless creatures and rather two-dimensional. For example, Lucy and her mother are kept ignorant of the other's fate, for fear that if they should know the truth, the mere shock of it shall cause instant death. I do, however, understand that in portraying the women as innocent and pure, they represent the antithesis of the evil, voluptuous vampires they are in battle against.Although this novel may be a bit of a disappointment to those with high expectations, this novel is still worthy of a read to Dracula or classic horror fans."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Bram Stoker's Dracula was quite the roadtrip. The plot is very complicated, beginning from the perspective of Jonathan Harker, a young British estate agent, who travels to Transylvania to meet with the mysterious Count Dracula who is looking to buy a house in England. He is warmly received, but after a while things prove to be more deceiving than they appear. Jonathan soon finds out that he is essentially a prisoner in the castle and as he investigates, he discovers the Count has supernatural powers and wicked intentions. In fearing for his life, Harker tries to escape the castle by climbing down its walls.In the meantime, the attention shifts to Mina Murray in Whitby, England, Jonathan's fianc&eacute;e, who is corresponding with her best friend Lucy Westenra. A strange series of events unfolds in England: a Russian ship is found wrecked near the British town with its captain dead and crew missing, strange puncture marks are found on Lucy's neck after a sleepwalking incident, and a lunatic asylum patient raves about the impending arrival of his master.When Lucy Westenra falls deathly ill, and the only thing that is temporarily reviving her is daily blood transfusions, a search ensues by a group of men working collectively to save Lucy. Inadvertently, the objective shifts to slaying the reigning King of the Vampires, as Count Dracula becomes the embodiment of all evil.Bram Stoker's storytelling is truly ingenious. He uses journals, letters, and newspaper articles to narrate the story from alternating perspectives. At first I did not like this technique, because just as I was getting comfortable with (and quite fond of) Jonathan Harker's narration, the point of view shifted to his fianc&eacute;e's diary entries - an unexpected move that is initially hard to adjust to. However, this unique method of narration helps the reader more fully comprehend the close, interconnected relationship between the characters. It becomes clearer how each character contributes to the story and the hunt for Dracula. It also provides for interesting insight of characters' inner thoughts, something that is extremely limited in typical first-person or third-person narration.Bram Stoker is particularly clever in the way he chooses to allow the plot to develop. He builds tension by drawing out developments in the story and prolonging the climaxes of the plot as long as possible. For example, in one instance, Stoker ends the chapter in media res - literally, leaving his character in jeopardy! His highly descriptive writing style adds to this, and somehow, he manages to maintain the suspense despite the lengthiness of the novel.The ornament in Stoker's work is his rich language. His writing style is dated in the sense that it is of high diction and clearly an example of Victorian writing. On one front, his excesses of rhetoric contribute to the Gothic mood of the piece, yet in a suspense novel of its kind, the continuous formal language does bog down the novel. Also, it complicates the story for a modern reader because of its sophistication and lack of language reprieves.Though the subject matter may be grim and dark, the author does not fill the book with gruesome details of the sinister rituals the legendary vampires may engage in, and rather focuses on the social and more domestic issues of Count Dracula. The general suspenseful mood of the book serves to attract a wider audience, rather than aim to terrify. Overall, Stoker's writing talent does visibly shine in this infamous novel that introduces one of the most renowned fantastical creature in mythology: the King of the Vampires. It is a book that I would recommend because of the whole impression the book has on a reader, but if I could, I would edit a lot of unnecessary details to make the novel more concise."},{"Title":"Dracula (G.

Everything that we read is someones diary, relating all of the events that are unfolding. I found myself unable to read this novel at night, as I was 'fearful'. I do not think that a novel or movie has to be 'gory' to convey a message of 'horror', it can be done with suggestive words and the type of enviroment that a character is in.Unlike the movie, we are not made to feel for Dracula. We see him for the bloodsucking fiend that he is. There is no love or romance between him and the dedicated Mina.

It was surprising because of the ideas I had about both the novel and the monster (from various screen incarnations). I like to be surprised, and finding Dracula both weaker and more powerful than I had imagined, was fun. I am a huge vampire fan but have been jaded by modern vampires (and their fans).It was better than I expected/feared, in the way that it was able to still convey the horror, to me, today, even living in the horror-saturated culture I do. I thought the way it portrayed the quintessential vampire was refreshing in a world where everyone is reinventing the monster in their own image.I was disappointed but not surprised by, the limitations of the mid-late nineteenth century novel form. I was reminded of the worst of Emily Bronte, E. M. Forster, which is a plodding fascination with detail and a pace not suited to a modern life. The idea that each scene in a book should move the plot forward, is a fairly modern one and this book needed a good editorIn the end, I think it would be interesting and useful for modern writers to return to the original, or even the sources of the original, before they set out to re-imagine him. It seems to be they all re-imagine based on a copy of a copy and all the work if flawed and reads like cardboard tastes.Every vampire I see today began with Lestat, and not Dracula, in mind.

I am reviewing with the plan of being objective, and focusing purely on the enjoyability of the book. I am leaving all appreciation of, or loyalty to, \\"classics\\" aside.During the first few passages, the book is very interesting, and pulls you in with its tactful mystery. Jonathan Harker is hardly an interesting character at this point in the book, which is to be expected. It is often enjoyable to see an ordinary character thrust into an extraordinary situation, and to see how they develop. Well, Jonathan doesn't really develop throughout the story. His lack of personality isn't something to be built off of. It is a structureless pit upon which no character can be erected.Dracula's castle is a haunting place, and Jonathan's experiences there are peculiar at first, and terrifying after some time. He must withstand such terrors, meanwhile passively interacting with the vampire Dracula, pretending not to suspect anything. While some details are described for far too long, and some details are overlooked where much potential lies, this part of the book was really enjoyable.Then in London, Dr. Seward oversees a \\"Zoophagus\\" (life eating) insane person who, we can see, has some peculiar ties to The Count. This maniac, Renfield, is an interesting character and, to be honest, is probably the only character with an interesting personality in the whole book. Dr. Seward and two other men (Mr. Morris, and Lord Godalming) fall in love with the lovely and innocent Lucy, who also happens to be The Count's first victim. Lucy's sleep walking, and peculiar behavior is a precursor to a mysterious illness which she begins to suffer from shortly after her marriage to Lord Godalming. This affliction of hers prompts Dr. Seward to call upon his old friend Dr. Van Helsing.Long story short, Lucy slowly becomes one of the Undead, and begins feeding off of children, making it into newspaper headlines. Van Helsing is hard pressed to convince the other men to help him stab her in the heart and cut her head off.This is pretty much the last interesting thing to happen in the book. And even during these passages, there is a lot of unnecessary wordiness. Bram Stoker is quite skilled at saying very few things with a whole lot of words. Days pass, without any real events to note, and yet he catalogs these days as if something relevant to the story has happened. Why? Why do we need to know, in detail, every event of every day, and every passage of indecision and inaction?My major qualm with this book comes from the massive opportunities that are wasted. Bram has 7 main characters with which to work. 7 possible interesting characters that could have been. But not a single one of them is any more interesting than the bland Jonathan. Each one of them is an over-polite Victorian era Londoner, worried about manners when a vampire is on the loose. And each one of them is devoutly religious, invoking some religious prayer nearly every few paragraphs. I understand that people were simpler, more ignorant, and more religious back then, but it gets annoying when nearly every idea is ended with a reference to God, or Jesus.The book is written in the form of journal entries, letters, newspaper articles, etc. Nothing is narrated from any disembodied voice. Only physical recordable media. This means that we are able to have 7 main characters, and other accessory characters as narrators. Yet as I read, I often had to go back a few pages to see who was narrating, as every character speaks in the same way, and holds the very same opinions and ideas. You would think between all these characters, there would be some trace of individuality within them. But nope.As an Atheist and skeptic to all supernatural claims, I have to put my personal views on the back burner whenever I read fiction. I'm used to that. But some of the superstitious manifestations in this book are nerve racking, and the author obviously has a disdain for skeptics. Every reference to skepticism is synonymous as a reference to fools. As if those who look at the evidence first are the gullible ones. This is a small gripe, but one worth mentioning.Among many problems I have with this book, I will only touch on one more, which I mentioned previously. This is the most important and infuriating flaw of this book.Inaction is described in more detail and fills more space in the pages than action. For every two pages of indecision, nervous self-awareness, and unnecessary prayer, there are perhaps two sentences of actual plot. The worst example of this is at the end of the book. Nearly a fifth of the book is spent describing every uninteresting passage of time while the main characters pursue the Count as he flees back to his castle. Then, when the moment of truth arrives, and it is time for Dracula to meet his end... 4 sentences.Bram Stoker describes the great showdown between life and Undeath with 4 sentences. This would be excusable, if he had not previously wasted 4 sentences on every tiny uninteresting detail for the past 400 pages. Honestly, at that point in the book, I didn't even want to read the last page or so. I felt my time had been wasted enough already.When the plot points of the book are laid out, end-to-end, it really paints a haunting, and beautiful picture. But it is as if Bram Stoker's goal was to make us look at his masterpiece with a microscope, after he had cut it into hundreds of pieces and spread it out over a football field. I'm sorry, but that just isn't my idea of a good book. Maybe I've been spoiled by all this \\"modern\\" literature. I don't care. Da Vinci never asked us to examine the Mona Lisa, piece by piece, separated by long expanses of unpainted canvas."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"If you have any interest in horror fiction generally, or the vampire genre particularly, then naturally Stoker's classic is required reading. But you might as well be warned as to what you are in for. The early chapters, where Harker is trapped in Dracula's castle, are truly great! However, once the Count gets to London, things start to slow down, or even become downright annoying. I had a particular dislike for the obnoxious Van Helsing and his band of effete upper-class male heroes. I would have been much happier if Dracula had turned the bunch into vampires, and it had been left to Mina, Lucy and Renfield to stake the lot. Shelley's FRANKENSTEIN holds up much better as classic horror fiction.I wish I could recommend a better vampire novel, but, sadly, vampire novels are mostly trash, and much of the genre is now devoted to sick pornography. Better, in some ways, are Steven King's 'SALEM'S LOT, Sheridan Le Fanu's CARMILLA, and and Anne Rice's INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE (avoid the sequels), but none of them have anything that can substitute for the opening chapters of DRACULA."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"I first read this book in school, but didn't finish it. The next school year I read the novel in it's entirty, and was amazed at Stoker's talent for creating a story so gripping and emotional that years after it's first publication, it's still remembered as one of the greatest stories in the histiory of mankind.But any book can have a strange moment, and this book contains one of those. I found it disgusting when Dracula burst that vein on his chest and forced Mina to drink the spurting blood. MAN, THAT'S REPULSING!!!!!!!!I would suggest this novel for anyone looking for a tale that will be remembered for eternity.PARTY ON, DUDES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Bram Stoker has a unique writing style. The whole book is made up of letters that are written back and forth between the main characters,Mina and Lucy. This novel is 450 pages long and much of the beginning is unsuspenseful, useless information. Bram Stoker has a very unusual vocabulary. Many of these words are of nothing I have ever heard before. Parts of this story are confusing because it goes from the diary of Jonathan Harker to letters between Mina and Lucy. His style of writing makes you lose interest fast.This story starts out with Jonathan Harker going to Dracula's castle on business matters. Once Jonathan finds out that Dracula is a vampire, Dracula locks Jonathan in the castle. He then travels to England in search of victims to lure into the houses that he's set up all over England, so he can suck their blood. He makes sure that each one had a coffin in it so the light will not kill him during broad daylight. Jonathan escapes the castle and finds that Dracula is trying to manipulateboth Mina and Lucy. Mina being his wife. This is when the vampire \\"doctor\\" Van Helsing and Jonathan are on the prowl for this blood sucker and they will do whatever it takes to find him.This book is only recommended to those who enjoy long novels with challenging vocabulary. The book's exposition was way too long and I don't think that the vocabulary really matched the time period. Personally, I think it was confusing to try and remember where each character was. It had Jonathan Harker, who was from England, and Dracula from Transylvania which got confusing when they ended up going to eachothers' homeland. Overall, the book was much too confusing to try and grasp."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Written in a journal form of various character, it chronicles Dracula, the vampire from Romania, venturing into London. The first 100 pages of the book are mesmerizing, the journal of Jonathan Harker traveling and staying in Dracula's castle is amazing. The fear, the dread, the sinister Count and elegant prose all add to feel of a great horror novel.Then the rest of the book comes along. What once was a horror movie becomes pure Victorian drivel, with laughably divination for the two females, Lucy and Mina, that not only destroys the readability with the extreme flowery nature of their banalities, but detracts from the true horror that Stoker brings about in the first 100 pages.The last fifty pages are interesting, as they are on the quest to destroy Dracula, but the drudgery of language and the previous 300 pages destroy all hope of enjoying this book."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"It's probably unfair of me to give this book only two stars. I'm sure it's been a 'tremendous influence' on the 'popularization of vampires in popular media' over the last century. The problem is that the book itself, despite a good first act, is slow-paced and ultimately unsatisfying, either as literature or as a horror novel.The book begins promisingly enough: Jonathan Harker travels to Transylvania to facilitate a real-estate transaction for a mysterious, worldly Romanian Count named Dracula. Slowly, while staying with Dracula for several weeks, Harker realizes that not all is as it seems with the Count. Since we're reading the story as a series of journal entries (first by Harker, later by the other protagonists), the feeling of suspense is heightened; Harker's mood descends from lighthearted to cautious to nervous to terror-stricken. It's well-done and creepy (history's greatest horror writer, some guy named Poe, used this technique to great effect), and Bram Stoker should have ended it right after Harker leaves the castle (I won't tell you how).Unfortunately, the rest of the book rapidly devolves into an insipid mess. Dracula hardly appears at all after the initial encounter with Harker. This is as it should be, but instead of being a vague, horrible presence off-screen, Dracula is treated more as a fox with several hounds after him. The characters at this point become caricatures and stereotypes. The worst offender is the Dutchman Abraham Van Helsing himself, who is a surgeon, a lawyer, a kindly old man of the world, a father figure to the poor damsels in distress, and the leader of the band of vampire hunters. Now, this could be fun with the right touch of lightheartedness, but Stoker plays it deadly straight; the book hasn't an ounce of humor that I can recall. The journal entries that comprise the rest of the book are dedicated to demonstrating just how heroic and virtuous all the other vampire hunters are (as the Wolf from Pulp Fiction would say, 'Let's not start __ __ __ __ just yet, Gentlemen.'), and how the Count's foul presence must be wiped off the face of the Earth.Again, this would be fine if the slow pace were just a prelude to a dramatic confrontation with Dracula, but this book's bizarre anticlimax is such a letdown that it's actually astonishing; it must be seen to be believed, except that it's not worth it.If you're looking for effective 19th-century horror, look no further than Edgar Allan Poe. But once you've read Poe, you're left with no reason to read this book."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"I do not like this story. It is boring to me.

K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"This book is quite different from the movies I have seen. The main characters are the same and the beginning of the story is the same (Jonathan Harker's trip to Dracula's castle) but other than that any similarity is pure coincidental.The book has four major scenes:First is Jonathan's visit to the castle Dracula to hand Dracula his deed of purchase of a property Dracula bought in London. Jonathan eventually escapes. Dracula orchestrated his own journey inside a box.Second: Dracula and his boxes arrive in London. Here we meet Lucy, a friend of Mina, which is Jonathan's fianc&eacute;. Dracula gets hold of her and turns her into a vampire. Dr. Von Helsing is sent for by Lucy's friends to come and help. He figures out what has happened. So Lucy is released from her vampire status by means of a stake through the heart.Third: it is Mina's turn to get relieved of her blood. She is now Jonathan's wife. All her friends now team up to protect her and to fight Dracula to the end. They are successful in so far as to make Dracula flee London and head back (in his box) to his castle in Transylvania.Fourth: the friends chase after Dracula. The ending is for you to read and find out. But I can say it is a bit abrupt (in my opinion). I was hoping for some more melodrama.This is the story, told via diaries from several of the role players, media clippings, letters etc. This makes it interesting and different to most other novels. The only thing that bothered me is that it is slow moving. Many meetings and discussions are narrated in great depth, overshadowing the real actions.Still I enjoyed reading the book."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

Anyway, I'll get over it don't worry.As to the novel itself, I'll say that it is very interesting in its structures (characters writing the book themselves), epistolary stuff and diaries. However, there are things that are incoherent in this novel, things that were intelligently corrected in Coppola's version of it. I am talking about the incredible LUCK Dracula has that he should run into exactly this guy's fiancee when he comes to England and all the other not-so-coherent things there are. In the movie that flaw is filled. In fact, I was very disappointed in Dracula's treatment as a character, there is virtually nothing about his origins, that was a bummer to me because I was very much expecting some deeper stuff on this issue: why he came to be what he is, the reasons behind it, etc. Instead there is just nada. In the movie you get the idea that love is behind this, love turned bitter but at least there is a reason, Dracula denies God and life because he has lost what was dearest to him, his love. There is no such person in the present book, sadly. As a result Dracula in the book is your basic evil guy without a cause, very flat. That was my big big disappointment to me."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

Half of the time when they could be out fighting the vampires they were eating breakfast or taking walks, and I couldn't see why they would wait so long, I mean, peoples lives are at stake (and so are their souls)! The characters were boring and underdeveloped; my favoriet was Jonathan, but he somehow got very wimpy, leaving Dracula as the best character(too bad he didn't write a diary, because that would have been interesting). The proffesor Van Helsin was considered the vampire expert, but a lot of the things he did made no sence, and when the obvious was staring at him in the face he didn't even notice it until it was to late. It did give a lot of info about how to kill vampires, but that probly won't be of much use to anyone considering vampires arn't real. If you really want to find out what happens, rent the movie 'Dracula', because it follows the plot fairly well and is more scary than the book, not to mention requires less time or effort.

Hall (Large Print))","review":"\\"Dracula\\" was not the first vampire novel, nor was it Bram Stoker's first book.But after years of research, Stoker managed to craft the ultimate vampire novel, which has spawned countless movies, spinoffs, and books that follow the blueprint of the Transylvanian count. Eerie, horrifying and genuinely mysterious, \\"Dracula\\" is undoubtedly the most striking and unique vampire novel yet penned.Real estate agent Jonathan Harker arrives in Transylvania, to arrange a London house sale to Count Dracula. But as the days go by, Harker witnesses increasingly horrific events, leading him to believe that Dracula is not actually human. His fiancee Mina arrives in Transylvania, and finds that he has been feverish. Meanwhile the count has vanished -- along with countless boxes filled with dirt.And soon afterwards, strange things happen: a ship piloted by a dead man crashes on the shore, after a mysterious thing killed the crew. A lunatic talks about \\"Him\\" coming. And Mina's pal Lucy dies of mysterious blood loss, only to come back as an undead seductress. Dracula has arrived in England -- then the center of the Western world -- and intends to make it his own...\\"Dracula\\" is the grandaddy of Lestat and other elegantly alluring bloodsuckers, but that isn't the sole reason why this novel is a classic. It's also incredibly atmospheric, and very well-written. Not only is it very freaky, in an ornate Victorian style, but it is also full of restrained, quiet horror and creepy eroticism. What's more, it's shaped the portrayal of vampires in movies and books, even to this day.Despite already knowing what's going on for the first half of the book, it's actually kind of creepy to see these people whose lives are being disrupted by Dracula, but don't know about vampires. It's a bit tempting to yell \\"It's a vampire, you idiots!\\" every now and then, but you can't really blame them. Then the second half kicks in, with accented professor Van Helsing taking our heroes on a quest to save Mina from Dracula.And along the way, while our heroes try to figure stuff out, Stoker spins up all these creepy hints of Dracula's arrival. Though he wrote in the late 19th-century manner, very verbose and a bit stuffy, his skill shines through. The book is crammed with intense, evocative language, with moments like Dracula creeping down a wall, or the dead captain found tied to the wheel. Once read, they stick in your mind throughout the book.It's also a credit to Stoker that he keeps his characters from seeming like idiots or freaks, which they could have easily seemed like. Instead, he puts little moments of humanity in them, like Van Helsing admitting that his wife is in an asylum. Even the letters and diaries are written in different styles; for example, Seward's is restrained and analytical, while Mina's is exuberant and bright.Even Dracula himself is an overpowering presence despite his small amount of actual screen time, and not just as a vampire -- Stoker presents him as passionate, intense, malignant, and probably the smartest person in the entire book. If Van Helsing hadn't thwarted him, he probably would have taken over the world -- not the Victorian audience's ideal ending.And brilliant dark fantasy author Holly Black adds a fun little prologue for this edition, in which she talks about her childhood fear of \\"that book\\" and of Dracula crawling down the side of her house, as well as the staggering impact the book has had on the image of vampires. And how there's \\"nothing out there in the dark. Of course.\\"Intelligent, frightening and very well-written, \\"Dracula\\" is the well-deserved godfather of all modern vampire books and movies -- and its unique villain still dwarfs the more recent undead."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"While this is definitely a Should Read novel-- after all, the character of Dracula is firmly entrenched in our culture-- I came away from it mildly disappointed. While the epistolary quality is a fun way to get inside the minds of the various characters, I never became comfortable with its inherent misogyny. The women are either pillars of virtue or shameless vixens, and the men's responses to female sexuality are either to possess the woman, kill her, or protect her. This is clearly a response to the time in which it was written, when women were beginning to show their discontent with being merely decorations.Stoker also shows his (or perhaps his culture's) fear of the other through the constant assertions that London is the center of the civilized world and those places further east are barbaric and backwards. However, this is still essential reading as it's important to get this influential story from the original source and not one of several over-sexed, over-dramatized Hollywood versions."},{"Title":"Dracula (G.

I am a big Gorey fan myself, but I was greatly disappointed when I received my copy - not because the illustrations are bad, but because there practically aren't any! The only real illustrations are the front and rear endsheets, and the title page. But other than that there are just a few simple caricatures of the main characters, that introduce some of the chapters here and there. I don't know exactly what I was expecting - perhaps a handful of full-page illustrations depicting characters or scenes from the novel. I thought that was what an \\"illustrated\\" novel was.

Overall a good read but I'm not sure horror books stand up to horror movies."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Umberto Eco, in the foreword to his The Name of the Rose, suggests that it is not the job of an author to explain his work. From this assertion he goes on to argue that the title of a book should give away as little as possible as to the content of the novel. Simple titles, such as ones that simply identify the main character (Oliver Twist, Jane Eyre, etc.) are acceptable. Even better are titles that give no hint at all of the subject matter, and the best titles are the ones that are in fact completely misleading.Umberto Eco certainly would have applauded Bram Stoker. Dracula, the novel, is in fact not at all about Count Dracula. The character of Dracula appears for a grand total of less than 100 pages in this 400 page novel. The main characters in this book are the two women that he bites, and the handful of gentlemen that resolve to hunt him down and kill him. And though Dracula is eventually the focus of their attention, for the better part of the novel they don't even know of his existence. If you are expecting a suspenseful, gory thriller that follows a blood-thirsty killer on his nocturnal adventures, like in the movies, you may be disappointed.Still, with the right expectations, this is a perfectly enjoyable book. It paints an interesting picture of an age very much caught up in righteousness and religion. It's a classic story of good versus evil, with few gray areas. And it introduces a character who was destined to become the most famous villain in the history of literature."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

You meet amazing characters like Lord Arthur Godalming and Quincey Morris (American). The story has many twists and turns that have you feeling like you are the character of whom eyes you are reading through.The story begins with Jonathan going to meet the Count. Then we go to Mina who is visiting a place with Lucy where the Count lands in England and makes Lucy his victim. Here we meet the characters of Dr. Seward and Van Helsing.

But this was not the case with Stoker's \\"Dracula.\\" This epistolary novel (written in the form of letters and correspondence) was definitely a page-turner, full of melodrama and supernatural suspense. I found that the various perspectives of all the characters really enhanced the storyline, as each character had a distinctive voice and take on the events of the story. For me, it was so interesting to return to the beginnings of the current fascination with vampires in pop culture. It is clear that Dracula was the vampire story that started it all! If you are at all a fan of classic literature or gothic novels, or even more modern takes on vampires, give this a try...it doesn't disappoint!"},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"This is a MUST READ for any fan of vampire literature! Although it is a classic, this story is timeless. I had a hard time putting this book down when I had to, and the story kept coming back to me days after I read it.Dracula is so very creepy, yet very elegant - I liked and hated him all at the same time. I felt sorry for his victims, but I also felt sorry for him when they hunted him down.The way the author told the story from several characters perspective (through their journals and letters) put a refreshing twist throughout the book. Each characters voice was unique - there was never a question as to who was telling the story each time.Overall, this was a great book!"},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"First off, I definitely enjoyed the book. I liked the story, characters, and vampire mythos. But after watching so many Dracula movies (especially the 1992 one), I wasn't left with any surprises. But that only hurt the experience a little. The book goes into so much more detail and character development. In the movie, Arthur; Jack; and Quincey are more of an afterthought. In the book, their relationship amongst themselves and with the main characters are much more dynamic.Another thing is how subtle they convey the vampires' habits and weaknesses. They don't just come out and say: they don't like garlic, and crosses, etc...Finally, I was pleased on how well the novel read. It wasn't long-winded and hard to read, it read more like a modern book. I had so much fun reading it. I wish I read this in highschool rather than \\"Rebecca\\".The only thing that keeps this book from being a five star book in my opinion is the fact that it was ruined long ago by the movies. If I would've read the book first, then I would have enjoyed both more. I promise I'll never ruin a classic by watching the movie first ever again! Who knows, I'll probably enjoy reading it even more during a re-read in a few years."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Sometimes it's the case that so-called \\"classics\\" don't quite live up to the hype. And since 'Dracula' is a book that has been re-made and re-interpreted to the point of clich&eacute;, I was concerned the book would be a bit underwhelming and stale.Well, I was wrong.'Dracula' more than lives up to its status as a classic, and despite containing an array of very familiar elements (coffins, crucifixes, garlic, holy water, punctured necks, stakes through hearts), I found it surprisingly fresh and interesting. Perhaps this is because the various film interpretations have exaggerated the violence and bloodshed to almost cartoonish level, whereas Stoker's more understated style has a brooding and dread-filled quality.Unlike some classic books, \`Dracula' is also highly readable. You do have to negotiate a few Victorian \\"O woe! O joy!\\" stylings, and Stoker's attempts to mimic Van Helsing's accented English are very ham-fisted. But the flow and pacing of the book is almost perfect. There's no long, slow build-up here; from the very first chapter, the deeply unsettling mood is set, such as when Jonathan Harker sees the circle of wolves surrounding his carriage. And the narrative format (comprised of letters, journal entries, newspaper clippings from different characters) give an insight into each main character, sometimes providing multiple perspectives on the same scene.In addition to being a Gothic horror novel, \`Dracula' also raises themes such as feminism (heroine Mina Harker is an intriguing mix of Victorian purity and New Woman resourcefulness), scientific progress (Van Helsing uses a mixture of superstition and modern medicine in treating Lucy), sexuality (the Three Brides and the stake scene in the graveyard), religion, psychiatry, and morality. So it's something that works as pure entertainment, while also providing plenty under the surface to keep you coming back again and again.You can definitely believe the hype on this one. A classic novel that's still fresh a century later. Five stars."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"The novel \\"Dracula\\" is written by Bram Stoker, in 1897. It begins with Jonathan Harker, a solicitor. He's travelling to Transylvania to Count Dracula. The Count bought houses all over London from Jonathan Harker's firm (he wants to search for new victims there, but of course Harker doesn't know that) and wants Harker to tell him all about English customs, traditions and the English language. But there are a lot of mysterious things going on at the Count's castle and Harker realizes soon, who Count Dracula really is: a vampire who drinks the blood of the living and makes them become vampires, too. Somehow Harker manages to escape from the castle, but that was not the last time he saw Dracula......... (I'm not gonna tell you the end...:))One thing I liked was that Stoker described everything very detailed. That made it very scary and spooky and you can imagine it better. For example Chapter II, on page 28, where Stoker describes the Count precise and exact. Also the descriptions of the castle, of Transylvania's landscape and of the tombs were excellent. Although Stoker didn't describe too much, you can also use your imagination.The book is divided into several diary entries, letters and newspaper articles. They all are written in the \\"Ich-Perspektive\\" and in a \\"personales Erz&auml;hlverhalten\\", but by different persons. I like stories which are written in the \\"Ich-Perspektive\\" because you are able to sympathize with the people better. Sometimes stories which are written in this perspective are kind of one-sided or biased but this story wasn't because each letter or diary entry was made by a different person (the point of view changed with every letter, entry,...) and you read narratives from many different characters. So you could see each character's point of view even though Stoker used the \\"Ich-Perspektive\\". He wrote it really well, I never got mixed up because of the different points of view, you always had an overview and the parts weren't confusing. The reader was able to find an own opinion and was not influenced by the narrator as it often happens when just one person tells the story with only his or her point of view (in \\"Ich-Perspektive\\").There was one part I didn't like: Why did Stoker left out Harker's escape from Dracula's castle? I think it would be very interesting to know how he ran away from there and while I was reading the book I always wondered when Stoker was going to tell about Harker's escape. Well, now you can imagine how he did that............. But this part which was left out by him could also be very exciting.Something that was at first strange and new to me was the old/older language Stokers used ,of course. There were some words I didn't know, but of course you can make sense of them when you read the context and it was not that difficult. Difficult to understand was the dialect or accent some of the people had. For example the captain of the \\"Czarina Catherine\\" Jonathan Harker met at the end. It was not very easy to understand him, but it was interesting.It would be also interesting to know Dracula's point of view and his thoughts and why he became the \\"King of the Vampires\\" (it's mentioned in the movie I saw, but not in the book), perhaps Stoker could have added one diary entry from Dracula!?The story is timeless, the people read it more than hundred years ago and they also read it today, it's still frightening and thrilling. The book was hard to put down, I just couldn't stop reading, I wanted to know what was going to happen next. I know that the story has inspired many movies and other stories, but I don't think they're as good as the \\"real\\" Dracula. I saw one movie (the one with Keanu Reeves) and even though it was made really good and thrilling it was not as good as Stoker's novel, which was, of course also more detailed."},{"Title":"Dracula (G.

I have read clasic novels and horror novels before, like Frankenstine ( Wich I definately do not reccomend, its very boring), and I thought this would be the usual good story but not at all as suspensful and creepy as books and movies these days. But this certainly was. If you dont know if you really want to get into this kind of reading level or length but still want to see an acurate telling of the classic story, the movie Dracula with keaneu Reeves and Winona Ryder isvery acurate at following the story line.

There is more to the plot than just killing Dracula and vampires, it is a story of a group of honourable folk, and what they take upon themselves when they meet with the terror of Count Dracula and his kind. This book speaks of courage, duty, love and death and reveals its horrors in the most sutble way as to un-nerve even the most collected people. Told through the journals of the main characters, it gives you personal depth into the story. It is a masterpiece of the written word and horror as well as human nature and unhuman nature. It is thrilling."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Dracula, by Bram Stoker, is one of all times greatest horror novels. Within its 417 pages it manages to stun its readers with it's amazing frightening and suspense filled storyline. It is a classic tale of a vampire, Count Dracula, who is hungry for blood. He first victimizes his lawyer's fianc&eacute;'s friend, Lucy Westenra, turning her into a vampire. This brings the tragic death of Lucy. Seeking revenge, Dracula's lawyer, Jonathan Harker, his fianc&eacute;, Mina Murray and a few of Lucy's close friends, set out on a mission to end the life of the vicious Count Dracula. During this time the Count manages to feed on Mina, making her yet another on of his victims. As she slowly starts changing into a vampire herself, the rest succeed in killing the count using silver knives. The death of the Count saves Mina. The reason I chose this book to read was because I had heard that it was really good. I had no idea how good I was. It is one of the most interesting books I have ever read. It brought chills to body every time I would pick up the book. Bram Stoker's choice of words and excellent imagination colored the book. I thought this book is a very intriguing book to read especially for adventure lovers who like a good scare. Like all books, Dracula had its strengths and weaknesses. Some of its strengths were the fact that you were able to imagine yourself in the story making it easier to understand. Its descriptions were very graphic and detailed, enough to help the reader picture exactly what was happening. Even the characters were described so thoroughly, that it felt as if you knew them by appearance and personality. Also, the story keeps you attached so that you don't want to put it down. Each chapter has something new and interesting to offer to help capture your attention over and over again. Slowly everything links together and you slowly find your self near the end of the book. I can't remember ever being bored throughout the book. Its weaknesses are a few in number. Every now and then you can get lost because there is so much being told and sometimes it's hard to follow. Also it jumps a lot from one setting to another and one characters point of view to another's. I would probably recommend this book to teens 14 years of age and older, because of the graphic descriptions, it would truly scare children younger because of it's violent scenes. In general this is one of the best classic novels I have read. This is the type of novel that satisfies most tastes. It includes: love, triumph, adventure, sorrow, mystery, horror, friendship and satisfaction after an accomplishment. In other words this would be the book I would recommend to all types of readers, especially those who want a good scare."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

Had I not known all about Vampires and Dracula before I read the book it would have been much better.

I, of course was expecting to read something similar to the movie 'Dracula' that I had seen. While there are some similarities, the book is immensely better. I guess that it would be hard to convey all the emotions of an individuals character 'on screen'.This extremely well written tale is written in a series of diaries. Everything that we read is someones diary, relating all of the events that are unfolding. I found myself unable to read this novel at night, as I was 'fearful'. I do not think that a novel or movie has to be 'gory' to convey a message of 'horror', it can be done with suggestive words and the type of enviroment that a character is in.Unlike the movie, we are not made to feel for Dracula. We see him for the bloodsucking fiend that he is. There is no love or romance between him and the dedicated Mina. The 'slayer' Van Helsing is as witty as ever as are all the rest of the important characters. This tale unfolds quite nicely and is very enjoyable.If you are looking for an interesting and well written read, then I recommend this riveting tale."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

Then from there the fun ensues from people getting their blood sucked by Count Dracula to Dracula getting killed.This book shows what a genius that Bram Stoker really is. Stoker portrays pure horror like no other writer I have ever read and can convey raw emotions of sheer terror. So if you enjoy blood and gore then you will love this book"},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"A milestone of the genre, Dracula was more enjoyable than I feared. Many classics just don't translate well in the modern world. Dracula does have some of those weepy emotional moments, so common to 19th century literature. Also I am usually leery of stories told by the device of letters and diaries. However Dracula starts off very compellingly with Jonathan Harker's visit to Transylvania. The story drags a bit when the Count reaches London, but picks up after the death of Lucy. Unfortunately, the story never regains the creepy feeling of the beginning; mainly because the count remains a vague menace off page for almost the whole last two thirds of the book."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"With so many reviews ALREADY out there, I'll keep it short and sweet. This is not the oldest vampire novel, but it became the most well known and the standard for all stories, novels and movies to follow. With a very interesting foreward by Leonard Wolf, this copy is straight-foreward, without any extras, it is for the 'Dracula' fan who needs no help with understanding the age the story is set in. No matter how many times I read and reread the novel, I never get bored and, in fact, it seems to get better and better as I come to really savor it, like a wine that only gets better with time.

Hall (Large Print))","review":"I recall being impressed with the popularity and continued interest in Dracula. For some reason this literary work is still captivating readers and movie goers alike due to the tireless effort and diligent skill that was put into the original manuscript. The author did not leave any details or emotionally stimulating angles out of the novel, it did a commendable job of combining horror and sadistic paranormal events with romance.The book was ultimately inspired by an historical reference that was most likely influence by Vlad the Impaler, which is an infamous Eastern European ruler whose real name was spelled similar to Dracula, which means, son of the dragon. This is the combinable aspect of the novel it drew on real life and was affected by real fears of sexual promiscuity (syphilis and now HIV) and racial blood mixing which became a prevalent topic of debate when thinking about genocide and ethnic cleaning which took place in Spain when the Andalusia moors were flushed out of Spain by queen Isabella in the 1400's and early 1500's. Currently there has been a resurgence of these themes because of the success of vampire novels that were influenced by Dracula such as the Vampire Chronicles by Ann Rice and Twilight."},{"Title":"Dracula (G.

K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Having escaped from the horror of Count Dracula's castle in a secluded part of Transylvania, Jonathan Harker thought he had seen the last of the Count. But when his fianc&eacute;'s friend's health starts deteriorating with no apparent reason he soon realises that it was not to be so. As he uncovers the terrifying secrets about the mysterious Count Dracula, he realises that the only way to save his beloved, Mina from also falling under the Count's clutches is to put an end to this heinous being for once and for all.Vampire stories have been told since the time before Dracula. So, you can't actually give Bram Stoker the credit for being the creator of the vampire lore. But at the same time it is true that most of the depictions of vampires over the years have been inspired from Bram Stoker's Dracula. While talking about vampires one of the first names that pops up into mind is that of Dracula.Living in a time when vampires are depicted as charming, \\"gorgeous\\" and like \\"Knights-in -shining-armour\\", Dracula is something to turn to when you get tired of the sickly sweet and hopelessly romantic vampires of today. It gives you all the chills and terrors that the tales of these undead creatures are connected to. Though I rarely read books in the horror genre and have read just one other gothic novel, this was a book which kept me glued to it till the very end. While reading the book I could actually imagine the creepy music of the old horror movies playing in the background which is accompanied by a blood- curdling scream. Though the much awaited scream didn't come Dracula became one of my favourite books. Though I have read the book just once I can actually remember some of the scenes as clearly as something I would have read right now- I remember my heart beating at a lightning speed during some of the instances of the book.Though the book is dominated by male characters I thought Mina Harker character, the strongest of them all. With her brave, steadfast and caring nature she became one of my favourite characters of the book. And of course then there is the Count Dracula in front of whom all the other characters become quite bland. The mysterious and ruthless vampire continues to terrify and fascinate generations of readers .Favourite Quotes:\\"Once again...welcome to my house. Come freely. Go safely; and leave something of the happiness you bring.-Count Dracula to Jonathan Harker\\"\\"Though sympathy alone can't alter facts, it can help to make them more bearable.\\"\\"Despair has its own calms\\"Overall:Thrilling, hair- raising and above all an entertaining book.Recommended?Yes, to those who love a good vampire story which remains true to the myths and, also to those who like gothic fiction."},{"Title":"Dracula (G.

Dracula is a vampire from Transylvania and can turn others into vampires with a bite. Van Helsing knows the methods to combat vampires using things such as garlic, blessed host, and a wooden stake through the heart. Despite this, I really enjoyed reading it. It was the first book I read on my Kindle. While there were some typos (which even paperback books sometimes contain), overall the Kindle version was excellent.Told in the form of letters and journals, the tale is done from the viewpoint of a group of people who do not all know each other at the start. Before the end, they become a tight-knit group brought together by the quest to destroy Dracula. Most of the characters are well-developed, interesting, and very sympathetic. The writing invokes an eerie atmosphere which is easy to imagine given the detail provided.

Has some slow spots (what doesn't, really?), and a few very slow spots, and very few truly exciting bits. Aside from these, the pace is, perhaps, a steady walk (more than a stroll or plod, but less than a jog or run). Like many books of the time, the language can occasionally be cumbersome and wordy. When the letters between Mina and Lucy begin, the story seems lost, and it's difficult to get through for a bit, until enough details are revealed so that we can see what is happening, even if they cannot.

Dracula is made up of letters, which are written by Mina and Lucy and journal entries by Jonathan and Dr. Seward. Dracula is 450 pages long and Bram Stoker uses a large variety of words. Many of the words in this book are old fashioned words. These words are not used in everyday life. The beginning of the book has useless information to the readers. Dracula get confusing because there are all these journal entries, and people who are not explained clearly. The letters go from Lucy to Mina to Dr. Seward and back again and it loses your interest.Dracula starts off with Jonathan traveling to Dracula's castle for business. OnceJonathan Harker finds out whom Dracula really is, Dracula locks Jonathan in the castle so he can't escape. While Dracula travels to England and he lures women into his houses so he can suck their blood, Jonathan had escaped from the castle and finds that Dracula is after Mina and Lucy. Van Helsing and Jonathan are on the hunt to capture Dracula and kill him.This book wasn't how I expected it to be. There was a lot of letters from Lucy and Mina, which made the book boring to read. The exposition of the book dragged on and never ended. Also the use of vocabulary, some of it was hard to understand. In Dracula, there was a lot of traveling going on. I would recommend this book to people who like long books that are 450 pages long, and the choice of words he uses in the book. Other than that, this book is not for you.

K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Dracula is a suspenseful novel of blood, revenge and true love. Unlike a horror movie, Dracula doesn't need expensive equipment, computer technology and million dollar make-up to bring you into the novel.We enter Jonathan Harker's journal with little knowledge of the true Dracula, other than the popular image of a man wearing a long collared coat, with an immensely thick accent and two vampire fangs. His journal does not go into detail of Dracula's lust of blood until far into the novel, and the beginning pages are distressingly slow., whether on purpose or unknowingly, Stoker makes Harker seem slightly ignorant and slow. When Harker realizes that Dracula has him in prison and intends to harm him, Stoker takes us to an entirely new journal of his wife Mina Harker, and her dear friend Lucy, leaving the reader in suspense as to what actually happens to Jonathan. Stoker continues writing about Mina for some long chapters until Mina gets a letter saying Jonathan is alive, but severely ill. Not until then do we find out that Jonathan has survived Dracula and his castle. At this point Dracula starts its steady and quickening descent from passable novel to irritating and irksome pile of notes. Stoker seems to note himself that his book is crashing before his eyes so he attempts to capture the reader's waning attention by focusing on Lucy's sudden illness, loss of blood and finally death. Before Lucy's demise, new characters are introduced into the novel, including Van Helsing, an expert on vampires, who reveals his suspicions about the cause of Lucy's death and what is needed to be done once she passes. The others agree to follow him on the long journey to rid England of all vampires and the leader, Dracula. Once all vampires other than Dracula, are heroically killed, the expedition continues to seek out Dracula by hypnotizing Mina Harker, who in her tranc, provides the group clues to Dracula's hiding place. These trances to everyone's surprise (except the readers) get shorter and shorter as the book gets closer to the end, thus making it more difficult to search for Dracula and increasing the suspense to the reader. Ultimately, they locate Dracula and stab him. Dracula turns to dust and his victims turn back into humans.Dracula's mythology explores the legend of vampires. Immortality fascinates Stoker as his novel is based on man's desire for everlasting life. Ancient sagas told of vampires that were living replicas of a human body that had since died, a completely different soul, mind and mission, but the same looks and voice of the deceased. The mission of the vampire is to live forever. Blood is the sign of life, the sign of youth and energy. The vampire drinks the blood of the living to stay alive longer and postpone the day when the body no longer exists. No one really knows the source of the vampire legend, or even if they're real. From the beginning, vampires were made up so humans could blame the unexplainable on them since no one could refute the theory. This idea seemed to work for a while until science developed explanations for what humans had thought inexplicable. Science explained what phenomenon vampires and other superstitions had been taking the blame for and science had proof, unlike superstitions which had no proof besides some infrequent and random accounts of sightings. In Dracula, Stoker doesn't develop the mythology of vampires in much depth. His research is mainly confined to his own imagination and some rumors of what weakens a vampire. In short, the mythology of vampires in Dracula deal principally with the fear of death and the desire to remain alive and youthful.Bram Stoker had no main protagonist or loyal sidekick in his novel. All characters share the same number of appearances in the chapters and no character is achieving more than the others. Some may have more knowledge than others, but those who have less knowledge about vampires make up for that with greater common sense and knowledge of and love for geography, helping track the next vampire on the list or help get the fastest transportation to another area. All characters are very smart, and help the novel progress through difficult challenges. Everyone deals with the main challenge of ridding England and the world of Dracula. Every character is linked in some way to each other character, each character knows and cares for the other characters and wants to help get rid of the vampire that is trying to infest and infect the world without hurting those they love or other innocents on the way. All the characters confront the hardships of the pursuit of Dracula with bravery and sometimes foolishness, which does result in injury and death. Mr. Morris, a friend to the principle characters, dies in the last few pages of the novel. Unfortunately you don't know much about him so you don't feel that much sympathy for him.I am very surprised that Dracula is a classic in literature. This book was not thrilling at all after the first few pages. After we leave Jonathan's journey Transylvania, and the book shifts to his wife, the excitement and the suspense bubbles a small amount but then stops entirely. Overall, this book was an enormous disappointment. Dracula didn't inspire me as so many other books do to want to write a novel of my own. Stoker isn't a bad writer but he can't seem to put words into fluent and exciting sentences, and to maintain suspense through the entire novel."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"I'm an avid reader and vampire fan. Over the past couple years I've started a collection of vampire books which totals over 100 now and I figured what vampire collection would be complete without Dracula, the one that started it all? I started reading this book almost 3 weeks ago...and I'm just now halfway through. I don't like to give up on a book, but I just don't think I can waste another 2 or 3 weeks on this. In the first 200 pages there have literally been less than a handful of short-lived moments that were actually interesting. Other than that it feels like NOTHING is happening. There's no STORY here.I can't help but wonder what are the standards when it comes to classic books...Is it simply being old? Groundbreaking? Longevity? I guess Dracula has all that going for it...it's certainly old, was the first of it's kind and people are still reading it more than 100 year after the fact.

Of course, nearly every reader already knows Dracula's secret, but the creepy little details still work just fine. The slow pace of Harker's journey enables the author to build a wonderful, immersive stage setting in the Carpathian mountains. The creepiness mounts to outright horror as Harker learns the Count's secret and has dangerous encounters in the castle.Unfortunately, at this point, the book abruptly switches from rural gothic Carpathian countryside to Victorian England. I found this jarring. Also, the epistolary format does not really help, and sometimes interferes with the flow of the story.Eventually, though, Stoker rebuilds the terrifying atmosphere. He's good at it, too -- hints and clues of vampire activity building up to chases, ambushes, and fights. However, the final chase and fight just felt rushed.There's plenty to like here, including some qualities of vampires that were new to me. However, the abrupt transition after Harker's first journey plus the rushed denouement detracted a little."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

In the Christopher Moore books, which are comedy, at one point the boyfriend of a novice vampire struggles to help her by collecting all the vampire fiction he could find. His comical references to the differences are funny and made me curious. Having completed 4 Anne Rice novels, I thought I'd go back to where it all began and read the classic.The style is, of course, a bit funny since it is stiff, proper and full of words that are less used today. Never the less, the style of narrative via letters, diary entries and notes is clever and gives the reader the feeling of having stumbled across a secret archive. While there isn't the blood and gore of some modern horror tales, Stoker creates real ambiance in his lavish descriptions and subtle details. This was a clever writing style and quite enjoyable. Now I know why this caught on and has become so iconic. Like so many classics, characters and phrases have entered the lexicon to the extent that I recognized much of this book.Final Note: I had thought Carfax was a service that faxed reports of cars. In our modern age it seemed quaint that this business would make itself seem older by referencing 80s technology. However, Carfax is the name of Dracula's estate in England! Could it be that the nice car history report people are actually blood sucker?"},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

My book was in great condition and got here on time."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Surprisingly \\"Denn die Toten reiten schnell\\" or \\"For the dead travel fast\\" is more than an opening line to this tale of love in the dangerous moon light. After watching several Drac movies and a few Nosferatu's, I pretty much though I had a handle on the genera. Little did I know what a wonderful world of mystery and suspense that Bram Stoker opened up for me.The story is told mostly third party though the papers, diaries, and phonograph recordings (on wax cylinders) of those people involve in a tale so bizarre that it almost defies belief. The general story line is that of a Count that plans to move to a more urban setting (from Borgo Pass to London) where there is a richer diet. There he finds succulent women; something he can sing his teeth in. Unfortunately for him a gang of ruffians (including a real-estate agent, asylum director, Texas cowboy and an Old Dutch abnormal psychologist) is out to detour his nocturnal munching. They think they have Drac on the run but with a wing and a prayer he is always one step ahead.Of more value to the reader is the rich prose chosen by Stoker as he describes the morals and technology of the time. We have to come to grips with or decide if we can perform the rituals that are required to eliminate vampires verses the impropriety of opening graves and staking loved ones. The powers in the book differ from the movie versions in that they are more of persuasion and capabilities to manipulate the local weather. At one point the Dutch Dr. Van Helsing, is so overwhelmed by a beautiful vampire laying in the grave that he almost for gets why he is there and may become vamp chow.All in all the story is more in the cunning chase. And the question as to will they succeed or will Dracula triumph. Remember \\"For the dead travel fast.\\"Dracula"},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"\\"Dracula\\" was not the first vampire novel, nor was it Bram Stoker's first book. But he managed to craft the ultimate vampire novel, which has spawned countless movies, spinoffs, and books that follow the blueprint of the Transylvanian count. Eerie, horrifying and genuinely mysterious, \\"Dracula\\" is undoubtedly the most striking and unique vampire novel yet penned.Real estate agent Jonathan Harker arrives in Transylvania, to arrange a London house sale to Count Dracula. But as the days go by, Harker witnesses increasingly horrific events, leading him to believe that Dracula is not actually human. His fiancee Mina arrives in Transylvania, and finds that he has been feverish. Meanwhile the count has vanished -- along with countless boxes filled with dirt.And soon afterwards, strange things happen: a ship piloted by a dead man crashes on the shore, after a mysterious thing killed the crew. A lunatic talks about \\"Him\\" coming. And Mina's pal Lucy dies of mysterious blood loss, only to come back as an undead seductress. Dracula has arrived in England -- then the center of the Western world -- and intends to make it his own...\\"Dracula\\" is the grandaddy of Lestat and other elegantly alluring bloodsuckers, but that isn't the sole reason why this novel is a classic. It's also incredibly atmospheric, and very well-written. Not only is it very freaky, in an ornate Victorian style, but it is also full of restrained, quiet horror and creepy eroticism. What's more, it's shaped the portrayal of vampires in movies and books, even to this day.Despite already knowing what's going on for the first half of the book, it's actually kind of creepy to see these people whose lives are being disrupted by Dracula, but don't know about vampires. It's a bit tempting to yell \\"It's a vampire, you idiots!\\" every now and then, but you can't really blame them. Then the second half kicks in, with accented professor Van Helsing taking our heroes on a quest to save Mina from Dracula.And along the way, while our heroes try to figure stuff out, Stoker spins up all these creepy hints of Dracula's arrival. Though he wrote in the late 19th-century manner, very verbose and a bit stuffy, his skill shines through. The book is crammed with intense, evocative language, with moments like Dracula creeping down a wall, or the dead captain found tied to the wheel. Once read, they stick in your mind throughout the book.It's also a credit to Stoker that he keeps his characters from seeming like idiots or freaks, which they could have easily seemed like. Instead, he puts little moments of humanity in them, like Van Helsing admitting that his wife is in an asylum. Even the letters and diaries are written in different styles; for example, Seward's is restrained and analytical, while Mina's is exuberant and bright.Even Dracula himself is an overpowering presence despite his small amount of actual screen time, and not just as a vampire -- Stoker presents him as passionate, intense, malignant, and probably the smartest person in the entire book. If Van Helsing hadn't thwarted him, he probably would have taken over the world -- not the Victorian audience's ideal ending.Intelligent, frightening and very well-written, \\"Dracula\\" is the well-deserved godfather of all modern vampire books and movies -- and its unique villain still dwarfs the more recent undead."},{"Title":"Dracula (G.

Hall (Large Print))","review":"To be sure, this book carries worthy elements. The technique of using letters and journals is interesting, and it helps us to see the situation from different points of view. The pace is nice and swift, and the book rarely drags. Some images are drawn well, and some characters are memorable. It must also be stated that this book provided the foundation for the several Dracula movies. (Notably the Lugosi and Langella version.) Unfortunately, the 1979 version of Dracula with Frank Langella as Dracula and Laurence Olivier as Abraham Van Helsing shows the flaws in the book. (1) It's hard to see the Dracula in this book as anything but a monster who gets what he deserves in the end. Frank Langella makes Dracula all the more frightening by making him human and fascinating. We may not feel sorry for him, but he is more fascinating than repulsive. (2) It takes little to know that in the book, Renfield is under Dracula's power. John Badham (the director of Frank Langella's &quot;Dracula&quot;) probably realized that it would be better to give Renfield the initial appearance with Dracula to introduce us to Dracula's evil. This allows for a less obtuse John Harker. (3) Delaying John Harker's meeting Dracula offers us more surprises, a greater unfolding of terror, and allows for a more intelligent John Harker who gradually realizes the danger of Dracula. (4) Laurence Olivier keeps the eccentricities of Abraham Van Helsing, but tones them down nicely. Also, Laurence Olivier (Abraham Van Helsing) is much more convincing here since he has an axe to grind. (Dealing with the death of his beloved daughter, seeing her turned into a vampire, having to run a stake through his own daughter's heart, and having to listen to her cry: 'papa' before she is destroyed.) (5) Making Lucy (Nelligan) an eventual willing victim of Dracula who attacks her father, her possibly to be husband, and father of her recently deceased best girl friend introduces new meaning to the word terror. For the record, this is much more captivating than Mina's sudden absurd pity for Dracula. I don't see how we can go along with any sympathy for Dracula in the book. Unlike Macbeth from &quot;Macbeth&quot; or Claudius from &quot;Hamlet&quot; we were never permitted to see him as human. (6) The book has Renfield's murder off stage. (We shouldn't really have trouble knowing Dracula did it at this point.) So much is lost here. In Langella's movie, much of Langella's crimes have been offstage. There is unspeakable terror in the fact that we finally see a brutal murder on stage. Don't get me wrong. This is a good book that deserves a place in the museum of literature, and it did pave the way for Lugosi and Langella.But in all honesty, John Badham, Frank Langella, Laurence Olivier, Trevor Eve, Donald Pleasence, and Kate Nelligan outdid the book in evry sense of the word."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

But Stoker's vampire novel can still provoke some intriguing classroom discussions over the use of different first person narratives, the elements of horror, and the willinging suspension of disbelief. Given all the variations on Dracula in films, it may well be worthwhile to talk about the range of interpretation versus being faithful to an author's original vision. For some classes, this might be worth a shot and Dover makes it economically feasible."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

It is cursed with an overbearing patriarchal tone, a clear lack of character development, and apart from the initial chapters fails to explore the most ineresting of its character--Dracula. All the same, I did enjoy the overall story, and would recommend it.

Not only was the plot magnificent, the language used in the book is fabulous! The reason some people couldn't understand Bram Stoker's diction is probably because they were too busy watching Dawson's Creek while reading the book. Actually, the book is very easy to understand and follow. It is also extremely interesting and entertaining; I really hated having to put it down to sleep or eat! However, I must say that I was a little disappointed by the ending, which was just too simple.

However i feel that the book left more to be desired.The book starts off with the fascinating and many times frightening experiences of Jonathan Harker in Dracula's castle. Afterwards, however, i feel that the novel loses focus. The story line slows and focus seems to be on Lucy instead of Mina, the herione. Overall the book was good although it seems to be slow at times it is still worth the read."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Is 'Dracula,' a classic because it's really that great of a book? Or is it because of the mass influence it's had on culture? I'm going with the latter.I found it, overall, to be a pretty boring book, our glimpses of Dracula are slim, the only interesting narratives are those of Lucy & Mina, & Stoker's overwhelming message of women + sex = way too scary for any decent man to handle, is pretty annoying.So read it because it's a classic, & because without it legions of great movies & books may have never been written, but if you're looking for excitement, stop at go."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Dracula really existed. The old legend has at its core a historical figure: Vlad Tepes, the impaler, a 15th century Transylvanian nobleman noted for making kebabs out of captured Turkish soldiers.The legend of Dracula will probably outlive the works of Dickens and Tolstoy, but the life of the real Vlad Tepes -- if it could be written -- was probably more interesting than this tepid, late-Victorian novel that takes place mostly in England. The best part of the book is the first 50 pages: Jonathan Harker's journal of his visit to Transylvania and his frightening encounter with Dracula. The rest of the book could be condensed by one-half and even then it wouldn't be all that exciting or frightening.So, read the book because the story of Dracula is hugely important in popular culture -- but don't expect too much."},{"Title":"Dracula (G.

Hall (Large Print))","review":"For my own personal Halloween Treat, I listened to the L.A. Theatre Works dramatization of the one, the only, the original, prince of the night, Count Dracula.This L.A. Theatre Works dramatization is a full-cast adaptation of the Bram Stoker classic Victorian horror story, Dracula. It's absolutely perfect for anyone's holiday listening pleasure, complete with chills and thrills.We all know the story, or we think we do. And it doesn't matter. Hearing the story, with each part portrayed by an excellent actor, as was done in this production, makes the entire story fresh and new. You feel Jonathan Harker's terror as he watches helplessly when the Count's boxes of earth are packed and shipped to England. You share in Dr. Seward's and Lord Godalming's surprise, disgust and ultimate belief when Dr. Van Helsing proves to them that Lucy Westenra has, in fact, become a vampire. All while hearing only the actors' voices.The quest to solve the mystery, destroy Dracula, and save Mina, all while scouring London, and then trekking through half of eastern Europe, is painted through voices that can't help but etch themselves in your mind.Bram Stoker's Dracula is a classic for a reason. Listen to this production and you will have an absolutely marvelous time remembering the reasons why.A few personal comments about listening to the recording. If you can download this, do it. The download is currently $3.95, that's 4 bucks. The CD is $17. Talk about a holiday treat for downloading!Second comment, this initially caught my attention because of the voice actors. David Selby plays Van Helsing, Simon Templeman voices Dracula. I would have bought it for those two names alone. I used to run, not walk, home from school to watch the original Dark Shadows. Climbing into the \\"Way Back Machine\\", David Selby played Quentin Collins, the werewolf member of that rather unusual family. Hearing his voice again brought back a lot of memories.Returning to the present, I play a lot of role-playing video games, in what I refer to with some irony as my \\"copious free time\\", mostly because said free time doesn't exist. For the past two years, my video game of choice has been Dragon Age Origins and its sequels and DLCs. In Dragon Age, Simon Templeman is the voice of Loghain Mac Tir, an extremely compelling character who has listened to the darker side of his nature. Actually not unlike Dracula in some ways. Without the blood-drinking. Loghain had a henchman for that.And in case it wasn't totally obvious, Escape Rating A+."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

I was a bit unsure because I was unsuccessful with many other classics( I found pride and prejudice almost unreadable). She handed me her copy and told me to give it a try.I was pleasantly surprised. I was so pulled into their world it was hard to put the book down! The stories were so well entwined and each character so like able I was lost in with them afraid of this unknown monster!The main thing that got me was how scared I actually got . I've read and seen so many vampire genre things that I thought there was no way this old book would get to me. I was so creeped out!I definitely get how this one novel started it all!"},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"The most striking characteristic of Stoker's masterpiece is its solid grounding in late 19th-century Victorianism. This may prove frustrating to some readers. It is far from uncommon for the men in the tale to weep and bemoan the dangers threatening the virtuous ladies Lucy and Mina; virtue and innocence of women are hailed rather religiously. Mina, for her part, assumes the role then deemed proper for women, accepting and praising the men for their protection of her, worrying constantly about her husband rather than herself, shedding tears she must not let her husband see, etc. Yet, it is most interesting to see Mina rise above the circle of a woman's proscribed duties; she in fact becomes a true partner in the effort against Dracula, expressing ideas and conclusions that the men, with all of their wisdom, could not come up with themselves.Another thing I find interesting is the lack of a clear protagonist in Dracula. Technically, I suppose, Jonathon Harker is the protagonist, but Mina, Dr. Van Helsing, Dr. Seward, and the Count himself basically operate on an equal plane with him. It is Van Helsing who can be described as the anti-Dracula; he plans the moves by which he and his friends seek to thwart the Count's plans and destroy him; the second half of the novel can be compared to a chess match between two equally strong competitors. Minor characters such as the lunatic Renfield are also drawn clearly in our mind's eye by Stoker's incredible gift of characterization. While the format is unusual--the novel consisting fully of diary and journal entries by different characters--you cannot help but be drawn in closely to the group of heroic souls who pledge their very lives to one another as they take it upon themselves to combat a centuries-old evil."},{"Title":"Dracula (G.

I'm only just starting but i love this book very much."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Some of the more supernatural elements of Dracula---bats flapping against windows, his ability to control and turn into mist, etc.---strike today's reader as rather more silly than terrifying. Stoker seems aware of this, as he includes a lot of nonsense to the effect that there are things of which science is not aware, and we can only rely on faith and tradition in dealing with them. Still, Dracula is in my experience of higher literary quality than the vast majority of the many vampire novels that have come since, even those that downplay or at least try to explain the supernatural aspects of vampire mythology.There are several interesting characters here, including, of course, Van Helsing, and also the Texan Quincey Morris (who was absent from all of the adaptations I'd encountered before actually reading the original novel), but particularly Mina Harker, who in some respects is almost a sort of proto-feminist character. And the scenes with Renfield in Seward's insane asylum are genuinely creepy.John Lee's narration in this audio edition isn't his best work, but he's almost always worth listening to, and his voice is well suited to the material.Three and a half stars."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"I've read soooooo many books glorifying vampirism, that is was kind of nice to read one that portrayed them for what/who they really are: undead minions of the devil that feast on human blood. This book was undeniably gruesome in a completely entertaining way. I so engulfed with the horror of it all I couldn't turn away from it!!Because the story is told from so many perspectives, I was more than a little confused at the beginning as to how all of them were going to connect. Renfield's connection to the story was the most confusing for me. I just couldn't figure out what he was and what was his connection to Dracula. I was also a little disappointed to find out that his connection was so trite. I was speculating that he was a werewolf (or possibly even a vampire) as he seems to have an extensive knowledge of what the Count is up to and I was slightly disappointed to find out exactly how little he was involved. Granted, his involvement GREATLY affected Mina as well as the plot for the remaining portion of the book. Personally, I was just a little let down as I was expecting something more than what I got. I was also a little disappointed in Dracula's ultimate demise. There was just so much build up in his evading their plot to eradicate him, that the actual act seemed a little underdeveloped. To me, it just didn't feel like it was really over.....Having said that, this book was chilling!! I actually had to stop reading it before bed because I kept having nightmares of the \`Bloofer Lady' feeding on all the little children in town. Jonathan, Mina, and Lucy's involvements with the Count are nothing short of gruesome. Even more so by the fact that don't actually use the word \`vampire' until about half way through the book (even though they have their suspicions). The book is a bit slow in places, but the plot is well written and incredibly entertaining. A total classic for a reason!!"},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

Hall (Large Print))","review":"To some people reading may be a chore, but to others, like myself, it is a way to get away from life and enter a new one. Reading is more than picking up a book, reading the content and then putting it away for months at a time. When you walk into a book store, you venture off to the section where your favorite authors or genres are in order to satisfy your individual tastes. When I walk into a book store the first place I go is to the classics and then the gothic/vampire based novels. With Dracula I got the best of both worlds.Dracula was written by Bram Stoker, and was basically about a young man whose ignorance gets him caught up in some very sticky situations. When he goes to the very picturesque countryside of Transylvania to meet up with noble man Count Dracula, he realizes that what you hear as horror stories aren't stories, they are real. The book to a very simplistic reader may seem difficult to read, due to there being a difference in dialect. The way Stokers' characters articulate themselves as well may not be easy to comprehend the first time either. Other than those minor things the book is a very smooth read. I would recommend this to anyone who loves those gothic/mythic novels, and to those who like to just keep turning the page."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

Not sure if there were typos in the conversionof the book to kindle but there were many points where it didnt read very smoothly."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Dracula proves to be a bit of a surprise. Surely there are moments that are gruesome, creepy, or both. But the writing is wonderful, and the book takes on aspects of fine character development and the 'mystery' of hunting down a formidable foe. The pervasive good against evil theme is handled well and is there throughout. Everyone thinks he or she knows Dracula, and while most common knowledge is fair, knowing it in no way interferes with enjoying this fine work. The characters on the good side against THE evil are not so well known, but well drawn, particularly Dr. Van Helsing and Mina, who serves an integral role in the story as well as being the romantic interest of opening character Jonathan Harker. Jonathan, an English solicitor is sent to Transylvania by his boss to facilitate the client's purchase and move to London. The client proves to be eccentric from the first, but Stoker makes Jonathan's time in the castle slowly terrifying. Without going into further plot development, it's well-paced and clearly written. I am grateful for the ease of access to the references that my e-reader provided since some of the accents of characters or Latin phrases led me to the references to understand them better. I'm impressed with Stoker's writing; one notably strong part being the way he writes accents where appropriate, particularly the English-fluent, but second language man, Dr. Van Helsing. I've already located a couple of Stoker's other books to try. A thoroughly enjoyable book to read (in spite of its being a classic!)."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"I'll warn you, \\"Dracula\\" is not an easy read. That being said, you can easily navigate the more antiquated words through using the dictionary on your Kindle or through using context. Aside from that, the plot is wonderful, as is the premise. This book is writing entirely through correspondance or personal diaries of the characters directly involved. What emerges from this correspondance is a haunting, twisted tale of a Dracula that many have lost sight of as a result of pop culture.Indeed, when comparing the pop culture Dracula with that of Stoker's elderly (sort of), wolfish Count, I tend to be more afraid of the latter. Throughout the book, Dracula manifests himself over and over as a force affecting the lives of the young men and women in the story. When Van Helsing makes an appearance, pop culture would lead you to believe there will be an instant climax and conclusion: this is not the case.Finally, for a free e-book, the prose is well-worth the read alone. In particular, I loved the following:-\\"I read that every known superstition in the world is gathered into the horseshoe of the Carpathians, as if it were the centre of some sort of imaginative whirlpool; if so my stay may be very interesting.\\"-\\"There was one great tomb more lordly than all the rest; huge it was, and nobly proportioned.

I had never sat down to read the book. Now that I have an eBook reader on my iPhone and iPad (and Android), I took the opportunity to download this book. To say it's engrossing is an understatement. Stoker's eloquent use of the English language is so evocative, and actually quite beautiful at times. There is no gore or ugliness, in fact, it makes you realize how much liberty Hollywood took (surprise...NOT!) in making the films. I truly think this is one of the masterpieces of English-language literature."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

The creepiness of Dracula and his castle; the tenseness of the race against time, and the sun; and the vividness of the characters make this story unforgettable. Mr. Stoker's writing style of first hand accounts from various characters adds to the depth and descriptiveness of the book and provides its own suspense, since you don't know who will be alive to write the last chapter.

Hall (Large Print))","review":"Written in 1897, Bram Stoker's Dracula is a classic of fiction, fascinating for its subject matter and still the subject of films a hundred years later. Count Dracula, the epitome of evil, is exotic enough to keep even the most jaded reader of his exploits interested in their outcome, and grounded enough in the reality of evil to make even doubters wonder whether evil can be transmitted from one person to another against one's will.The novel begins with the arrival of Jonathan Harker, a lawyer representing a London real estate agency, at the Transylvanian castle of Count Dracula to clinch the deal by which the count will move to a British estate. Details about Harker's arrival by coach, his greeting at the castle, which has no doors except the front door, his reception by the count (who has hair on the palms of his hands), and his instructions regarding where he may go or not go within the castle set the tone and establish the mysterious background of the count and a sense of dread regarding the outcome for Harker.By the time that Harker recovers from a long and mysterious illness and returns home, the count, already in London, has turned Lucy, a lovely ingenue, into a vampire. Dr. Van Helsing, a German expert on vampires hired by her family, saves her several times from what appears to be severe anemia and recommends ringing her room with garlic and making sure that she has crucifixes around her. When Dracula then turns his blood-thirsty attention to Mina, fianc&eacute;e of Jonathan Harker and friend of the unfortunate Lucy, the scene is set for a showdown regarding Dracula's power vs. the power of goodness and traditional religion.Stoker takes his story beyond sheer melodrama, eliciting sympathy for the afflicted victims of Dracula while also recreating the religious atmosphere of the period and the beliefs and doubts of average citizens. The novel is far more compelling than I expected, creating suspense at the same time that it develops the character of the count with his supernatural powers. The climax in which the forces of good are ranged against the forces of evil in the shape of the count, whose long history is detailed in the novel, is truly a conflict between traditional religion and evil in the form of Satan personified. Fun to read and surprisingly affecting.

While some modern readers may have difficulty with the late 19th-century writing style, the novel itself is a rewarding experience for anyone willing to consider the work, and the use of language should not be held against its brilliance.Though not the first word in vampire literature and mythology, Stoker's novel is, in a way, the last word - and one very much so worth reading."},{"Title":"Dracula (G.

Even now, it is possible to understand the enthusiatic response of contemporary readers to his sensational tale of \\"the Undead\\" and the hardy souls who take on the eponymous Count. From the chilling opening in the Carpathians, Stoker relates his grimly fascinating tale mainly through diary extracts, also managing the tricky task of creating authentically different narrative voices. Add to the equation some masterful prose, a relentless pace and some genuinely shocking moments and the result is a novel that genuinely deserves the title of \\"classic\\"."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"The fact that Bram Stoker's \\"Dracula\\" was published in 1897, and it still holds its own in today's Hollywood style, glitz, glam, and sanguinity is utterly amazing. You will find that this is the most original piece of literary work ever published.In the past, others have tried to copy his eclectic style, but in the end they've always miserably failed. Why is this you may ask?Well, because most other authors never really explore their characters psyche, which was something Stoker mastered, especially in this book. In Stoker's story the narrative arrangements are a series of journals, letters, and diaries written by his characters.Stoker allows you to witness the story unfolding through their eyes. This method allows the story to move rapidly.In chronicling the story in this fashion the reader will envision, and feel as though he or she is apart of the story.It is interesting to note that even though the Dracula character is the antagonist he is relegated into a background character, and even if this concept escapes some people. You'll have to admit this method works extremely well in this tale of the macabre.Van Helsing, Dr Seward, and Mina Murray Harker are all characters everyone is familiar with and there are dozens of movies that tried to recreate the milieu of Stokers story, but you'll never find a better version than the original.The plot everyone knows so I don't see the point in rehashing it here. Besides the best thing is to order your copy today because you'll be in for a real treat.4 stars."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Though it had been made in to multiple movies and changed into other forms of media, Dracula's characters and the evident Victorianism makes it one the greatest horror novels ever written. It does move slowly at times and the ending is anticlimactic but the good outweighs the bad in Bram Stoker's classic novel.There are many \\"good-guys\\" in Dracula but there is never a true apparent protagonist and this does anything but detract from the story. Jonathon Harker does seem like the intended protagonist but Mina, Van Helsing, and Dr. Seward could all be put on the same level as well. In fact it is Van Helsing who makes the plans to try and destroy Dracula. The way the book was written (diary and journal entries) the reader is drawn closely to the group of heroes who pledge there lives to one another to fight an evil they all wish to destroy.Also the elements of Victorianism are seen through out the masterpiece. Stoker is able to maintain the characteristics of the era while still writing a horror novel. Mina is able to rise above what women were expected to be able to do and \\"play with the big boys.\\" She plays a vital role in the fight against Dracula proving that even with men and all their wisdom, sometimes it takes a women's mind to come up with ideas and conclusions that the men had not thought of.Though it is a bit gruesome, slow, and anticlimactic at times, Bram Stoker's Dracula is a masterpiece for the ages."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Surprisingly \\"Denn die Toten reiten schnell\\" or \\"For the dead travel fast\\" is more than an opening line to this tale of love in the dangerous moon light. After watching several Drac movies and a few Nosferatu's, I pretty much though I had a handle on the genera. Little did I know what a wonderful world of mystery and suspense that Bram Stoker opened up for me.The story is told mostly third party though the papers, diaries, and phonograph recordings (on wax calendars) of those people involve in a tale so bizarre that it almost defies belief. The general story line is that of a Count that plans to move to a more urban setting (from Borgo Pass to London) where there is a richer diet. There he finds succulent women; something he can sing his teeth in. Unfortunately for him a gang of ruffians (including a real-estate agent, asylum director, Texas cowboy and an Old Dutch abnormal psychologist) is out to detour his nocturnal munching. They think they have Drac on the run but with a wing and a prayer he is always one step ahead.Of more value to the reader is the rich prose chosen by Stoker as he describes the morals and technology of the time. We have to come to grips with or decide if we can perform the rituals that are required to eliminate vampires verses the impropriety of opening graves and staking loved ones. The powers in the book differ from the movie versions in that they are more of persuasion and capabilities to manipulate the local weather. At one point the Dutch Dr. Van Helsing, is so overwhelmed by a beautiful vampire laying in the grave that he almost for gets why he is there and may become vamp chow.All in all the story is more in the cunning chase. And the question as to will they succeed or will Dracula triumph. Remember \\"For the dead travel fast.\\""},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

As a matter of fact, I used to keep a journal, in homage to the characters in the book. The movies about Dracula had never done Stoker's book proud - with deference to Bela Lugosi - until Coppolla's Bram Stoker's Dracula - this book is mesmerizing, taut, frightening. And if you are like me, will bring it out every so often and enjoy the experience all over again.Kostova's Dracula is worthy of Stoker - still keep looking around for a notebook with a dragon burned into the cover...Read Dracula - it is the classic of classics."},{"Title":"Dracula (G.

I had to look a few words up but so what I expanded my vocabulary a bit. If your not sure just go to a book store and turn a few pages. If you like spooky stories about vampires and the like you'll enjoy this book. One thing I have to say is that I saw the movie first (the one with Gary Oldman titled same as the book) and I actually liked the movie more than the book.

K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"\\"Dracula\\" was not the first vampire novel, nor was it Bram Stoker's first book. But after years of research, Stoker managed to craft the ultimate vampire novel, which has spawned countless movies, spinoffs, and books that follow the blueprint of the Transylvanian count.Real estate agent Jonathan Harker arrives in Transylvania, to arrange a London house sale to Count Dracula. But as the days go by, Harker witnesses increasingly horrific events, leading him to believe that Dracula is not actually human. His fiancee Mina arrives in Transylvania, and finds that he has been feverish. Meanwhile the count has vanished.And soon afterwards, strange things happen: a ship piloted by a dead man crashes on the shore, after a mysterious thing killed the crew. A lunatic talks about \\"Him\\" coming. And Mina's pal Lucy dies of mysterious blood loss, only to come back as an undead seductress. Dracula has arrived in England -- and he's not going to be stopped easily.\\"Dracula\\" is the grandaddy is Lestat and Jean-Claude, but that isn't the sole reason why it is a classic. It's also incredibly atmospheric, and very well-written. Not only is it very freaky, in an ornate Victorian style, but it is also full of restrained, quiet horror and creepy eroticism. What's more, it's shaped the portrayal of vampires in movies and books, even to this day.Despite already knowing what's going on for the first half of the book, it's actually kind of creepy to see these people whose lives are being disrupted by Dracula, but don't know about vampires. It's a bit tempting to yell \\"It's a vampire, you idiots!\\" every now and then, but you can't really blame them. Then the second half kicks in, with accented professor Van Helsing taking our heroes on a quest to save Mina from Dracula.And along the way, while our heroes try to figure stuff out, Stoker spins up all these creepy hints of Dracula's arrival. Though he wrote in the late 19th-century manner, very verbose and a bit stuffy, his skill shines through. The book is crammed with intense, evocative language, with moments like Dracula creeping down a wall, or the dead captain found tied to the wheel. Once read, they stick in your mind throughout the book.It's also a credit to Stoker that he keeps his characters from seeming like idiots or freaks, which they could have easily seemed like. Instead, he puts little moments of humanity in them, like Van Helsing admitting that his wife is in an asylum. Even the letters and diaries are written in different styles; for example, Seward's is restrained and analytical, while Mina's is exuberant and bright.Intelligent, frightening and very well-written, \\"Dracula\\" is the well-deserved godfather of all modern vampire books and movies -- and arguably among the best."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Actually Dracula does not need a lot of explanation. Everybody must have experienced at least once the myth of Count Dracula in any form: film, television or book. No character has ever ignited so much imagination than the Chief Vampire of Transylvania. It is absolutely no surprise that this book is still read by thousands of people worldwide.The narrative unfolds itself by combining letters, newspaper clippings, journal entries and even phonograph records. This certainly adds to the mysterious atmosphere that dominates the first half of the book, but turns a bit against the story when the action really starts. Simply by reading a letter written by Miss Mina Murray, you are already informed that Mina will survive the struggle described by her. Technically this method also puts extra constraints on the author. Knowing this, it is fun to see how many tricks Stoker needed to keep the flow of letters going. At one point in the story he has to send Doctor Van Helsing back home, just so he can respond with a letter. Of course, it would have been quite silly to have two people writing each other letters while they are living in the same house.The story itself is very powerful, but to modern readers it is often perceived as being dense and overcrowded with details. This is typical to Victorian novels, in which the women are always tender and caring and the men brave and intelligent. It seems that these conclusions have to be underlined on every page of the book. Still Bram Stoker succeeds in winning the attention of the reader by supplying an unprecedented richness to the story. The plot is filled with unexpected twists, remarkable action sequences and rather eerie -sometimes almost erotic- confrontations with evil entities. No situation is left unused to heighten the mystery. Even for the spoiled modern reader, some lugubrious scenes can still be experienced as hair-raising; a treat that most modern novels can't claim so easily.Keeping in mind that this is a typical Victorian extravaganza and that the story suffers a bit under its form, one can but only admit that Dracula must be \`the' classic vampire novel. Although there is a lot of \`derived' work on the market, no one can truly claim to know the legend of Dracula without having read Bram Stoker's novel."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"I was in the library the other day, and I overheard a group of 30-40-something women discussing Bram Stoker's Dracula. The conversation went something like this:Woman One: \\"I've been thinking about reading Dracula. I'm just not sure it will live up to my 'Twilight'-standards.\\"Woman Two: \\"Oh god, don't do it! There's like no love story at all. And it's really hard to read.\\"Woman Three: \\"It's in like Old English or something. Might as well be Arabic.\\"Woman One: \\"Are there werewolves?\\"Woman Two: \\"Hardly any!\\"Woman One: \\"Ugh! Nevermind!\\"At this point I had to excuse myself from the building before exploding a storm of literary justice on these women.What I'm getting at is this:If you want something more challenging to read than the back of a cereal box, please, give this fantastic book a try. It will push you, but it's absolutely worth it. If you \\"omg looooooooooooved Twilight,\\" this probably isn't the book for you. If you, however, have the reading competency level higher than the average third-grader, I suggest you take the challenge.It's a thrilling tale and Stoker's use of the letters/diaries makes the story dramatic by allowing tension to build throughout the entire novel.Oh, and Mina Harker could absolutely kick Bella Swan's angsty teenage butt."},{"Title":"Dracula (G.

It seems almost like this is one of those attempts to write old literature in a fashion more appropriate for \\"young adult\\" readers. Even if this is the case (and there is absolutely no indication judging by the cover or the contents leading up to the first chapter that this is true), the problem is that this is edited badly... very very badly.

There is a reason this one is so cheap."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

Hall (Large Print))","review":"First let me say, I bought this book because it is a collectable book. I wanted to place it in the bookshelf next to my other fancy books. The first one I got, was shoved in a small box, had all these marks on it, and looked like it was dropped on the corner end, had to send it back. Poor packaging. The second came packaged the same way, but there was no visible marks (at least ones you couldn't see from a far).Onto the book.Excellent, well detailed color. The binging is nice and tight, the red leaf colored edge papers make the book really \\"hot\\" looking. The felt material book mark, is a nice touch to the book, and makes it feel special when you read it. The book pages turn nicely, and they pages are thick enough, not to have to worry about ripping a page when reading it.So the book is great, anyone that loves this book, should pick it up. I just hope your warehouse sends you a nice copy."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"Dracula was written a century ago, and it would be difficult to find someone who doesn't know of the books prominence. Having said that, my review is tailored to this edition of the classic. I chose this edition because it's not annotated and its not abridged, meaning you see the text as it was originally written by Bram Stoker.The Books construction is of high quality material, the paper is thick ivory, and it includes a built in ribbon place mark. The typography is classy as well as easy on the eyes. I was also surprised by the illustrations included in the book, which were done by Scott McKowen. The illustrations are appropriately placed, and no so numerous to make you think you're reading a children's edition.I haven't detected any spelling or obvious grammatical errors either. While the book isn't laden with annotations, the publisher was kind enough to occasionally include definitions in the footnotes of various pages. This is very helpful and greatly reduces the need to search for an Old English/Scottish dictionary. However, to minimize the effect, the publisher doesn't do this too often and it's easily overlooked.Overall, I'm immensely impressed with both the quality of this edition and the price, which makes it a steal. Out of the numerous editions I've read from public libraries, this is by far the best I've seen. At less than $10, there's no reason not to own this beautiful print of Bram Stokers classic.EDIT:If you're willing to spend an extra $10, the Barnes and Noble Leatherbound Classic's edition of Dracula is the most beautiful print of Dracula currently in production. If you're on a budget, the $9.99 Sterling Classics edition is a great choice, but if you want something that will attract you to your book shelf then head on over to bn.com and check out the Leatherbound Classic edition."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"This makes the third time I've read Dracula, and the third time that I've had to force my way through the middle half of the book. The story itself is very good, and it's easy for the reader to be swept up in Stoker's descriptions of the country where Dracula comes from. It can be VERY creepy at times, especially at the first and near the end, and contrary to some of the reviews I've read, the ending is not a letdown at all. I also liked Stoker's use of the characters' diaries and journals to form most of the story.Unfortunately, everything that's good about this book bogs down in the middle. Stoker cripples all the main characters (especially the men) except for Dracula and Renfield by giving them suffocatingly melodramatic dialogue and actions. They constantly break down in emotive overload and take a third to a half a page to say things that could be said in three sentences; Victorian writing style or not, there's only so much weeping and group hugging I can handle. Stoker could have easily cut enough unnecessary dialogue out of the book to shrink it by a third and not harmed it in the least. Fortunately, the perspective of the diary/journal entries changes frequently and keeps the story moving at a suitable pace.Final verdict: For a spooky yarn to keep you awake through a dark night, Dracula's a good choice. Just be aware of the pitfalls before you take the plunge."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"My first book read on my new Kindle... I could not put it down!

Hall (Large Print))","review":"Dracula, by Bram Stoker, is a well-thought out, complex novel that leaves the reader page-turning into the late hours of the night. The author's use of imagery and detail make the novel complete and help to further the reader's understanding. The style in which the book is written, which is called epistolary, is hard to comprehend at first, but it eventually grows on the reader and it becomes easy to interpret. Dracula, a vampire who has lived through centuries, is the main character, and throughout his pursuit of people to feed on, he runs into many people who are looking to destroy him and put a stop to all of the havoc he has brought to their lives. The fight against evil is displayed throughout the novel and the obstacles that are overcome by the characters take an immense amount of bravery and strength. One of those obstacles is the destruction of Count Dracula. The success in overcoming this obstacle lies with Professor Abraham Van Helsing, Dr. Jack Seward, Arthur Holmwood, Quincey P. Morris, and Jonathan Harker. These five men team together to save Jonathan's wife, Wilhemina Harker, from the evil Count Dracula. They have to save her before the same thing that happened to Lucy Westenra, her best friend, happens to her..........."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"4. I thought this book was fantastic. Unlike the other books, this one was hard to put down. The best part was how you could see each characters point of view by reading their diary entries. It gave details about everything so not one part was confusing. Renfield, Dr. Seward's patient and Bram Stoker's genius, was my favorite character. His confusing moods hinted you on to something, but then totally threw you off. This intrigued me greatly. Despite this, there were a few things I didn't agree with. The first one was I didn't like that Stoker did not describe Jonathan Harker's escape from Dracula's castle. It would have been better if you could see the tension and excitement in escaping from the Count. Secondly, a minor difficulty was how they talked in Old English and not proper English. Not proper English has a good example on page 349 a worker says, \\"Why \`e took up \`is end o' boxes like they was pounds of tea.\\" It was a bit confusing, but it made the story more frightening and Gothic. After a while, I got the hang of reading it."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"I loved this book! I think it was a well-told tale of the battle of good and evil. The story was interesting and very engrossing for me. I think &quot;Dracula&quot; touched on the sensuality of vampires in an interesting way. Since Stoker couldn't write about sex in his book during his time, he did it creatively, through the way the vampire drank the blood of the women he desired. It's a classic novel, which is why I think it's been the sole influence on how we view the vampire today, and why it will be around for a long time."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

Throughout the entire book, I was having the feeling that I was actually seeing the events in the book firsthand instead of reading about them. The detail and the continuity were la creme de la creme, and Bram Stoker's decision to write this book as a series of letters and diary entries was a good one. Overall, I cannot say that there was anything wrong with this suspenseful and frightening book. If you like this book, read Mary Shelley's &quot;Frankenstein.&quot;"},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

Hall (Large Print))","review":"Dracula is one of the best horror novels ever written. Back when it was first published in 1897, it must have been truly terrifying to it's first readers. I was shocked, to say the least, that I was somewhat disturbed in reading it's pages. The first fifty or so pages define what is true classic horror. After that it slows down for a while, but when the Count lands in England, the story just takes off. While it me a while to get used to the journal and diary style of writing, Stoker made it a focus that this element was crucial in the later part of the novel. I hear most people say that Francis Ford Coppola's film version is the most accurate in following the novel. If that is true, then I must say that all Dracula films made so far are very pathetic attempts to capture the essence of Stoker's novel. I saw Coppola's film the same day of finishing the novel, and I felt like breaking the TV. It was blasphemy. However, the only part of the novel that I didn't like was the final showdown, and that's the main reason I didn't give five stars. I'll leave it to readers and see if they agree with me or not. I can't of many literary figures that have had such an impact on popular culture as Dracula. The horrible movies of him, other vampire movies, scary movies in general, the Castlevania series, halloween, Buffy, and countless other things I can't think of right now; all own at least some thanks to him. I'm sure professional writers everywhere will just die with ectasy if one their own characters reach the status that Dracula has. Dracula earned his position with just cause; it's to bad that Stoker did not live to see the full influence that his brainchild has. I heard that he died a miserable man. If you really want to know why Dracula is so popular, turn off your TV, sit down somewhere, and fire up your imagination with this masterpiece. Dracula is truly someone who will remain undead for a long time to come. Happy Horrors! =)"},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

Although, the beginning is somewhat slow, as well as some parts towards the middle, if you keep reading, you will realize that these parts are important to help you understand the rest. Dracula being an awesome villin, and the other characters being so good hearted, I found it a joy to read. I definately reccomend it. Some of my other favorites are, Subterranean, Carrie, The Shining, and To Kill a Mockingbird(which is nothing like Dracula, but a goodie all the same)."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print))","review":"This is an interesting book for anyone, no matter if you are interested in horror or not. There are many different interpretations of the meaning of this story, but I like to think of it as the &quot;dark side&quot; of Victorian literature. It is also interesting to point out the many erotic overtones in the book. As for the story itself, it drags a bit, and though it is genuinely creepy in some parts, the ending is so quick that everything is wrapped up in two pages, with a &quot;happily ever after&quot;-type ending that has Van Helsing bouncing Mina and Jonathan's child on his knee. However, though the book does have its faults, it is still a classic novel of English literature and should not necessarily be classified as &quot;horror fiction&quot; when there is a lot more there to be discussed."},{"Title":"Dracula (G.

I would recommend everyone to read this book. It has a wonderful storyline that doesn't bore you for a minute and always keeps in suspense. I can guarantee that readers of this book will not even skip over one word. This is a very long book, yet I wish it were longer.The story is about a man named Jonathan Harker, who meets with Dracula, but soon realizes Dracula's devilish ways. Later on, Jonathan and a cast of friends go on a quest to kill Dracula before he can get away. The entire book is written as the journal entries and letters of Jonathan, Mina Harker, Dr. Seward, and others. This style of writing gives a new way of reading that is sure to please you.

Hall (Large Print))","review":"Dracula is the story everyone knows, but few have read. If you have seen any of its film adaptations or imitators, you should read this short novel to re-set your expectations. The depths of psychological exploration into the Count's motives, history, methods, and tradition are unmatched elsewhere. This is a rare example of a writer creating a dark fantasy which sets the metaphysical rules for an entire literary universe. [If you love a short review, stop here - the remaining commentary is extraneous to your purpose.]The plot is well-known and does not bear repeating here. However, it is worth mentioning liberties taken by various adaptations not included in the book. Mina Harker is never likened to the Count's deceased love; sunlight does not kill him; Renfield is not his servant; and no one ever says \\"I vant to suck your blood.\\" The absence of these tropes forces the novel into subtle territory regarding motives and action, ultimately yielding a richer story than I initially expected.Two major shifts in the narrative are instrumental in raising the novel above predecessors such as \\"The Vampyre,\\" \\"Carmilla,\\" and \\"Varney the Vampire.\\" The first is the change in protagonist from Dracula to van Helsing, a shift which creates a mechanism to propel the narrative from start to finish. Whereas the Count's early scenes set the story in motion, it is the professor's later involvement and analysis which govern the other characters' actions and propel the remainder of the story. The second major shift is the change in victim from Lucy to Mina, which provides a psychological underpinning to the novel and raises it above genre fiction. Whereas Lucy's passivity and lifelong subjection to flattery allows the initial vampiric attack to unfold, it is Mina's position as an independent, \\"new woman\\" which establishes a strength of character necessary as a rallying point for the remaining characters. Without it, the story is about protecting helpless women and avenging loved ones. With it, the story is about the will to live, redemption, and honor.The strength of the book lies in its originality and genre development rather than literary merits tied to prose and character development. There are definite drawbacks, such as Dr. Van Helsing's pidgin English and inconsistent character development (there is a good reason why Quincey and Arthur are often left out of movie adaptations). However, it is superior to most of the works following in its wake and is entertaining in the extreme. I recommend this highly to anyone interested in works of horror, suspense, or psychological fiction."},{"Title":"Dracula (G. K.

Hall (Large Print))","review":"That Hollywood hasn't scratched the surface of the depth of Dracula's evil is a true testament to the stridence of this piece of great literature. Stoker's novel paints a much more brutal and erudite picture of Dracula than the movies have ever managed. Perhaps because, for some lowbrow pop culture reason, vampires are regarded as vessels of fashion first, at the expense of their potential menace and depth. We're more likely to see washboard stomachs and deep tans than we are to see anything resembling the eerily esoteric Count. Perhaps Stoker's character is simply too mysterious to be duplicated on screen, or perhaps Hollywood is too illiterate, or both.For the uninitiated, the novel's surmounting terror lurches forward in the past tense, as told through correspondence. Steven King and William Peter Blatty have undoubtedly drawn much inspiration from this, as implied horror is most often the most horrifying of all. Readers might find some other stories more frightening, but they'd be hard-pressed to find anything more genuinely creepy. Dracula's evil might surprise even fans of the film genre.

Hall (Large Print))","review":"Bram Stoker's \\"Dracula\\" was first published in 1897, and as one reads this work, it is overwhelmingly apparent that it was written during a time when morals and virtues were held in a much higher regard than they are today.The book is comprised primarily of various journal entries from six main characters. Two of these main characters are remarkable women, possessed of lofty talent and high moral character. It is when both of these women encounter Count Dracula himself and fall under his poisonous and deathly spell that the remaining main characters in the book--all courageous and gifted and accomplished men--spring to the aid of these women.I, for one, loved the old fashioned language, the rigid formality and courtesy, and the unyielding respect that the main characters demonstrated in their interactions with one another. Chivalry was certainly not dead in 1897, if one were to use this book as evidence. The graciousness and loyalty that the men in this book showed the women is inspiring, and the moral refinement and sensibilities of the women characters caused me to yearn for an older time, away from the immorality and crudeness apparent in today's society.I had to smile at one point when reading the book when the two main women characters found themselves out late at night after a frightening experience. They were both in their full-length bedclothes, which apparently covered every part of their bodies but their bare feet. One of the women, not wanting to appear immodest dabbed mud on their bare feet so as not to offend anyone who might see those exposed parts.This book is filled with suspense and plausibly thrilling episodes. It stands as a wonderful classic of good-natured fright, which proves that tension and drama and expectation may be created in a work of fiction without all of the offending elements of bloody violence, gore, vulgarity, sex, and devilishness thrown into the mix. Its ending is noble, with at least one of the main characters revealing remarkable compassion when she sees the look on Count Dracula's face during the final decisive scene in the book. This book was a pleasant surprise, as I wasn't suspecting a work of such high literary value from a \\"horror\\" novel.

It contains writings by Bataille that were published separately in a surrealist type group's periodical which is fantastic when put together here. From A to Z Bataille defines in a dictionary/encyclopedic type style various terms, objects, actions, and in this format really grabs a reader by his perspective and YANKS, turns ya around to see things differently than you could've ever imagined. There's much more than that though, other writing, including an introduction that mentions Bataille's attempt at creating a secret society. A great book to not just read, BUT TO OWN, whether a frequent reader of Bataille or as just a curious soul. &quot;Acephale&quot;, by the way, means without head, and as you might know: Decapitation is really in these days so buying this Book will make you cool."},{"Title":"You Can Forgive a Cheating Spouse: One Woman's Triumph from a Perishing Marriage","review":"I read this story and It really blew me away....This book is an awesome testimony and has really taught me how to forgive......Get it and read it and you to will be Blessed.....!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Whose Reality Counts?: Putting the First Last","review":"While it might be premature to give full comment on this book because I am yet to read it all up.

Read them for yourself. They're all here in this book. Do you believe prayer has been banned from public schools? Think again. Read the 1962 and 1963 school prayer decisions in this book. You may be surprised when you learn that only government-sponsored, mandatory prayer and Bible reading has been removed. Truly voluntary prayer has always been legal and still is.

But there is one caveat. The reviewer noted that the book gave only a sentence to the case &quot;Edwards v. Aguillard&quot; On pages 219-231 that case is, in fact, presented, including the Scalia dissent."},{"Title":"CONSTITUTION & RELIGION","review":"This is an excellent reference work providing the reader with the actual text of Supreme Court decisions involving the first amendment and religion. The majority opinion and dissenting opinion(s) are presented with occasional abridgement. Most of these cases fall in three main categories:1. Support to religious schools 2. Religion in public schools 3. Restrictions on the free exercise of one's religionThe editor, Mr. Alley, provides no critique of the Supreme Court's action in these matters, so one doesn't actually critique the book in the normal sense. What the Court has written, it has written. My only disappointment was in finding that a brief summary was sometimes presented in lieu of any Court opinions. Mr. Alley undoubtedly had book size restrictions to consider (the book is 545 pages long), and presumably he gave short shrift to cases that were less (in his opinion) important, or were based significantly on reasoning established in prior cases.As an example, I have a strong interest in the creationist vs. evolution controversy. The Epperson vs. Arkansas case concerning teaching creationism in public schools was presented in a half page summary. A similar case involving a state law in Louisiana, Edwards vs. Aguillard, was dismissed in one sentence.In balance, however, it's a great reference book. I can see that this would be an outstanding resource for students writing term papers on the subject of the first amendment and religion."},{"Title":"The Judas Field: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read.

I had read Black Flower a few years ago, and absoluetly loved it. The Judas Field is most certainly on par.His novels on the Civil War reach far beyond the battlefields themselves. He truly has a strong grasp on the psyches of those who lived and fought this war. And his ability to paint the southern landscape is breathtaking at times.His characters are true grit, with incredible depth.While he has written three, on topic, this is only the second I have read. I will most definetly be going back for the third.If not for authors such as Bahr, I'd unlikely read very much fiction at all."},{"Title":"The Judas Field: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"Another solid book from Howard Bahr but when your first novel (Black Flower)is by far your best, I guess all subsequent novels are bound to disappoint.

I would have rated it four stars if not for the cursing. I will read no further books by Howard Bahr."},{"Title":"The Judas Field: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"Magnificent! Mr. Bahr has written a wonderful, poignant, personal view of how the brutality of the Civil War affected those that lived it. War is the ultimate of human endeavors; those who have been embraced by it are changed forever. Brutality on a grand scale that brings into question the essence of the human condition. Mr. Bahr reaches into the very soul of those who have witnessed the carnage and examines how their lives are changed forever. His character development was superb. His use of the pervasive darkness of that era was stunning in its portrayal. Men fought and died not for their nation but for their beliefs in their fellow comrades. Mr. Bahr is a genius at putting into words the timeless love of men and women who lived those desperate hours. War is terrible but man's belief in himself and those who he fights beside transcends the violence of the battlefield.I highly recommend this classic novel for anyone who wants to briefly glimpse what it is like to taste, hear, smell, and feel the horrors of the battlefield. No gratuitous violence, although the graphic nature of battle is portrayed in all its ugliness. Mr. Bahr's trilogy of the civil war is the best I have ever read on how those that lived it, dealt with its horrors. He is a master at showing how the glories of the battlefield scared an entire generation for years after the guns went silent. A must read."},{"Title":"The Judas Field: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"Daniel Aaron, in The Unwritten War, lamented that the Civil War never produced a great work of fiction until, possibly, William Faulkner's works. If anyone ever updates that book, the author may come to a happier conclusion with the works of Howard Bahr. Lost in the clamor over Charles Frazier's Cold Mountain, Bahr's novel of the Battle of Franklin, The Black Flower--published the same year as Frazier's fine book--was a taut, beautiful tale that I have recommended to readers for years as the best Civil War novel I know. The excellent follow-up book, The Year of Jubilo, carried the story of Yalobusha County's Confederate sons forward to Reconstruction. Now comes The Judas Field, proving that Bahr is not just our greatest Civil War novelist, but one of our greatest modern novelists, period. Others describe the particulars of the story below, so there is no need for me to do that here. Suffice it to say that with this book, Bahr's fictional world, stretching from Mississippi to the cotton gin at Franklin, is beginning to resemble Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha. This body of work deserves ten stars."},{"Title":"The Judas Field: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"Not a necessarily a civil war buff, I had to be encouraged to read this book on its literary merit versus content. As a result,an absolutely beautifully written novel was discovered. The horrors and atrocities of the Civil War are well done but not necessarily for shock value. Bahr's character development and ability to portray the postwar southern landscape are superb. The last 100 pages have to be one of the best pieces of southern fiction - or any fiction - written in recent years.Lamar Nesbit, Jackson, MS"},{"Title":"The Judas Field: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"I had read Howard Bahr's \\"Black Flower\\" and \\"Year of Jubilo\\" and liked both. \\"The Judas Field\\", however is a literary leap. This is the story of Cass and Lucian Wakefield and their return to the site of the Battle of Franklin Tennessee twenty years after the fact to recover the remains of a friend's brother and father. Along the way Mr. Bahr tells the story of this and other engagements and the fate of several characters. He writes beautifully, and his descriptions of the horrors of war are gripping. Most of all, his treatment of the spirits of the dead sets this work apart from other great Civil War novels. \\"Killer Angels\\" and \\"Cold Mountain\\" are two that come to mind. His manner of moving forward and backward in time is so smooth and seamless, you are sometimes not sure whether you are witnessing an event during the war or twenty years later. In the same way, there are time you are not quite sure whether the characters are living or the ghosts of those who died in the battles. I hope to see this title among the nominees for the Pulitzer Prize or the National Book Award or both."},{"Title":"The Judas Field: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"I have been a Howard Bahr fan since THE BLACK FLOWER, and now he has in this third novel written a fine portrayal of the burden of the Civil War on those who fought it and the ones who waited. Bahr is a master of description and his prose is poetic in its imagery. Anyone who thinks that war is noble must read Cass Wakefield's ever-present memories of the Battle of Franklin--his comrades who were blown to bits, the bloody ground, the maimed corpses, the futile stand by an army ill-equipped, starving, and threadbare. It was Franklin, Tennessee, but it could be Iraq. The reader should make a trip to the site of the battle and walk among the headstones in the little cemetery. There are ghosts there."},{"Title":"The Judas Field: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"\\"The Judas Field\\" is about MEMORY! It's about the power of godawful human conflict to wharp, to mutilate, and ultimately to destroy human lives; the lives of those who have lived through the horror of it and \\"survived.\\" But survived for what? Survived how? NO ONE who faced combat, who \\"saw the elephant,\\" emerged from our nation's most horrendous conflict without deep scars that lasted for whatever years remained of his life. Bahr is a master at finding, recording and describing those who made it through and what the survival cost them. His descriptive capacity is superior! When I read his works I keep saying, \\"Yes, yes, that must have been the way it was.\\" In \\"Judas field\\" he gives us alcoholism and drug addiction. He also gives us deeply sympathetic characters who desperately want to do the right thing, to care, to make things right somehow. There were probably lots of young men from Iowa and Indiana who went home to lives essentially unchanged from before the conflict. In the South this was certainly not the case. One in four southern men of military age was dead. Statistically, EVERY man who served in the Southern armies and was not killed was wounded. And the world they came home to was devastated beyond anything Americans have experienced since. McMurty says the South is about memory. He's right. Read Bahr's works to know why. \\"Black Flower\\" \\"The Year of Jubilo\\" and \\"Judas Field\\" will make Southerners of anyone. Even this tranplant."},{"Title":"The Judas Field: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"I have been a Howard Bahr fan since The Black Flower, and The Judas Field did not disappoint. Strong character development and plot, but the real joy of reading Bahr is the sheer poetry in his language. If you want to know about the South - what the landscape is/was like, the heavy stones of defeat people have carried in their hearts for so long - read Howard Bahr"},{"Title":"The Judas Field: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"This is a great novel. I just happened to notice it in the book store three days ago and I decided to buy it. I finished it last night. It was very hard to put it down once I had started. Bahr writes a powerful story with characters whom you really begin to miss once you're done reading. After reading for a short while, I found myself easly sympathizing with the main character, Cass Wakefield. It is refreshing to see a work of literature about the War Between the States in which the author doesn't go out of his way to criminalize and demean Southerners in order to insure popularity of his work (i.e. the horrible piece of \\"literary sucking-up\\" and prejudicial misinformation known as 'Cold Mountain'). Bahr's work is truely a masterpiece of American and Southern literature. The last chapter could drive you a little crazy with the many elusions back and forth but that seems to be Mr. Bahr's style and only adds to the joy of reading the book."},{"Title":"The Judas Field: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"This is the second one of Bahr's books I have read. I enjoyed The Black Flower, but I think this is the better book. In fact, this is a remarkably good book. Bahr has an uncanny ability to capture what I assume was the whole scene surrounding the Civil War. His accounts of the battles are memorable and his accounts of what must have been going on in the heads of the soldiers is excellent. The book is haunting. He doesn't sugarcoat the realities of the killing and suffering. I recommend it unconditionally not to just Civil War buffs, but to anyone who enjoys getting lost in great literature."},{"Title":"The Judas Field: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"This completes a \\"trilogy\\" by Howard Bahr that in my opinion is more profound and moving than other more \\"popular\\" works about the Civil War. (Cold Mountain, anyone?) The Judas Field is so beautiful yet so powerful. The conclusion is completely ironic and significant. Wow. Words can't express how this book made me feel about the Civil War. This book just puts you there, in the middle of it all, and then shows you how difficult of a time people had after the conflict. I consider this to be fine literature, up there or superior to some of Faulkner's writings. (Yes, I do agree with the reviewer that said that there was a lot of bad language, but this language was always in the mouths of characters and not the narrator- the narrative voice is never overly grostesque, in fact it's the opposite- a beautiful voice of conflict, pain and endurance.)I need to reread \\"The Black Flower\\" now."},{"Title":"The Judas Field: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"If you pick up \\"The Judas Field\\" give it about 30 pages. Up to that point I was fairly confused and lost. Then, it suddenly comes together and this book became one of the most powerful books I've read all year.The book features two storylines - one set approximately 20 years after the Civil War and one consists of flashbacks about the Battle of Franklin. Both are interesting. Bahr's descriptions of the battle contain some of the most poetic descriptions of the most awful things that men can do to one another that I've ever read. Truly beautifully written.On top of that there is an ongoing discussion about the role of God in war. Does he take sides? Has he forsaken both sides? This discussion is not done lightly. These are not post-modernists characters - they believe but they must reconcile that belief with the awful experience of war. Here's a snippet of this discussion:\\" 'What do you ask for then?' said the boy.Roger pulled the quilt around his shoulders. 'To be forgiven,' he said.They were quiet then. The snow swirled around them, borne on a cutting wind, and through it ghostly shapes began to pass, bending, searching, speaking softly.\\" (pp. 168-9)The dialogue works. The descriptions are so thorough that I could almost hear the horses stamp and the men groan and stretch. This book is an outstanding experience."},{"Title":"The Judas Field: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"First and foremost, I love Bahr's poetic prose. Just beautiful. He paints beautiful images with his words like no one in today's literary world. The reason I gave this book 4 stars and not 5, is because as good as his writing is, he has trouble with plot points, which seem at times contrived (Simon Rope in The Black Flower). In The Judas Field, Lucian finding Cass and Roger during the Battle of Franklin really stretched and didn't suspend my disbelief. In my view with the \\"fog of war\\" at hand and soldiers moving in and out, dying, lines blurred, there is no way Lucian would find Cass or Roger during the battle. Impossible? No. Improbable? Yes. Bahr's writing is never contrived for me, but his plot points can be seen a mile away. In The Black Flower, once he introduced Simon Rope, you knew Rope would be the villain in the story. In The Judas Field, once Lucian and Roger followed, I knew something ominous was going to happen to one of them.Now for some other criticisms: as the reviewer of Publisher's Weekly stated and I agree with him, the uneducated characters seemed too profound in their insights at times, too wistful and polished. (The dialog on page 168.) Too poetic and insightful for Cass and Roger to speak. That was only one example. Cass' explanation of war to Alison was too well-spoken and profound of Cass' character. The other criticism I have is the flashback of the soldiering that Cass and Roger went through beginning on page 65 to 110. Although I found it quite interesting, it went on too long and brought me out of the reason why Cass accepted to find Alison's father and brother in Franklin. I thought that section went on way too long and should have been interrupted by a scene between Alison and Cass and the affection she once had for him. That would have brought the relationship back to the present and the past and solidified why Cass agreed to escort her to Franklin to find her dad and brother.The major positive I had was unlike The Black Flower, which had no battle scenes or descriptions of war, this story had plenty. Bahr does a wonderful job describing war and the effects of what war can do to the living and dying, as well as the graphic descriptions, which painted the brutal reality of what these killing fields represented. Bahr didn't hold back and I found the graphic nature to be spot on. I know some reviewers didn't care for the expletives, but I found them to be reasonably believable and not gratuitous.In sum, I think this book was a much better and stronger read than The Black Flower. I highly recommend this book to those who love the Civil War and to those who love a writer, who is a master of his craft."},{"Title":"The Judas Field: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"This is an excellent, well-written book that falls neatly into the era of the author's other two works \\"The Black Flower\\" and \\"The Year of Jubilo\\". We find some familiar names here, particularly Bushrod Carter, who was in the other two books. This book stands on its own, with its own characters and plot, but really the writing and the descriptions are the main focus of the work, at least for me. I have rarely, if ever, read a book that so well conveys the \\"terrible beauty\\" of war, but then goes on to show how, even when the war is over and many years have passed, that war still remains the defining moment of the lives of its participants. Their actions, for a large part, are often guided by those wartime memories, even if occasionally they are incomplete. Even if you don't like the plot, or find it thin, read this book for the poety of its language, and its sympathy for the \\"survivors\\" of a frightening war that lingers in their minds until they die, sometimes all too soon."},{"Title":"The Judas Field: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"Having read the previous two books in this series-- the first The Black Flower which covered the Battle of Franklin, TN and the second The Year of Jubilo which took place right after the end of the Civil War--I wanted to read this third book The Judas Field which featured soldiers returning to the Battle of Franklin location twenty years after the war.The books are well written. Mr Bahr was able to take me into the lives of the simple, plain, everyday characters and very well describe the times in which they lived or died and the issues they dealt with. He is extremely knowledgeable about this battle and the experiences that soldiers had returning to their homes."},{"Title":"The Judas Field: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"I love Howard Bahr's books.

I was just back from the war, wasn't sleeping, and the PTSD was running my life. I would stay awake for days at a time, hiding out on the back porch or in the garage. That was when I discovered \\"The Judas Field.\\" I was familiar with Bahr's writing, having read \\"The Black Flower\\" when I was overseas. I read \\"The Judas Field\\" in one marathon session; it kept me going a little longer.Not to give away too much of the plot, but \\"The Judas Field\\" is about a Confederate Civil War veteran named Cass Wakefield, who, 20 years after the war, is asked to return to the Franklin battlefield to retrieve the body of his commanding officer. \\"The Judas Field\\" is then the story of his trip, and the memories he has to confront. \\"The Judas Field\\" is a great book about how no matter how far we go, or how old we get, the past will never let us go. Give the book a try, I think you'll enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Judas Field: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"Be prepared for some gut-wrenching, reality-check descriptions....so well written that it was difficult to find a stopping place. The reader finds himself walking along beside the book's characters, seeing and feeling the same events. If you have an interest in the Civil War, you will fall right into this story, even though it's fictional--and anyway, who's to say the story might not have actually happened??"},{"Title":"The Judas Field: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"First Line: Cass Wakefield was born in a double-pen log cabin just at the break of day, and before he was twenty minutes old, he was almost thrown out with the bedclothes.Since that rather inauspicious beginning, Cass Wakefield piloted steamboats, married, was a soldier, and became a widower. For the last twenty years, he's lived in Cumberland, Mississippi, and been a traveling salesman selling Colt revolvers.Alison Sansing lost her father and brother in the war, and for the last twenty years, she's lived in that big old house in Cumberland alone. Having just been told by her doctor that she has cancer and hasn't long to live, the thing Alison fears most is being buried in the family cemetery alone. She asks Cass Wakefield to accompany her to Franklin, Tennessee-- where her father and brother died in battle-- to recover their bodies and bring them back to Cumberland to be buried at home.Having fought in the Battle of Franklin himself, Cass has no desire whatsoever to return to the area, but he does... for Alison. Two friends who fought alongside Cass travel with the pair, and the closer they all get to Franklin, the more vivid their memories become.I chose to read this book because my great-great-great-grandfather fought and died in the Battle of Franklin, and the fact that James Henry Brown's uniform was blue not gray, doesn't make a bit of difference. Bahr sets his scene very carefully. The pace felt like a steam locomotive pulling out of the station and gradually gaining speed. A profound sense of sadness, of sorrow, for all that was lost, for all the lives that were forever changed, permeates the book. At one point Alison asks what the fighting was like, and the response is one of the best I've ever read about the impossibility of telling someone who wasn't there what it's like to fight in the midst of the bloodbath of battle:\\"If we live a thousand years, won't ever find a way to tell it.\\" He coughed , and turned his head to spit. \\"In a battle, everything is wrong, nothing you ever learned is true anymore. And when you come out-- if you do-- you can't remember. You have to put it back together by the rules you know, and you end up with a lie. That's the best you can do, and when you tell it, it'll still be a lie.\\"The book's sadness turns to heartbreak as the men arrive in Franklin and try to locate where the bodies were buried so long ago. Yes, things have changed, but there are still roads, still buildings, that unleash an overwhelming tide of memory and loss. It's some of the best writing about war I've ever read because Bahr never once lets graphic carnage carry his story. It's a wonderful thing when a writer credits his readers with enough imagination and feeling to fill in the blanks for themselves.Cass Wakefield is a beautifully realized character. One I will long remember, as I will remember The Judas Field. I come away from the book feeling that I now have a tiny idea of what my ancestor went through in that time and place so long ago."},{"Title":"The Judas Field: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"I don't feel the need to post a recap of the story because others have done that so well.

By characters, I include the place because the setting is as much a character as the people in his book. Unfortunately, we don't have many modern writers that can paint a description of a place and time the way Mr. Bahr can. He puts the reader in the story, at the place, in the right time. I find myself stopping after reading a paragraph, with my mouth open in awe at the artistry I have just read, and I have to go back and read the passage again just to marvel at Mr. Bahr's language skills."},{"Title":"The Judas Field: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"If Howard Bahr writes about the Civil War I'm there. Bahr really knows how to capture the feeling of the tragedy that was the American Civil War. I was a huge fan of 'The Black Flower' and have read it many times since it was released. His characters were so heartbreaking and the situations so realistic that I knew that he really had captured a bit of what it was like to be in the Army of Tennessee and at the Battle of Franklin and life during the Civil War.This continues in 'The Judas Field'. I like the cross cutting between the two stories-one set in the 1880s while the other takes place during the Tennessee Campaign of 1864. Bahr is magical with words and his descriptions of the marches and the battles are first rate. Unlike 'The Black Flower' he describes the actual Battle of Franklin in some detail and how it affects his main protagonists. Bahr's Civil War is not romantic and is very gritty but still some dark humor shines through. Also, a description of a battle during the Atlanta campaign is very vividly described as is a very dramatic scene involving a burning down of a house. These are two of my favorite scenes. Bahr is just a master of words.I highly recommend Bahr and all of his great Civil War novels- 'The Black Flower', 'Year of Jubilo', and 'The Judas Field'. They are quite simply some of the best literature ever written about the American Civil War. I hope he returns to writing about the Civil War in the near future. Very rarely does a author and his subject match so incredibly well!"},{"Title":"The Judas Field: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"Just as in 'The Black Flower' Howard Bahr brings to the reader the horrors of the Civil War better than any author I can think of. He uses his characters in a way that you feel you actually know them and feel their pain. The setting again is the \\"Battle of Franklin' at Franklin, Tennessee. This was more of a slaughter than a battle. The main character, Cass Wakefield agrees to help a friend return to Franklin to retrieve the bodies of two loved ones. It's been 20 years since the war but it still lives (and haunts) Cass and his two comrades in arms that fought the battle with him.Bahr is a master at weaving in and out of his characters without confusing the reader. His almost poetic style plays with your emotions.You will enjoy this book!

In a valley by a river, Megan is 15 years old while realizing the water rising in Pennsylvania in 1889 and is spoiled and selfish while she resents(dislikes) her aunt telling her what to do. As Megan was taking her father's commands, she went to get the children in the attic, and heard her father's shout; she looked back and saw the water at her father's armpits. After that she heard a whistle that would not go away. It was a roaring wave around her father. While Megan prays, she is floating on a soggy bed passing people, but every time Megan calls for help, they ignore her and pass on by. As Megan is horribly frightened, she is on a sinking mattress, while 20 people stare at her in astonishment, and one of the men jumped from the house. Another person shouted, \\"Get back here.\\" They both are on the mattress; they soon see a man with two other ladies floating on a wagon. As they struggle but soon manage to get on to the wagon, a hill comes in sight. As Lottie, Shaw, Brian, and Daisy are floating toward a hill; they soon pick up two more passengers, Lottie, a beautiful young girl, cries in pain with a broken leg. As Lottie fainted in pain with a hurt leg, Shaw saw a head of a boy with blue eyes and golden hair. While Shaw got the kid, Megan was tearing up strands of cloth off her dress for the child's wounds, and the others went to the cabin with food provided. While Brain took all the dishes back to the house about 10 yards away, Shaw, Stefan, Lottie, and Megan got ready for bed; Brain soon returned. He brought some medicine for Megan's hands. After he was finished, Tom and Brian went out to find Megan's family. As the bell from the church steeple rung 11 times, Brian didn't find Megan's family, but there is a huge fire that looks a mile long. Tom still hasn't returned from looking for Megan's family. As Tom showed Megan the watch someone gave him, the rest of them went to get breakfast from the house not too far away; they got cleaned up. Stefan was still a mess. While Megan and Brian went out to look for her family, Shaw and Miss Alderson stayed at the headquarters, the shed; Megan broke out in tears, as she was mad at Daisy. As Brian and Megan were looking for her father in a house, Tom happened to find some good peaches; after that, they were out of the house and heard a yelping dog and it happened just to be Megan's dog. As Tom snatched the money he found; Megan and Brian stared in astonishment, while they approached an ugly school building with a person Megan knew. It was captain Hart. Megan asked, \\"Do you know where my father is?\\" He replied, \\"No, sorry.\\" As Megan left the school house, she passed a dead person that she knew. They soon returned to the shed and ate; they also fell into a deep sleep. As Megan found Halda, their house maid, Halda asked, \\"Do you want to come with me and my husband?\\" She refused because she promised to go back to Stefan.

Now, after all this years, I treasure this volume in my library and read it again and again.In very few pages he gives the reader a complete picture of Ancient Greece, from its origins till the advent of Alexander the Great.Every main issue is described here: the Polis, their religion, the construction step by step of a unique civilization; art and war; literature and theater; philosophy and history; not a significant issue is left over.

It is an extremely well researched overview of ancient Greek history and culture. Quite scholarly, and written in an interesting way, he leads the reader through his research and thinking, not always giving definitive answers to cultural questions. In the end the reader comes to fairly confident assumptions of what the Greek world was, and is, like. His first chapters are quite good: Introduction, Formation of the Greek People, The Country, Homer, The Polis. The later chapters are less engaging, but overall a good scholarly read!Reviewed by David Lundberg, author ofOlympic Wandering: Time Travel Through Greece"},{"Title":"The Greeks","review":"The author of &quot;The Greeks&quot;, a well-known professor who devoted a great part of his life to the study of Ancient Greece, wrote this book with an aim: help others to understand better the subject that he taught. In my opinion, H. D. F. Kitto fulfilled his self-imposed task marvelously.Kitto doesn't pretend to write an exhaustive history of Ancient Greece, but rather an introductory book that touches upon many subjects without delving too much into any of them. As a result, after reading this book you will end up with a general idea of the culture, art, literature and historical facts regarding Ancient Greece, but you won't be able to say you know all about it. On the other hand, you will know much more about the Greeks, and the values that shaped them and motivated their actions. That is probably more than enough to recommend this book :)I want to point out that even though the author doesn't oversimplify the subject at hand to the point of distorting it, he highlights so much certain central ideas that even those who read the book without paying it due attention will understand them. For instance, Kitto emphasizes the great divide that existed for the Greeks between themselves and the others, the barbarians. According to the Greeks, that divide was undeniable because only they had mastered the way of being truly &quot;free&quot;. That certitude, and their consequent feeling of exceptionalism, marked all their actions.Kitto says, in the introduction, that he strove to allow the Greeks to speak for themselves, and the reader gets exactly that impression from time to time. I don't know much about Ancient Greece, but I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I guess that is a good indication that even those who just want to dabble in the subject are likely to enjoy it...I believe that &quot;The Greeks&quot; is a very well-written book, something that combined with the fact that it isn't overly long makes it the kind of reading material that almost everybody might be interested in. All in all, I highly recommend this book to you :)Belen Alcat"},{"Title":"The Greeks","review":"I am rereading this book, and I'm inspired to share the good news. It is truly a remarkable work, conveying information in the same measure as passion, humor and reverence. A proud scholar of the old school, Kitto unashamedly reveres the Greek culture as he understands it. There are more modern works, which muddle in gender issues, and in other ways cut the Greeks to our measure; but this brilliant lens is the rare optic that inspires, draws in, engrosses."},{"Title":"The Greeks","review":"Here is history as pure pleasure -- formidable in its learning, yet delivered in a style that is plain and direct, yet enlivened with color and wit. After you have read a few pages, you will have no doubts as to why this relatively slim volume is an evergreen among studies of classical Greece.Kitto, who taught at the University of Glasgow and the University of Bristol in England, set for himself an ambitious aim: to probe the very soul of the Greeks, from the beginning of their literature and history in Homer and Hesiod, through the sublime artistic creations of the 5th century to the decline of the polis (inadequately translated, Kitto says, as \\"city-state\\") following the disastrous Peloponnesian war.He avoids two extremes that would have hobbled such an attempt. Kitto neither gets bogged down in historical minutiae (as even the great Will Durant occasionally did in his masterly The Life of Greece), nor does he turn the work into a series of free-floating thought balloons of philosophy and theory. His observations about the spirit of these people who have left an indelible print on western civilization are invariably penetrating, the more so because he is careful, good scholar that he is, to illustrate them with specifics from Greek history and arts.I'll end my review here because your time would be better spent reading the book itself."},{"Title":"The Greeks","review":"After reading Gates of Fire, I wanted to delve into classical Greek culture. This book is a great intro to Greece from Homer to Alexander. The book covers the history, culture, philosophy, arts, and &quot;mind&quot; of the ancient Greek - all in about 250 pages. It does a marvelous job of introducing the reader to the subject. It would be difficult to read this book and not be astonished by what this civilization accomplished. My only complaint is a nit: the author includes many references to 1950's England that I did not understand."},{"Title":"The Greeks","review":".What a wonderful book on the ancient Greeks! Very informative and highly interesting. After reading some of the plays of Aristophanes, Euripides, Sophocles, Aeschylus and some of the Socratic dialogues of Plato, some modern books, including The Trial of Socrates, by L.F. Stone, I am starting to get a feel for ancient Athens and Greece. Add this to some of Nietzsche's thoughts and arguments against Socrates and for Greek tragedy and there is a great and inspiring culture and way of life to be admired greatly.H. D. F. Kitto's book, The Greeks is a great history book and an introduction to the Greek character, way of thinking, lifestyle, the art forms of comedy and tradedy, the Greek abitlity to accept fate of suffering, injustice and death, and yet see the divinity of this human life, fully living this life, to know thyself without excess. Also, how the political democracy, the polis is so intertwined and bound in and through out the Athenian culture, and through out Greece.Now it's the polis, (city-state) the government of the people that truly fascinates me and I find it an amazing concept and this is what was known as democracy and is so far from what we have in our modern day. The polis was more than a political party, it was a community, both religiously (non-dogmatic religion, and this is very significant) and also a social and ethical entity with a high degree of flexibility and the ability to reverse previous decisions that were deemed to be faulty, such as the outcome of the city of Mitylene. All adult Athenian citizens were to partake in the polis and had an open voice in contribution. In turn they were listened to and had an active participation. The rich, the poor, the tradesman, the farmer, the aristocrat, all co-mingled and were completely aware to each other's functions, there was far less ignorance here as to what really was occurring - no secrecy between governmental departments as we have in modern day. There were no professionals, all were amateurs, no representatives, all represented themselves, no high-paid attorneys, all defended themselves, judged themselves and were balanced from being partisan by having such a commingled segment of society in active participation. It was truly an incredible governing system. This was a living community. And in this respect, it brings to mind a phenomenon defined as \`community' by M. Scott Peck in his book, A Different Drum. It was truly a remarkable system that has never been repeated.In turn the Greeks thinking consisted of very weighty matters with responsibility and this can be seen reflected in both the Greek tragedies and comedies. Some have written such thinking off as fatalism, but this is not the case, as such fatal destinies as in the oracles are coupled with the individual's freedom to choose within and bring about beauty and justice inside the limits of human existence. And this can be seen in the weaknesses and limitations of the gods themselves. For the Greek religion was far removed from the dogmatisms found in the monotheism of Western civilization. Symbolism and religiosity was thriving unlike the dead arid rationalism that permeates both secular and religious thinking of our day.Now there are certainly downsides to the polis, and the Greek way of life as in the existence of slavery, in women's limited rights and in an Athenian league that policed the other islands and cities, in which such a small review does not permit me the space to relate on in what you will find in Kitto's book who goes into an excellent analysis of this and is a superb book to read.Ultimately, it was when the polis got too large, too corporate and starting policing the other states to conform to the Athenian League in order to receive protection against the Persians. When Sparta requested the end of an embargo against them trading with Megara, Athens refused, so Sparta attacked, starting with the city of Thebes. And after two oligarchy take-overs, the weakened restored democracy of the fourth century developed into a lethargic disinterest in the polis, the Athenians interested in other things. Here the trust in a professional speech writer, Philip, the king of Macedonia, against the advice of the Athenian Demosthenes brought on his successor, Alexander the Great and the end of Greek freedom. Clearly, there is a modern day parallel in the U.S. However, it was with the invent of professionalism, sophism and individualism toward the cosmopolis rather than the polis along with the specialization of military tatics which favored the Athens polis taxing the others. This requried the professional over the amature and the end of the polis.\\"To attend to that business of the polis was not only a duty which a man owed to the polis: it was an absorbing interest too. It was part of the complete life. This is the reason why the Athenian never employed the professional administrator or judge if he could possibly help it. The polis was a kind of super-family, and family life means taking a direct part in family affairs and family counsels. The attitude to the polis explains, too, why the Greek never, as we say, \\"invented\\" representative government. Why should he \\"invent\\" something which most Greeks struggled to abolish, namely being governed by someone else.\\" p. 129"},{"Title":"The Greeks","review":"On the back of my copy of Kitto's book, there is a quote from Raymond Mortimer declaring this volume to be the best introduction to Ancient Greece he had ever read. I'm not sure if I can go that far with regard to this book; perhaps in 1957, when it first came out, that accolade would have been appropriate. However, just because I can't declare this book to be the best unreservedly, I still consider it to be an excellent text, and one that I have very useful in my upper-level undergraduate course in Ancient Greek philosophy.Kitto has relatively short chapters on a host of subjects, including origins, culture, warfare, political life, philosophy, art, and more. These are arranged according to certain major facets of Greek life that we know - for example, Homer gets a chapter to himself. However, Homer neither arose in a vacuum nor did his work only matter during his (or her) time. Kitto doesn't address too much about the academic controversy over who Homer might have been, but rather addresses the work that we have which survives. That work includes an exploration of the direct and indirect influences on later generations of Greeks, who in turn have had profound impact on our own culture.Kitto spends a good deal of time on the political structure of Greek life, from the early settlement and migration times, to development of small polities, to larger hegemonic times and the Athenian empire, brief-lived though it was. One question I ask my class to address out of Kitto's text is this - Sparta seems to have won the war, but Athens won the peace; what does this mean? Kitto gives a lot of insight into the competition between Athens and Sparta, and to a lesser extent other polities around the Aegean and off toward Italy; there were unified times in the face of Persian aggression, but more often there were less organized times, which allowed for a kind of international relations in microcosmic form. I once had a professor who longed to teach a modern international relations course using nothing but Herodotus and Thucydides - one reading Kitto can get the sense that there are many truths in this desire, given that many of the motivations of nations and many of the principles of politics among nations remain the same as can be found in the speeches recounted in Thucydides' writing.Kitto clearly has a deep love of the ancient Greek culture, and parallels much of his own time with this period; he is also quick to point out the differences. This is perhaps the one weakness of this text. If one lacks a familiarity with Britain and British sensibilities and learning in the first half of the twentieth century, one may lose some of the references Kitto makes - for example, he makes reference to the Sophists as being akin to those who might host a seminar, \`Did You Want to be a 1000GBP Man?' - the answer would be a resounding no today; he also alludes to \`our political parties' which are clearly different from those today (and for those in North America, one might have really no hook upon which to hang understanding).On the other hand, some things haven't changed. He also says of the Sophists that \`Perhaps \\"Professor\\" would be a rough modern equivalent to \\"Sophist\\".' A challenge to remember, indeed! This is certainly something my students can understand. He also uses colourful stories such as Diogenes calling to both the perfumed set and what would be the Greek grunge set, \`Affectation!' He also pulls from Herodotus the disappointment of Croesus at finding out that Tellus, Cleopas and Biton led happier lives than he (but alas, that they were dead, too...). There are many pieces that stick with one upon reading, and because this text does not go overboard in information, it fits together in a more easily grasped framework, too.One might challenge Kitto's assertion that the Greeks were as superior as they are presented - \`unless our standards of civilization are comfort and contraptions, Athens from (say) 480 to 380 was clearly the most civilized society that has yet existed.' However, there is no doubt that the Greeks advanced in directions hitherto unknown and rarely exceeded in a measure-by-measure analysis. This comes through with Kitto - a worthy text for a worthy subject."},{"Title":"The Greeks","review":"This book is really great. It briefly covers the formation of Greek civilization, it more thoroughly covers what is called \\"classical Greece\\" (the best part), and it ends by considering various other areas--myth and religion, the decline of the polis (city-state), the life and character and mind of the Greeks, and a tiny bit of philosophy.The writing style of Kitto is outstanding; I bet he was a great teacher. It was a real joy to read this book, and I might read it again some day just to \\"hear\\" Kitto tell the story once more. Here are the opening lines (to give you a taste of his style): \\" The reader is asked, for the moment, to accept this as a reasonable statement of fact, that in a part of the world that had for centuries been civilized, and quite highly civilized, there gradually emerged a people, not very numerous, not very powerful, not very well organized, who had a totally new conception of what human life was for, and showed for the first time what the human mind was for.\\"Kitto mentions a few Greek writers in the course of the book (Homer, Herodotus, Xenophon etc.), and it will really make you want to read them. I am a philosophy student, and I feel like I have a better understanding of the background of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle after having read this book. It isn't, however, an exhaustive study on the Greeks; that is not what it is intended to be. Anyway, it's great. There's no reason not to buy this and read it; it's a quick read."},{"Title":"The Greeks","review":"Ignoring this book in a study of the Greeks is like ignoring &quot;Buckaro Banzai&quot; in a study if Science Fiction movies.

What is a Hellene? Kitto explains it. What does the word polis come from? Kitto explains it. What is the Spartan ideal? Kitto explains it. It can be a dry book at times, but reading it carefully you will learn a lot about Greek culture. You will learn who were the Greeks, the Greek government systems, the Athens, the Spartans, and a polis. I suggest this book if you read or study about ancient Greece. I suggest reading pages seven to ninety-five."},{"Title":"The Greeks","review":"It's been almost twelve years, but I have not forgotten reading H.D.F Kitto's &quot;The Greeks.&quot; This was a text for one of my college courses, and I still recall the terribly dry writing style of this book. It's quite simply the kind of book that gives history books a bad name. I'm a lifelong history buff, but this book helped make me understand why so many people think history is boring.I was a history major so I read scores of books during college, and &quot;The Greeks,&quot; the book I most detested, remains the clearest memory of my academic college life. Why? The class for which this book was assigned was taught by a very old Jesuit priest. Every week we had to read one or two chapters of this book and then take a fill-in-the-blank quiz on the reading. The old priest allowed the students to grade their own quizzes while he announced the answers. Of course, two thirds of the class cheated like crazy. I was one of the few who didn't cheat. I read and re-read &quot;The Greeks&quot; before each quiz, but did very average. As the semester went on, I grew quite angry that my grade would be harmed by the quizzes while the cheaters benefited, and all because this kindly priest was too old to know what was happening. Of course, not being a rat, I kept my mouth shut. However, near the end of the semester, after the last quiz had just been completed, the priest announced that we didn't have time to grade them so the class should turn them in. You must have seen the faces of the cheaters! Some of them were so stunned that they even turned in their blank quizzes with their names on the top. The smarter ones, knowing they had just been caught, didn't even bother turning theirs in. I turned mine in- completed. Despite how lousy I did on those quizzes, I got an A in that class. I like to think that old Jesuit planned that all along as a test of honor, and that he picked H.D.F. Kitto's &quot;The Greeks&quot; simply because it was unreadable and that the quizzes would be very tough. That story is the reason why I recall my memory of &quot;The Greeks&quot; with fondness."},{"Title":"The Greeks","review":"Kitto's work was invaluable not in that it recounted the accomplishments and history of this ancient civilization, but rather that it gave the audience an actually glimpse into the mind-set of these ancient people. We get to know at bit about their character, their sense of idealism and intellectualism which were all paramount in creating a society that gave rise to the likes of Socrates and many others. Kitto shows us how the Greeks saw themselves as dignified people who valued their sense of freedom above all else. It was this sense of freedom, self-reliance and honour which the Greeks held so close to their psyche as recounted in the epics of Homer, and it was these characteristics which they thought differentiated them from their non-Greek neighbors. Kitto also tried to explain how these values became slowly eroded during the fourth century by a new sense of individualism and cosmopolitanism that had been spurred on by numerous factors including the loss of \\"freedom\\" wrought by the new imperial age of Alexander the Great and later the Roman Empire.Kitto is a philhellene to be sure, as one can perceive from his enthusiasm and admiration for these long gone people. However, he does not blindly go about praising their accomplishments by any means. Kitto does not hesitate to take up the more distasteful elements of antiquity such as slavery. By no means is he an apologist nor does he make feeble attempts to justify any improprieties, yet at the same time he sees fit to qualify excessively disparaging views put forward by other authors on the status of women and slaves for example. Ultimately one gets the sense that he makes a critical analysis of the subject at hand and presents well-weighted arguments."},{"Title":"The Greeks","review":"I never expected such a wide scope in such a small book. Kitto covers everything you could possibly want in an introductory presentation to ancient Greek civilization.While not elaborating or proceeding into an in-depth study of any of the various topics he touches upon, he does a fantastic job for what he does. A perfect book if you would like to simply read a slight over-view of ancient Greece or a book to get you started on your way to greater studies.Another thing I enjoyed about this book was Kitto\`s writing style. Never very stuffy and boring, Kitto adds writing flares that you wouldn\`t expect in a scholarly work that is simply stating facts. He does a fine job with words, with memorable sentences such as, &quot;I will let Homer describe it. He is a far better writer than I&quot; proceeding with an exert from The Iliad. Little touches like these really add to the job he has done.I recommend this book to a student or a casual reader who wants a nice introduction to classical Greece with an over-view of the important subjects and topics of that time. Someone who is already familiar with the basics doesn\`t really need to read this, but even so, you may want to pick it up for the simple fact that it is a fantastic piece of literature."},{"Title":"The Greeks","review":"From time to time a title appears and becomes a cult book .

I think that is because the many illustrations and quotations taken from Homer as well as major Greek dramatists, poets, philosophers, and historians enrich and illuminate the various aspects of Greek culture under discussion; and are themselves illuminated by the analysis of topics such as the polis and Greek myth and religion.For a volume of only around 250 pages, the book seemed to me to convey an enormous amount of information. The unity of theme, (that the success of Greek culture was due to a dynamic tension produced by many formative factors), and occasional enlivening touches of humor, made for interesting as well as very comprehensible reading.'The Greeks' was published in the 1950's, and I have no idea how it compares with subsequent scholarship, but it seems to me a very good starting point for one interested in classical Greek culture."},{"Title":"The Greeks","review":"I got in touch with this book as a mandatory reading when I was applying to study at Buenos Aires University. As usually happens with prescribed readings, I eyed \\"The Greeks\\" with little enthusiasm.But to my big surprise it was a great read! Professor Kitto has done an outstanding work here. Now, after all this years, I treasure this volume in my library and read it again and again.In very few pages he gives the reader a complete picture of Ancient Greece, from its origins till the advent of Alexander the Great.Every main issue is described here: the Polis, their religion, the construction step by step of a unique civilization; art and war; literature and theater; philosophy and history; not a significant issue is left over. At the same time Professor Kitto succeed in writing a very straightforward account and an easy reading.We may understand thru this book our eternal debt to that Mediterranean people. Nothing will be as it is without the Greek heritage.A recommended read for students and any person interested in Western Culture.Enjoy this trip!Reviewed by Max Yofre."},{"Title":"The Greeks","review":"This book is a good source for an introductory glimpse of the 'Greek context'. Possibly not the best book for classics students because many statements are made without reference to sources of information. Kitto keeps the pace going fast enough to maintain interest in those not so versed in this area."},{"Title":"The Greeks","review":"Far and away the best introduction to ancient Greece that I have yet found. Kitto has a real love -- even a passion -- for his subject; not only does this passion show throughout but it is contagious as well. With joyful, dynamic prose Kitto introduces us to the history, the people, the places, the culture, and the events of Greece before Alexander the Great. In the process of retelling the story of ancient Greece, he opens up the Greek mind and the Greek heart for us, examining each minutely and showing where it is that we differ (and why we should be careful not to judge too harshly when we do) and where it is that we find similarities. Often it seems that Kitto is introducing us to ourselves, or at least to a part of ourselves which we didn't even realize we possessed. The history of Greece is in many ways a good portion of the history of Western man -- the history of Greece is our history. If you want to know more about ancient Greece and about yourself -- read this book."},{"Title":"The Greeks","review":"Now - after having read this book sometime ago I can look back and review my opinion. My knowledge of Greek History and Classics is expandeding (one would hope) and I consider, sadly, that Kitto's version is rather dated one. From historical point of view he has few interesting ideas and fails to sustain educational interest of the reader and continuity of the knowledge that his research offers is equally slow - the book lacks innovative ideas.However what this book does offer, in my view, is its gentle and old-fashioned style of writing - very English and very charming, you may find reading certain chapters with a smile on your face. If you want a solid introduction to the Classics don't bother - but if you are after some good fun and education - this is the one to fullfill your desire."},{"Title":"The Greeks","review":"Pros1.) This book has had several editions since its original 1950s publication, so you can get it for cheap.2.) Mr. Kitto has made huge contributions to the study of the ancient Greeks, so you'll learn something about their origins, lifestyle, politics, and military engagements. It's a tribute to him that this book is still in print.Cons1.) Written in the post WWII UK era: Highly conversational tone, has a number of analogies to the war, and compares ancient Greece to 1950s Great Britain (such as population sizes). Overall, the book is becoming somewhat ancient itself.2.) I think it'd be hard for a new author to publish this as an academic work today in its present form:a.) there's a HUGE amount of speculation going on about daily life, philosophy, cultural events, etc. without referring to any physical evidence to explain to the reader how the author arrived at these conclusions. Kitto seems to know what he's talking about, but I have know idea how he got there.b.) There's no source material or footnotes, at least not in my 2009 paperback edition.It's doubtful you'll bemoan $10 or so if you don't like the book or can't relate to it, but don't spent $20 or more.

Listen to him.Don't be no &quot;barbaros&quot; - baa, baa, baa...git them sheepsoutta here!This work is divided into 12 chapters -- half the numberof chapters [24] apportioned to the Books of the epicpoems of the Hellenes, _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_ -- so we,as &quot;moderns&quot; might salute him for his brevity. Thechapter titles are: Introduction; The Formation ofthe Greek People; The Country; Homer; The Polis;Classical Greece: The Early Period; Classical Greece:The Fifth Century; The Greeks at War; The Decline ofthe Polis; The Greek Mind; Myth and Religion; Lifeand Character.From the opening foot step out of the starter'sblock, Kitto sets the tone. For he says that theGreeks emerged as &quot;a people, not very numerous, notvery powerful, not very well organized, who had atotally new conception of what human life was for,and showed for the first time what the human mindwas for.&quot; Ka-boom! I'm listenin'; I don't knowabout you!Kitto says that the Greeks [a name applied to themlater by the conquering Romans -- and still applied tothem today--are they still a &quot;conquered people?&quot; Dowe love the Roman culture more than we revere theHellenic culture? After all, who civilized the Romans?]quite simply and naturally felt that they were differentfrom the peoples who surrounded them. Kitto says thatthe difference which the Greeks felt was not just oneof language (because the foreigners did not speakGreek), but also because the foreigners did not &quot;live&quot;as Greeks, nor &quot;think&quot; as Greeks, either. Of course,Kitto does not address what effect a language has,psychologically and culturally, on the thinking andliving of its speakers - as well as the programmingof the writing pattern of the language on the thinkingand analyzing patterns of its users.Kitto says that if we asked the ancient Greek whatdistinguished him from the barbarian (any and all non-Greeks), he would not point out the triumphs of theGreek mind, nor the fine temples, statues, or plays...he would say, &quot;The barbarians are slaves; we Hellenesare free men.&quot; Kitto goes on to point out that this&quot;eleutheria&quot; was more than political freedom, orfreedom from Fate and the gods [which the Greeks didnot have] -- though they did have &quot;the dignity ofbeing a man&quot; even in the face of these trials...it was because the Greeks &quot;developed a form ofPOLITY [relation between the citizen and his state]which both stimulated and satisfied man's higherinstincts and capabilities.&quot;Immensely satisfying...so sit down with a cup ofwine, some goat cheese, and some grapes...and slowlysavor this man and his analysis of ancient Greece.* * * * * * * * *"},{"Title":"The Greeks","review":"An excellent and short history of the Greeks.

Jackson, retired former Boston police officer, who now lives on Martha's Vineyard year-round. J.W., who spends most of his time fishing, puttering in his garden, and enjoying life on the Vineyard, has an insatiable curiosity that grew with his years on the force. When a boat explodes with the son of a friend of J.W. onboard, he quickly starts to question why the seemingly well-running boat blows up. The college-aged student, Billy, had been into drugs in the past, and J.W. begins to wonder if some of his old acquaintances want Billy dead. And when Billy's sister, Susie, pleads with J.W. to find out who would want her brother dead, he simply cannot resist the pull to investigate. Meanwhile, J.W. meets a beautiful, exotic nurse, named Zeolinda Madieras while fishing for blues one early morning. They start a simmering romance while J.W. seeks out a murderer before he becomes the next victim.I just love this series! I had read all of the first books in the series several years ago, and have returned to read them for a second time. I feel as though I am revisiting a beloved vacation spot, as the setting of Martha's Vineyard is both beautiful and refreshing. I enjoy the characters of J.W. and Zee, and it is fun to watch their romance grow and blossom in this book. Reading this series is like taking a vacation on a beach on a gorgeous summer day, while enjoying good food, and the company of great friends.

What a treasure! It fascinates me how Craig began the series with most of the charming anecdotes that re-appear in the subsequent Vineyard books, from the pay toilets at Gay Head (an abomination to civilization) to his love for catching the blues with a red headed Roberts. The romance with Zee starts here too, which delighted both myself and my wife as we read it.This book starts off with a bang (actually an explosion) and quickly leads into something involving illegal drugs in paradise. We discover a fascinating story of a young man trying to discover his past, and another young man entangled in a world of drugs he cannot control. J.W. gets into personal danger in multiple circumstances. One of those seemed like it could have been the grand finale to the book, but I knew it couldn't because if occurred with many pages to go, leaving me intrigued how the story would continue to develop. The only negative comment I have is the ending leaves the reader to clean up a few of the loose ends in his or her imagination. This didn't bother me, but it might bother some.Enjoy this masterpiece.

(Jefferson Washington) Jackson series. Craig sets this series on Martha's Vineyard, where Jackson, a former cop in the Boston police department, has a small house on an old hunting camp property he inherited from his father. Despite having a bullet lodged near his spine, he lives happily in relative poverty, supporting himself on his disability pension, the bluefish he catches and sells to the local fish market, the clams he digs, and the garden vegetables he grows.In this book, a young woman asks Jackson to find out if someone tampered with the boat carrying her brother and a friend that blew up off the coast, killing the friend. Though Jackson doubts there was any foul play, he discovers it feels good to be investigating again. What he learns is that there is a lot more to the boat explosion than he thought. The investigation leads to the drug trade on the island and to a surprising family relationship, and as he delves deeper Jackson himself becomes the target of the killer.In \\"A Beautiful Place to Die\\" Craig introduces us to two recurring series characters: the police chief in Edgartown, Jackson's friend (of sorts) and local law enforcement helper-to-be, and the beautiful Zee, a local nurse he meets while fishing for bluefish and a new love interest. Craig makes the most of his setting in this series, giving the reader a feel for life on Martha's Vineyard--the different types of locals, the culture of the fishermen, the island layout, the sunbathers, the traffic from tourists. He also makes the reader's mouth water as he describes the food, such as bluefish pate, that Jackson prepares for himself and the martinis he mixes. Craig's writing reflects the informal way that Jackson lives in its own light tone. I did find the dialogue a bit too cute and self-conscious.

His island sanctuary is being poisoned with drugs and death, and he's determined to do something about it.Philip R. Craig has a deceptively smooth writing style that drew me right into the story, and J.W.

Given that, Trojan Women by Seneca, which is in some ways a &quot;remake&quot; of Euripides Trojan Women and in others a highly original masterpiece, is one of the best tragedies of all time and is recommended because of its timeless themes of life,death, war and the treatment of the conquered by the conquerors that it addresses.

The book includes chapters on Mendelson, Schulz, Melendez, and Guaraldi, as well as an \\"illustrated script\\" (i.e., the actual script, illustrated with the pictures from the original book, A Charlie Brown Christmas).The book is filled with fascinating insights about how the production came together in only six months: e.g., \\"Unlike the usual Hollywood practice of hiring adult actors to mimic the voices of children, A Charlie Brown Christmas featured the voices of real children---a choice that gave the show a refreshing innocence.\\" (Pg. 19) \\"Reflecting on the first appearance of Linus and his blanket in the 1950s, Schulz wrote, 'I did not know then that the term 'security blanket' would later become part of the American language.'\\" (Pg. 38)Amazingly, ALL of the children's voices were recorded in a single day, in just a few hours. Since several of the children couldn't read, Melendez had to \\"feed\\" them their lines, one line at a time. Peter Robbins [Charlie Brown] recalls, \\"once I got in the studio I found it was chaotic, with a bunch of kids, six to nine years old, running all over the place and too excited to calm down. We had unusual words to deliver like 'good grief' and 'rats' and 'eastern syndicate.' A lot of the talk was 'edgy,' at least for us kids at the time. Another challenge was the fact that I, as Charlie Brown, was supposed to be depressed at Christmastime. It was very strange for an eight-and-a-half-year-old to pretend to be depressed about Christmas, the most joyous time of the year!\\" (Pg. 21)Mendelson notes, \\"Toward the end of production, Vince Guaraldi brought in a beautiful opening song. After he laid down the instrumental track, however, we all felt it needed some lyrics. Because we were running out of time, I wrote some lyrics in about fifteen minutes on the back of an envelope. The song became 'Christmas Time Is Here,' which has become a holiday standard covered by dozens of recording artists. Who knew?\\" (Pg. 27)Of the famous recitation of Luke 2:8-14 (KJV) by Linus, the book notes, \\"I told Sparky, 'We can't do this, it's too religious.' And he said to me, 'Bill, if we don't do it, who else can? We're the only ones who can do it.' I wasn't convinced that was true at the time, but he was right about so many things. It just didn't sound right for a cartoon, an entertainment. When I read that part, I thought we were going to kill this thing, but by golly he came through. In this and in every show, Sparky always stuck in a little message.\\" (Pg. 40)Amazingly, the top CBS executives were disappointed with the final product: \\"'Well, you gave it a good shot,' said one. 'It seems a little flat... a little slow,' said the other... 'I'm afraid we won't be ordering any more. We're sorry; and believe me, we're big Peanuts fans. But maybe it's better suited to the comic page.'\\" (Pg. 27) Melendez comments, \\"When we saw the finished show, we thought we had killed it. It had so many warts and bumps and lumps and things. A year later we fixed up a few things, but we never completely re-created the show. The inconsistencies and little problems seem to make it even more endearing to a lot of people, and Sparky never wanted to change it.\\" (Pg. 61)For all of us who loved Schulz, his comic strip, this special, and the other specials, this book is a real treasure."},{"Title":"A Charlie Brown Christmas: The Making of a Tradition","review":"Bought for Its complete script, but does contain other interesting info including a flip book portion from the movies opening title.

Will buy this book immediately on one of the BEST Christmas specials in the history of television! RANKIN/BASS, MAGOO, GRINCH and CHARLIE BROWN are in a league of their own! THANK YOU for doing a book on this wonderful show!"},{"Title":"A Charlie Brown Christmas: The Making of a Tradition","review":"Lee Mendelson , one of the men behind all of the Peanuts cartoons, has created a tribute book for one of the most watched and appreciated Christmas specials. Inside you'll find the history of the cartoon, from its humble beginnings as an idea put forth by Coca-Cola looking for a Christmas special, to the inspired use of Vince Guaraldi's wonderful jazz, and the casting of \\"real\\" children as the voices, A CHARLIE BROWN CHRISTMAS proved to be a series of fortuitous events. This is an enjoyable keepsake for fans of the show, but there is some obvious padding, I mean, 90 pages of illustrated script? The book is only 192 pages long. There are other extras, like the production sheets and Melendez's original backgrounds. They are welcome sights and it would have been nice to see more effort put into details like these. That being said I enjoyed the book, but would only recommend it if you get a break on the retail price."},{"Title":"A Charlie Brown Christmas: The Making of a Tradition","review":"In the television show, A Charlie Brown Christmas, Charlie Brown searches for the true meaning of Christmas and helps infuse it into all the Peanuts gang. Like many people, he's a little down in the dumps over the upcoming holiday season, but with his good heart he soon finds a way to seek out Christmas in his own way by getting a real tree rather than the artificial one that Lucy sent him for.If you are like me, you have watched and enjoyed A Charlie Brown Christmas many times since it premiered in 1965. Now, you can have this experience every day with this remarkable keepsake album. Everything about the book is first-class and a joy. Do be kind to your family and friends who like Peanuts and give them this book.The book contains the whole illustrated script of the show, which brings the experience of watching the show back very literally. You also get the lyrics and music to &quot;Christmas Time Is Here&quot; and &quot;Linus and Lucy.&quot; I could hear the music in my head for days after reading the book. You can, of course, play and sing these songs for yourself, as well.There are also a lot of background sketches, story boards, and production sheets to help you understand the development and production process better. I found these to be interesting and valuable additions to the book.I also enjoyed learning more about the decision to integrate jazz and classical music into the show. The remembrances about Vince Guraldi, who wrote the music, added to my understanding of why this is a great story.To me, though, the best parts were the memories of Charles &quot;Sparky&quot; Schulz by producer Lee Mendelson and animator (and voice of Snoopy) Bill Melendez. This material integrates the story back into Mr. Schulz's basic religious values. You also get insights into the characters and their relation to Mr. Schulz. My favorite reference was this quote, &quot;Charlie Brown is the way I am and Snoopy is the way I wish I could be.&quot;After you read and reread this book, I suggest you sit back and plan for how you can have the kind of Christmas that Charles Schulz wanted to encourage with this story. That will be the best benefit of all.May you always find and enjoy the true meaning of Christmas!"},{"Title":"A Charlie Brown Christmas: The Making of a Tradition","review":"Reading &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; on a dark Sunday afternoon in November is a bit like owning a DVD crammed with special features. This gorgeously-designed hardcover, with glossy pages and a heavy silver dustjacket, is a terrific companion to the TV special, and an almost essential shelf companion to &quot;Peanuts: A Golden Celebration&quot;.Anything you'd want to know about the &quot;Christmas&quot; TV special is in this book -- lengthy interviews with producer Lee Mendelson (a veteran of Peanuts anniversary books) and animator Bill Melendez. Charles M Schulz passed away before the book was written, but there are plenty of rarely-seen photos of him taken in the 1960s. There's a chapter on Vince Guaraldi, whose jazz soundtrack defines the lives of many &quot;Peanuts&quot; fans; interviews with some of the children who voiced the characters; and, O happy day, sheet music! The second half of the book contains the complete script for &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; itself, along with dozens of photos and animated sequences, taken from the original cels.&quot;Christmas&quot; is not for small children (unless they're reading it with you), and there are a couple of misprints (including, in my first edition, a caption for a photo that's not in the book!). But it's lovely to look at, and when I put it down finally, reluctantly, I was whistling the soundtrack and hearing Linus's nativity speech (and I'm Jewish!). These days you can buy it for about as much as the DVD costs, and it's a wonderful Christmas gift. Unless, of course, the person you're buying it for already owns it."},{"Title":"A Charlie Brown Christmas: The Making of a Tradition","review":"I purchased this book yesterday, and it's beautifully done. Includes entire script of film with glossy prints of many cells. Includes sheet music and production notes as well as many wonderful photos and reminicenses of how the film came to be. I'm enjoying it!"},{"Title":"A Charlie Brown Christmas: The Making of a Tradition","review":"This book is for anybody who's seen A Charlie Brown Christmas virtually every year it's been on TV or via VHS or DVD.It includes storyboards of the Ford commercials which featured Linus and Lucy back in 1962 (3 years before this classic TV special debuted). Not only that, it features advertisements in TV guide, an interview with Bill Melendez, who animated all the Peanuts specials and films up to Charles Schulz's untimely death in 2000), and a few essays from Lee Mendelson, who worked side by side with Melendez on each of the specials. It also features a few words from Peter Robins (the 1st voice of Charlie Brown) and Chris Shea (who played Linus). You also get a tribute to Vince Guaraldi who composed the music (not to mention that it includes the sheet music for \\"Linus and Lucy\\" and \\"Christmastime Is Here\\"). This book mentions how they came up with the adult \\"voices\\" in the specials and Schulz's conditions on working on Charlie Brown Christmas (one was that real children would do the kids' voices, and another was that the Gospel of Luke was present in the script in order to remind the audience the true meaning of Christmas).Most importantly, this book includes the entire script of Charlie Brown Christmas with stills from the special. In essence, there is enough information for you to cast your own stage production of A Charlie Brown Christmas. There is one slight error in the script, however- the Peanuts gang is not humming \\"O Little Town of Bethelehem\\" at the finale but \\"Hark the Herald Angels Sing\\" (unless this was written in the original script and changed at the last minute). Finally, turn the pages and you'll see Snoopy cause Charlie Brown to crash into the tree in the one scene that begins the special!Recommended to all Peanuts collectors and all who love the classic special that started it all for Peanuts animation."},{"Title":"A Charlie Brown Christmas: The Making of a Tradition","review":"The world's most recognized cartoon character, ever in our national consciousness, comes alive periodically on TV specials, movies, ads, but never more so during the season of Christmas. He stands before us as the plucky everyman to remind us of the most important message in Christmas, that a babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a manger invites us to visit and worship Him.The background story of how it all came about is as entertaining and instructive as the show itself. The man who turned Charlie Brown and his friends into moving figures, Bill Melendez, says, \\"This little story and the way it's told is almost as simple and direct as Sparky's cartoon strip. The message is so gentle, there's nothing pompous about the story.\\"He recalls, \\"When I first looked at that part of the story, I told Sparky, 'We can't do this. It's too religious.' And he said to Bill, 'if we don't do it, who else can? We're the only ones who can do it.'\\"A grateful nation watches it again and again. May the message sink in."},{"Title":"A Charlie Brown Christmas: The Making of a Tradition","review":"If you always wanted to see music cues or script treatment for this classic, this book is for you. Inclusions of this type are extensive. If you're looking for background, it has that, too. You won't go wrong if you're looking for the real nuts and bolts in great detail. However, if you want a little keepsake picture book, this goes into way more documentation than that. I'm very attached to the program, and enjoyed all the detail included in this book, but it will be overkill for some folks' interest level."},{"Title":"A Charlie Brown Christmas: The Making of a Tradition","review":"\\"Charlie Brown Christmas\\" is the crown jewel of Christmas specials. Heavy on holiday introspection, but with the dry wit and humor you'd come to expect from Charles Schulz's creations.\\"A Charlie Brown Christmas: The Making of a Tradition\\" just expands that experience, by outlining how the famed special came to be -- the music, the animation, the voice acting, even the advertisement to get people to watch it. It's a charming, nostalgic little book, and a good accompaniment.\\"A Charlie Brown Christmas\\" was spun up quickly, when Coca Cola wanted a Christmas special in less than a week -- and Charles Schulz's lovable loser Charlie Brown seemed to be the ticket. But the special was made very differently from other cartoons -- 2-D animation, no laugh track, uncutesy kids, and (horrors!) a jazz soundtrack. It was doomed to fail, they said.Well, instead it became a booming hit, and has been running every December ever since. Lee Mendelson and Bill Melendez reminisce in here about the much-loved Charles Schulz, and about Vince Guaraldi, who made the distinctive piano soundtrack, and why it's so beloved -- it dares to approach holiday ennui and commercialization, then dashes it away with Linus' description of Christmas' meaning.As for the \\"making of\\" portion, there are storyboards, musical scores, test photos, clips of television reviews, and rare photos like Melendez and Schulz doing the football gag. Finally, there is the entire script of the special, framed by colourful stills from the cartoon.You couldn't wring this much information from most half-hour animated specials, no matter how much fun they were. But it's a bit different with \\"Charlie Brown Christmas.\\" It was so completely unusual -- and has proved to be so timeless -- that a book on the making of it, and its effect, seems completely right.It's a very conversational, reminiscent book. It feels like sitting in a room with Melendez and Mendelson, listening to them reminisce about \\"Sparky.\\" And we also get input from other people involved in the project, such as Christopher Shea (Linus), who talks about his famous \\"Second Chapter of Luke\\" speech, as well as odd bits of trivia (the little girl playing Sally had to be fed her lines).The Christmas special is more than able to stand on its own, but \\"Charlie Brown Christmas: The Making of a Tradition\\" is a wonderful accompaniment. Full of interesting tidbits and history."},{"Title":"A Charlie Brown Christmas: The Making of a Tradition","review":"I have wondered, sometimes, what it would be like to go through a Christmas without knowing the wonderful, brilliant cartoon \\"A Charlie Brown Christmas\\" was going to be on the air. I've never lived in such a world, nor do I think I would want to.This book is a look into the process of making what is inarguably one of the most-loved Holiday specials ever. Everything about the cartoon is in here -- from the journey to get it on the air to the dangerously abbreviated production time to the perils of casting real children to play the Peanuts gang -- the first time children played children in American animation, by the way, and some of them were too young to even read their lines.And of course, the piece de resistance, the book includes the complete screenplay, written by the brilliant Charles M. Schulz himself. A sweet, humble man, I doubt he really knew at the time how wonderful his creation was or how important it would become to so many.This is a fabulous book and seems to be designed as a companion to \\"Peanuts: A Golden Celebration,\\" which was released a few years ago. Both of them are simply invaluable for anyone who loves Peanuts."},{"Title":"A Charlie Brown Christmas: The Making of a Tradition","review":"My earliest memories of watching the Charlie Brown Christmas Special, was when I was in kindergarten. I taped the show that year, and prefer my 1985 viewing over any video for sale. Even so, this book by Lee Mendelson tells us the great back story about making the story. Charles Schulz was instrumental in plenty of great decisions: such as the inclusion of Linus's reciting the &quot;true meaning of Christmas,&quot; the use of actual children for the voices of Charlie Brown and the rest of the cast, and the absence of an annoying laugh track. There is even commentary by Bill MElendez, a former Disney animator, who was tasked with prepping and getting the Christmas special ready in 6 months. Even in the beginning, the network executives did not love it, but it ranked #2 in the top 5 of shows after premiering December 9, 1965. We even get insight into Jazz musician Vince Guaraldi, who made the catchy tune &quot;Linus and Lucy,&quot; which all of us associate with the Peanuts gang. The book even includes piano music to play, and an illustrated screenplay of the TV show. I'd recommend buying this book along with the Peanuts 50th anniversay book that was written by Schulz, as well as Peanuts 2000, which chronicles the last year of the comic strip."},{"Title":"A Charlie Brown Christmas: The Making of a Tradition","review":"You don't need to have grown up with Charlie Brown to appreciate this, but of course this will bring back lots of great memories if you did. The book includes reminiscences about Charles Schulz and also lots of glimpses into the creative process (artwork sketches, animation cells, sheet music).Probably 40 percent of the book (essentially the second half) is the illustrated script for \\"A Charlie Brown Christmas\\" in its entirety.Paperback, but thick and almost coffee table book quality."},{"Title":"Biography - Salsitz, Norman (1920-2006): An article from: Contemporary Authors Online","review":"Norman Salsitz was a Polish Jew who went through WWII.

There are all kinds of terrific suggestions for the everyday homeschooler. I like the easy-to-read format. It is almost like a reader - a collection of essays written by many different authors. As a busy homeschool mom, I liked that I could read it in bits and pieces during my free moments and still get so much out of it. The resource section is truly Catholic. I appreciated that I did not have to be on guard for anti-Catholic publishers or Protestant resources. My sister, who sends her children to public school, bought A Catholic Homeschool Treasury to supplement her children's religious education. I also liked the positive tone of the book. It presents all of the wonderful reasons for homeschooling without bashing public or parochial schools. Because of this, I was able to share it with my pastor and parents who were not exactly supportive of homeschooling. This book helped them understand the benefits of homeschooling, without putting them on the defensive. If I had to find fault with the book, it would be that there are not enough practical suggestions for teaching high school. I heard that the authors are writing a sequel that focuses more on teaching the upper grades.

I assign the vocab page, the reading and the script, and then ask questions about the events of the chapter in class he next week. Slowly, as we speak, I begin asking my students the same questions about their own lives (i.e. instead of What's Carlos's favorite subject, What's YOUR favorite subject)The only downfall is that it is an older text, and so the conversation flow is a bit stilted - older words, and no hi tech words at all in each story.

The Toby Peters stories are enjoyable but only that. The Leiberman series has a bit more substance, but still read like the slow second movement of the standard 4 movement symphony. The Fonseca series has just begun. Vengeance was above average (compared to all mystery/suspense/crime/ whatever..writers). Retribution was much in the Leiberman vein--slow, winding down, world-weary ad nauseam. Where Kaminsky SHINES is in his Russian/Rostnikov series. Not all the dozen or so novels have been equally good, but even the weakest presents real, alive, fleshed-out characters, beginning with the truly inimitable Rostnikov (&quot;the washtub&quot;) and his vampire-like underling Emile Karpo, probably the most striking and original continuing character in any myster/suspense series of ALL time. But it is the world of Moscow and the world of the highly-intelligent weight lifting Rostnikov that with his Jewish wife, playwright son (seques into detective), the Yak, the silver haired Colonel and all the colorful characters and settings that make this series vibrate with life. This latest novel, perhaps his best (and, sad to say, perhaps his last) is set up with the usual three plots, unrelated, except for Rostkinov getting involved in more than one. The plots involve the film industry, the space industry and the government funded paranormal acitivities research section. If you haven't read prevevious entries in this series, you will be impressed by this novel with its depth and color and unusually well-done dialogue (for a mystery). But having read all the previous novels, save the first, it is not only a good book but a triumph of Kaminsky in creating and forcing the reader to love and appreciate his characters not just as cogs in a plot (e.g. Lovesey's characters), but having a literary quality, a richness that even Faulkner or Camus would have enjoyed. Cosmonaut is an unalloyed triumph of man, of his spirit, and of the vital diversity that makes man what he/she is.My feeling is that Kaminsky has ended this series, but I would urge him to reconsider--even an average Rostkinov novel is worth two Leiberman's, three Fonsecas, and four Peters. Anyway read this book. It is GREAT."},{"Title":"Fall of a Cosmonaut","review":"The economic and political mess of Russia provides prime hunting grounds for Kaminsky's Edgar Award-winning (&quot;A Cold Red Sunrise&quot;) Porfiry Rostnikov series. &quot;Fall of a Cosmonaut&quot; opens with a prologue set in the crumbling Mir Space station where Rostnikov's name is mentioned by cosmonaut Tsimion Vladovka in the midst of a major unexplained disaster.A year later, Tsimion is missing and Rostnikov, head of Special Investigations, receives an ominous order to find him. Meanwhile, brooding Marxist stoic Emil Karpo and his unassuming partner Arkady Zelach investigate murder in a lab for paranormal research and Elena Timofeyeva (recently affianced to Rostnikov's son Iosef) and Sasha Tkach, his habitual depression overlaid by a peculiar euphoria since his life has bottomed out, are sent to recover a a great Russian epic film being held for exorbitant ransom.The character-driven narrative shifts from case to case, encompassing the points of view of each investigator as well as various witnesses, victims and villains. The tone is a cross between Ed McBain's 87th Precinct (a particular favorite of Rostnikov's) and the Zen practicality of Janwillem van de Wetering. Personal developments entwine with investigations and everything is complicated by the daily difficulties of Russian life and occasional political incursions.Kaminsky, who also writes the Toby Peters and Abe Lieberman series, delivers another well-constructed, well-written entertainment."},{"Title":"Fall of a Cosmonaut","review":"If you have read the other books in this Russian series by Stuart Kaminsky I think that you will agree that this one stands out. It is like getting a letter from home bringing you up to date on what is happening to close friends or even members of your family. The characters are interesting and consistent from beginning to end. I would recommend that you read the previous books in sequence to build the background necessary to grow fully attached to the characters but it is still a good stand-alone story. I certainly hope that this is not the last in the series."},{"Title":"Fall of a Cosmonaut","review":"In Russia, the Office of Special Investigations handles those cases that are too difficult to solve or too political to handle by the regular law enforcement types. The investigators are free to do what is necessary to solve the case, but the Director decides what to do with the findings.Currently, the Office is working three cases simultaneously. Chief Inspector Porfiry Petrovich Rostnikov and his son Ioset look into the disappearance of a cosmonaut Apparently Vladovka has damaging secrets that force the head of security at Star City to want the man returned immediately.Sasha Tkach and Elena Timofeyna investigate the stealing of the negative of a multimillion-dollar movie on the life of Tolstoy that is heading to Cannes. The thief demands two million in American dollars.Emil Karpo and Akarcy Zelach check into the murder of a researcher at the Center for the Study of Technological parapsychology. Someone used a hammer to smack the victim numerous times till he died.Through the seemingly different cases and the personal lives of the investigators, readers gain a taste of modern Russian society. This enables the audience to care for what happens to the crew of Office of Special Investigations. The story line is entertaining as all three inquiries are fun to observe and ultimately tie together into one stirring plot. Still, the inside look at Russia makes Stuart M. Kaminsky's police procedural a tale worth reading by more than just sub-genre fans, who already know that this is a top-rate series.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Fall of a Cosmonaut","review":"Stuart M. Kaminsky continues his Inspector Porfiry Rostnikov series in grand style--grand, that is, if you like suspense, excitement, great characterization, superb plot--in general, great reading.In this, the 13th of the series, Rostnikov's name is mentioned by a cosmonaut on board the space station Mir (If anything goes wrong, says Tsimion Vladkova as he relates an emergency situation on board, \\"please inform Porfiry Petrovich Rostnikov.\\"). Of course, something does go wrong. Vladkova returns to earth, then disappears. Rostnikov is told to find him, and his superiors are more than just a little curious as to why the cosmonaut should refer specifically to him! However, locating a \\"fallen cosmonaut\\" is not as easy as it seems; the Inspector knows that his case has the highest priority. No one knows if the Vladkova is dead, kidnapped, or has simply disappeared on his own. The government is concerned because he possesses valuable secrets!As usual, Kaminsky has more than one story going on at the same time, all interrelated, and all equally exciting. One sub-plot deals with a movie director working on the life of Tolstoy whose film negatives have been stolen and are being held for ransom; another involves the undertakings at a paranormal research center, where the director is found murdered.It takes the skill, the intellect, the presence of Rostnikov and his crew (Sasha Tkach, Emile Karpo, Elena Timofeyeva, and Arkady Zelach) to sort out and to solve all these problems. Kaminsky seems to have post-Iron Curtain Russia's \\"number\\" and \\"Fall of a Cosmonaut\\" only enhances the series! (Billyjhobbs@tyler.net)"},{"Title":"Fall of a Cosmonaut","review":"One of the distressing aspects of finding a terrific mystery series is when the author seems to have abandoned the effort. Fall of a Cosmonaut is the 13th of 14 Stuart Kaminsky Porfiry Rostnikov mysteries, and he hasn't written a new one since 2001. Having a mystery series set in Russia could be extremely depressing, but through the eyes of Porfiry Rosnikov, we see the eternal hopefulness that keeps Russians from the depths of despair.In 1986, a serious problem develops on the Mir space station. While the problem is catastrophic, the cosmonauts land safely and a big hush campaign begins to keep this big secret. But a year later, the cosmonauts on board (along with the three sent to relieve them) are being murdered systematically, or end up dead under mysterious circumstances. Rostnikov and his son, Iosef, are assigned to discover the location of one of the cosmonauts who seems to have simply vanished. At the same time, Emil Karpo and Akardy Zelach are trying to find the person who murdered a scientist at the Center for the Study of Technical Parapsychology. And Sasha Tkach and Elena Timofeyeva are after the person who has stolen an unreleased film to be shown at the Cannes Film Festival on the life of Tolstoy.Kaminsky is always first rate in his plot development, but this book is even more enjoyable than his previous efforts. Some of the most comical moments involve \\"the vampire,\\" Emil Karpo. The stern Karpo does not believe in emotion, imagination or the paranormal. Yet while investigating the murder of the institute's director, this skeptic is exposed to more than a few examples of visions, telepathy and clairvoyance. Even the slow-witted Zelach seems to have paranormal gifts, and those at the institute are anxious to study him.Fall of a Cosmonaut is the 7th book I have read in this series, and knowing that I'm now halfway done, maybe I'll try to stretch them out just a little more. It would be a shame to go through them quickly and then not be able to look forward."},{"Title":"Fall of a Cosmonaut","review":"As in all previous books, Chief Inspector Porfiry Petrovich Rostnikov has three cases to solve simultaneously. All the cases have been taken on by the Office of Special Investigation because the Yak (Igor Yaklovev) sees a chance to discover information that will allow him to continue his political agenda to become Minister of the Interior.The cases are:1) the disappearance of a cosmonaut;2) the theft of the final negative of a Russian movie epic on the life of Tolstoy;3) the murder of a parapsychologist.What makes the first case so unusual is that the Yak tells Rostnikov to find the Cosmonaut and then call him. Oddly enough the cosmonaut had, in his last message from space, asked that should anything happen to him, Porfiry Petrovich should be called in on the case. Porfiry is not to ask him any questions or to listen to a confession, only to bring him directly to the Yak and then leave. Porfiry decides to take Iosef with him as they search for the missing cosmonaut.Sasha and Elena are assigned to find the negative from the film and to protect the director whose life has been threatened. There are a myriad of suspects, but Elena is the one who figures out that the culprit is an ardent chess player (not unusual in Russia) based on the way he conducts the negotiations and how he speaks. She also suspects that the wife of the director, who was once an actress is also involved in some way.Emil Karpo (the Vampire) and Arkady Zelach (the slouch) are assigned to the murder at the Center for the Study of Technical Parapsychology. To his dismay Zelach who has been having 'visions' since he was beaten finds that one of the investigators has discovered his unusual gift and is very interested in researching them (as well as Arkady).As always, Kaminsky uses a deft hand in the way the stories are brought to closure and who is the culprit is not always who ends up being designated as the 'bad guy'. Over the years, Kaminsky has spent quite a bit of time in these novels, discussing the idea of Justice versus Prosecution. Does the actual crime result in a situation where the perpetrator is more deserving of justice than the victim?There are also some nice asides about the relationship between Sasha and his mother, Zelach and his mother, Porfiry and just about everyone, and Elena and Iosef."},{"Title":"Fall of a Cosmonaut","review":"I have read a number of Kaminsky's Toby Peters' mysteries (and highly recommend them!), but this was my first experience with Porfiry Petrovich Rostnikov and his team of Moscow investigators and I found myself quite interested in the mysteries that Kaminsky puts before the reader. Disappearing cosmonauts, murder at a paranormal research facility, and a movie producer threatened with death and worse, the destruction of his movie, all tie together in a neat package reminiscent of Ed McBain's fine procedurals. But you never forget you're in Russia, the cultural aspects and locales are always part of the story. The three mysteries and the characters that take the lead are of varying interest; I can honestly say I felt little concern for Sasha and his marital problems, but Karpov's Spock-like approach was intriguing and Rostnikov is a charismatic character, a wise investigator working valiantly to find justice in the occasionally grey area of Russia's political climate."},{"Title":"Fall of a Cosmonaut","review":"Stuart Kaminsky makes no secret that the Inspector Profiry Rostnikov novels are inspired by the &quot;87th Precinct&quot; books by Ed McBain. Indeed, Rostnikov himself can ofter be found re-reading a dog-eared copy of one of the 87th Precinct books. Like their model, the Rostnikov novels usually depict a detective squad working multiple cases, seeking the little clues which eventually will point their way to solutions to the mysteries. The world of Inspector Rostnikov -- the Soviet Union and, in the later novels, post-Soviet Russia -- is even more morally ambiguous than McBain's fictional city of Isola, and Rostnikov often finds himself between serving justice and enforcing the law. I find Rostnikov, the gentle, physically powerful detective whose greatest relaxation is found in repairing faulty plumbing, to be one of the most appealing characters in modern crime fiction, a man both wise and compassionate. &quot;Fall of a Cosmonaut&quot; is another strong addition to the series, with the detectives pursuing three seperate mysteries while the stories of their personal lives advance yet further. I must emphasize that the Rostnikov books really should be read in order for maximimum enjoyment, as the characters and the crises in their lives progress from novel to novel and much would be lost if their futures were to be relieved too soon by reading out of order."},{"Title":"Fall of a Cosmonaut","review":"Life goes on for investigators with the Office of Special Investigation, Moscow, former Soviet Union. In his Porfiry Petrovich Rostnikov series, Stuart M. Kaminsky has deftly transplanted the Ed McBain police procedural to Russia: individual detectives, each having his/her own serial back stories, investigating different cases. And through the time span of the series, the reader also watches the Soviet Union disintegrate. In this, the 13th installment of the series, Putin is in power in Russia and the men and sole woman of the OSI are tracking down a missing Mir Cosmonaut, the theft of a major motion picture negative on the life of Tolstoy - due to premiere soon in Cannes, and the murder of a research physiologist at the Moscow Center for the Study of Technical Parapsychology.This is not a \\"cozy\\" Jessica Fletcher-type murder mystery series. The brooding of the Russian soul is frequently mentioned. \\"The Yak,\\" former KGB functionary, is directing Rostnikov, and the one-legged decorated veteran of the War Against Nazi Aggression must \\"walk a tight-rope\\" between his conscience and the ever-shifting Powers That Be. The spectre of Chernobyl and the tension and power-struggles in the wake of the Soviet Union loom constantly in the background. Prolific author Kaminsky gives the reader a feel for the people and politics while raconting a riveting tale."},{"Title":"WISHING SEASON","review":"My daughter, who is 14 really liked this book, but I found it first ! (I reccomended it to her !) There is a little bit of a love story in it and alot of wise-cracking. The mishaps that the genies and humans go through are hilarious. As a parent I was happy that the language was clean and yet still funny. It was a real light-hearted read, and after reading it, we immediately bought a copy."},{"Title":"Areopagitica","review":"It is strange, indeed, that a great work such as Milton's Areopagitica should be issued in a redacted version--that is to say, edited to modernize the poet's vocabulary and usage: in a word, to impose political correctness on his essay. This is the worst sort of historical revisionism. In a sense, A. S. Ash--the editor--has seen fit to censor a work which decries censorship and he stands condemned by the work he has edited.The book is part of the Little Humanist Classics series, which attempts to introduce &quot;the humanist pronouns HU, HUS, and HUM wherever the reference is to a third person generally, without reference to sex.&quot; This edition also substitutes &quot;adulthood&quot; for &quot;manhood&quot; and modernizes certain other archaisms in Milton's language.I sympathize completely with an effort to make English non-sexist, but I see no need to re-issue the classics (Milton, Tolstoi, Plato, Whitman, etc.) in expurgated, politically correct versions.As far as the modernization of vocabulary, this seems hardly necessary with Milton, whose English is not as far removed from us as Chaucer's. After all, Milton is a bit more modern than Shakespeare, whose works are intelligible to most literate adults.For those who prefer to read the Areopagitica as Milton wrote it, I recommend the Everman edition of the Complete English Poems, edited by Gordon Campbell. This volume includes the essays &quot;Of Education&quot; and &quot;Areopagitica.&quot;Hopefully, the language will evolve to a non-sexist state--living languages are very good at changing. But I doubt if the humanist agenda and its invented pronouns will win out over the great, slow, glacial tide of usage that has given us modern English and will, no doubt, produce something better than HU, HUS, and HUM."},{"Title":"Areopagitica","review":"Let the buyer beware! I should have recalled this adage and examined my purchase more carefully.I am now the owner of writings by the new John Milton, a politically correct John Milton, a John Milton that rejects manhood for adulthood and rejects man for person. This new Milton embraces the humanist pronouns hu and hus and hum, non-sexist third person pronouns. He, his and him and she, her and hers are no more.Milton's quotation of Euripides is likewise changed. Euripides now says' \\"And hu who can and will, deserves high praise\\". Euripides stands corrected.Milton's use of archaic English has also been modernized. Milton has cast aside much of his seventeenth century English. This Bandanna Books version of John Milton is no longer John Milton, but an altered, censored revision.Ironically, in the essay Areopagitica John Milton is arguing to the Parliament of England for freedom of the press, specifically for the liberty of unlicensed printing. Would John Milton have approved this modern, secular, nonsexist version of his essay?Milton would have agreed that Bandanna Books had a right to publish, but I suspect that he would have argued that that Bandanna Books had a moral obligation to label the book cover to indicate that Milton's essay had been significantly altered to fit a peculiar nonsexist standard.Bandanna Books in Santa Barbara, California offers other humanist works including Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass, Plato's Apology and Crito, and commentaries by Confucius. Unless you find comfort in hu, hus, and hum, I suggest that the traditional Whitman, Plato, and Confucius might be adequate and that you look elsewhere. Let the buyer beware!"},{"Title":"Areopagitica","review":"Prospective buyers of this edition should be aware that it is edited; some of Milton's words have been changed, either to modernize or to &quot;humanize&quot; (that is, eliminate sexist usages by the replacement of he/she, him/her, etc. with bizarre &quot;hu&quot;, &quot;hum,&quot; etc. This is not a worthy edition of Milton's great text!"},{"Title":"Areopagitica","review":"As the editor of this edition of Areopagitica in the 1970s, I had been upset at the marginalization of women in John Milton's male-oriented language, specifically in the \\"universal he\\" pronoun. Various approaches to sexist language within the academic world have been tried: using \\"he and she\\" throughout, alternate \\"he\\" with \\"she\\" throughout, use \\"s/he\\" or \\"he/she\\" or other combinations to qualify for gender neutrality. In my enthusiasm for gender fairness, I came up with what seemed to me to be a logical, elegant solution for the pronoun problem. Specifically, these were \\"hu,\\" \\"hus,\\" and \\"hum\\" in place of he, his, him. These seemed to me to be unmistakeable for anything else (except possibly \\"hum\\").Why did Milton never use \\"she\\" in his statements? In the 17th century, almost no girls or women went to school and few were literate, so one might say that it was accurate at the time. Does that mean that his arguments for freedom of the press should still apply only for men in the Twenty-First Century?Reaction to my modernizing the language has been mixed. People were generally OK with the change, but a few were appalled that I had the temerity to tinker with Milton's language. Although the issue is still strong with me, especially as I have become transgender M2F myself in the meantime, I have been willing to regress to the original pronouns, with the hope that women can understand the setting in which Milton wrote, read past the snub to the important message about censorship and freedom of printing, which is a foundational document. The current printing of Areopagitica has the restored pronouns."},{"Title":"Areopagitica","review":"Areopagitica by John Milton. Published by MobileReference (mobi)Anytime one looks at a work in another historical context, consideration of time and place must be given if the communicator's message is to make sense.

To the reviewers below-get over it-As a woman, I appreciate it, this is not some politically sensitive wordage, it's inclusive wordage. I am not a man, mankind does NOT mean humankind, and during John Milton's time women were being burned on stakes, so his outlook especially torwards women was dim, and very well could have been reflected in this book, if it wasn't for the publishers insights regarding this. This is an excellent account of one of the original ideas for free speech in this country. This book will particularly interest those who are in media studies."},{"Title":"Women of Steel: Female Bodybuilders and the Struggle for Self-Definition","review":"This is a really interesting book indeed that points out that there is a male hegemony that dictates how female bodybuilders develop and present themselves. Its a constant struggle for bodybuilders because they never know whether they need to develop more muscle or go for a softer more feminine look and are in a state of constant confusion and frustration. These women who represent power are really quite powerless in their sport the author asserts. Its a very interesting read but I deducted one star because the author has a terrible habit of having passages of some great quotes from bodybuilders and the contest judges and then she proceeds to simply repeat what was just in the quote. Its like reading the same thing twice. It is annoying indeed. Still I do recommend this book for female bodybuilding fans."},{"Title":"Women of Steel: Female Bodybuilders and the Struggle for Self-Definition","review":"I enjoyed this book and found it provided some fascinating perspectives on women in bodybuilding. This narrative research report examines the motivations, relationships and formative experiences of female bodybuilders. The insights lifted the two dimensional physique pictures of athletes to a deep,rich and empathic portrayal of women in a largely frustrating sport.It's hard to believe that women who are so strong are dominated by shallow definitions of 'femininity' and by the unimaginative, sexist male gatekeepers of the industry. The research is a little dated (1992), and the small sample size of female bodybuilders did not provide sufficient diversity to broaden application of findings. I was left hoping that follow-up research would be conducted on these athletes, to examine their departure from the sport and the effects of their bodybuilding history on their current life."},{"Title":"Women of Steel: Female Bodybuilders and the Struggle for Self-Definition","review":"Let me save you the money and trouble of ordering this book. I will state the essential arguments put forth in this small-type tome, minus the repetition that causes these few sentences to swell to fill 150 pages: 1) Joe and Ben Weider own the sport of bodybuilding, exercising a \\"hegemonic\\" and monopolistic control unparalleled in any other pro sport. 2) Whether because of old-world thinking or economic reality, they decree what kind of female physique will win the top awards, favoring symmetry over muscularity and insisting on a show of femininity in the forms of heavy makeup and breast implants. 3) As long as the Weiders hold the purse strings, women bodybuilders who want to earn a living from the sport will have to limit their muscularity if they expect to succeed. There, I think that about sums it up. I have also included the author's favorite word, \\"hegemonic\\", which appears in this book more times than I have ever heard the word used previously in my life. Finally, there are some nice photos of women bodybuilders, who manage to look both sexy and sinewy, but you can find these online elsewhere free."},{"Title":"Women of Steel: Female Bodybuilders and the Struggle for Self-Definition","review":"This is a very informative book on women in the realm of body building, but the writing is really poor to horrible. There are numerous iterations and reiterations and it's very hard to believe this was written by a graduate student, HOWEVER, the information is worth wading through the bad writing for."},{"Title":"Women of Steel: Female Bodybuilders and the Struggle for Self-Definition","review":"my approach to the book was psychological, e.g., what drives these women? what are they like? i was surprised, in this post-reagan era, to come across a dialectical piece focusing on, yes, some psychological aspects of this subculture but on the socioeconomic strata as well--surprised to find these powerful female athletes toeing the line for a patriarchy (the Weiders et al.) out to make a buck off their hard work &amp; looks. also, it seems no one is really very certain what to make or think of the feats of these women, how to respond to them. it is as if the impetus to sculpt one's body were in the challenge presented by the obstinate weight itself, dunning the desire of the lifter--you've either gotta love the work, be obsessively driven by it or, like most of us, be repulsed or bored by it. it also doesn't seem to be as healthy as it ought to be, what with steroid use &amp; mad, dehydrating diets. still it is a vaguely admirable endeavor, perhaps moreso for a female than a male, considering the pressures &amp; lack of equitable rewards."},{"Title":"Lenten Lands: My Childhood with Joy Davidman and C.S. Lewis","review":"Whomever the book is about... The title clearly indicates, but does tend to make most think it is primarily about Lewis and Joy. At any rate, it comes across as readable but dry. It seems to be about a boy lost in a confusing life filled with loss who then seeks desperately for his own worth. Sadly he seems to find his worth mostly in who his mother and stepfather were. If that is the sort of story you seek, then this is your book."},{"Title":"Lenten Lands: My Childhood with Joy Davidman and C.S. Lewis","review":"I sincerely wanted to give this book five stars. I wanted to give it the highest recommendation and praise. I'm sorry to say, however, that I can't. I'm a very fervent C.S. Lewis fan. He has always been one of my heroes and role models, and his life is just as, if not more interesting than the amazing man's literature. I've read several biographies on Lewis, and plan to read many more in the future, all of which, I'm sure, will be better than &quot;Lenten Lands&quot;.I've corresponded with Doug Gresham some, so you can image how I feel giving this book only three stars. Here are my reasons: the book has very little to do with Lewis himself, or even his marriage with Joy Gresham. This book concentrates nearly %70 on Doug Gresham's life. It started to get really old, and by the time Lewis passed away about half way through the book I simply couldn't take any more. No offence, Mr. Gresham, but I'm not too interested in how many girls you had crushes on during your youth. He describes lying on a sofa with one, holding each other tight, during his teen years. And yet he contends that he didn't have a sexual relationship? I'm sorry, but that doesn't sound like a very Christian attitude to me. I thought this was a biography of the famous Christian apologist and author C.S. Lewis, but obviously I was wrong.I only gave this book three stars because of respect to Mr. Lewis. It is a book that claims to be about him and his life with Joy Gresham, and for that I must at least concede a little. There are numerous other biographies written by close friends of Jack, such as Walter Hooper's &quot;The Inklings&quot;, or Sayer's &quot;Jack&quot;. If you want much more in depth information, without a lot of side stories and useless facts about Mr. Gresham's life, then please check out one of the other great biographies. All I can say is I'm regretful about this book. It could have been very good."},{"Title":"Lenten Lands: My Childhood with Joy Davidman and C.S.

If you ever saw the movie, \\"Shadowlands\\", you would definitely enjoy this book! I was left wondering what happened to Joy's little boy at the end of the movie and I found this book breathtaking to hear what he did with the rest of his life. No, maybe he didn't do anything \\"extravagent\\" (whatever that means to different people), but he did become a christian and is living his life following Jesus. THAT is what is important!!I loved the book! And whether you are a C.S. Lewis fan or not, you can enjoy and appreciate the writings of Douglas Gresham because he in fact was closer to C.S.

Lewis","review":"\\"I think I hid my face in Mother's skirt, for I was keenly disappointed. Here was a man who was on speaking terms with King Peter, with the Great Lion, Aslan himself. Here was the man who had been to Narnia; surely he should at least wear silver chain mail and be girt about with a jewel-encrusted sword-belt.\\" ~Douglas Gresham upon first meeting his step-father, C.S. Lewis.You may very well associate the name C.S. Lewis with such literary masterpieces as \\"Mere Christianity,\\" \\"The Screwtape Letters,\\" or \\"The Great Divorce.\\" Perhaps, you are more a visual person, relying solely on movies for entertainment, so the name of Lewis brings to mind of course the new Narnia series that made it's debut only five or six years ago.Despite the elements with which you associate him, the name of C.S. Lewis invokes a magical awe and mystical reverence in all our educated minds. He is an enigma which shook the very foundations of conventional Christianity with his great works. And before reading \\"Lenten Lands,\\" it never once occured to me, that this man, this literary great of the 20th Century, may be anything less than absolutely perfect in his manner and speech. Unfortunately, I made the mistake, as so many of us do, of using his works as a sort of means of defining the person that he was 100% of the time.Written by Douglas Gresham, his step-son, this engaging real-life account recalls for the reader the trials of C.S. Lewis as you have never known them before. Gresham successfully humanizes this great man, without demeaning him in the eyes of his readership...a feat that could have only been accomplished by someone who was not only close to Lewis, but revered him as well. Lewis was not perfect, but he practiced what he preached as much as any man could. He was generous, so much so that the recipients of his gifts believed him to be wealthy, though he was utterly convinced of his own poverty.Upon reading \\"Lenten Lands,\\" be prepared to meet C.S. Lewis the person, not Lewis the author."},{"Title":"Lenten Lands: My Childhood with Joy Davidman and C.S.

Douglas comes across as a friendly sort, of average intelligence, but for those of you looking for an in-depth Lewis book, you've come to wrong place. Most of this volume is about Douglas, and Lewis dies half-way through this book.One of the most shocking things about this book is the omission is that, to the most part of his brother, David. David has only a walk-on role in this book; from the few mentionings of him, you would think he was Lewis' mailman and not his stepson or Doug's brother.All in all, this book does give some more light on Lewis, but it's not indepth at all. I would recommend first looking at your library to see if it has a copy than to spend cold hard cash on this."},{"Title":"Lenten Lands: My Childhood with Joy Davidman and C.S.

Gresham was eight years old when his mother took him and his brother to England to meet the writer; in time, she and Lewis married. Gresham's mother died when he was fifteen and Lewis died three years later.The subtitle of this book - \\"My childhood with Joy Davidman and C. S. Lewis\\" - is misleading, because he has little to say about them. Gresham was away at school throughout their marriage and his descriptions of Lewis are vague, indicating he didn't know him well. The book should have ended with Jack's death, but goes on at length about Gresham's adult life which was uneventful. Fans of C. S.

Lewis","review":"If, as one reviewer states, you are an ardent fan of C.S. Lewis, you will want to read this book. The opposite is true, too. If you are not particularly interested in C. S. Lewis, this is a forgettable book, not very interesting. I am not particularly interested in C.S. Lewis, I'm not going to see \\"Narnia,\\" I never read the Narnia books as a kid. I wanted to read this because I saw \\"Shadowlands\\" and wanted to know what happened to the little boy after his mother died.What stands out the most is Gresham's writing style: rather like that of the people who send anecdotes to Reader's Digest. It's clear enough, rather rambling, rather predictable imagery, lots of repetition. Not very interesting. I didn't even finish reading it.So, my recommendation, if you're not a fan of C. S. Lewis, is to skip this book, and watch \\"Shadlowlands\\" when it comes on television again - it is beautiful and stands on its own."},{"Title":"Lenten Lands: My Childhood with Joy Davidman and C.S. Lewis","review":"No true die-hard student of C.S. Lewis can pass on a reading of this book, and here's why:Lenten Lands provides a perspective of Lewis that you can get nowhere else... the perspective of a stepson.There are many books about Lewis the academician, Lewis the lay-theologian... Lewis the prolific author/poet... but a first-hand account of Lewis the around-the-house stepdad? Trust me, you will find THAT nowhere but here!And it's an important perspective, this day-to-day life at the Kilns in Oxford, because many misconceptions about Lewis are cleared up in the midst of Douglas Gresham's recollections.As other reviewers have noted, this is technically a biography of Douglas Gresham rather than of C.S. Lewis. The opening chapters are of the Gresham family in Staatsburg, New York. Then, in 1953, as a child, Douglas met Lewis for the first time in Oxford. By this time, Joy Davidman (Douglas' mother) was already acquainted with Lewis. Three years later (1956) the two were married in the Registry Office, but not before Joy's illness was already fairly advanced. The following year (1957) their vows are re-instated by the Rev. Peter Bide in Wingfield-Morris Hospital. Three years later Joy dies from cancer.Then, three years after this, on a somber November evening while eighteen-year-old Douglas is still digesting the fact that President Kennedy has just been assassinated, he receives the news that Lewis has died.\\"On that day... there was a bitter stillness about the world; for the second time in my life everything I knew, everything I held dear and the one person I loved had been swept away.\\" I found this portion of the book to be especially moving.The following year (1964) Douglas' birth father commits suicide.A few final chapters tell of Douglas' own marriage and settlings in Tasmania and mainland Australia.But the bulk of Lenten Lands consists of Douglas' decade of knowing C.S. Lewis. A very well-written book, the title being borrowed from a phrase in Joy's epitaph, written by Lewis.As I read Lenten Lands I was reminded of something C.S. Lewis said long before ever knowing the Greshams. In his \\"Abolition of Man\\" (published 1943) he said \\"I myself do not enjoy the society of small children... I recognize this as a defect in myself.\\"Again, in a private letter to his friend Arthur Greeves (December 1935) Lewis commented \\"I theoretically hold that one ought to like children, but I am shy with them in practice.\\"Yet Douglas concludes that his decade of knowing Lewis was a \\"privilege\\"... \\"a gift of education and experience greater than some of us gain in a lifetime.\\"His statement confirms my own suspicion about Lewis... that he was a man of such inner greatness, that he proved to be good even at the things he was not good at."},{"Title":"Lenten Lands: My Childhood with Joy Davidman and C.S. Lewis","review":"First I must say that I am a bit put off with reviews suggesting that this wonderful book is, to paraphrase, too much about Doug Gresham and not enough about C.S. Lewis. If you'll read the subtitle, it clearly indicates that this is a book about Doug's childhood with his mother and step-father.Taking this book for what it is, and what I believe it was intended to be, I feel I am able to see through the eyes of a young Doug Gresham, as well as an older Doug (who wrote this much later in life), and get a lot closer to a &quot;true&quot; image of Lewis. This book allows me to see a perspective of Lewis that no other author could possibly offer.I know that when my own father died almost two years ago, the glowing eulogy given was truly wonderful, but only touched on the essence of the man I knew my father to be.I feel that with this book, readers are offered a glimpse of Lewis that no one other than Doug could offer, and not yet another glowing eulogy offered by many other authors, nor a misguided critique offered by many writers who never even met the man.Additionally, Doug is quite a gifted writer, and this is evident of his accounts of Lewis' life throughout the book.And I would also add that over the past several years, Doug has become someone I consider to be a good friend as well, and I can tell you without any hesitation, he is one of the most direct and honest people I know. If I want the truth, read this book."},{"Title":"Lenten Lands: My Childhood with Joy Davidman and C.S. Lewis","review":"Unlike some reviewers, I found Lenten Lands well-written, poignant, and honest, though it dies a bit towards the end. (As auto-biographies often do -- if the author doesn't die first, like Moses.) I am not sure why some reviewers complain that Douglas chose to tell his story, even if his memories of Lewis were not as full, say, as George Sayers, and he has lived a fairly simple, even blue-color, life at times. Greshem's descriptions of growing up, the houses he lived in, taking the boat to England, London and Oxford, and the Kilns, were all interesting to me, though as a fan of Lewis I was of course anticipating scenes of his life. Greshem brings nature, his feelings, the drama of watching his mother come to love C. S. Lewis and the love returned, then her death, to life. The scene in which his dying but still fiercely defensive mother confronts a trespasser with a shotgun, C. S. Lewis standing alarmed at her side, and yells, \\"Get out of my line of fire, Jack!\\", and the scenes that follow, made me laugh for a fair chunk of an hour.I didn't expect this book to all be about Lewis; hasn't he had enough pure biographies already? I was pleased to learn much more about Joy, whom Douglas and \\"Jack\\" both greatly loved. (Having read her Smoke on the Mountain, I agree she had talent and insight -- though Douglas' claim that she was an intellectual match for Lewis should be described as filial, I think.) Lenten Lands seemed to me an honest and thoughtful story, and I found myself reading it very quickly."},{"Title":"Lenten Lands: My Childhood with Joy Davidman and C.S. Lewis","review":"This is one of those books I think any authentic admirer of C.S.Lewis should read because Douglas H. Gresham writes so empathetically as well as objectively of his Mother Joy and his step father 'Jack' Lewis. Seeing these two people thru his eyes from childhood to young adulthood is fascinating. Be it the feel of his Mothers embrace that made him feel safe, to how mature his view was of his father who had problems with alcohol. Where some people would have been harsh or mean in how they saw such a parent Douglas was able to see beyond the issue of alcohol to something deeper.Reading of his first impressions of C. S. Lewis and his brother Warnie again shows reality vs visions one has in their heads of things and people not yet seen. From the cigarette stained teeth to the evening visits to the local pub, Douglas bring a sense of humanness to the great author. And his descriptions of the places he/they lived are so real one feels as if they are a fly on the wall.The thing that makes me appreciate Douglas so much is how the lessons he saw and was taught have taken root in his life . He now lives in Ireland and is active in walk the community helping women with unwanted pregnancies.So the nasty comment by reviewer Kona (Emerald City) 'The problem with this book is that Douglas Gresham did nothing in his own life to warrant an autobiography' makes me wonder just how much of the book did they actually read, since having taken the priceless lessons that the great C.S.Lewis wrote and taught and putting them to day to day use, makes Douglas well worthy of being an author. The title is after all 'Lenten Lands: My Childhood with Joy Davidman and C.S. Lewis'."},{"Title":"Lenten Lands: My Childhood with Joy Davidman and C.S. Lewis","review":". . .written by one of Joy Davidman's sons (and CS Lewis's stepson).This is not a book primarily about CS Lewis. It is not a book primarily about Joy Davidman. Those who pick up this volume looking for a \\"biography\\" will be disappointed. Rather, the book is a painful exploration of the trials and tribulations of a young man faced with:1) abuse by a violent father (whom he still loved)2) the controversial marriage of his mother to a prominent public figure (whom he also loved, despite a sometimes difficult relationship)3) the illness and death of his mother (1960)4) the illness and death of his stepfather (1963)5) the illness and suicide of his father (1964)6) the normal \\"angst\\" of the growing-up years.Considered from this perspective, I suspect that the book was a form of catharsis for Douglas; a sort of \\"coming-to-grips\\" with years of pain and uncertainty.This sort of \\"from the heart\\" revealatory book will NOT suit all tastes (as is evident from the tenor of some of the other reviews). But taken for what it is, the book provides valuable insight into the Lewis \\"family\\"."},{"Title":"Lenten Lands: My Childhood with Joy Davidman and C.S. Lewis","review":"I don't agree with some of the other reviews here; this is a really good book. Lewis doesn't die halfway through the book, more about three quarters of the way through. But up until that point, its very interesting and it gives, in my opinion, tons of new insight into Lewis' persona and everyday life. The only thing that really bugs me about this book is Gresham's writing style; its very wordy and comma happy, making it difficult to read at times. Some of his analogies and placed adjectives are, without meaning to be, really hysterical, stemming from the fact that they are so corny. But overall, I'm glad I read this book. There's some really interesting passages in here, especially those giving insight into the Lewis' lives after Joy dies. Also there are a few surprises in there I wasn't expecting. Probably you should get this book out of the library before you buy it, but only because it won't be to everyone's taste."},{"Title":"Lenten Lands: My Childhood with Joy Davidman and C.S. Lewis","review":"Many books have been written about C.S. Lewis and his works, but it is rare for books to be written in this field by those who knew him, particually by his own relatives. A candid and thoughtful account, this is not only a book about C.S.Lewis and Joy Davidman Lewis, but also the memoirs of the early life of his author. On both those accounts a delightful book has been produced which is difficult to put down, and which produces a picture where memories of warmth and pain mingle in proportion to each other"},{"Title":"Lenten Lands: My Childhood with Joy Davidman and C.S. Lewis","review":"In the preface Greshman makes it clear that the book is his story about his life. No doubt the publisher thought it necessary to throw \\"My Childhood with Joy Davidman and C.S. Lewis\\" on the cover because this is the reason why we care about Douglas Greshman.Most of the book is about his early life and there is much on his mother Joy and Lewis. I found the parts that had nothing to do with Joy and Lewis to be enjoyable too. Gresham is a very good writer and you get a feel for what it was like to grow up in England in the 1950's.Only the last few chapters deal with his life after the death of Lewis. But in some ways, this is an important part of the Lewis story. Why you ask? Because we see how little Gresham, Lewis' stepson, benefited from being his stepson. Greshman was dirt poor and barely getting by. What happened to Lewis' money? Why were Lewis' two stepsons not in his will?Whatever one thinks about the book overall, it is an essential piece of C.S. Lewis history. Greshman saw Lewis up close and personal. He gives insights that few others can. Even if he did not live with Lewis all the time (he was at boarding school), he still lived with Lewis some of the time, and this is more than most. His memories are invaluable."},{"Title":"Lenten Lands: My Childhood with Joy Davidman and C.S. Lewis","review":"Like several previous reviewers, when I started Lenten Lands, I expected more about Jack and Joy Lewis themselves, but found that Lenten Lands is actually Doug Gresham's autobiography. But unlike several previous reviewers, although I am an ardent Lewis fan, I found Lenten Lands to be a touching story and would recommend it heartily even if it contained no reference to Lewis at all. Gresham's writing is open, honest, and straight from the heart. It is very real and full of anecdotes that make you laugh, incidents that make you cry, and scenes that contain a bit of both.I also felt that Lenten Lands had a perspective on Lewis, even if it wasn't a central part of the book, that I do not get from other biographies. Gresham saw a personal side of his stepfather that other biographers don't have.I can't recommend this book enough, whether you are a Lewis fan or simply looking for a good read."},{"Title":"Lenten Lands: My Childhood with Joy Davidman and C.S. Lewis","review":"This book adds to any C.S. Lewis collection. Anyone trying to undertsand better Lewis' life and works will gain some value from this book, but in addition, the book adds value to understanding Joy Davidman, herself a remarkable person and Doug himself. One reviewer is somemwhat upset about the book because the author writes mostly about himself, yes, it is subtitled \\"My Childhood...\\".Doug Gresham is remarkably candid about himself (he directs most criticism at himself, well and the Millers). He is also very forgiving towards his father, which I found instructive for all of us. His insights into Lewis' chairity (both in time and money) and Christian heart are an addition to what a Lewis admirer might already know, but it helps add to the Lewis icon. I do wish he had a wrote more on his brother, but it may be he is keeping in with his brother's wishes (it is well known that David has avoided the Lewis/Davidman limelight).This is a good book, at a great price, and it is a quick, nicely paced read."},{"Title":"The Stone Garden","review":"Usually, scifi lit is very manly, full of men and their machines.

In this espionage thriller by first-time novelist Ken Smith family, war and social upheaval force a young man to discover that for him, honor can't be compromised and a violent, virulent truth can't be evaded.

They were believed extinct until a dog in Meeteetse, Wyoming, killed one who was stealing from his supper dish. Fortunately, that wasn't the last of the ferrets. The Meeteetse community survives, and they have been reintroduced into a few national parks, where they are hanging on. The authors are experts on black-footed ferret biology, and have been active in the recovery programs for this species.Knowing all this, I expected an interesting but somewhat dry account. Well, I was surprised. The book is remarkably lively, at least for the first two-thirds or so.Each chapter starts with a story from a ferret's life, such as a prairie dog kill or a mating. One or more of the authors observed each of these events, and they \\"humanize\\" the animals considerably. After the story, each chapter moves to a discussion of its theme, such as habitat or predatory behavior. These are written in an easy, almost-conversational style (but with too many scientific passive voices). The authors provide a plausible account of the ferret, filling in gaps with reference to closely-related species such as the Siberian ferret.Though not organized as such, the book consists of three parts. The first part covers both ferret and prairie dog ecology, interlaced with stories of individual animals. For example, the chapter on ferret hunting techniques begins with a narrative of a ferret killing a prairie dog. This literary device works well to grab your attention and sets the stage for the more scientific material that follows in each chapter. This part is written in a lively style throughout and is accessible to the general reader.The middle part of the book focuses on the rediscovery of black-footed ferrets outside Meeteetse, Wyoming, in 1981. It also covers the initial recovery effort and captive breeding program, and it relies heavily on the involvement of the authors in these efforts. They are very critical of the state of Wyoming and of the decision by the US Fish and Wildlife Service to delegate authority for ferret recovery to the state. For all its strengths, it is written in a slightly less accessible style.The third part tries to draw general lessons about endangered-species recovery from these experiences. A single chapter would have sufficed, but the authors drag these issues out over several chapters. They attempt to draw lessons about the politics of endangered species, organizational behavior, and other social-scientific topics, but in the end they do not have sufficient familiarity with these issues to develop much insight into these issues. As a result, too much of this part reads like summaries of a social-scientific literature - - \\"things we wish we had understood better when we began ferret recovery.\\" The style becomes dry, and the book drags.I was going to give this book five stars two-thirds of the way through, and it lost that star in these final chapters. The first half or two-thirds is very strong, and an excellent introduction to black-footed ferrets. You'll also learn a lot about black-tailed prairie dogs. If, in the later chapters, your interest wanes - - put the book down. You won't miss anything."},{"Title":"Prairie Night: Black-Footed Ferrets and the Recovery of Endangered Species","review":"An excellent book, covering everything from the history of this rare species, its decline, the reasons for its near-extinction, its biology, and the ongoing recovery program. I recommend this book to anybody interested in black-footed ferrets or any endangered species recovery. The book is written in layman's terms without being overly simple in explanation with plenty of pictures and drawings to make it more interesting. A great addition to any library!"},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"The book itself is very intriguing, written by an amazing scholar.This edition handles the umlaut better than the other versions; however, struggles with Greek letters. Could it be a Kindle issue?"},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"I do not intend to review content here. This new edition is so full of typographical errors that sometimes the reader will have to intuit what the author really wrote. It is clear that the proofreaders of this edition were not actually reading; they were simply following the little red lines under the \\"misspelled\\" words. This has resulted in some truly bizarre apparent statements by the author, unreproducible here due to copyright laws. Disclaimer-- I have not purchased this book, merely checked it out of the library."},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"The author's preface is dated 1886. Biblical scholarship has changed a lot since then, most notably with the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls and the Nag Hammadi library. Many of Rev. Edersheim's conclusions will have been refuted in the 130+ years since this book's original publication.For me, the author was at his best when he was dealing with _facts_, such as the details of Jewish life and society in Palestine during the time of Jesus. Unfortunately, being an Anglican priest, he cannot resist the temptation to preach - so he spends pages upon pages telling us what the story MEANS instead of just telling the story. I enjoyed his exposition on the parables in Book V, but most of his preaching was tedious and overburdened with Victorian-era sentiment.Edersheim also argues incessantly (with other Bible scholars whom he often names in the text or the footnotes) in favor of the authenticity, earliness, and \\"Jewish origin\\" of the gospel of John - a position which to me seems indefensible. He also insists on \\"harmonizing\\" the gospels into a single continuous narrative while also insisting that all four are literally, factually, and unerringly TRUE. This approach does not hold water, and watching this otherwise talented scholar & historian flounder through a mire of faulty logic and circular reasoning has only strengthened my conviction that the Victorian dream of a \\"Gospel Harmony\\" is an unreachable goal. Edersheim must undergo strange intellectual contortions to hold to his belief that the gospel writers 1) never made mistakes, and 2) never made stuff up. In one passage he points out Luke's specificity of historic detail as \\"evidence\\" of the truthfulness of his tale, and a few pages later points out Matthew's vagueness & lack of detail as proof of his veracity. You can't have it both ways!! Edersheim never gives the Classical/Antique era's writers any credit for imagination & inventiveness. Furthermore, he seems to have no understanding of Non-Christian myth nor how good stories are told.The book is huge: 1,491 pages, not counting the index and the Roman-numbered pages in the introduction to both volumes (bound together in this one enormous edition but retaining their two separate paginations). As other reviewers mentioned, there are lots of typos, and the old-fashioned prose often bogs down. I felt every one of those 1,491 pages. This book took way too long to read ... but ultimately I'm glad I read it. It's a treasure-trove of information as well as misbegotten opinions. It is probably something that should be experienced by anyone who's got the interest in the subject matter, and the patience to turn that many pages - but its flaws are too numerous for me to award it more than 3."},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"This book was recommended by my pastor and because I wanted to know more about Jesus I ordered it and will order another to give as a gift.

Dip into it by subject or time period. And you'll love it. Of course it was written by a believing man with a great generous soul. But it's thoroughly documented, and has immense and timeless insight to offer on many subjects. For some, it might be a rich corrective to the mini-series, and movies about Jesus which portray his surroundings as so meager and primitive, with no sense of the grandeur of the Holy City, and the complexity and variety of the village life that Jesus might have known. Jesus didn't live in the Stone Age as motion pictures and documentaries would have one believe. He lived in the busy world of Augustus and Tiberius Caesar. And this book embraces that period with vast wisdom and knowledge. It is outdated, yes. But the period in which it was written (late 1800's) is no doubt partly responsible for it's profound simplicty and overwhelming charm. Happy reading."},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"This classic work is a goldmine of information about the context of the Gospels. Many of the events and sayings in Jesus's become even clearer when we understand the widespread Rabbinic teachings of His day. Edersheim's insight into the famous \\"Thou art Peter\\" is most interesting -- yes, Jesus was speaking Hebrew but he DID mean to distinguish petros and petra, because these names had also been incorporated into Hebrew and Aramaic. It's also very important to see how Jewish writers interpreted Messianic prophecies to see that the NT writers were following accepted procedure.For something more modern, I recommend Dr Arnold Fruchtenbaum's books, especially Messianic Christology."},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"While somewhat outdated, The Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah remains a magnificent reference to the historical and cultural setting to the days of Jesus of Nazareth. Although written some 70 years prior to the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, Edersheim's great work still offers highly valuable information and insight on the Gospels and related events. One of the more striking features of the book is the appendix list of 400+ Old Testament passages which were tagged by the ancient rabbis as being messianically applied. An absolute must for anyone who wish to study the Jewish expectations of the Messiah surrounding the days when the Nazarene Carpentar walked the Earth.

I truly consider myself more then a casual reader of this magnificent work! That being said, my review...For the believing Christian, this is a must read. For the skeptic, consider yourself remiss to overlook this book and for the Non-believer, this work will renovate your thinking. Edersheim has put together a true masterpiece herein. His depth of research on the subject matter is totally comprehensive. A commitment of 7 years, in almost complete solitude, was made to the writing of this book by he and his daughter.Literally thousands of footnotes, drawn from nearly every major Jewish writing of the time, are listed on the pages of this book indicating the intense discipline and scholarly effort enforced by the writer. An impression of truth and trustworthiness almost overwhelms readers as they have literally noted in conversation with me as I have passed this book along to many friends and acquaintances.This book is a bon-a-fide \\"best effort\\" to set before it's readers the daily foot steps of Jesus of Nazareth so that His words and works may bring us to an understanding of Jesus The Messiah that will blaze with a brightness that will light every other understanding.Finally, to put oneself to the task of completing this book is an undertaking. However, as noted by Edersheim himself, we are called to look upon Jesus with intent and resolve before we will see him as the \\"God-Man\\". ( St. John 6:40)"},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"Alfred Edersheim's heritage as a Messianic Jew gives the description of Jewish culture in &quot;The Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah&quot; an authenticity that a non-Jew would be hard-pressed to duplicate. The culture of Israel during the Roman occupation comes alive in Edersheim's writing in a way that goes beyond scholastic study by blending his own Jewish heritage, archeological fact, and keen spiritual insight. Any serious student of the Gospels or the Epistles would benefit from the insight of Mr. Edersheim because so much of the imagery in the account of Jesus is steeped in the culture of Israel as it progressed from Abraham to Herod. Used as a reference, &quot;The Life and Times&quot; is indexed according to verses and events and gives Bible studies the context for the illustrations of Jesus. Read as a book, Edersheim is ponderous, however, a contiguous reading would give a person a consistent Hebrew framework which the New Testament fit into 2000 years ago. &quot;The Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah&quot; has become a fixture in my library which, second to the Bible, is now a standard starting point in my study of Jesus, the Messiah."},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"In Bible school I had to use this book as a resource in writing several papers.

Lots of information on early Judaism, carefully footnoted from primary sources. In the footnotes, lots of arguments with other scholars, chiefly German (as was typical in the late nineteenth century). Some of author's weighing of evidence will have been challenged in the 100+ years since this book was first published, and new sources will have been discovered; new archaeological sites too. But this is still a good starting-point, if only for the quantity of early sources that are collected in one place.2. Florid prose.3. This reprint edition has more than the usual number of typographical errors. Most of these are harmless, but sometimes they change the sense. E.g., on p. 304: \\"We are _not_ in some measure prepared to follow the worship on that Sabbath in Nazareth\\" should read \\"We are _now_ in some measure prepared...\\""},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"While I have only started the book, I have read Edersheim's other works and found them to be of great benefit for Bibical insight. Having said that, I'm enjoying \\"Jesus The Messiah\\" very much. As with his other books, Edersheim brings the indepth knowledge of one who converted from Judisum to Christianity and is able to provied the reader with an understanding that brings the subject alive.Without hesitation I would recomend this book as well as the others in this trilogy."},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"This is NOT Volume One!! However, because I collect books with intense information that can be used for great studying and increase learning (esp. based on Jesus Christ) I'm not too disappointed. This book has the continuation of the first volume and has a nice load of info. PLEASE BE ADVISED I have NOT YET finished the entire book! But judging from many others which I have completed and how this one starts (esp. the areas of focus within each chapter based on the titles of the chapters) I can tell I am going to enjoy these 900 (plus or so) pages as I read through them. If you want the first Volume, go to this website Christianbook.com .(and put the same titled in the search bar) They seem to be the only ones that have them, NOTE*** They seem to only have TEN(10) COPIES LEFT IN STOCK!!! SO YOU BETTER ACT QUICKLY.

I use it often as a reference in devotions and sermons."},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"At the purchase of this book I was already aware of its basic content. This book reports on the environment of the time and people; the basics of the wars fought; as well as the religious background and polical scene; inter political marriages and the ambitions of the political leaders like Herod and his brothers. It includes submission to Emperer Tiberius Augustus in Rome as well as the cruelty of Pontius Pilot. If interested in biblical history it is a book at I would recommend. The book predates the first coming of Jesus Christ by about 100 years and continues on. You can even use this book in conjunction with the \\"Works of Josephus\\" another biblical historical writting that begins ealier and provides different points of historical value than that of the book \\"Jesus the Messiah\\".One thing that I looked for when purchasing the book was the reliability of the seller and the condition of the book since it was used.

He lived from 1825 to 1889.His best known work is The Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah. As he said, he took seven years to complete this project. He isolated himself and devoted full time to his writing with only his daughter Ella as his researcher, proofreader and inspiration. This is indeed a tribute to a devoted daughter and skilled researcher in her own right.The volume of 1100 pages is not a devotional book. It has many devotional thoughts, but this is a scholarly work with historical details filling every chapter. You can tell by reading the extensive research and writing ability which into this tome.If you want to know about the times in which Jesus lived and glimpses into His life, then this book will be a good one for you. For example:The Gospels present a great deal of tension between Jesus and the religious leaders over rituals and the Sabbath. Edersheim explains this controversy where Jesus rejected the numerous ritual rules for everyday life and especially for the proper observation of the Sabbath. By the time of Jesus the religious authorities had created a burdensome system of do's and don'ts that even the devout hard a difficult time following. The Jerusalem priesthood was corrupt and the cleansing of the temple by Jesus was more than just a simple act.In addition, you are presented with graphic descriptions of the Herod Dynasty. King Herod and family left a bloody mark on Judaea before and after Jesus. It was a bloodline conceived in the worst possible elements of human nature. The Herods sought to build a second Rome in Judaea.If you have a serious interest in this subject, then I recommend this book to you. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"The edition of \\"The Life and Times of Jesus Christ the Messiah\\" that I am reviewing is the third edition printed in 1995. It is a burgundy hard cover with gold lettering.This may be the most thorough,comprehensive book about the land and times of Jesus. It covers religious thought and politics of the day.What the Messianic expectations were.This is a very detailed and well-documented chronicle of the Messiah's life.The Appendices in the back of the book are the best I have read.Mr.Edersheim also covers such topics as:Pseudigraphic Writings-Enoch,Jubilees,Apocalypse of Baruch are some.Rabbinic views,theology,and literature.Lists of the Maccabees,Family of Herod,and Roman govt leaders.The Law in Messianic times.Jewish Angelology and demonology.The Jewish history of exorcisms was interesting.The Fall of Angels.Some very helpful tools also found in the back of this book are the Subject Index,Scripture Index,and maps.I have read \\"the Complete Works of Josephus\\". This book is much better in my opinion! It covers a lot more ground and would make a great reference tool."},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"While a little outdated now, The Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah remains as both an excellent and massive reference work to the historical setting to the time of Jesus of Nazareth. Written some 70 years prior to the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, Alfred Edersheim's great work still offers highly valuable-and detailed-information on the Gospel and related events. One of the more striking features of this book is the appendix section which gives a list of 400+ Old Testament passages which were tagged by the ancient rabbis as messianically applied. An absolute must for any who wish to study the Jewish expectations of the coming of Messiah surrounding the days when the Carpentar from Nazareth walked the Earth. Place Edersheim's great work in your library, and you will find yourself going back to it time and time again."},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"This book is a treasure to read. Alfred was obviously a world class scholar. He adds meaningful depth to the scriptures as he follows Jesus through his time on earth. I find it exciting to sense Jesus being brought to life in beautiful English. It is a little daunting to bounce back and forth between the author's references and the text but it is well worth it. Alfred brings in many comments from both Jewish and non-Jewish scholars. He explores the scriptures with insights and depth challenging the reader to do likewise. This is a book for the serious searcher well worth the time and money.john s"},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"This has been the standard work on the life of Christ for decades. It has some good insights into the life of Jesus, and it will help pastors and teachers of the Word in their search for information that will preach.The book has some weaknesses that keeps it from being the top contemporary resource on the life of Jesus. Number one: The book is not easy to read. It is technical and tedious, and demands alot from the reader.Number two: Edersheim operates under the assumption that everything he knows about Talmudic tradition was also true in the first century, and we simply do not know if this was the case.Number three: The scholarship in this book is more than a hundred years old. I think the best features of the book are the preaching tidbits sprinkled throughout the volume.Having said all that,I think that if you are looking for the best Jesus biography, you'd be better served with Jesus and the Gospels by Craig Blomberg. The scholarship is recent, the prose is engaging, and the volume compresses an amazing amount of information in its 450 pages. Buy that book, along with Darrell Bock's Jesus According to Scripture and Ben Witherington's The Christology of Jesus, and you should have everything you need."},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"Alfred Edersheim is a scholar of unique perspective. He was born and raised a Jew but converted to Christianity as a young man. He provides insight into Jewish history and background to the gospel narratives like no one else I've read. A couple of problems with this work though, it can be very hard to reference. When searching for a particular parable or passage you have to search through the chapter headings one by one to see if you recognize the content. Furthermore, Mr. Edersheim is so unbelievably wordy it can be frustrating waiting for him to get to the point, but this is typical of late 19th and early 20th century biblical expositors. Overall this is a must in any self-respecting theologian's library."},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"This edition is not the complete text. It is only Volume 1 of 2 volumes, and only covers through the feeding of the 5000."},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"I have had this book for years and still refer to it regularly. If you have an interest in why Jesus did the things He did, why He said what He said, or why the people responded the way they did you should read this book. One cannot fully grasp the message of the New Testament without the type of knowledge that comes from Edersheim."},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"This book is so much more than I expected!

Clear exposition of the basic elements of each technique and useful introductory practices. The accompanying photos are clear and relevant.The tactical side is treated in a similar clear way and I particularly liked the section on individual tactical play in which the author uses his own playing and coaching experence to guide an upcoming player through each phase of the game.For the beginning coach there is a helpful chapter on planning practise and running a game.The fitness for volleyball section is also useful for players and coaches.If I have a criticism it is that certain parts need updating to take into account recent rule changes.I was surprised by this book , although the author comes from a very minor voleyball playing country it is one which every school and college library should have .

It was one of his favorites. It became one of my favorites, too. Over the years, I reread the paperback so many times that it literally fell apart. I was delighted to rediscover the Kindle edition.Don't be put off by the genre. The plot is much more adventure tale and character study than western. The plot revolves around the dynamic between the books' two central characters; the cowboy, a seasoned trail boss engaged to deliver a herd of cattle half way around the world, and the Cossack--a Russian officer assigned to make certain the herd is delivered. It is the interaction between these two strong me, who literally come from opposite ends of the earth, and their relationship to the men they lead which makes the tale.If you enjoy Jack London or Kipling's adventure tales, you will likely enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Cowboy and The Cossack","review":"This is a very wonderful read.

One of the early scenes has men, horses and cattle swim from a ship to the Siberian shore through the ice-filled sea. Then warm themselves and the cows by fire and vodka. They then proceed to cross 500 miles of Siberia with no wagon or pack animals. They never run out of whiskey, beans or ammunition. They somehow have four barrels of gunpowder at the end of the journey but there was never mention of them reloading their ammunition or saving the brass from their gunfights.They human interactions are what this book is all about and it's worth reading for that reason."},{"Title":"The Cowboy and The Cossack","review":"I just came across this book.

And indeed, this is definitely NOT Louis L'Amour. The premise is a herd of American cattle that has been bought by an obscure village in Siberia and must be delivered by cowboys from the ranch that sold them. Once they reach Russia, the cowboys are joined by a group of cossacks from the village, determined to see that the cattle arrive safely. The book is full of perils avoided and not avoided, cowboys and cossacks reluctantly getting to know each other, high-minded sentiments that don't quite ring true, and some mildly amusing cowboy humor. I don't regret reading it, but I'll take Nancy Pearl's recommendations with a little more salt in the future."},{"Title":"The Cowboy and The Cossack","review":"This is a must read.

Huffaker makes you feel like you are riding along with the fabulous characters. Whether wielding a Cossack sword or shooting a Cowboy's six-shooter you are part of the action.

I can't say enough good about this book. Its a masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Cowboy and The Cossack","review":"Beware! If you love Western novels, this book will become the standard you measure them against. It has it all...my most recommended book to family and friends.

It is timeless, just wonderful!"},{"Title":"The Cowboy and The Cossack","review":"I have read this book over the years since I first bought it in 1981 many times and I have never grown tired of it. My imagination pictures every scene and vista so vividly brought to life by Mr. Huffaker. Each Character comes to life as a individual in a truly powerful way. It is a tale of more than a cattle drive, but also of courage, understanding, and the opening of minds. I could not help but to think of my own attitudes in respect to how I view others. There was high drama (Novosibirsk with Col. Veruski), humer (The war games and the chaw of more than year old Red Devil plug tobacco), Wide open vistas, deadly enemies, danger, and even a tad of romance. Oh, and one heck of a battle with a tough ending. I think Ill go get the book and read it again right now! I would have given it a ten but I could have done without all the strong language.

So I grew up with my eyes on the stars and all the science fiction I could read. No cowboys for me!I still like science, fact and fiction. But as I got older I found myself being drawn to tales of the West. This book is one of the many reasons I still get drawn back."},{"Title":"The Cowboy and The Cossack","review":"This tale of 1800's cowboys taking a herd of Longhorn cattle to Russia by ship, and then driving them across the Russian steppes to their final destination - in some cases for both the drovers and the livestock - is full of suspense and adventure.

Best for ages 18 and older."},{"Title":"The Cowboy and The Cossack","review":"I read this book when I was a young man and it had a tremendous impact on me. I grew up with the Cold War era and totally accepted the idea of fighting the Russians. But this book changed just about every prejudice I had about the Russian people. I learned they are humans too, with deep feelings and strong senses of honor and decency and pride. It is really a simple story, but I was moved to no end. This book touched my life.

A man who is truly a king never dies.\\"Written in 1973, Huffaker's tale is told from the POV of nineteen year old Levi Dougherty as in 1880 he and a group of Montana cowboys from the Slash-Diamond ranch arrive at Vladivostok, Siberia prepared to drive a herd of longhorns to their new owners in Bakaskaya. After a very creative way of avoiding the bureaucracy and red-tape denying them landing (priceless), the cowboys and their herd are off, although to their dismay they are to be escorted by Cossacks from Bakaskaya for their own \\"protection\\".What follows is a highly enjoyable tale as the two disparate groups of cowboys and Cossacks begin to build mutual respect and friendship as they battle the difficulties they face along the way - from crossing raising rivers, avoiding confrontations with the Czar's Cossacks all leading up to a horrifying showdown with the barbarian Tartars against unbelievable odds (you won't believe it 'till you read it).In the end, despite the trappings of high Western adventure in the East, this book is much more than that - it is about the men and the relationships and respect (and love) that grew as they faced the many challenges along the way to Bakaskaya and beyond. You'll be laughing on one page and crying at the next as a very fickle fate delivers the good along with the bad. Like another reviewer I was a bit skeptical about the always available whiskey so many miles into the Siberian frontier, but outside of that and a couple other nitpicks, this was a highly engaging tale and I had a hard time putting it down. Western fans should find this one right up their alley. 4/5/5 stars."},{"Title":"The Cowboy and The Cossack","review":"I first read this book shortly after it came out in paperback back in the late 70s while I was in the Navy. That paperback book fell apart from all the times I re-read the story. Now I have this new hard cover version to read again and again. Claire Huffaker brings Levi, Shad, Old Keats, Capt. Rostov, Igor, Lt. Bruk and all the rest of the \\"greasy sack outfit\\" and the free cossaks to life in this wide open novel not of the old west but of an adventure as big as Siberia. Once you read it, you forget about all the feldercarb fed us daily be our goverment concerning commies, etc. You realize these are men, real men he's writing about who somehow work thru their differences and earn mutual respect, admiration, and even love for each other. If you like westerns, youll love this one...Oh east is east and west is west,and never the twain shall meet,till earth and sky stand presently atGods great judgement seat.But there is neither east nor west,border, nor breed, nor birth,when two strong men stand face to face,though they come from the ends of the earth!Rudyard Kipling 1889"},{"Title":"The Cowboy and The Cossack","review":"Was happy to find this on Amazon as it is a hard book to track down.Person who received it for Christmas was estatic!!!!"},{"Title":"The Cowboy and The Cossack","review":"This is a great book, kept my interest beginning to end. Well written, just enough detail, the story flows. I have a line of family and friends waiting to read it."},{"Title":"The Cowboy and The Cossack","review":"This book was recommended to me by a friend and I am absolutely THRILLED that I took them up on their word. It's a powerful story about character and the strength of determination and overcoming prejudice, fear and the unknown. It would be an amazing movie -- I'm surprised it hasn't been picked up as such, yet. Definitely a MUST read for anyone who appreciates history, cowboy and foreign culture thrown in with lots of heart. It's based on and includes actual excerpts from the diary of the young man in the story.Due to the language used and the violence described, I would recommend caution with young readers."},{"Title":"The Cowboy and The Cossack","review":"Thrilled to find this book again! It's one of my top 20 books of all time."},{"Title":"The Cowboy and The Cossack","review":"I read this book the first time in 1977 during my senior year in high school. I had finished assignments in a literature class and was reading the book, which was checked out from the school library, during class. About the third time I had to put the book down to stifle my laughter, the teacher came over to see exactly what I was reading. He said nothing. He picked it up, looked at it, looked at me, and gave me a thumbs up. The book made a deep impression on me, causing both laughter and tears. Because of this book I was ahead of the game when it comes to converting miles to kilometers, and I learned to pay more attention to what the sky says. I won't bore you with more of the little things this book made me aware of, but it painted the story in such strong colors they haven't faded too much over the years.A few years out of high school I searched high and low for it, but could not find a copy. After I got married, I told my husband about it, and he found a copy through a book dealer. He fell in love with it as well.I am thrilled to see that it is available again and I hope a new generation discovers it. Yes, it is that good. Or maybe I was just that impressionable when I first read it . . . nah, it is just that good."},{"Title":"The Cowboy and The Cossack","review":"I'm not a western reader and never have been, but I first picked up this book in high school and have loved it ever since. I have lured friends and family to read it, to their surprised delight. By turns hilarious, exciting, touching and beautiful, this book is simply a joy to read. I own two copies at any one time because one is always out on loan."},{"Title":"The Cowboy and The Cossack","review":"I can only echo what the other reviewers have said. I discovered it as a teenager, and absolutely fell in love with it: the humor, the unforgettable characters, the wisdom, the grace. I could go on indefinitely. It remains the only western I have ever read, as I do not believe any could hold a candle to it. I'm thrilled to see other readers cherish it as much as I do. Because it was hard to find, I squirreled away several copies, to be loaned out to only the most trusted of my friends. Perhaps a half dozen of my friends and family have read it and every single one, from Yale snobs to German dressage trainers to former Marines, have all, unequivocally, loved it. It is a great book. I hope they never make a movie of it, although I heard a rumor...Run, don't walk, to the nearest opportunity to get your hands on this little-known masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Cowboy and The Cossack","review":"I first read this in the seventies, and was captivated by the scope of the novel, and how much I came to love the characters. I, too, have lent this to many friends. If you like this book, you might also like Monte Walsh, by Jack Schaefer."},{"Title":"The Cowboy and The Cossack","review":"A friend insisted I put aside my latest novel to read The Cowboy and the Cossack. That was the last we saw of each other until I finished the book. My oh my....what a story. From page one I was there....with all those cowboys, all them Cossacks, and all those rambling, rambuncous cattle. A must read for all generations. Who is Clair Huffaker? I am trying to find everything else written, all out of print...."},{"Title":"The Cowboy and The Cossack","review":"Sit-down, pour yourself your favorite beverage and let Levi Dougherty tell you his tale of wrangling longhorns from Vladivostok through 1000 miles of Siberia. Mr. Huffaker put together a great book with a very simple premise, a cattle drive, different from other Westerns about cattle drives in that rather than going to from Texas to Kansas, the Slash-Diamond ranch has sent its cowboys and longhorns from Montana to Siberia. To help them deliver the longhorns, a Cossack troop escorts the cowboys.As much as this book is the story of a 19 year old cowboy experiencing something new, this book is also about the people of two countries (the US and Russia) coming together and learning about each other. Incredibly written in 1973, during the heart of the Cold War, Mr. Huffaker found a common thing to write about, mounted people who enjoyed the free life. The learning between the two groups (cowboys and Cossacks) is continual and shows the positive that can happen when people from two different backgrounds strive for the same thing. However rather than limiting his book to just this, Mr. Huffaker takes us through the learning experiences of a 19 year old and we get to see a limited look at interracial relationships (two of the cowboys are black, one is an American Indian, and one is Mexican). My only complaint about the book is that Mr. Huffaker took a few liberties that are really minor when compared to the whole of the book. These liberties included such simple things as forgetting to have a chuck wagon, always seeming to have alcohol (I think Jack Daniels would have been a little rare on a 1000 mile drive in Russia), and an independent Cossack society in Imperial Russia (sorry, the Cossacks were loyal to the Czar due to the freedoms they enjoyed). Despite these limited weaknesses, this one's a solid 4.5 star for me and I'll round it up to 5 stars for Amazon purposes due to how well Mr. Huffaker made me believe that Levi Dougherty told him the story or that Levi was telling me the story. I first read this book in 1979 and after 30 years I can honestly say it's as good the second time through. Btw, the name of the book; the obvious answer Mr. Huffaker wants us to see is the relationship between Levi and Rostov. My opinion though is that Levi is telling us about the two most important men in his life; the cowboy Shad and the Cossack Rostov. Btw, why isn't this a movie?"},{"Title":"The Cowboy and The Cossack","review":"I first found this paperback in a used bookstore 15 years ago. I couldn't put it down - too enjoyable! Since that time, the paperback has come apart at the seams (I lost track of the number of times I've read it), so I tried to find a hardback. Since it was out of print, I had to wait for Amazon.com.

It was also a good history and geography lesson,"},{"Title":"The Cowboy and The Cossack","review":"This is not your typical western novel. The book is done as a narration of one of the characters. I kept identifying with characters as cowboys and cossacks move es a herd of cattle through Siberia. As I neared the ending I began to feel sorry the ending was near because I didn't was it to end."},{"Title":"The Cowboy and The Cossack","review":"This book was a great surprise to me and shall be kept on my \\"better reading\\" list. Who would have ever imagined transporting 500 cattle from Montana to Siberia. This is a very good story combining the uncouth Western Cowboy with the more sophisticated free Russian Cossack. The differences in characters are amusing at times and yet their goal is the same and learn from each other to survive against all odds including the barbarian Tartars and the Tzars Cossacks. It amazes me how authors have the ability to delve into unimagineable tales with such vigor that keeps the reader constantly intrigued as to the how the final page will read. The cowboy language is a little, well more than a little strong so I skipped over the foul language which I suppose was to distinguish the cowboy as he is portrayed. It is a good read and fosters page turning to witness the next turn of events. This is definitely NOT a Western novel, but the landscape of Russia and Siberia portrays the Cossacks, Tartars, Villagers and Cowboys framing a wonderful story."},{"Title":"The Cowboy and The Cossack","review":"A basically good read but it slowed down at times in the details. The charater development was very good and gave the reader a good insight into their abilities and motoivation."},{"Title":"The Cowboy and The Cossack","review":"As I read this book I kept thinking \\"well, this is ok...\\" but nothing wonderful. The last fourth of it made me just not want to see it end. I found myself thinking about the book, and the messages contained within, for days after I finished it.It's a good cowboy story, although I could've done without the literal spelling dialogue. But most of all I was fascinated by the cossacks and their sense of honor and sensitivity. Great teachings went back and forth between both sides of the \\"riders\\".This is not the greatest book ever written, but it does make you think and has some interesting insights into Russia, especially the Tartars."},{"Title":"The Cowboy and The Cossack","review":"I bought this book on ebook for my husband to read on an upcoing cruise. He is not a book reader but reads three newspapers a day. Decided to preview it myself. Finished it in two days. If he does not enjoy this book, he will never enjoy any.

I was disappointed.I read this novel back in the 70s and thought I remembered it well. I must have been enamored with the F words way back in my youth. As another reviewer of the book has indicated, the only thing Mr. Huffaker apparently knew about cattle drives and the &#34;Cowboy Code&#34; must have come from a movie script. Anyone who has ever actually handled livestock would know better.If you can find a copy, I would recommend Sam Brown's book &#34;The Long Drift&#34; as a better description of the cowboy way of life."},{"Title":"The Cowboy and The Cossack","review":"I loved this book. Very interesting details about Siberia during the time of the Tsars. The interplay between the Cowboys and the Cossacks was very well done and using the &#34;greenhorn&#34; of the group to tell the story was perfect. It isn't just a Western although the best elements are there, it is a story of breaking down prejudices and learning that all people are similar in their need for freedom, humor and friendship; if we would just start out by tolerating and learning about each other."},{"Title":"The Cowboy and The Cossack","review":"After just about giving up on finding a decent book to read I foundThe Cowboy and the Cossack .To read about two strong men and invisiioning such men and their lives waswell worth having a Kindle.I am looking for books equal to The Cowboy and the Cossack."},{"Title":"The Cowboy and The Cossack","review":"I would recommend this book to young and old males.

This is all besides the point, but I do remember how much I enjoyed it when I did read it and would recall the story line vividly as the years went by.

To find it again on Kindle was truly a great moment. However, this is not for the faint of heart. If it was a movie it would be rated R. The language is down and dirty and it you are offended by that kind of talk you might want to look elsewhere. If you can get around the language, this is a great story and not just a great story but a look into the heart of two very different men who are very similar.

A book that has to be passed on for others to read an enjoy."},{"Title":"The Cowboy and The Cossack","review":"Forget that &quot;The Cowboy and the Cossack&quot; is a &quot;Western&quot; novel -- it is a wonderful novel that happens to fall in that genre, that's all. I almost typed &quot;a wonderful novel that happens to take place in the Old West&quot; but that wouldn't be accurate. &quot;The Cowboy and the Cossack&quot; actually takes place in the Old East -- Siberia, to be exact -- where a group of Montana cowboys have come with a herd of Texas longhorns to be driven thousand of miles across this alien landscape. The characters are beautifully and subtly drawn, and the action and the setting are done with equal skill. The plot is exciting and the relationships between the characters are moving. This one belongs on a bookshelf right next to &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot; and, coming from me, that is high praise. I read a borrowed paperback and, so much did I like this novel, that I have now ordered my own copy for future re-reading. If you don't care for &quot;Westerns&quot;, try it anyway (neither of the two women who recommended it to me like &quot;Westerns&quot; either, but they both loved this novel). And if you do like the genre, then I suspect this one will move on to your list of all-time favorites."},{"Title":"The Cowboy and The Cossack","review":"I've never been a western fan. I'll say that right up front because that said, I buy this book every chance I get. My copies keep vanishing as I loan them out and new readers fall in love with Huffaker's work. This, and One Time I Saw Morning Coming Home - these two books are full of warmth, compassion, passion and the rich delight that comes with a book that's just a wonderful read. Huffaker deserves a much wider readership and it's a shame his books aren't better known. Give this one a chance if you see it - and then share it with someone who's never had the luck!"},{"Title":"The Cowboy and The Cossack","review":"I'm a voracious reader (not particularly of Westerns) and this book, which I read 15 years ago remains as one of my all time favorites.

However, this is one of the best books I've ever read. It's essentially about friendship, honor, loyalty, etc., but it rises above cliches because the characters are so unique. It (and anything else by Huffaker) needs to be re-published."},{"Title":"The Cowboy and The Cossack","review":"I have read this book several times and each time I am re-convinced of how real the story is.

Gaius Aemilius Durus is a &quot;pretty man&quot; of the equestrian class, whose dissolute life is spent-- or more accurately, wasted--on all-night drinking bouts and &quot;calling on idle ladies of fashion-preferable married ones of easy virtue.&quot; Gaius is saved from all that by becoming friends with an older Roman, Tiberius Rufus. Tiberius and his mother are the embodiment of the traditional Roman virtues. Tiberius teaches Gaius a number of character-improving things. However, Gaius' father is murdered, the family fortune is lost, and Gaius goes to Gallia to join Julius Caesar's legions. Fortunately, Tiberius' lessons stand Gaius in good stead, and he has a number of adventures in Gallia and Brittania.I read one of the other book in this series, &quot;With the Eagles&quot; when I was in junior high school-- my father gave me the copy he had as a kid and I loved it. When I was in my freshman year of high school, I discovered the rest of the series in the library and enjoyed them just as much.For those who are recommending the series only for boys, I want to point out that I'm female (though I had a particular interest in ancient Rome as a kid). For what it's worth, &quot;Swords in the North,&quot; written in 1935, is a bit more female-friendly than &quot;With the Eagles&quot; which was written in 1929: it actually has some female characters who are more than incidental to the plot."},{"Title":"Swords in the north (Roman life and times series)","review":"Swords in the NorthSwords in the North.was published in 1935 as part of Paul L. Anderson's \\"Roman Life and Times\\" series.This story follows a rich, young Roman dandy named Gaius Aemilius Durus on a highly engaging trajectory from party boy to patrician.Early in the story, Durus is befriended and mentored by Tiberius Rufus, the protagonist from \\"Slave of Catiline\\" who is now a respected patrician and swordsman. Without giving away too much, Durus falls on hard times and flees Rome to join Julius Caesar in Northern Gaul (France).Durus enters one of Caesar's legions as a common soldier and, thanks to both the moral and martial training received from Rufus, works his way up the ranks. Caesar is consolidating his conquest of Gaul and the results are devastating on the tribes that resist. One tribe, the Veneti, is wiped off the map. Those not killed are sold into slavery. Of course, the legions profit from the sale of slaves, the officers even more so. Durus may have occasional mixed emotions about the brutality, but he benefits nicely until Caesar invades Britannia.Durus is captured and taken to Londinium. Without divulging too much of the plot, the book earns my five stars for the wonderful last third of the story that takes place in Britannia. I especially liked the introduction of Brighde, a very strong female character who plays a prominent role.I've enjoyed all of Anderson's books so far (see my other reviews), but this is the crown jewel. \\"Swords in the North.\\" is the logical sequel to \\"Slave of Catiline\\" which, itself, is the logical sequel to \\"Pugnax the Gladiator.\\" The books are written in a serialized chapter format and don't have to be read in order (in fact, \\"Pugnax\\" was published last).The original audience for these stories appears to have been teenage boys, but these good, solid adventure stories work well for adults. Anyone who likes historical fiction, adventure, and Ancient Rome will enjoy this and Anderson's other books.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Jade Star (Star Series)","review":"&iexcl; Star series &iexcl; is the best series I&iexcl;ve ever seen.

A great potential villain is sketched out. But it all ends there. The storyline is soon abandoned. I kept reading and hoping for its reappearance. But the next three quarters of the book rambles here and there and becomes a drudgery to read. The villain disappears for long periods of time, only reappearing by name or brief encounter.

Smaller drawings across the upper half of the pages show details of the vehicle and its uses.I was disappointed at first with the series based on its recommendation for children in the 0-to-3 years of age category. The subject matter and the format in which it is presented are more appropriate for older children.&quot;Planes&quot; was a well-done example of this series.

Perhaps the aforementioned loonies have not actually read him and base their support on his sometimes more than required use of the word \\"Aryan,\\" which he equates with certain Mediterranean groups and only marginally the Nordic peoples of Northern Europe.Waddell's main thesis is that a great empire extended from India in the east to Britain in the west and that it was ruled over by Sargon I and later by his son Manis Tusu, whom he equates with the Menes of the Egyptian king lists. The alignment of Egyptian, Sumerian, and Indian king lists is worth the price of admission by itself. If there is a fault with Waddell's writings, it is a consistent repeating of his statements in varying forms, as if the reader may have forgoten what he just said, but there does seem to be enough of a forward progression to keep one reading.Anyone who feels threatened by the idea of ancient civilizations that were much more widespread and powerful than admitted by modern historians and anthropologists should avoid this work, but if you are curious about the interrelationships among the various dynastic kingdoms of the Old World, this is quite a good place to start. It is certainly readable and provides a fair amount of information you won't find anywhere else. You may just want to hold your nose when he starts theorizing on the origins of \\"Aryan\\" civilization, but that's a small price to pay for the enlightenment contained in his works."},{"Title":"Egyptian Civilization: Its Sumerian Origin and Real Chronology","review":"I felt compelled to write a review of this work upon reading Waddell's suggestion that the \\"true\\" history of what we now call the pre-dynastic period in Egypt has remained unknown to Egyptologists because of their \\"narrow\\" field of inetrest (Waddell himself possessing an honorary law degree, with no formal training in any of the languages or cultures- Sumerian, Egyptian, Indus Valley- he professes to set us straight on). Speaking as someone who *has* been formally trained in both the Egyptian and Sumerian languages, I felt a degree of responsibility to set the record straight about this truly abominable piece of so-called \\"scholarship.\\"To begin, I won't even dwell on the blatantly racist propaganda that informs all of Waddell's thesis (\\"white warrior-race\\" this, \\"blue-eyed conquering Aryans\\" that, etc., and ad nauseum) because it doesn't take much academic insight to recognize the stupidity of, for example, racially typing a highly-stylized, bas-relief portrait based on a \\"nose of non-Semitic type\\" (p. 86f., pl. 10). Instead, I would prefer to speak against the foundation of his argument: the supposed commonalities of script, and his \\"translations\\" of Egyptian, etc., material. First off, his ignorance of even the basic principles of linguistic change over time leads to many embarrassing false conclusions. To give but one example (and there are many, many more), a substantial part of his equation of the Egyptian king Menes with \\"Sargon the Great\\" (I won't even go into the chronological impossibility of this) and the Indian Manasyu is based upon the link he fabricates between a Sanskrit word, prabha, with Egyptian per-aa, \\"great house,\\" which later comes to be equivalent with the king himself, and is familiar to pretty much everyone in its Greek form, \\"pharaoh.\\" Using this equation, he translates a mythical Indian king's name from Sanskrit as \\"Manasyu of the line of prabhu ['pharaoh'], the royal eye of Gopta [Kopt or Egypt]\\" (brackets from original, p. 4). At the most basic level, per-aa, \\"great house,\\" was simply the term for the royal administrative palace in the period under examination. It did NOT (yet) mean \\"the king.\\" It did NOT (ever) mean the king's \\"line.\\" These concepts are, at best, anachronistic to the tune of about FIFTEEN HUNDRED years, at worst, completely wrong. Stupid, stupid man...Anyway, as much as I would relish going into even more gory philological detail, I will simply say that pretty much anything he gives as a \\"translation\\" of pre-dynastic or early dynastic Egyptian material is entirely, unquestionably, and demonstrably false. His treatment of Sumerian is only marginally better (at least *some* of the words are right), which I suppose is remarkable, given that our understanding of Egyptian grammar is, at present, considerably more fleshed out than that of Sumerian. Suffice it to say, his \\"Sumerian Origins of Egyptian Hieroglyphs\\" (pls. 21 ff.) is profoundly flawed by numerous antiquated sign readings, long-disproven identifications of sign forms, and a general lack of all but the shallowest surface-knowledge of either language. Let me stress the latter point: he gets it wrong from BOTH SIDES much of the time, and it is the simple, first-week-in-class stuff that trips him up. To wit: his equation of the the Sumerian \\"land\\" glyph, which he reads as \\"SAT,\\" with the Egyptian (desert/hillcountry) land glyph, which he also calls \\"SAT, SAMT\\" (p. 162f, pl. 21) is patently false. The Sumerian sign can, in fact, carry the value SAT, but to understand it with a \\"land\\" value, it must be read as KUR. The Egyptian sign, on the other hand, is only associated with the consonatal skeleton s-m-t as a determinative/sense-sign (i.e. no phonological value), in reference to a necropolis or desert; when used phonetically, it is almost invariably read as KHAST. In other words, his suggestion fails on every conceivable level. And the examples could go on and on.Suffice it to say, the few points I have briefly outlined above are representative of the very basic, yet very fundamental, errors made throughout this abhorrent piece of trash. The fact that it purports to be an authoratative piece of academic literature is apalling, and I can only advise any undergraduates who may be considering using it as a resource to run the other way, as quickly as possible. There is NO USEFUL INFORMATION in this work. None. If you enjoy reading failed experiments in scholarship as satire, farce, or tragedy, then this book will probably make you laugh out loud. I know I did. But if you are honestly interested in the early history of Sumer, the Indus Valley, or Egypt, then I strongly suggest checking out a book that wasn't written more than 75 years ago by a closet fascist, in the heady years prior to World War II, when this kind of nonsense was still considered fashionable. For its value as a text, I would give this book no stars whatsoever, but I suppose the one star minimum Amazon requires could be seen as a recommendation of Waddell's work as an insipid joke in extremely poor taste, masquerading as real research."},{"Title":"An Ethic For Enemies: Forgiveness in Politics","review":"The following was a review I handed in for my \\"Confession and Forgiveness in Pastoral Care\\" class at Princeton Theological Seminary.In \\"An Ethic For Enemies,\\" Donald Shriver seeks to bring about a shift in the current understanding of how we should treat enemies in the realm of politics. More plainly, Shriver is trying to give us a fresh and satisfactory answer to how we can get along with people who are different from us, and with whom we share a history of evil. The historical necessity for such a discussion is, of course, the \\"hundred million or so people who in fact have perished in war since 1900\\" (p.9), not to mention contemporary global conflicts fueled by an increasing ability to destroy one another with sophisticated and powerful weaponry. In contrast to most modern political discussions of ethics, which tend to center around notions of justice, Shriver contends that political theorists and philosophers must begin taking seriously the moral concept of forgiveness. He is aware of the response this word invokes: \\"The word forgiveness has a religious ring in the ears of the most modern westerners in a way that justice does not\\" (p.7), and is often charged with being too idealistic for politics. In order to rescue forgiveness from a purely religious connotation, Shriver references history and narrative as evidence for how much power this concept has had in the past, and how much it can have for secular politics today.Shriver defines forgiveness as a moral concept that is actualized in human transactions. The first transaction occurs by remembering the wrongs conducted, taking a moral assessment. Once consensus is built on what wrongs were committed by both parties involved, the second transaction is to discuss and enact the proper restitution that \\"should be leveled against the offender\\" (p.7). Shriver makes clear that whatever restitution means, it must mean \\"the abandonment of vengeance\\" or \\"forbearance\\" (p.8), effectively stopping the cycle of violence. As these discussions of corporate memory and restitution take place, the third transaction of empathy of the enemy's humanity begins to happen. This mutual humanizing (and thus the end of de-humanizing) brings the possibility of co-existence. Finally, the relationship between former enemies is renewed through the fourth transaction as a \\"civil relationship between strangers\\" (p.8), which may or may not grow into something more interdependent over time.In the first chapter, Shriver draws on ancient historical texts that have defined the nature of justice and forgiveness, including the Greek play by Aeschylus, the history of Thucydides, the story of Cain and Abel, and the story of Joseph. In the second chapter, Shriver turns to the theme of forgiveness in the New Testament, which Jesus affirmed in \\"the five settings [of] (1) healings, (2) prayer, (3) eating, (4) public enemies, and (5) discipline inside the new community\\" (p.36). However, as Shriver examines the political ethics from Augustine to Kant, he finds that the emphasis on forgiveness has been set aside in favor of justice. In the third chapter, Shriver begs the question \\"Can humans in our time agree on any ethical standards?\\" (p.10). He argues that we can and must agree that \\"the first \`law' of politics is the preservation of human life\\" (p.66) The second half of the book is devoted to case studies describing the role of forgiveness in our relationship to Germany, Japan, and African-Americans.For years I have struggled to know exactly how to articulate the kind of political attitude and practice that Shriver has described here. After trying to describe it in my own way recently to a conservative proponent of American foreign policy, he replied that, while my intentions were clearly in the right place, I was an idealist who would one day wake up to the reality of politics. \\"Unless you can point to some historical evidence that this works, I'm not convinced otherwise.\\" This book equips us with a deeper historical knowledge that will demonstrate that, without a doubt, forgiveness belongs in politics today. It is not only crucial to preventing war, but also in taming the hostile bi-partisan climate of American domestic politics, as evidenced in the seething negative-ad campaigns before the election takes place. Shriver shows he has a wealth of knowledge of a variety of texts which political theorists, religious and secular, are familiar with. He could have elaborated more on what sort of idealism feeds such theories today, such as the conservative idealism of the free-market or liberal democracy. If Shriver wants to examine American politics, the modest interest in preserving life needs to push us to identify our own ideals, which we consider to be right and worthy of protecting from our enemies.Theologically, while Shriver forgoes any sectarianism in his treatment of Christian literature for the sake of his primary secular audience, a more robust Christology would have helped to crystallize the otherwise shaky relationship between what he calls the \\"horizontal\\" and the \\"vertical\\" aspects of forgiveness. Unfortunately, his treatment on the \\"vertical\\" is relegated to a small section on the Hebrew Bible entitled \\"Who Can Forgive Sins but God Alone?\\" (p.29), after which he discusses Jesus in the New Testament as one who redefined social life through the concept of forgiveness, and taught a community how to embody this concept in a way that was wholly foreign to the political structures of his time. While a rereading of the Gospel for its political undertow is important, the figure of Christ remains a completely separate entity from God. Yet at least some treatment of the atoning death of God on the cross as the very definition of forgiveness could have answered the question \\"What will God do about all this human evil that only God can do?\\" (p.29)"},{"Title":"An Ethic For Enemies: Forgiveness in Politics","review":"From this book I learned how deeply it is possible to forgive.

That it was created by such a young mind is testament to the author's genius; that it has yet to be rivaled as a stirring, oftentimes painful and disturbing portrait of a doomed family, is testament to the writing. Composed with thick, purposeful prose, heavy on similie, metaphor and description, the novel charts the rise and fall of the Loftis Family, an archetypal rendering of the Soutnern Gentry. We follow the tragic downfall of Milton, the drunken patriarch, Ellen, the frigid mother, and the two Loftis daughters, one born perfect, one born crippled. It is a novel of abundant ontological truth, which will reach in and strangle the unconscious sensibilities of almost any reader, regardless of background or predispotition. The novel's beauty ranks with the prose of Lawrence, the passion of Rimbaud and Kundera, the depth and spiritual metaphysics of Doestoyevsky; It is both story and case study. And ultimately we are shepherded through tragedy after tragedy into the climax--the suicide of the immeasurably beautiful and desired Peyton Loftis--as we walk moment to moment with her, peering inside the poisoned stream of consciousness that overwhelms and eventually claims her. Lie Down In Darkness belongs in the canon of Great American Masterpieces. It's significance has only begun to be understood."},{"Title":"Lie Down in Darkness","review":"William Styron is likely the greatest novelist no one has ever heard of. His name is even less recognizable than Faulkner's, or other great American writers: Steinbeck, Hemingway, etc. And yet, in my opinion, his works are far superior. With only four novels to choose from out of his career he has made it very difficult for himself to be regarded in those terms, but he has still achieved a wide amount of critical acclaim, with a Pulitzer Prize and an American Book Award to his credit.His novels are not light novels. They are not coffee table books, but a rather serious discussions on moral issues written with an eloquence that is unmatched in modern writing.Lie Down in Darkness is his first novel, and is much like what I have just said. As a first novel it is necessarily experimental, although the effect of this experimentation is at times hard to tell.Following through flashback the trials of one Virginia family on the day of their daughter's funeral, Lie Down in Darkness leads up to the present, describing in tragic terms how the family has come apart and where it is now.This is great writing, some of the best writing I have ever read, as realistic as any Dickens novel, and as engaging as anything by Baldwin.It is not a happy book, but it is the best book I have read about the American family, far greater and relevant than anything I have read by Morrison."},{"Title":"Lie Down in Darkness","review":"William Styron, in Lie Down in Darkness, tells the story of Peyton Loftis, the beautiful daughter of Helen and Milton Loftis, her ultimate suicide, and her family's contribution to her fate. Sad, yet compelling. As I read, my revulsion for the characters grew line by line, for they are wasted, empty, and they drown themselves in a swamp of despair and impotency. Helen is a vindictive, jealous mother who takes painful jabs at anyone in her path; Milton is an incestuous alcoholic who can't own up to his failures and who is stuck in a sort of paralyzed stupor; and Peyton, well, she is a genetic carryover of her parents-from her mother she learns revenge, and from her father, alcoholism.The story is one of severe despondency, a portrait of lives that have lost their savor and are headed toward destruction. Of all the characters in the story, the Negro house servants come forth as the strongest. They have a spiritual strength that contrasts strongly with that of the Loftis.' The overwhelmingly best quality of the book, I believe, is the beauty of the prose. It's like an epic poem, lyrical and dramatic and sweepingly colorful. And, believe it or not, I actually enjoyed Peyton's stream-of-consciousness marathon just before she killed herself. Styron made it enjoyable and I will always remember the flightless birds and how they follow Peyton all over New York and also the $39.95 clock that Peyton perceives as her refuge from the evil world. Is this what mental illness is really like? This book is certainly one to be read again."},{"Title":"Lie Down in Darkness","review":"Never have I wanted to pound some sense into fictional characters as when I read William Styron's Lie Down in Darkness. The Loftiss family saga is sometimes hard to read because they hurt each other so easily and so often. But Styron's language is beautiful, and his understanding of the characters is deep. The account of Peyton's last day is especially heartbreaking and revealing. In short, this novel is one of my favorites simply because of its account of human frailty and the amazing way in which the story is told. Styron is one of the best."},{"Title":"Lie Down in Darkness","review":"I recently managed to make it all the way through Sophie's Choice, a book I had attempted to read in college and hadn't had the maturity to finish. I loved it on my recent read so I thought I should return to Lie Down in Darkness, another book I hadn't been able to complete.This is a very good, if not great, novel. It is also very depressing. I remember it being so depressing that I just couldn't get through it the first time (and my memory was good). All the same, the writing is beautiful and the characterizations clear and sad. In a sense, this novel is a lyrical essay on Tolstoy's quote about unhappy families from Anna Karenina: \\"Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.\\"The novel opens on Peyton Loftis' body returning to her family on the train from New York after her suicide. Styron ranges back and forth in time and point of view throughout the novel in presenting the causes of Peyton's depression and suicide.Peyton Loftis is the template for a particular kind of doomed Southern girl - beautiful with Daddy issues and a dozen bad habits, the kind of girl certain kinds of boys fall in love with but never marry. She is in some ways a very old-fashioned character - very much of her own generation. Reading her will make you grateful that our mothers' generation fought the feminist battles and gave us options beyond attending Sweet Briar and marrying the first fraternity boy that crossed our path. I think it's a wonder more intelligent and creative women didn't cut their own throats in the public square out of sheer boredom.I'd like to say that all the changes in the status of women in the last 50 or so years have made the Peyton Loftises of the world obsolete, but that would be untrue. There are still plenty of boxes for both women and men to be confined to and political and societal change don't necessarily eliminate them.I'm glad I made it through this one this time. It is, as I said, a good novel. I can strongly relate to all the flavors of despair that Styron depicts and truly felt the presence of his own depression throughout the novel. Styron is wonderfully flamboyant with language and character, even when weighed down with his own demons."},{"Title":"Lie Down in Darkness","review":"Before I read the novel Lie Down in Darkess, I read commentary which said that Merle Miller, a noted critic of the time, could not finish the last eighty pages because of beautiful and doomed tragedy of it all. The day I finished Styron's Lie Down in Darkess, it occurred to me that I should stop writing because none of my prose would ever be this amazingly poetic.Lie Down in Darkess is one of the most beautifully written books I have ever read. Milton Loftis, the main character, is not a protagonist because he is not our hero, although we certainly spend time hoping that he might find a middle ground between his shrewish wife, his alcoholic excesses and the heartbreak of his feelings for his oldest daughter Peyton. Milton Loftis is a man trapped in a Greek tragedy who blunders on every day, balancing his illusions and hoping for the best, although he, and we, the readers, see the foreboding clouds which spell certain doom from the beginning of the book.Helen, the bitter, hypocritical wife, clothes herself in the self righteous delusions of religiosity and spends most of her energy with the mentally incapacitated daughter Maudie. She pretends that Milton is a profligate sinner and adulterer who has made it his life's work to torture her, ignoring that her icy civility and the obvious hatred of her own daughter has been the prod to his loveless and licentious life style. Milton Loftis finds some modicum of hope in his sad affair with Dolly Bonner, but that and whisky are only ways to escape an insufferable existence he cannot escape and cannot understand. He is not weak enough to die, and he is not strong enough to flee.Admittedly, I am a stylist of the Faulknerian, Reynolds Price persuasion, so I found the haunting beauty of this novel enough to recommend it to other readers. I understand that is my bias, but I stand by that verdict. The more people who read this great book, the more awareness of life's inexorable twists, and, hopefully, the more aware we become of the pain of others, and the more committed we become to tolerance and forgiveness."},{"Title":"Lie Down in Darkness","review":"This long, wending, fatiguing, frustrating novel is one of those rare books that are so suffused with suffering and tragedy that the reader, if s/he is the sort of \\"deep\\" reader, as I imagine most prospective readers of this book are, will not emerge from reading it without suffering and trauma themselves. In particular, the character of Helen Loftis, whom Styron seems to have drug up from the depths of Hell, has such depraved and hateful intricacies in her soul, which Styron never ceases to plumb to their core, that this reader at least, breathed a long sigh of relief upon finishing the book and knowing that I wouldn't have to read about her anymore. She makes Lady Macbeth seem an ideal candidate for sainthood. All of this invites the question of whether a book that causes the reader to suffer is worth the read. To this, I don't have a pat answer.Yes, the poetic prose is beautiful and haunting. But so is that of Faulkner and Thomas Wolfe and Proust and Lowry and, more recently, John Banville. I'm not sure I would recommend this book before these, or even with these. A book which causes the reader to suffer is a unique experience in my long acquaintance with literature.I've not much else to say here, save to let the novel speak for itself, to let the prospective reader know what s/he is in for:\\"...a song of measureless innocence that echoed among lost ruined temples of peace and brought to their dreams an impossible vision: of a love that outlasted time and dwelt even in the night, beyond the reach of death and all the immemorial, descending dusks.

They were painted with fire, like those fallen children who live and breathe and soundlessly scream, and whose souls blaze forever.\\" Last paragraph of Chapter 5, pg. 225, in my edition.Pretty love scene...No?

But now with such distance one sees so clearly how much it owes to, among others, The Sound and the Fury and Ulysses--and by that comparison, how it has fails to renew itself with time, unlike those two books. Styron's book, while beautiful and wonderful, has not made the short-list of immortality, because it belongs to a fixed time. It is a work of amazing grace, fluidity, and power; it is a classic of a time when the bomb had just dropped, and when humanity was emerging from two wars with a great hope of solving its woes. The narrative struggles to make sense of all the madness and nihilism, the faith and sanity of that time, and as such Lie Down in Darkness's ambition and grace make it worthwhile reading for those dedicated to literature and beauty and understanding--understanding, that is, where we come from and, perhaps, where we are going. Will this work endure forever? No; it has its limits and its bounds, and already perhaps there are books that better capture the pervasive spiritus mundi, sorrow. But what does endure forever, after all? Daddy Faith might say belief.

The entire time I was reading the novel, I kept wanting Peyton to somehow \\"win\\" -- to assert herself, to want to live. But I sensed that the opposite would happen: Styron is a master at making us see and feel the inevitable.Although I think this novel was beautifully written and true to its characters, I will also say that I have never had a desire to re-read it. It's not as universal as, say, Faulkner's novels, which I've read several times. There is something so specific about the people and setting depicted in \\"Lie Down in Darkness\\" that I forever think of it as a book that walks down a very narrow lane -- a lane so exact you will never forget it, but also so dark and uncomfortable that you will never go there again."},{"Title":"Lie Down in Darkness","review":"A startlingly beautiful telling of intimate personal destruction. Styron's ability to fill the reader with both love and revulsion for his charcters in this novel is a marvel."},{"Title":"Lie Down in Darkness","review":"Although Styron has been influenced by classic novelists such as Faulkner and Joyce, he has improved upon that from which he has borrowed. He has raised the standards of classic literature.Styron's language is of the most beautiful I have ever read. His prose is often poetic and melodic. Furthermore, his characterization, namely of Peyton, is especially well-developed.Lie Down in Darkness, like Styron's other novels, is a work of art."},{"Title":"Lie Down in Darkness","review":"William Styron creates some impressively tragic and melancholic situations for his fatally flawed characters. Their lives have a way of permeating your dreams after you enter Styron's world. A fine example of this is Sophie's Choice.The problem I had with Lie Down in Darkness is that the situation is overly dramatic. While I can understand Sophie, I cannot accept Peyton's insanity. Styron attempts to attribute Peyton's descent into madness to her childhood, and her experiences with her mother, which albeit unhappy, cannot plausibly be used as an explanation for the tragedy that ensues. The style is sophisticated, and the imagery and symbolism of birds as death omens create a forbodding presence throughout the novel.While the style is sophisticated, I didn't find the journey enjoyable because there were parts that felt tedious and long-winded. Mostly, it is just a depressing novel, with every familial milestone that should be joyous - such as a wedding, or Christmas celebrations - marred by a doomsday feel. You know that Helen will find some way to quarrel with her husband or Peyton and that the repercussions will resound throughout the entire novel, which feels like a lifetime.Novels about sorrow and lost can be enlightening and enjoyable. However, this novel requires stamina because it is very long. You sink into a stiffling world for the duration of the novel and you won't necessarily come out of it feeling rewarded."},{"Title":"Lie Down in Darkness","review":"As a huge fan of Sophie's Choice, I decided to try this one. It may be &#34;great art&#34; since the critics all love it but it shouldn't be this difficult to read a book. Virtually no characters are likable. The story is totally depressing and repetitive. I almost didn't finish it but at some point decided to go down with the ship. Probably won't read another Styron."},{"Title":"Lie Down in Darkness","review":"I'm not sure if it's the translation from book to Kindle, or the writing itself, but all I can say about this book is that it rambled on and on.

Oh Lordy, no."},{"Title":"Lie Down in Darkness","review":"What is the deal with this new modernist style of writing. Everything is so ambiguous, and the plotline is very vague. I like real classics, not this modernist trash. This book was awful."},{"Title":"Lie Down in Darkness","review":"This 400-page novel begins on a train on a morning in August 1945. The train is traveling from New York City to Port Richmond, Virginia, carrying the coffin and body of suicide victim Peyton, the recently married daughter of Milton Loftis. Waiting at the train station are her father, his mistress, the undertaker and his assistant. The local minister has gone to the Loftis home to retrieve the unforgiving mother and wife, Helen Loftis. The book ends about eight hours later after the burial. In between these pages, the characters rant and rave as they reminisce about their dysfunctional lives, separations, alcoholism, prejudices, and all other acts of unkindness toward each other. It is a book of flashbacks and Peyton sums it all up by stating the overriding causes of their mis-spent lives: \\"It's time and remembrance, that's what it is.\\" In other words, people with too much time on their hands and too much dwelling in the past. At another point, Peyton exclaims to her forever-complaining husband, \\"I've sinned only in order to lie down in darkness and find, somewhere in the net of dreams, a new father, a new home.\\" One can only hope that she found that peace in her death. I thoroughly enjoyed this character study of deeply troubled people. One intriguing section of the book tells the history of New York City's Potter Fields. I have lived in the Big Apple for years and was not aware that there was even such a place. It's an amazing tale to the point that I couldn't believe what Styron was telling me. However, I checked my copy of The Encyclopedia of New York City, and what he says is totally true. That segment alone made reading the book worthwhile."},{"Title":"Lie Down in Darkness","review":"Lie Down in Darkness is not a great book. But it is a very good one, and shows how William Styron, even in his youth was a talented and perceptive writer. This novel begins with the death of Peyton Loftis, and goes back in time to follow her childhood and coming of age, as well as her eventual marriage, until her death. We see these pictures through the alternating points of view mostly of her father and mother, but also of some other characters, and learn how her death was inextricably related to the slow attrition caused by stubborness, jealousy, and hate that tears apart her family. Darkness is everywhere in the novel, taking the form of guilt and personal failures that corrode the hearts of each character and make inevitable Peyton's tragic end. Indeed the predetermination is all the more evident, since we know from the very beginning that she has died.Although Sophie's Choice shows how much more polished (and more thoughtful too, perhaps) he has become as a writer, Styron's writing is beautiful, as are the characters and the story. This may not be a necessary read, and the beginning may be slow, but it was well worth my time."},{"Title":"Lie Down in Darkness","review":"made me grateful about those long, boring afternoons spent in learning English!I just read all the reviews: Some were written by real experts. But some of them depict this novel as \\"too long\\" (I WISHED IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LONGER!\\")\\"boring\\" (This lady is far of understanding any book:This book is a living proof of the geniality of Styron : He is capable of describing the most shining and also the most heinous feelings of a character. Styron strips the characters and drive us to watch them as they really are.This is one of the most soul tearing book ever...and the argument is unique, BRUTAL, TERRIFYNG and BEATIFUL1"},{"Title":"Lie Down in Darkness","review":"I first read \\"Lie Down in Darkness,\\" Styron's first book, when I was barely 20. In that first reading, I identified passionately with Peyton Loftis, the daughter who cannot survive her father's obsession or her mother's hatred. I saw Peyton as a free spirit, albeit spoiled, trapped in a South I knew only from reading Carson McCullers, Flannery O'Connor and Tennessee Williams. Re-reading the book nearly 50 years later, I understand better that her parents are trapped too, unable to cope with their failed expectations and their own desperate need to be loved.Make no mistake about it, this is a story of alcoholism and mental illness born of both nature and nurture. As we learn from Styron's writings about depression, and from his daughter's recent memoir, so many of the images in this book come from his own struggles through childhood and adolescence. Styron's mother was chronically ill and died when he was very young, replaced by an almost stereotypical \\"evil stepmother\\" who becomes a model for Helen Loftis. As Milton Loftis lurches from one tragic drunken event to another, Styron takes us inside his head so compellingly that you're convinced he has been there himself - and he has.And yet, in a novel that is painfully depressing, the words and the images they summon are excruciatingly beautiful: Every foot of an incoming tide, every flower blooming or wilting, every tacky mile of the Virginia Tidewater region, even Peyton's delusional reveries about flightless birds. Some elements of the book may appear outdated and no longer politically correct: for example, characterizations and descriptions of the African American community. But Styron cannot lie about the time (the 1930s and 1940s) or the place. You can hear it, feel it, smell it, taste it - good and bad.\\"Sophie's Choice\\" and \\"The Confessions of Nat Turner\\" brought Styron fame and fortune, but it is this first book that established him as one of the great American writers. \\"Lie Down in Darkness\\" will haunt you forever."},{"Title":"Lie Down in Darkness","review":"William Styron produced Lie Down in Darkness when he was twenty-five. Published in 1951, it gained immediate critical acclaim. To read it with Styron's age in mind is to realize the meaning of literary genius. His powers of description are ridiculous and his insight into human nature belies his youth. He tells the story of a star-crossed WWII-era family of his native Tidewater area of Virginia which devolves inexorably to its demise. Replete with Southern gentility, the tale wends its way through relationships, psyches, and social conventions of the day. If you read fiction only rarely, as I do, this may change that habit for you."},{"Title":"Lie Down in Darkness","review":"I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a dramatic page-turner that is written like poetry, but is easy to relate to, and will stay with you long after its completion. Lie Down in Darkness represents a darkness farbeyond death.FULL REVIEW:[...]"},{"Title":"Lie Down in Darkness","review":"Overall I liked this book but I thought it began to drag towards the end. It became really repetitive and just wanted Peyton to throw herself out that window just to make the novel stop. Ugh. Styron's talent for vivid description is amazing and he gets all the characters right. But it just begins to plod along and I had to force myself through the last third of the book. Still, definitely worth the time to read."},{"Title":"Lie Down in Darkness","review":"William Styron's first novel is often overlooked because \\"Sophie's Choice\\" is, without doubt, his flagship; however, his style in \\"Lie Down in Darkness\\" is as melancholy and forceful as it was in each of his subsequent novels. No reader can leave these pages unmoved by the depth of suffering, both self-imposed and due to other forces, of its principal characters. The family unit is rife with undercurrents and has no opportunity to become functional because the parents are so deeply enthralled with their own problems. I disliked Helen the most. Her passive aggressive martyrdom fueled her husband's neuroses and alcoholism until their relationship became Faulknerian in its dysfunction. Styron's well-known bouts of depression obviously inspired much of the insights into mental illness. The pain of these characters is palpable throughout the book, and I find myself thinking about this family more than I would like."},{"Title":"Lie Down in Darkness","review":"\\"Lie Down in Darkness\\" is one of a group of books the novelist Richard Yates recommended to his writing classes at the University of Iowa and elsewhere. I copied the entire list from Blake Bailey's excellent 2003 Yates biography and have been using it as a means of re-entry into fiction-reading after a very long absence.What makes this book a considerable achievement, for me, is its structure, the way it plays with time, lurching forward as unsteadily as the funeral procession that is the book's core event, and telling its story along the way. The stream-of-consciousness suicide narrative near the end is richly imagined and convincing.I found the ending itself--which asserts that humble black people have more wisdom about life, love and forgiveness than the privileged whites who control their world--obvious and patronizing. Perhaps I'd have thought otherwise if I'd read it when \\"Lie Down in Darkness\\" was first published, in 1951.I'm very glad I followed Yates's recommendation."},{"Title":"Lie Down in Darkness","review":"I think it was interesting how Styron dedicated the final 10 pages of a 400-page book to a baptism of the minor characters. But in doing so, he draws a contrast between the impotence of Carey Carr and the spiritual bankruptcy of Helen Loftis and the power of Daddy Faith to inspire Ella and a faith community. Carr's ministrations fail to save Helen from her own guilt and self-loathing, which ultimately destroy her marriage and her daughter. On the other hand, Ella supports the Loftis family throughout the book, even if it is in a servile role, and at the end safeguards a stranger, Doris, who has strayed from her mother during the baptism. I couldn't help but think that the tragedy that befalls Peyton would not have occurred had she been Ella's daughter. A larger theme could be that the spiritual community in which Ella belonged is an antidote to the nihilism that pervaded the Loftis' world."},{"Title":"Lie Down in Darkness","review":"Styron captures the reader with superb characterization of flawed, damaged people confronting life as they want it to be contrasted with life as it is. An engrossing yet sad story. Despite its depressing nature, I couldn't put it down. Truly captures the essence of an Southern gentility from an earlier time."},{"Title":"Lie Down in Darkness","review":"Maybe Styron is not so famous outside the US, but he undoubtedly deserves more attention. His poetic realism is deeply touching, in this book he portrays the dark side of a southern family and the tragedies brought along. If you love authors like Yates and Bukowski, you definitely have to read this book."},{"Title":"Lie Down in Darkness","review":"Early in William Styron's novel Lie Down in Darkness the reader is introduced to a man, Milton Loftis, at the train station. Milton is a good allusion; whatever paradise this man has hoped for in life, it has been lost. How?There, I think, is the essential question that drives this novel. How do we bring ourselves to lose things we charish? How does this happen?It's a deep and heartbreaking question, and it may leave many people unable to read this book. This is understandable, but reading this novel, though the author's first novel and somewhat experimental, allows one to view the depths of human suffering, and perhaps provides ways to avoid it."},{"Title":"Lie Down in Darkness","review":"It should come as no surprise that Lie Down in Darkness is beautifully written, given who wrote it. It's a slow read at the beginning, gradually picking up steam as the story progresses. At its best, Styron manages to capture the electrical emotions of his deeply-troubled family. Yet for some reason he does not provide us with a reason, or some explanation for the parents' many flaws: why did Helen Loftis grow up hating men so much?; why did Milton Loftis feel the need to drown his sorrows in alcohol? Answers, or at least, a casual addressing of these questions would have improved the readers understanding of these complex individuals. The novel builds to a lyrical and almost dream-like conclusion ... but I could have done without the fifty-page interlude into Peyton's stream of conscious."},{"Title":"Lie Down in Darkness","review":"This book is a lot of things: arduous, painstaking, sad, disgusting, loving, enchanting, sweeping, graphic, and vague. As a southerner, it is the quintessential representation of growing up in guilt. It took me awhile to get into this book: more than a couple LLLOOONNNGG chapters; but I was adamant about seeing this through to the end, and I am so glad I did. I don't want to summarize a plot since so many other readers already have, so I'll just say that this book is in the same genre as Cat on a Hot Tin Roof or A Streetcar Named Desire, both by Tennessee Williams. You will probably either love it or hate it, and also will most likely never want to read it again, regardless. It is a very specific plot with incredibly well-developed characters and a story that leaves you in shock by the end. Neo-tragic and beautiful, Styron's writing is unparalleled."},{"Title":"Lie Down in Darkness","review":"Yes this is beautifully written, \\"masterful prose\\". I wholeheartedly agree. Enjoyable reading? Definately not. I didn't find it depressing. I would sum it up as bad things happening to bad people. Not one major character had any redeeming quality at all. That's not the problem, though, for me anyway. I don't know the right word, long winded? rambling? For example, in one of the final sections of the book Peyton is speaking in about a hundred page long, all one paragraph, stream of consciousness. It's the culmination of the whole book, leading up to her suicide. It would be the most interesting reading yet, I thought, but it felt like it would never end. For me reading shouldn't be work and this was a lot of work to get through and I didn't feel like it was worth the effort."},{"Title":"Lie Down in Darkness","review":"It is not a spoiler to state that William Styron's intense 1951 novel \\"Lie Down in Darkness\\" begins with a young woman's suicide, because that tragedy is made clear in the opening pages, as a distraught Milton Loftis prepares himself for his daughter's funeral. Peyton Loftis would seem to be the perfect Virginia belle, beautiful and affluent, but she must deal with a disabled older sister (Maudie's affliction is never named, but it seems to be Down's Syndrome), an increasingly hostile mother, and a doting father whose admiration goes far beyond the paternal. The novel's time scheme is the stormy (in every sense of the word) day of Peyton's funeral, the bulk of the story told in flashbacks, as her father, driving to the cemetery with his tiresome mistress, and her mother, supported by their fatuous pastor, recall their unhappy family life: the father's escalating alcoholism and the mother's deepening neurosis. As a child Peyton has been hopelessly spoiled and as a woman she becomes less and less able to deal with life's demands. Her marriage to a nice Jewish boy is a disaster from day one, her father getting sloppy drunk at the wedding and her mother going into hysterics. Peyton and her husband move to New York, where he hopes to succeed as a painter, while his wife goes into a tailspin of drinking and adultery. Her last day on Earth (which, incidentally, is the day the first atomic bomb was dropped) becomes a 50-page Joycean stream of conscious and unconscious madness with no paragraph indentations and, trust me, not ending with Molly's ecstatic \\"Yes!\\" As many readers have pointed out, this is not exactly a feel-good affirmation of life type of story, but it is powerfully written and holds a serious reader's interest to the very last page."},{"Title":"Lie Down in Darkness","review":"The writer is really outstanding in describing settings - nature, weather, etc. The negative is that this is a VERY depressing book."},{"Title":"Lie Down in Darkness","review":"I checked out a public library copy of this book after reading Kristen Stewart and Jennifer Lawrence wanted the part of Peyton in an upcoming movie.

She had come to the party and it had been ghastly; everone misbehaved and nobody had a good time.\\"This perfectly demonstrates the expectations of a southern belle, but the reality was quite different.

I'm interested in learning more about holistic nursing and purchased the 5th edition of this book. The author of the music therapy chapter totally failed to distinguish \\"music therapy as a profession\\" and \\"music as a nursing intervention\\". Moreover, the author suggested some music and imagery work for nurses to try with their patients which is totally inappropriate. Even a certified music therapist graduated from a university-level music therapy program is Not necessary qualified to do All types of music and imagery work, if without more advanced training (such as years of BMGIM training). The author totally endangers the patients by suggesting nurses to practice music and imagery with the patient being in an altered state of consciousness, while not suggesting the nurses to receive some sort of relevant training first. It's very dangerous because some of the subconscious material may emerge during the music listening since the patient is not fully awake, but in an altered state of consciousness when their reality is shifted. Without proper training in psychotherapy, or BMGIM, the nurse interventionist may not be able to properly address the emerged subconscious material and may do more harm than good to the patient. Moreover, if the patient had a history of mental illness, music and imagery can actually elevate their psychotic symptoms. Last but not least, the author totally failed to mention a referral is necessary when a patient's response to music is out of ordinary, or if a patent wish to receive some real music therapy for personal growth/wellness during/after the hospitalization, while suggesting the patient to buy CDs or music for an iPod so he can continue his \\"music therapy\\"--this is just totally unprofessional!!

If you are interested in both heart thumping narrative and beautiful prose, this book brings it together with a flair borne in the passion and heartache of pesonal experience. Ogburn was communications officer for one of the three battalions of the original Marauders.Ogburn covers a lot of ground in his 300 pages and this narrative brings together beautifully the macro political level intrigues and the intense strain of personal combat. I have read perhaps 2000 war books in my short 40 yrs, but there are parts of this book that I will always remember: his description of his first operations against the Japanese and the strain of patrol action and the actual realisation of battle hits a person hard. It is not death that is shocking, but the realisation that one is close to death without ever experiencing it --- that a line gets crossed somewhere, where you are conscience that you are in a completely different territory. For Ogburn that happenned on his first patrol when he noticed the first fresh footprints of Japanese patrols.Ogburn is in fact one of the small minority of \\"thinking soldiers\\" --- ones able to philosophise on morality in time of combat, draw judgements about right and wrong, but also to act with supreme daring. His quotes about viewing Japanese dead are haunting:\\"viewing these dead, one wants to conjure some kind of image that foreordained them to some mortal sin. Some act or upbringing that marked them clearly as crossing over in the land of the wicked. That leant a notion of justice to their deaths and the fact that you still lived. You searched for it. But you knew there was nothing in it.\\"Ogburn took part in two of the three hooking actions of the Marauders. After nearly slicing his foot off he missed most of the last operation at Myitkyina. For this operation he relies on the personal experiences of everyone in his unit and there is no flagging in the pace.Since I have read more on the Chindits than the Marauders I really came to appreciate how much both units, formed seemingly for the same operation --- initially conceived to be under the command of Wingate --- became victims to the insidious greed of careerism that seems to be a defining mark of the US military. In no other western democratic military has there ever been such a thorough-going willingness to sacrifice grunts for the ambitions of the supreme officer class. Stilwell with his pathetic personal vanity and pathological hatred of the English, meant that he would never ask for the British to support them with one of their free divisions at a time when the Marauders had ceased to exist as a functioning unit. He pressed medical orderlies to certify everyone as fit for battle at a time when the unit only could muster about 20% effectives. People suffering wounds, ameobic dystentery, fever and chronic undernourishment were flung into the battle of Myitkyina. (One officer continually passed into and out of consciousness from undernourishment while commanding his battalion, and still he was not certified for withdrawal). Stillwell placed the blame of the British Chindits for their \\"slow\\" advance from the south and failure to block the railway -- as Ogburn points out, it was a convenient scapegoat. In a tribute to clear and fair thinking Ogburn describes that the British were at this time functioning in very similiar, if not worse conditions (since they had to be 100% supplied from the air -- the Marauders had a road). One Chindit battalion could only muster two rifle platoons! Such was the intensity as Ogburn describes, that both the British and the Marauders faced.But the one vital element was, that there were fresh troops that the British were willing to commit -- but Stilwell refused to for the sake of his personal vanity. The British therefore came to hate Stillwell, but Slim at least said that he could \\"work with him.\\" The Marauders hated Stillwell more: one soldier, that we know of, drawing a bead on him with a rifle and almost shooting him \\"I could have shot him right there and no one would have thought it was anything other than a sniper.\\"Ogburn also cites the irony of the American way of war where the number of soldiers in US uniform increases proportional to the distance from the front. At a time when Stillwell commanded 30,000 men in Burma-India he still kept rotating essentially the same combat troops and convalescences of the original 3 battalions (although in the end he eventually dragooned about 1000 construction and engineering troops to fill the void created in the Marauder ranks).Lt-Col. Hunter, the defacto commander of the Marauders for a lions-share of the campaign (Col. Merrill suffered two heart attacks and was hors de combat for most of the campaign after Shaduzup), was also sacrificed and eventually removed by Stillwell from command with no reason -- accept to find a fall-guy for his inability to quickly capture Myitkyina. Eventually mutiny swelled in the ranks and whole sections of the front and rear areas became effective \\"no-go\\" areas for American officers.The text of this book should serve as a tribute to the personal courage and individuality of the US combat infantryman and his rugged ability. It should also serve as a warning to those still in the US military on operations.... the tendancy of careerism in the senior officer class, right up to President, and the willingness to sacrifce the average grunt, has become noticeably worse since the times of the Marauders --- in this sense Ogburn is not merely a poet, but also a trenchent analyst of our own times as events that happened in the Burmese jungle 60 years ago..."},{"Title":"The Marauders","review":"This is an excellant account of Merrill's Marauders and the battles they fought and the conditions they endured. Charlton Ogburn Jr. was the communications officer for the 1st Battalion of Merril's Marauders and his book includes many first hand accounts ( including his own ). His narrative encompasses from when the unit was formed until it was deactivated in Aug 1944 during the siege of Myitkyina. What is especially intriguing is reading about the living conditions and the long difficult marches the unit toughed out. It is very obvious this was written by a person who was there. This was one of the first accounts ever written of Merrill's Marauders and their campaign and it does them justice. The maps in it could be better but you can still easily follow the action and not get lost. I was fortunate that I found a paperback copy of this book at a used bookstore in excellant condition.

Superbly told, with a unique combination of excitement and compassion, it is a factual narrative with the emotional appeal of fiction.The three battalions of American infantrymen who, in spring of 1944, marched and fought across six hundred miles of northern Burma to achieve fame as Merrill's Maurauders won both an extraordinary victory and an enduring place in the American legend. Theirs was not only a victory over determined and resourceful enemies, over \\"the most forbidding fighting country imaginable,\\" as Churchill called it, over malaria, dysentery and typhus, but also over mismanagement from above and their own limitations as human beings. When in the end the odds against them proved overwhelming, a poignant finale was written to one of the most moving, dramatic and inspiring episodes of the war.This is the story of the foot soldier, on whose will to take the next step whether he is sick, exhausted or mortally afraid the fate of nations ultimately depends. As the author, who served with the Marauders, points out, it is also a story in which is compressed and intensified the common experience of human beings, of whom nothing less is required than to keep on going in the face of the impossible.There is nothing I could add that would explain the book any better. Maybe a WWII vet or another member of the US Military could write something more in depth, but I was impressed."},{"Title":"The Marauders","review":"I picked this book up on Amazon.com. This book is written by a 2nd Lieutenant in one of the three battalions of the 5307th Composite Unit (Provisional). He was just high enough up in the pecking order to know what was SUPPOSED to be going on, and low enough to know what WAS going on. The Marauders were under General Merrill who General Stillwell at least liked. On the other hand, the Marauders were treated badly when the fighting was over. They weren't taken out of battle soon enough to recover their health. They went on three missions between 24 February 1944 and 17 May 1944, which basically ruined the health (physically and mentally) of Merrill and everyone under him. The Japanese they were fighting were some of the best Infantry that the Imperial Army had ever had, but they weren't the main problem. It was hot, it was a jungle, there were a multitude of diseases, snakes, and their supply wasn't all that reliable.

Now we can enjoy the performances by means of these Bantam Double Day releases. Very well done, by a very experienced cast, you can let your imagination run riot as you picture the various scenes in your mind. These are the classic stories by Sir Arther Conan Doyle. They have been around for 100 years or so, and time has not diminished their appeal. On this Audio Book you have 4 stories, each about 45 minutes long. If you haven't heard these before, then I don't wish to spoil the story line. If you know the stories then you will not be disappointed.

Since then he has narrated some 350 audio books and has garnered every possible award (some numerous times) - A Golden Voice and Voices of the Century by AudioFile, 24 Earphone awards, 5 Listen Up awards...well, you get the idea, he's terrific.This collection of 13 Holmes stories was initially published during the years 1903 - 1904. It is the first collection to appear since Holmes supposedly died in \\"The Adventure of the Final Problem,\\" and represents Doyle at his best. Among the 13 we find everything from The Adventure of the Empty House (which features the return of Holmes and his explanation of miraculously surviving a to the death struggle with Professor Moriarity) to The Adventure of the Second Stain.The redoubtable Watson is, of course, by Holmes's side throughout offering his memorable comments and questions.THE RETURN OF SHERLOCK HOLMES is truly a classic and one that detective fiction aficionados will want to hear again and again.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"The Return of Sherlock Holmes","review":"I received this item and it's nicely bound.

Along with the second collection (\\"The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes\\"), \\"Return\\" is generally regarded as inferior to the superlative first collection (\\"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes), but easily better than the last two in the series (\\"His Last Bow\\" and \\"The Case Book of Sherlock Holmes\\"). After Doyle had apparently killed Holmes in the last story of \\"Memoirs\\" (The Final Problem), the popular outcry which followed the disappearance of the legendary detective eventually led Doyle to resurrect his character in the first story of this new collection (The Empty House). But with \\"Return\\", Doyle perhaps even surpassed the earlier effort of \\"Memoirs\\", with excellent stories such as The Empty House, The Dancing Men, The Prioriy School, and the Six Napoleons, and other favorites like The Norwood Builder, Charles Augustus Milverton, The Golden Pince-Nez, and The Second Stain. In my view, fans of \\"Adventures\\" will find that the dozen stories of \\"Return\\" are a great second choice, and not much far behind the brilliance of the first collection.Here's a list of the stories in this collection (with the better stories marked with stars):**The Empty House, 1903 - One of the top ten stories, the presumed dead Holmes is \\"resurrected\\" to solve the murder of Ronald Adair, a card player. More interesting than this mystery, however, is the mystery of the account of Holmes own escape from death.*The Norwood Builder, 1903 - John Hector McFarlane is arrested for allegedly murdering Jonas Oldacre, who has just included McFarlane in his will, and it is up to Holmes to prove McFarlane's innocence and expose the events as a plan by Oldacre for revenge.**The Dancing Men, 1903 - A top ten favorite, as Sherlock Holmes needs to decode the threatening notes with mysterious symbols of dancing men received by Hilton Cubitt's wife.The Solitary Cyclist, 1903 - The mystery surrounding Violet Smith, who is regularly pursued by a strange cyclist, perhaps one of the various lovers who is after her hand in marriage.**The Priory School, 1904 - The only son of the Duke of Holdernesse is abducted from his private school, and Holmes uncovers what really happened to the boy, as well as the missing German schoolmaster.Black Peter, 1904 - The seaman Captain Peter Carey, known as Black Peter, was a nasty man, but who harpooned him to the wall of his outhouse and why?*Charles Augustus Milverton, 1904 - Charles Augustus Milverton is a reputed blackmailer who specializes in \\"selling\\" sensitive letters which reveal the dark secrets of the upper class - but he meets his match with Holmes who is enlisted by Lady Eva Blackwell shortly before her marriage to the Earl of Dovercourt.**The Six Napoleons, 1904 - In this top ten favorite, Holmes uncovers the perplexing mystery of why various busts of Napoleon are being strangely smashed, apparently the result of a lunatic with an obsession against Napoleon, but actually linked to a jewel theft.The Three Students, 1904 - Which of the three students was guilty of stealing a copy of the important Greek exam from Professor Hilton Soames' office?*The Golden Pince-Nez, 1904 - A very good story, as Holmes unravels the murder of Professor Coram's secretary Willoughby Smith, and links it to Coram's Russian wife and his Russian past.The Missing Three-Quarter, 1904 - Holmes is enlisted to solve the strange disappearance of football star Godfrey Staunton the day before a critical game.The Abbey Grange, 1904 - Who murdered the wealthy alcoholic tyrant Sir Eustace Brackenstall? It takes Holmes to discover the involvement of a mysterious seaman.*The Second Stain, 1904 - Two important statesmen enlist Holmes' aid to discover the whereabouts of a stolen document that could result in a war in Europe. Is it coincidental that the theft occurred around the same time as the violent death of the nobleman Eduardo Lucas?

Firstly I enjoy short stories, but these present an intelligent level of 'deduction' that spans the years.

Considering this book was written 100+ years ago, I think this must be one of the first Hollywood-like resurrections of a main character that was killed off in a previous episode. The stories are good, but not as interesting or facinating as previous Sherlock Holmes adventures. For the most part, the mysteries are easily solved without much mental exertion. Definitely worth reading because of the classic nature of the literature, but definitely not the best collection of Sherlock Holmes' adventures in the catalog."},{"Title":"The Return of Sherlock Holmes","review":"This is cut-price luxury. It is more than 12 hours' worth of absolutely marvellous old stories read to us by an absolutely marvellous old narrator. It is also very nicely recorded and it does not cost very much. On top of that I was able to add a feeling of environmentalist virtue to the other pleasures by turning off my little reading lamp and enjoying being read to in the darkness.Conan Doyle had tried to kill off Sherlock Holmes, but by popular demand he had to bring him back from the missing-presumed-dead, and he did it rather skilfully. 13 stories in total are packed into 10 discs, with the sixth tale ending neatly at the end of the fifth disc, which is obviously a convenient presentation for standard cd carousels with 5 bays. Doyle's narrator is, as everyone knows, Dr Watson, and Derek Jacobi has absolutely the right voice for him. He modulates his tones for the other parties such as Holmes and Lestrade, but I think he is right not to overdo this. Watson himself would hardly have been any expert mimic, and the thing to aim at is avoiding monotony, not being some kind of rival to Alistair McGowan or John Culshaw. I suppose no American really ever sounded like Abe Slaney and no rough Scottish whaler talking like Patrick Cairns here would have convinced other Scottish whalers, but the general idea is good enough. There is a German as well, and a Russian who features in a story I shall not even name for fear of spoiling the plot. I experienced a moment's misgiving in The Abbey Grange when the refined Australian lady spoke in refined Surrey English, but my anxieties were allayed when her lady's-maid came out with some fine old Strine after all.The recorded sound is easy on the ear, and I think the only minor request I would have to the BBC producers would be to provide the track-# for the start of each story. Otherwise well done the Beeb.

But then a strange old man comes into Watson's office, and reveals himself to be none other than Sherlock Holmes. Watson promptly faints from the shock.But when he wakes up, Holmes reveals that he has been traveling the world and avoiding Moriarty's equally nasty confederates. And before he can resume normal life at Baker Street, he and Watson must catch the last of these evil men -- which may be connected to Adair's death.After that, Holmes and Watson fall back into solving cases: a young man who is accused of murdering his strangely friendly client; a string of stick figures, a music teacher followed by a cyclist, a boy kidnapped from his school, a harpoon impalement, blackmail and high society scandal, shattered Napoleonic busts, stolen exams, a Russian lady, a rugby player's disappearance, a brutal murder that isn't what it seems, and a missing document that could lead to a massive war.\\"The Return of Sherlock Holmes\\" occasionally feels a little unenthusiastic, probably because Doyle had really intended to kill off Holmes because he wanted to focus on \\"important\\" novels. Fortunately, even lesser Holmes mysteries are still brilliant -- there are twisted crimes, malevolent schemers, and some puzzles that only Holmes can unravel.And as usual, Doyle crafts two kinds of crimes/mysteries -- the ones that are ultra-simple but turn out to have hidden kinks, and the ones that seem impossible to solve but are actually shockingly simple. But things don't always end in the same way (\\"The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton\\" ends in a really shocking manner), and the culprits aren't always dealt with in the same way.It's also really fun to see Watson and Holmes working together again, especially after Holmes makes such a dramatic, energetic reentry in the very first story. And it's very cute to see Watson pass out because he's so shocked and thrilled that Holmes is alive. The characters seem even faster friends, especially when it's revealed that Watson has gotten Holmes off of cocaine (which was still used medicinally at the time).\\"Return of Sherlock Holmes\\" suffers from a few patches of unenthusiastic writing, but Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's mysteries are still brilliant brain-benders. The Great Detective is back."},{"Title":"The Return of Sherlock Holmes","review":"Sometimes, an author's fictional creation proves so popular that it cannot be escaped. Such proved to be the case for Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who killed Sherlock Holmes in an earlier story, only to be pressured by fans into reviving him, first in a novel called \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles,\\" which was set before the death, then finally in this subsequent collection of short stories that brings him back from the dead. If Doyle was thoroughly sick of writing Holmes stories, he disguises it well here.

Not so of course (although Conan Doyle had intended to cease writing about Holmes - but a public outcry forced him to reconsider). In this highly affordable collection Holmes and Watson continue to pit their highly developed intellect against the not so refined minds of the criminal underworld - although Holmes does give them due credit for their duplicity. The only problem I find with Conan Doyle's writing is that it is a bit lacking in decent female characterisation - rather a sign of the times than a fault in his writing however."},{"Title":"The Return of Sherlock Holmes","review":"The soft-cover Wordsworth Classics edition of The Return of Sherlock Holmes reproduces The Hound of the Baskervilles and the short stories that make up The Return of Sherlock Holmes as they originally appeared in the Strand.

Because a page of the magazine is reduced to the size of a trade paperback page, typeface is very small."},{"Title":"The Return of Sherlock Holmes","review":"Some of this book was cool but there was a huge feeling of deja vu as I progressed through these stories. It's no secret that Conan Doyle brought Holmes back to life only by popular demand and not because he felt anything special for the character. As a result, these stories and mostly uninspired and are basically retreads of stories that have come before them.Plus there are some parts that really bug me? How does Holmes make a living? Never once does he actually charge these people for his services. Where does his cash come from? And for that matter where does Watson get his money from? He says at the start he sold his practice to shack up with Holmes so if he is not a GP then what is he? A mere observer to the Mysteries? And what of his wife Mary Morstan? Does he not live with her any more? According to this he lives with Holmes? What is going on?If Conan Doyle were really serious about these stories then elements such as these would have been stronger and characters would be more fleshed out. The introduction of a new character in Inspector Stanley Hopkins is practically useless as he is just a generic police officer.The long and unrealistic monologues aren't so abundant here but the stories always seem to get off to a slow start. A couple of them are cool and interesting but never seem to generate an atmosphere or give any chance for Holmes or Watson to evolve.Conan Doyle only wrote these stories because his readers wanted them. Not because he felt they needed to be told. He felt totally indifferent about Sherlock Holmes and these generally poor stories only prove that."},{"Title":"Choices: An Introduction to Decision Theory","review":"On its 216 or so pages, Resnik's book covers most themes of modern decision theory: decisions under uncertainty, under risk (with separate chapters on probability theory and the concepts of utility), game theory, and social choice theory. The book is clearly written and manages a good balance between the formal (probability calculus, techniques, proofs of major theorems) and the more philosophical discussions of underlying concepts and well-known paradoxes. Each of the six, 20-40 pages long chapters is divided into sections no longer than 3,4 pages, and each section closes with exercises (solutions not provided). Given about two sessions per chapter, the book is well suited as course material for undergraduate courses in philosophy, economics or statistics. This is also how I learned to know it.Returning to the book in preparation for an exam, I could not help to notice a few flaws. First, the book is now quite old (1987). It lacks a detailed discussion of preference relations and choice functions (e.g. Sen's conditions alpha, beta, gamma, the limit assumption), and there is also no part on backward induction in games that has become so fashionable. There are some excentricities, like that the \\"battle of the sexes\\" problem is rephrased in more \\"appropriate\\" terms, and it would be nice to have more historical background for the paradoxes (but you can easily look those up with a search engine). In the later chapters, specially the final one on social choice, the author goes through heaps of heavily formal constructions, and while earlier such constructions were carefully explained using graphics and everyday life examples, the reader is now asked in the exercises to invent his own graphs, prove important theorems etc. Condorcet's paradox on majority decisions could have used a more thorough discussion, both philosophically and theoretically (failure of transitivity, failure of Sen's condition beta). This does not make it less useful as a textbook, it only means that some chapters require more extra preparation and explanation on the part of the teacher than others.All in all, this is a readable, reliable and concise textbook. It is written well enough that students might actually read parts of it.

The first-time qualitative researcher will now be able to go through the process with a competent guide, while the experienced researcher will be able to find answers to unanswered questions. The book starts with an explanation of the theoretical and philosphical foundations of the grounded theory method in qualitative research. Later chapters explain the different techniques that can be used in this approach, with examples. Sections that give definitions of terms used in this research approach provide a clearer understanding of the discussion in each chapter.

Strauss (who died in 1996, two years before the new edition of the book was published) and Corbin have thoroughly revised the first edition of &quot;Basics of Qualitative Research&quot; and added, among other things, a FAQ based on their students' questions. Caution, though, the book is NOT a step-by-step manual or a A-to-Z handbook for forging concepts, building categories and properties, etc. and other books will have to be read as an introduction to the technical aspects of qualitative research. Also, a complete newcomer to qualitative analysis may find chapters 5, 6 and 7 unclear until he gets to chapter 8 about open coding.This re-edition of a classic is nonetheless a must-read for every junior researcher pretending to work in the tradition of grounded theory."},{"Title":"Basics of Qualitative Research: Techniques and Procedures for Developing Grounded Theory","review":"The bottom line with this book is that, while it delivers the goods in terms of an introduction to grounded theory, it's poorly written for a 3rd edition. By the time a text book is in its third version it should be tight, and I'm afraid this book just isn't. Structurally the book is basically fine, but I found myself mentally editing various sentences and paragraphs as I read it because it simply wasn't written very well. This is particularly annoying for a pair of respected qualitative researchers, seeing as language is the stock and trade of qualitative work.Additionally, I felt like it was a little terminology heavy for terms that are not universally accepted as common language for discussing qualitative research, but I'm more forgiving in this latter regard. We are generally a bit challenged in the field when it comes to common language, and there remains a residual need to demarcate one's academic territory.Three stars . . . it could have earned 4 with better writing/editing."},{"Title":"Basics of Qualitative Research: Techniques and Procedures for Developing Grounded Theory","review":"I am a UBC Okanagan graduate student working on an interdisciplinary MA focused on water governance.

It's useful for the lay person and the experienced researcher alike."},{"Title":"Basics of Qualitative Research: Techniques and Procedures for Developing Grounded Theory","review":"This book's title shows that \\"qualitative research\\" is its primary subject, and \\"developing grounded theory\\" is its secondary subject. The opposite is true in the case of the book coauthored earlier by Strauss: \\"The Discovery of Grounded Theory: Strategies for Qualitative Research.\\" In the interval between the writing of the two books, Strauss may have realized that his thesis was about research work more than theory construction. But the text of this second book too presents research work as theory construction, as explained below. It could be thought that what is to be called a \\"theory\\" is a linguistic issue. But the definition of this term must not prevent the construction of real theories as distinct from empirical knowledge.In lieu of the implicit definition of \\"theory\\" that appeared in the earlier book (p. 1), an explicit one is given in this second book: \\"A set of well developed concepts related through statements of relationship, which together constitute an integrated framework that can be used to explain or predict phenomena\\" (p. 15). The new and critical but obscure expressions in this definition are \\"well developed concepts\\" and \\"integrated framework,\\" whereas the idea of explaining or predicting phenomena by using a theory appeared also in the earlier definition. As I mentioned in my review of the earlier book, explaining or predicting phenomena can be done by using empirical knowledge too and therefore cannot be considered a distinguishing characteristic of theories. For example, the empirical laws of electromagnetism known before Maxwell served to explain, predict, and control many electromagnetic phenomena but did not constitute a theory. The authors repeat the same mistake when they admit that \\"a theory is more than a set of [empirical] findings;\\" and continue by saying, \\"it offers an explanation of phenomena\\" (p.22). They also say, \\"generating theories about phenomena, rather than just generating a set of findings, is important to the development of a field of knowledge\\" (pp. 22-23). That is correct, but the problem is to know how theories are generated. Also, \\"findings\\" too serve to explain phenomena, as mentioned, although they have a narrower scope than theories.\\"Statements of relationship [between phenomena] are commonly referred to as \`hypotheses'\\" (p. 103). \\"Any hypotheses and propositions derived from data must be continuously \`checked out' against incoming data and modified, extended, or deleted as necessary\\" (p. 22). The key concept here, which the authors do not clarify sufficiently, is the derivation of hypotheses from data. First, some relationships between phenomena can be deduced from the data. But what is thus produced constitutes not a hypothesis but empirical knowledge about those phenomena. It is when those relationships are \\"generalized through induction,\\" in Newton's words, that they become general rules which are of hypothetical nature, or hypotheses, because induction yields only probabilities, not certainties, as Bertrand Russell emphasized. The authors seem to ignore this fact. Moreover, when the hypotheses thus derived from data are \\"continuously \`checked out' against incoming data and modified, extended, or deleted as necessary\\" and those that are conserved are finally supported by all new information, they stop being hypotheses and become empirically known facts. And any set of such facts constitutes empirical knowledge, not a theory.The authors seem not to have a clear view of where induction and deduction are used. \\"Anytime a researcher derives hypotheses from data, because it involves interpretation, we consider that a deductive process\\" (p. 22). A relationship that is deduced from the data related to some singular phenomena constitutes empirical knowledge about those phenomena. A hypothesis is created out of that knowledge when it is \\"generalized through induction.\\" The total process is not only deduction but involves also induction. The authors express these facts in an obscure way thus: \\"At the heart of theorizing lies the interplay of making inductions (deriving concepts, their properties, and dimensions from data) and deductions (hypothesizing about the relationships between concepts, the relationships also are derived from data, but data that have been abstracted by the analyst from the raw data)\\" (p. 22). What the authors unclearly describe as \\"abstracted by the analyst from the raw data\\" is what Newton meant by the words \\"generalized through induction.\\" And the generalization must cover phenomena that do not allow the deduction of the hypothesis from the data if the hypothesis is expected to be used to construct a theory. The authors conclude: \\"At the end, it is hoped, the researcher has systematically developed the products of analysis into a theory\\" (p. 22). The major mistake in this conception of theory construction is that it ignores the following fact: A hypothesis that is \\"checked out against incoming data,\\" (i.e. fits the data, is deducible from the data) is no more a hypothesis but empirical knowledge and therefore a system of statements that contains only such tested hypotheses constitutes not a theory but a group of empirical knowledge. The authors repeat the same mistake when they say that a theory \\"is validated during the actual research process\\" (213). What can be validated during the \\"actual\\" (original) research process is empirical knowledge. A second phase of theory work is concerned with the validation of the theory, i.e. with showing that the consequences of the theory fit the phenomena, or that they are deducible not only from the theory but also from the phenomena. Consequently, the theory becomes usable in explaining, predicting, and controlling the phenomena.Only when knowledge that is deduced, or readily obtained, from the raw data related to some singular phenomena is \\"generalized through induction\\" and assumed, or hypothesized, to be valid also in relation to phenomena that do not make possible the deduction of that hypothesis from the data that a hypothesis is created that can be used to construct a theory. This means that a theory contains at least one hypothesis that cannot be deduced from the empirical data related to all phenomena to which it is assumed to apply. The reason for this is that a law of nature may be deduced from the data related to some phenomena but not from the data related to other phenomena. Consequently, by transferring knowledge from one set of phenomena to another can provide hypothetical knowledge that is otherwise unavailable. A theory is a set of general statements, or laws, of which at least one is such a non-testable hypothesis at the time of the construction of the theory. After a theory is thus constructed, consequences are deduced from it that serve to explain, predict, and control the related phenomena. The usefulness of a theory in doing these things constitutes the proof of its usability and also the proofs of all of its contents, including the non-testable hypothesis, or hypotheses. When phenomena that do not fit a tested and accepted theory are encountered, a more general theory is constructed. The old theory is not discarded by being considered wrong but remains in use in the area where it is valid, because it is simpler than the more general theory.The above-presented knowledge about the content and the method of construction of theories is derived from the grand theories of physics. I have shown in my books how the same method can be used in psychology too. As an example, I constructed a theory of automatic responses such as the symptoms of non-organic mental disorders, dreams, cerebral lateralization as structural response, etc. This theory serves not only to explain and predict those phenomena but also to control them very effectively where this is possible. I had to mention these here because the best test of ideas is their usefulness in explaining, predicting, and controlling the phenomena.Although Strauss and Corbin advocate what they call \\"grounded theory,\\" which is in reality nothing else than empirical knowledge, they expose their distrust of their work, which contains many unclear points, when they warn the reader by saying, \\"Remember that a theory is just that - a theory\\" (p. 213). Theories inspire more respect when their method of construction and their function are better understood.Cognitive-Behavioral Cybernetics of Symptoms, Dreams, Lateralization: Theory, Interpretation, TherapyTheory Construction and Testing in Physics and Psychology"},{"Title":"Barron's in-depth guide to the Ivy League schools;: The guide which gives an inside view no college catalog can give and tells it \\"like it is,\\"","review":"Andy Warhol said it best, \\"In the future everyone will be famous for 15 minutes.\\" I know it's true because in the middle of this book is a full-page picture of me, taken without my knowlege or permission, as I was standing near a table in the Barnard cafeteria.

These require the reader's manipulation: many pieces move flatly on the page (with a tab pull), some you unfold to reveal the pop up. While this may not dazzle as much initially, it does make it fun for kids as you read the question and they await the movement and answer. And this may mean they can turn the pages because it doesn't require as much care (as, say, a Sabuda pop up). Also, it might not get as destroyed by young, not-so careful readers.Two notes:My copy has a few pages where the tabs are a bit stiff.The last page, which has a light and music, requires the tab to be pushed back in to turn it off (if this isn't done, the battery will wear down)."},{"Title":"Jingle Bugs","review":"My children love David Carter's pop-up bug books!

My son is almost 7 and even he has to be reminded to manipulate them carefully or they will rip off."},{"Title":"Jingle Bugs","review":"Now I'm buying it for the little ones in my life! I definitely recommend to anyone looking for a fun holiday book"},{"Title":"Digital Animation Bible: Creating Professional Animation with 3ds Max, Lightwave, and Maya","review":"'How to set up and run a video production studio' -- the main problem with this book is it cover so much it only gives the briefest coverage of anything. He covers subjects as basic as surge protectors and laptop computers, printers, scanners.While digital animation proper is reduced to a couple of chapters. Lets take storyboards for instance - four scribbled panels on half a page - a couple of meaningless 'flow charts' and that is all. The animation samples are from the tutorial that comes with max and reproduced in B/W.If you want an overview I suppose this will be a good choice, but if you want to learn 3D CG, find another book"},{"Title":"Digital Animation Bible: Creating Professional Animation with 3ds Max, Lightwave, and Maya","review":"I bought the 'Digital Animation Bible' in December 2003 and I've been reading and re-reading it ever since. I can honestly say that it is about the most useful book of its kind that I've ever come across. My background is in graphics and digital audio and I would describe my general knowledge of computing as strong...but you don't need that much computer experience to get major benefits from reading this.The book offers comprehensive overviews of the three leading animation programs (3ds Max, Lightwave and Maya) and also gives extensive coverage to general information about virtually every aspect of the field. If you're starting out with either no knowledge or just a general grasp, you should finish up with a very clear idea of what's going on and how you could get in on the action.Normally, I get bored with shelf-busters because they often don't tell you much you don't already know - or if they do, they take relatively straight forward ideas and pedal them out over so many pages that you either loose the thread, or fall asleep before you arrive at the meat of the issue.George Avgeraki's book is different. He's got a real knack for condensing key ideas into just a few pages or paragraphs in such a way as to make it possible for you to 'get it' with comparative ease. He also has a positive and enthusiastic 'can do' writing style that makes it easy to absorb what he's pitching you.There is a great intro to splines, an extremely revealing description of the use by professionals of 3rd party compositing programs for rendering, and lots excellent insights on how people actually approach their work on a day to day basis.The chapter on 'objects and surfaces' is particularly worth visiting - even if you think that you already have the basic idea.One of the unique things about this manual that sets it apart from the competition is that George Avgerakis has peppered it with lots of valuable little nuggets from his business experience in the field. He's done this in a way that's funny and entertaining - it never gets in the way of the the reason why you're reading the book - but it's illuminating, whether your coming to this field as freelancer or as potential (or actual) employee. If you want some insight into what your client or employer is looking for from you in the computer animation game then you can get that perspective courtesy of Mr Avgerakis.So, in summary, a great book and well worth your reading time."},{"Title":"Digital Animation Bible: Creating Professional Animation with 3ds Max, Lightwave, and Maya","review":"This book is designed to give a broad discussion about breaking into the 3D animation industry (esp. in large media meccas like NYC and LA) as well as review three of the most popular and powerful 3D software packages currently available - 3ds max, LightWave, and Alias Maya.The author owns an animation production company in NYC so he has a lot of \\"real-world\\" advice to newbies looking to become digital animators. He talks a lot about the business aspects of the trade, and provides numerous humorous anecdotes about his own trials and tribulations in the past three decades in this deadline-intensive business. Most of the first half of the book is spent detailing the career path you should take to become a successful animator. The author also gives his opinions on the hardware needed to create digital animation on a desktop workstation.The second half of the book is devoted to comparing 3ds max, LightWave, and Alias Maya and their relative strengths and weaknesses. As someone who is totally new to 3D animation, I found this section to be most useful. The author explains in common terms all the tools and capabilities of these 3D applications. It's obvious he did his research on all three software products and he is careful not to promote one over any other.This book is not intended for someone who is already familiar with 3D software and looking to improve their skill set. For that purpose, there are many good books that go into much greater detail over a product's toolset and capabilities. But for the beginner 3D animator wanna-bes, this is a good book to break the ice and introduce you to the exciting and rapidly-evolving field of digital 3D animation."},{"Title":"Digital Animation Bible: Creating Professional Animation with 3ds Max, Lightwave, and Maya","review":"After having read this book I questioned myself of what subject I have actually learned. Did I read a storybook on the business or did I actually learn to create professional animation with 3ds Max, Lightwave, and Maya? It seems that George Avgerakis is very savvy when it comes to the applications of business for Animation or he would not exist in his present position. As such he does very little in the terms of providing a good example of actually creating professional quality animation. He sells you a completely different book instead, which mind you, with a different cover could tell a better tale. I would like to caution those interested in the applications of this book, there is no technical basis that would categorize this book as a tool to help you produce better work. My conclusion: Money better spent elsewhere."},{"Title":"Digital Animation Bible: Creating Professional Animation with 3ds Max, Lightwave, and Maya","review":"Read the review by \\"Bob - The guy from nowhere\\". It's the most accurate description of this book.Don't waste your time or money on this one. It does not do a good job of covering any of the primary points it claims to present. Granted, it would take several books to cover each topic, but even as a general overview it's really not that useful. Digital Animation Bible? I don't think so!At the beginning of the book, the author writes \\"I didn't want to open [this book] with a lot of boring stuff about how this book was organized or what you could expect to get out of it.\\" There is a good reason for that. You will be asking yourself the same question by the end of the book."},{"Title":"Deathbird stories","review":"This is a very black, dark book. This is not a book for kids, nor is it a book for people who haven't read anything by Ellison previously. Harlan Ellison is one of those rare writers that can finish a story so powerfully, that you'll feel like you've been literally stabbed in the heart. Like many of Ellison's short story collections, he deals with a specific theme. In this book, he writes short stories about gods, in all their myriad shapes and forms. Gods of machines, pain, rocks, speed, revenge, among others. Of the 19 stories in this collection, let me tell you what I consider to be the best. THE WHIMPER OF WHIPPED DOGS: Ellison's award-winning retelling of the Kitty Genovese incident. Never heard of Kitty Genovese? Don't worry, after reading this chilling tale, you'll make sure you remember. BASILISK: A traitor to his country comes home and finds that he is not welcome. A little confusing at first, but you'll soon get the hang of it. PRETTY MAGGIE MONEYEYES: Don't let the strange title deceive you. This is Ellison in TOP form. Ever wondered what gods reside at the casinos and what they have in mind. It's not PRETTY, I can assure you. ERNEST AND THE MACHINE GOD: An easy-to-visualize story about a girl in a car-accident and her meetings at a gas station. ADRIFT OFF THE ISLETS OF LANGERHANS . . . : Another award-winning story about a man trying to find the geographical location of his soul. THE DEATHBIRD: Still another award-winner. This one is Ellison's retelling of Genesis. This story has a very innovative structure to it. You'll see what I mean, when you buy this book."},{"Title":"Deathbird stories","review":"This collection groups nineteen of Ellison's stories dealing with subjects such as gods spirits and suchlike. In former times, people created numerous gods and spirits for just about every aspect of their lives. Gods for thunder the moon and the sea. Spirits and Ghosts living in caves, rivers etc. What if we still felt the need to invent and invoke such gods and spirits today? What would they be like? A god for machines? A spirit in a slot machine? A demon ruling over violent crime? These are the subjects that Ellison deals with in this collection of stories.The book straddles the boundaries between science fiction, fantasy and horror and as such it will not satisfy SF purists but it does contain a number of very powerful stories. The opening tale, &quot;The Whimper of Whipped Dogs&quot; is a shocking and worrying take on the cruelty of city violence. It is followed by &quot;Along the Scenic Route&quot; in which modern day knights in armour fight their jousts to the death on the public highway. Those two, along with &quot;Ernest and the MachineGod&quot;, &quot;Basilisk&quot; and &quot;Deathbird&quot; are my favourites but they are not the only stories to leap off the page and grab hold of your imagination. There are some weaker tales here too but they are outnumbered by the good ones.I'd not recommend this as an introduction to Ellison. The anthology &quot;The Essential Ellison&quot; fills that role perfectly but, if you read and enjoyed that, you will like this book. If you like this book, I'd recommend Ellen Datlow's themed anthology &quot;Alien Sex&quot; though not her rather weak follow up."},{"Title":"Deathbird stories","review":"I read this book because, in the acknowledgements his wonderful novel \\"American Gods,\\" neil gaiman said this book burned itself into the back of brain when he was still young enough for something like that to happen.Well, how can you resist an endorsement like that? So, I raced up to the nearest library that had this book (an hour or so away, I'll have you know) and checked it out. And befoul these modern gods if it didn't blow my mind. At least, parts of it did.Most of the stories - \\"the Whimper of Whipped Dogs,\\" \\"Shattered Like a Glass Goblin,\\" \\"Basilisk,\\" and \\"Ernest and the Machine God,\\" just to name a few - are really brilliant. They will twist your mind around like only certain versions of certain myths can. They will smack your conciousness around until you think there really are gods in the engine of your car and that traitors really are the high priests of Aries. They will, as Niel Gaiman says, burn themselves into the back of your brain.Others, however, are not so brilliant. A few simply repeated ideas put forth in other, better stories. Some were simply not as interesting as the others, and some were both uninteresting and sordid. But please note that \\"some\\" could and should be read as \\"one, two at the outside.\\" The majority are amazing.On the whole, however, this is a wonderful book. I am shocked and dismayed to find that it it unavailable. I think anybody who is into mythology should read this book, just for some of the ideas expressed in it. So should anyone who read \\"American Gods\\" and thought it was cool, too. They should have a good time pointing to certain stories and saying, \\"Neil Gaiman lifted that, that and that.\\" I recommend this book highly. Even with the few faulty tales herein, it is definately worth the time."},{"Title":"Deathbird stories","review":"Harlan presents some stellar stories here about what modern gods might be like in what one would call a pessimistic, cynical outlook. He moves through such milieus as sci-fi, high fantasy and even urban fantasy through this book.The best stories are very hard-hitting and emotionally affecting. These include The Whimper of Whipped Dogs, a retelling of the Kitty Genovese episode about the alleged god of New York City, The Basilisk, where the most terrifying aspect of the story is how a small town treats a returning POW and Pretty Maggie Moneyeyes where a manipulative woman continues to manipulate even after death. There are some other good stories, such as the road rage tale, though not as emotionally hard-hitting.The problems in several of the stories stem from an abundance of cleverness. Rather than letting the story take the forefront, Harlan chooses to favor style over substance in an attempt to showcase his virtuoisity in the various methods of writing. This lessened some of his stories for me. He is most successful doing this in the titular tale, The Deathbird, but it was still distracting even there.A very good collection though, despite the flaws. It is unapologetic and uncomprimising demanding you take the stories on their own terms."},{"Title":"Deathbird stories","review":"For those fans of Ellison, you will not be disappointed, for those of you not familiar with Ellison, this one will have you hitting the used book stores in a vain hope of finding more fodder for your mind. (Don't bother looking, I already hit every book store myself.) Reading this book is like seeing Mohammed Ali box or Stevie Ray Vaughn play the guitar, you get the feeling of seeing the best at his best. Every story in this collection is a gem, some more than others. &quot;The Whimpering of Whipped Dogs&quot; is a classic in and of itself. &quot;The Deathbird&quot; is the most amazing story ever created by a fantasy writer and I say this with no hyperbole. Go out and get this book . . . NOW! It will change the way you view the world and yourself. Other books make this promise, Deathbird Stories is the only book I've ever read that actually delivers."},{"Title":"Deathbird stories","review":"While I typically associate Harlan Ellison with Science Fiction, I'm somewhat hesitant to call all of these stories SciFi... they are more like Twilight Zone episodes. They are 19 short stories that involve individuals getting caught up in all sorts of fantastic situations. While there is a general underlying theme of the stories involving \\"Gods\\", I found that the main uniting feature was the fantastic nature of the stories.Some sample reviews from the collection:ALONG THE SCENIC ROUTE(1969)***** - Ellison published this tale of \\"Road Rage\\" way back in the late 60's. It is definately a classic, and one of the more SciFi-esque stories from this collection. Richard K. Morgan recently tried to do a modern \\"Road Rage\\" novel, MARKET FORCES(2005)***, which takes ideas from ALONG THE SCENIC ROUTE, but ultimately falls flat.O YE OF LITTLE FAITH(1968)**** - A young man of no faith in any god, is accompanying his mid-30's girlfriend back from a quick Tijuana abortion, in this pre-Roe vs. Wade world (Roe vs. Wade was decided in late 1973), and finds himself transported to a world populated by gods nobody believes in any longer.PRETTY MAGGIE MONEYEYES(1967)*** - A sad story of two people's fateful encounter via a Slot Machine in a Las Vegas Casino. One is a pretty poor girl, who turns to prostitution to claw her way from the ghetto to Beverly Hills; the other is a long-time Vegas loser, who is down to his last dollar, and who's luck is about to change, but is it for the better?CORPSE(1972)**** - A Latin American Studies professor from Columbia University, a man of some faith in Christianity, begins to see the emergence of a new type of god - the Automobile God, but ultimately fails to realize the inevitability and make the transition to the new faith.SHATTERED LIKE A GLASS GOBLIN(1969)***** - A Marine, recently back from Vietnam, enters and becomes consumed by the varied pesonalities and drugs in a 60's \\"Party House\\"... reminds me of an old house my recently graduated high school buddies rented in San Diego, CA in the 70's (and which was slated to be razed along with the adjacent drive-in theater, to make way for a new shopping center). Like O YE OF LITTLE FAITH, this story is notable for the snapshot it gives of a Beatle's White Album-era America. Indeed, having just said that, I just realized that the title of this story SHATTERED LIKE A GLASS GOBLIN(1969), seems to be a play on the title of the Beatle's White Album song LOOKING THROUGH A GLASS ONION(1968).This book has recently been republished by the SFBC in December 2005, as part of the third set of books in the SFBC 50th Anniversary Collection."},{"Title":"Deathbird stories","review":"This is a review for the audio book, which has an almost entirely different collection of stories (audio form) than the print 1975 book. This listing is for the audio book from 2011 with the stories listed in the Amazon description, but Amazon seems to have a policy to automatically merge all reviews for a title regardless of the edition, regardless of the format. This will mean many of the stories listed in the reviews will not be in both and buyers may be disappointed.This is a collection of 13 stories mostly dating from after 1975, and most are read by H. Ellison. The standouts are the later \\"magical realism\\"-style and fragmented stories that Ellison was mastering in the '70s through the '80s, \\"The Deathbird\\" and particularly \\"The Man Who Rowed Christopher Columbus To Shore\\" (both award winners). Ellison's reading style tends to oversell the language and the emotions (he tends to lapse into dialects too) and can be a bit distracting in his emphatic delivery, particularly in \\"Killing Bernstein\\" here in which he is making sure it reads \\"funny,\\" but the 2 others above are read a little more quietly by readers who have fantastic voices (I believe Deathbird is read by Theodore Bikel) and are quite powerful for letting the words do the talking without Ellison's hyperactivity. \\"The Deathbird\\" is notoriously hard to follow on the page for me and having heard it here I really appreciated its subtle powers.Later stories like \\"On The Slab\\" and \\"Croatoan\\" and \\"The Whimper of Whipped Dogs\\" are firmly of the era in which most of HE's protagonists are doomed and adrift in an unfriendly universe, forced to negotiate with evil forces and impulses that have been brought to light through their own (often inadvertent) actions. There are seldom happy endings in Ellison's stories but rather, there are realizations of our own duplicity, our own limitations, our own willingness to live with hurt and damage if we can survive another day.\\"Some of the later pieces included (\\"Ellison Wonderland\\" (1994, after the Jacek Yerka painting), \\"The Creation of Water\\", \\"The Dreams A Nightmare Dreams\\") are shorter poetic exercises less plotted stories than mood pieces. Ellison's language always has a muscular force and the increasingly poetic turns of phrase and metaphors lend themselves well to aloud reading. The collection also includes HE's \\"Run For The Stars\\" a long late '50s SF tale that is the most dated piece here and is ultimately unremarkable yet seems to be one of HE's favorites as it is constantly being reprinted and recycled for his collections. I almost wonder if it was included to add length.This is a great way to hear some of HE's famous stories read almost as if they were meant to be enjoyed that way.Ellison Wonderland, The Creation of Water, Run For the Stars, Beast Who Shouted..., On The Slab, The Dreams A Nightmare Dreams, The Whimper..., Killing Bernstein, and How Interesting A Tiny Man are all read by Ellison.The Deathbird, Croatoan, The Man Who Rowed..., and Count the Clock That Tells The Time are read by other readers in the collection."},{"Title":"Deathbird stories","review":"Harlan Ellison has published just a LOT of excellent short fiction (from \\"Daniel White For the Greater Good\\" and \\"The Resurgence of Miss Ankle-strap Wedgie,\\" to \\"Paladin of the Lost Hour\\" and \\"Soft Monkey,\\" as well as the recent, 2011 Nebula Award-Winning short story, \\"How Interesting: A Tiny Man\\"). And besides seminal anthologies like DANGEROUS VISIONS and AGAIN, DANGEROUS VISIONS, he's also published at least a half-a-dozen must-have collections of his own work (perhaps one or two more, depending on how they are held up to the light). Of those collections, DEATHBIRD STORIES is, without a doubt, the one that stands head and shoulders above a body of work which already stands head and shoulders above the sea of published words floating around out there (for the record, the other collections are STRANGE WINE, SHATTERDAY, MINDFIELDS, ANGRY CANDY and SLIPPAGE -- failing those, THE ESSENTIAL ELLISON will do, as well). DEATHBIRD STORIES is a group of tales that addresses the issues of modern gods (whilst simultaneously saying something about older gods, like Jehovah): the gods of freeways, gambling, love, cities and commerce. DEATHBIRD STORIES has always been a powerful cycle of stories that can literally leave a reader emotionally and intellectually wrung out if read cover to cover in one sitting. Which might be part of the reason why Ellison saw fit to publish an Expanded Edition, this year, 2011, via Subterranean Press (that, and the fact that the stories included fit well inside the thematic cycle). At least two of the three newer stories have a bit of humor and levity, something that was largely absent in the 19 stories that have made up this collection for over thirty years. \\"From A to Z, In the Sarsaparilla Alphabet,\\" is one of those. Like the similarly titled story in his STRANGE WINE collection, this is a series of short-shorts and vignettes, ranging from a hilarious exchange between two lower class \\"Demiurges\\" ((\\"A is for Archon\\": \\"Not Oprah, kid! Okra, the vegetable!\\"), to more serious pieces dealing with racism, it's the type of Borgesian piece of fiction that Ellison has practiced to perfection. The next story, \\"The Whimper of Whipped Dogs,\\" pulls the reader headlong into the aforementioned, emotionally relentless flow of narratives. This particular story (winner of an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America) deals with the gods of violence, and the perils of ignoring the appetites of those particular beasts (it is based on a true story, something that happened to a poor young woman in New York City in the 1960s -- and, sadly, a violent event that was nearly repeated, detail for detail, decades later -- because humans rarely, if ever, listen and learn). \\"Along the Scenic Route\\" is a story about idiots and autos, and a need for speed that results in the ultimate road rage, that speaks well to the culutre of VinDiesel-film-inspired street racing that so many young and stupid men have taken to (once again) in these days of waning resources. A tale involving ghosts, a unicorn and the cemetaries of St. Louis, \\"On the Downhill Side\\" may be the most perfect story about love ever written. The gods of gambling get the once over in \\"Pretty Maggie Moneyeyes\\", another Ellison classic which Robert Silverberg claims has the most perfect last line of any story he has ever read.A man named Lawrence Talbot goes in search of his very soul (finding it in a location he'd never expected) in \\"Adrift Just Off the Islets of Langerhans...\\" (a story which won the Hugo Award) and, in \\"The Man Who Rowed Christopher Columbus Ashore\\" (a story chosen for inclusion in the prestigious, Best American Short Story collection, 1993), Ellison uses a Shirly Jackson story as inspiration for a quintessential Ellison tale (humor & pathos; short sharp Borgesian jabs; unusual structure) that deals with the notion of personal responsiblility, and the ultimate editct: thou art god. The last story, \\"The Deathbird,\\" deals with Christian mythology and the notion of forgiveness and the afterlife and...just a whole lot of things, and is another Hugo-Award-winning virtuouso that will leave the reader wrung out.Like recent publications by Ray Bradbury, P.K. Dick and Kurt Vonnegut republished by Everyman's and the Library of America, Ellison's DEATHBIRD STORIES is a seminal work of fantasy and SF, and a book that is deserving of it's status (and a book that should be collected by one of those prestigious publishers). It's also a book that should be in every home library, it's that good -- and that essential."},{"Title":"Deathbird stories","review":"The philosopher of horror and sci-fi, Harlan Ellison offers terrifying myths and metaphors for the modern age in the guise of horror stories. These stories are emotionally and intellectually provocative, sometimes leaving the reader in a troubled state of mind, as the author warns in the book's forward. Definitely not \\"kid stuff,\\" Ellison's stories express the spiritual terror of modern man, tottering like Nietzsche's tightrope walker over the abyss."},{"Title":"Deathbird stories","review":"Not for the easily offended, the stories within are darkand visceral, raw and questioning of the assumptions mostpeople never question. Save the title story, &quot;TheDeathbird,&quot; for last; it is a masterpiece in a collectionof (for the most part) masterpieces. A pantheon of &quot;moderngods&quot; for a callous, painful modern age."},{"Title":"Deathbird stories","review":"I suspect that most of these stories are already inThe Essential Ellison: A 50 Year Retrospective (Revised and Expanded)and that renders this collection obsolete. Could be why it's out of print. I had a copy and I read it so many times. Then I gave it to a friend that I never talk to anymore. Be that a lesson for you. It was signed too.But from the first story, a meditation on Kitty Genovese and the urban habit of just watching violence without doing anything, to the last one \\"Deathbird\\" which works the same theme asHis Dark Materials Trilogy (The Golden Compass; The Subtle Knife; The Amber Spyglass) (His Dark Materials)but more effectively, there's not a story in this collection that I felt wasted my time. This is rare as many Harlan Ellison collections mix the brilliant with the clunkers.If you can buy a copy, buy a copy. It's well worth the price."},{"Title":"Deathbird stories","review":"Great stories, some powerful, difficult themes and ideas at play here. The story at the end (I believe it was called 'The Deathbird' ) alone merits purchasing the book- easily some of Ellison's best work."},{"Title":"Deathbird stories","review":"I don't believe I've ever read a more memorable collection of stories.

They are well written, cohesive, and thought provoking. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in a sci-fi/fantasy approach to philosophical discussions on morality, god(s), and religion."},{"Title":"Deathbird stories","review":"The subtitle for Deathbird Stories is \\"A Pantheon of Modern Gods,\\" which in some ways is a more appropriate title for the collection, given that this is a tale of modern gods in our society: the god of the automobile, of the city, of brutality, of war, of machines. And, as expected from Ellison, the collection is masterful work, with even the \\"worst\\" stories still being compelling. But at its best, Deathbird Stories is unnerving, disturbing stuff. \\"The Whimper of Whipped Dogs\\" kicks off the collection with a nightmarish look into the infamous Kitty Genovese case, finding at its heart something far more evil than we first thought...and yet something all the more believable for its brutality. Bookending it is \\"The Deathbird,\\" a postmodern retelling of the book of Genesis from a very different perspective, all the way to a perfect ending for the collection. And between the two come any number of knockouts, including a fascinating take on the ghost story as set in a casino (\\"Pretty Maggie Moneyeyes\\"), a surreal plunge into 60s rebellion (\\"Shattered Like a Glass Goblin\\"), an unusual effort to understand pain and torment (\\"Paingod\\"), a surreal little burst of terror (\\"Bleeding Stones\\"), and even a weirdly comic tale of love in the strangest place (\\"Neon\\"). For too many people, Ellison is known more for his outspoken rants and his difficult personality; Deathbird Stories is a reminder that behind the critic, there's a ridiculously talented and intelligent author capable of incredible work."},{"Title":"Deathbird stories","review":"I am a huge Ellison fan and this is one of favorite books.

And when you do, whatever effort you exerted will have been well worth it.Harlan Ellison used this book to examine, debunk, and even glorify gods and how they relate to us. From the title story &quot;The Deathbird&quot; to the gutter-view &quot;Pretty Maggie Moneyeyes&quot;, he treats us to as many disturbing viewpoints as one person can stomach...he then adds one or two more, just to show you who's in charge.It's an excellent book. You'll never look at anything quite the same way again."},{"Title":"Deathbird stories","review":"Ellison, above all, is one of the foremost writers of our age, and among his many collections stands The Deathbird, a spread of years that contains within its stories pain, anger, hate, love, and ever present truth. The Deathbird itself is a masterpiece, a written hospital trauma case that, if you but listen, threatens to tear apart all that you know and make you see more than you ever wanted to. The only downside is that we aren't gifted with AM's mad cackle, but still... these are the gods we know today, these are the gods we revear whether we know it or not."},{"Title":"Deathbird stories","review":"From the very start of &quot;The Whimper of Whipped Dogs&quot; you realize that these stories and not for the timid of heart.

Sometimes he gets a little irrascible and you find yourself reading a fifty page tirade against Gene Roddenberry, which has its value. However, if you want to know who has been causing all these young writers to be so vicious and original (I'm thinking specifically Poppy Z. Brite, but the influence goes out far) read this book.

I have read Deathbird Stories at least 20 times and have yet to tire of it."},{"Title":"Deathbird stories","review":"I bought this because a blog I follow said some interesting things about it. I have never read Ellison before. I am not all the way through the 19 or so short stories however, the six or so I have read have been interesting. Harland Ellison's imagery is fantastic and there is nothing to criticize about his story telling ability. The actual stories themselves though come from a place I'm not sure I have ever been. This is a good thing.I'm not a philosopher but I would say there is a dark, almost monstrous notion to Ellison's view of man's life experience. A sense that one can't win for losing. A notion that God's change and become more monstrous as man himself becomes more monstrous. Sounds like a dire, shifting unstable universe.I was intrigued by the short phrase at the beginning of the book where Ellison says one should not read all these stories in one sitting. He says it could be too much, \\"the emotional content maybe too upsetting\\". When I heard that I had to buy it. So far though it has been pretty tame though. I do look forward to completing the book."},{"Title":"Deathbird stories","review":"Harlan Ellison has written some many memorable, bizarre stories in his day. However in this collection, 'Deathbird Stories', I am afraid my review is polar opposite of the glowing reviews posted on amazon.com. I really couldn't find anything of value in this book. The stories are almost unintelligible in their incoherent rambling. Rather than cool, these stories are a total mess. I was utterly disappointed. I give it two stars instead of one only because of the author's reputation (...I almost never give one star reviews).Bottom line: not even worth the one dollar I paid for it at a thrift store. A total waste."},{"Title":"Deathbird stories","review":"The All-Singing, All Dancing, Extremely Entertaining Audio Ellison#4:FIRST, IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT I AM ENTERING THIS REVIEW FOR A FRIEND (Booklover59) BECAUSE THE INCOMEPETENT FOLKS AT AMAZON, AFTER BEING ADVISED THAT THIS AUDIO COLLECTION, -- PUBLISHED BY AUDIBLE.COM, A COMPANY THAT _WORKS WITH_ AMAZON -- IS _A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT COLLECTION OF TALES_ (thus the different titles, doh) FROM A BOOK ENTITLED _DEATHBIRD STORIES_, PROCEEDED TO WRITE SOME INANE REPLY REVEALING THEY STILL THINK THIS IS THE SAME BOOK AS THE AFOREMENTIONED (even though my friend took the time to explain, in detail, that the contents were different). AND THEY, THE FOLKS AT AMAZON, DID NOT FIX THEIR MISTAKE (removing the reveiws of the _book_, DEATHBIRD STORIES, from this online posting of the _audiobook, THE DEATHBIRD & OTHER STORIES). STUPID IS AS STUPID DOES. ONWARD AND UPWARD. NOW, THE REVIEW OF _THE DEATHBIRD & OTHER STORIES, NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH _THE DEATHBIRD_ (published by Subterranean Press):Having recently purchased -- and seriously enjoyed the hell out of -- Vol. 4 & vol. 5 of Ellison's \\"The Voice From the Edge\\" series of Audio book/story & essay collections, I was moved to listen to the first three volumes (purchased as each one came out, earlier this century) and then review all five of the \\"Voice From the Edge\\" Audiobooks by Harlan Ellison. Ellison starts from strenght, again, in this collection with a reading of \\"Ellison Wonderland,\\" a short-short taken from MINDFIELDS, his sadly underrated (and underreviewed) collaboration with the imaginative illustrator and paitnter, Jacek Yerka. Inspired by both Yerka's paintings (as were all the stories in MINDFIELDS) and a maddening \\"layover/delay\\" in an American aiport, the story is a great piece of Borgesian paranoia regarding unwelcome changes in the events of our daily lives (it's always _them_, ain't it?).Like Volume 5 in this series, volume 4 contains reading by some guests whose skills are on par with Ellison's when it comes to narration. Not sure _which_ of the listed guest narrators reads \\"The Deathbird\\" (Arte Johnson perhaps?), but he sounds just a _lot_ like Max Von Sydow. And the voice works perfectly for the dark and cynical anti-King James version of mythical events, starting with creation and onward. Like many of Ellison's signature stories, \\"The Deathbird\\" is a tale which makes use of straight-forward narration as well as narrative, metafictional \\"tricks\\" (a pseudo \\"test\\", dropped into the middle of the narrative, as well as an emotional essay about the death of a pet dog). My only complaint would be that his voice _doesn't_ get soft (or wistful) enough when reading \\"Ahbhu\\", the essay about the death of a writer's (Ellison's) dog. Read in the right way, it's a punch in the gut that is guaranteed to bring a lump to the throat. \\"The Creation of Water\\" is yet another short-short from MINDFIELDS, and yet another short, sharp, poke to the intellect. A novella previously released on audio, \\"Run For the Stars\\" is on of about half-a-dozen stories set in an SF story Ellison first came up with when writing \\"Demon With a Glass Hand\\" (a teleplay for \\"The Outer Limits that won him his first WGA award). Aliens known as teh Kyben have invaded earth-settled planets out in space. Earthman Benno Tallent, a career criminal, is captured by his own soldiers, and forced to become a human bomb (a bit of relevance in today's world, even though this is a story from the 1950's), so that the survivors of a Kyben invasion can escape while Benno \\"holds\\" a sort of gun to the head of the alien forces. This sets up a chase across the planet story that is pure, space-opera/action-thriller, and Ellison has all sorts of fun with it while narrating the tale. \\"Croatoan\\" (narrated by a guest) is Ellison's famous story about the moral ambiguities of abortion -- and, of course (as he so often does), Ellison turns it into a tale of _personal responsiblity_. Without giving too much of the spooky gruesomeness away, suffice it to say that the protagonist is chided -- by a highly emotional girlfriend -- into going down into the sewers of New York City to try and find a just-flushed fetus. What he finds down there is another world, full of thoroughly creepy old men, reptiles, connections to a Roanoake settlement of long-ago, and...something else. Still as \\"trippy\\" as it was when he wrote it in the '60s, \\"The Beast That Shouted Love at the Heart of the World\\" is also just as unsettling as it was long ago, as well (it begins with a milkman delivering death --inspiration, perhaps, for a Stephen King tale?). And Ellison's delivery is pitch-perfect. The follow-up, \\"On the Slab\\", a Lovecraft-inspired tale is one of those stories that seems like a Universal Monster flick, but catches up with you an hour or so later. Good stuff, and another spot-on bit of Ellison narration. Even though I would've _loved_ to hear Ellison read his \\"Best American Short Story\\" (of 1993)-honored piece of fiction, the narrator who _does_ read it (Johnson again, perhaps?) does a bang-up job, balancing the pathos with the bouts of whimsy, making for a funny, moving, enlightening, and eye-opening story which rests at the core of this collection. \\"The Dreams A Nightmare Dreams\\" is another of those \\"entertainments\\" mentioned in reviews past, but this one is almost the verbal equivalent of an illustration (much like the MINDFIELD tales). It was written for and inspired by a H.R. Gieger drawing, and it also works as a tale that might be about the out-of-control contents of a story-teller's mind -- a storyteller who helped keep the nightmares of the world at bay. The second of Ellison's Edgar-winning stories to be recorded for Audio books, \\"The Whimper of Whipped Dogs\\" is famous for having been inspired by the death of Kitty Genovese (a name everyone interested should google some time). Ellison's reading is a chilling as the message of his now classic tale of a city (and a world?) lacking in empathy. Drenched in dark humor, \\"Killing Bernstein\\" is a crime-fiction-cum-science fiction tale that would've been perfect material for \\"the Twilight Zone\\". Ellison's reading is does it ample justice. \\"Count the Clock That Tells the Time\\" is a fable about, well...making the most of the minutes, hours, days, months and years we all have within us, and how two particular people -- who _don't_ make the most of their days -- deal with the consequences (it is read by a guest narrator). And, finally, Harlan Ellison's most _recent_ piece of fiction (published in 2010, and the winner of a Nebula Award in the short story category), \\"How Interesting: A Tiny Man\\" is a tale that conjures thoughts about ever-growing mass of increasingly intolerant people living in the USA, as well as thoughts about the creator and his creation (a bit of homage to Mary Shelly, perhaps? Or the author and his pseudonym or public image, maybe?). Ellison's reading, like the story, is sublime."},{"Title":"War","review":"Burroughs had told us this before- breathing is conspiring, consciousness is complicity. We are steeped to our eyes in blood, the atmosphere is redolent with the reek of putrefaction. Shrieks resound in the air, the ozone that we breathe is choked with hate. Raining down upon the pavement is a hail of shrapnel, landmines eagerly await their prey. We are all caught in the crosshairs, our bodies are marked for death. In this perpetual holocaust, who has time for thought, let alone literature?Few writers are quite as angry as J.M.G. Le Clezio- \\"War\\" is a maelstrom, an avalanche of a book, a relentless torrent that leaves little room for introspection or quiet contemplation. But then again, one might say that it has to be- Le Clezio is trying desperately to devise a rhetorical strategy commensurate with its task, one that is capable of keeping apace with its subject: global capital. It is true that a sense of despondency permeates the novel- \\"War\\" is unquestionably a far bleaker novel than its incendiary little cousin, \\"The Giants\\". Le Clezio, like Adorno and Beckett before him, is all-too-aware of the futility of any literary endeavor in an epoch where the human conscience has been eclipsed by unspeakable brutalities. It is foolhardy to imagine that the human being, once the pivot of the modern novel, can be retrieved from the humiliation to which he has been consigned.There is a discernibly Situationist streak that courses through \\"War\\", and Le Clezio's concerns are essentially Debord's: in a world where every image is intrinsically/inextricably bound to barbarity, where money and power have infiltrated every crevice of cultural production, can one continue to speak of autonomous art? Cue Walter Benjamin and his Theses On History: every page of European literature is saturated with gore, and the ornate treasures that clog the coffers of Western civilization bear the blemishes of murder (to make matters worse, there are those who blow the bugles for Western progress: the socialist realists and more disturbingly, Marinetti's Futurists, whom Le Clezio seems to lampoon in \\"War\\" and \\"The Giants\\"). The writer is ensnared in an impossibility: reticence is surrender, yet to speak is to inscribe oneself within a legacy of homicide. Debord's question remains crucial to all of us who aspire to create: in a society of the spectacle, deluged as it is with images, sounds and words on a daily basis, more culture is perhaps the last thing we need. The public is glutted with culture, they are constipated with it, art oozes out of every orifice. To make another film, to write another novel, to take another photograph is to fling more refuse upon this rancid heap of detritus.This was, of course, precisely the argument Georges Bataille levied against his erstwhile compatriots, Breton's surrealists- all their Trotskyist postuering amounts to just so much childish provocation as long as they continue to churn out works. It is all very well to engage in automatic writing and painting, just as long as one consigns such efforts to the furnace when they have outlived their purpose. To furnish the market with more artifacts is to capitulate: every work is a declaration of allegiance to the very forces that one purports to negate.To exacerbate matters, Le Clezio points out that the Western artistic impulse, one that is Promethean to the core, is at root an expression of violence. There is something pathetic about artistic desire, arrested as it is at the first moment of the master/slave dialectic: \\"Perhaps, whatever one does, one is always seeking that one thing, to be ONESELF, to hurt other people, to dominate the world. Even when one says nothing, one is saying something. Even if one managed to write, if it were possible to write, like this: ___ perhaps that would be just as violent a way as the others of saying AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, I EXIST, I THINK THAT, etc. You know that phrase of Descartes: 'I wish to believe that no-one existed before me.' That's what is so terrible, having to witness war, having to watch this whole farce, the individual fighting to impose himself on others, it's enough to make one sick, one longs to disappear, to stop being anything at all, and then one becomes conscious that one is acting that way, with all one's condemnations, because one wants to be different, and then everything goes rotten and it's no longer possible to be lucid. This desire to assert oneself is such a painful process. When I see others making the effort, my heart bleeds for them. They would do anything, anything at all, just so that people will listen to them.\\" (page 160)As they say, damned if you do, damned if you don't- Stirner's spectre seems to hover ominously above all artistic expression. Even Bataille's proposal of the potlatch, the consummately nihilistic destruction of artifacts (as opposed to their creation) is hardly a solution. Negation and antithesis is just another form of egoistic chestbeating, juvenile contrarianism.So, what to do? Having taken stock of all the impasses that impede the Western novel, \\"War\\" is an attempt, if not to supersede these irreconcilable deadlocks, at least to confront them head-on. Le Clezio is sensitive to the fact that the modern writer is an abject, forlorn creature- smothered by the hubbub of the marketplace, his voice enters into competition with the rapidfire chatter of the demagogue, the ominous blare of the radio, the hypnotic glow of the television. Against such odds, the writer is compelled to scream. In howling at his public, he risks being seen as a village fool, a raving lunatic. Is this not the situation Nietzsche faced so many years ago? The tone of \\"War\\" has the hectoring, haranguing urgency of Nietzsche's most impassioned work, and some might complain that some of it can come across as distastefully didactic, even hysterically hyperbolical. Le Clezio seems to have no problems with aligning himself with other paranoiac prophets of panic: William S Burroughs, JG Ballard, Michel Foucault (this book explains biopower/politics better than anything else you can name), Jean Baudrillard and Paul Virilio, whose discussions of speed, technology and the military diagram have much in common with this novel. Yet Le Clezio's vision is, at heart, deeply ecological- punctuating the delirious auguries of the apocalypse are elegiac odes to the natural world that he loves so much.Having read \\"The Giants\\" before this one, I can't help but feel that \\"War\\" is a tad clumsier. Some of the passages do seem a bit bloated, and the wholesale condemnation of technology does begin to wear thin a little bit near the end. It would be injudicious to suggest that \\"War\\" is a sort of dress rehearsal for \\"The Giants\\", though some of the ideas developed here are repeated and extrapolated in the later novel. Yet, \\"War\\" is perhaps the funnier novel- there are broad swathes of the jet-black, Swift-meets-Keaton humor that characterises Michaux' greatest hits (Un Certain Plume, Voyage To Great Garaban). As a poet, of course, Le Clezio is virtually second to none in French letters- many of the images in this book rival Georg Trakl's most haunting work, and I would say that fans of the German poet would find much to enjoy in this one. For lit-geeks around the globe, here is an incomparable collection of prose poems for armageddon."},{"Title":"Michael McClure (Boise State University Western Writers Series)","review":"This highly readable and keen account should appeal to scholar and student alike. If you're already a fan of McClure's, I say read this book, if only to learn why the poet always uses so many CAPITAL LETTERS.For those of you who don't know McClure well, let me tell you briefly about this fine study on him. Michael McClure's artistic career began as one of the poets at the famous Six Gallery reading in 1955 with other Beat poets like Allen Ginsberg and Gary Snyder (Jack Kerouac was in the audience). Since then, over the last 50 years, Michael McClure has gone on to write poetry, plays, and polemics--and he's made music with Janis Joplin and Ray Mazarek of the Doors. A true artist!The author of this study, Rod Phillips, is a university professor, who has written another book on the Beats as proto-environmentalists that I've also read and found very convincing (I teach college as well). In this latest effort, Phillips locates McClure in several literary, philosophical and scientific traditions, including, to use McClure's own term, \\"mammalian\\" tradition. Moreover, Phillips does an excellent job creating a sense of the effect upheavals like the Vietnam War had on McClure's work and what he in turn did to influence the art and politics of the day."},{"Title":"War as I Knew It","review":"I consider these book just excelent, the third part of the book regarding tactics and strategy it is an example of how to run not only an army but also a business, in these days of global competition and crisis being a good strategist and a good leader is the key to success, i recomend these book to executive managers and business students."},{"Title":"War as I Knew It","review":"My career Army son requested this. He is a history buff and found this to be just what he wanted."},{"Title":"War as I Knew It","review":"While I have not finished the whole of the books yet, I having gone through 1/2 of it that anyone with an interest in history will find it interesting and see why so many people considered Patton a great military leader. I know within the book even when things were happening he had the ability to predict effective courses of action though his brash nature would conflict with his higher up cause some delays in his desire for forward action and then there is some overview of his active combativeness toward Gen Montgomery."},{"Title":"War as I Knew It","review":"I have only read part of the book at this time. I find the book very interesting as well as a historical view of WW II from a very famous General who became famous fighting that war."},{"Title":"War as I Knew It","review":"Though steeped in vernacular, troop movements, and military protocol, Patton's own words provide business executives glimpses of the general's personal process for leadership, strategy, innovation and execution. Overall, this is not a typical or easy book for business leaders to read, but for the small subset who are military buffs, or those who can read through the military clutter, there are some gems for the business executive who fashions himself a timeless leader.Patton advised his commanders, \\"do not take counsel of your fears.\\" It would be easy to think this as bravado given his \\"blood and guts\\" reputation, but upon reading the General's own words, the reader comes to learn that Patton advised his commanders from his humility and insecurity. When he found himself doubting his own (renowned) boldness, he was able to remind himself of these words, and motivate action. We learn from this that Patton's greatness wasn't purely natural or instinctual, but acquired by exercising his great mental discipline, and reasoned through his ruthlessly objective thought process. \`Do not take counsel of your fears,' means that boldness can be learned.Patton commenting on an unorthodox attack in which he left his flank exposed, \\"if I worried about my flank, I would not have been able to fight a single battle (in France),\\" teaching us that leaders do not have the luxury both to follow the orthodoxy of their schools and to win. Often, the great successes come when leaders ignore the risk-reward calculation (or the return on investment calculation), and do what they 'know' is right, despite the what the books would say to do.Today, Fortune 500 corporations are sitting on unprecedented levels of cash, (by some counts, over $2 trillion), and enjoying unprecedented profit margins, but have never been more conservative in their investments. Have our CEOs \\"taken counsel of their fears?\\" Are they making their decisions more like Montgomery or more like Patton. If General Patton was a CEO today, I'd bet he be putting to work his cash, and investing either in his supply chain, distribution channels, or in new products. He would not be \\"keeping his powder dry,\\" until the economy stabilizes, as I have heard one CEO announce. Patton would attack.Regarding strategic planning, Patton extorts, \\"one does not plan and then try to make circumstances fit those plans. One tries to make plans fit the circumstances. I think the difference between success and failure [in executive management] depends upon the ability , or lack of it, to do just that.\\"Business leaders have much they could learn from this peek into General Patton's decision making process."},{"Title":"War as I Knew It","review":"A great first person account of the second World War. Does make you rethink and re-watch the film Patton. Also gives you a better understand of the tank command."},{"Title":"War as I Knew It","review":"I am a huge follow of General Patton and \\"War as I Knew It\\" was one of the first real history books I read back in 1972. It is a timeless classic. While many books have been written about Patton, some \\"Pro\\" and some \\"Con\\". this is his book. It is basic and striaght forward and am sure somewhat self self serving. But none the less an excellent book written by the best we had in WW2.I can find many words to say how this book has a huge impact on me 30 years ago I believe the read should find out what I did. Perfect!"},{"Title":"War as I Knew It","review":"My father served with Patton for a time, so I am drawn to books about him. Dad rarely spoke of the war, and specifically said little about Patton. All of these years later I really wonder what he thought of him, so I keep buying these books and try to guess.If you have read biographies of Patton you will find this book particularly interesting. Patton was unique in good ways and in bad. Since this book was published after his death from his diaries, it gives a good glimpse of how he saw himself. It's particularly interesting when placed in the context of how the historians see him. The book says nothing of the slapping incidents that got him in such trouble in Sicily, and little about other disciple issues, but gives terrific insight into his vision of conducting successful warfare. This book is a must for those interested in World War II."},{"Title":"War as I Knew It","review":"As on my review of Omar Bradley's \\"War as I knew it\\", a must have for anyone reserching US Army in WWII."},{"Title":"War as I Knew It","review":"George Patton knew how to write, that's for sure. Action packed! This book is great. Thanks Amazon for quick processing."},{"Title":"War as I Knew It","review":"&quot;War As I Knew It&quot; is not an autobiography. It is not a study of World War II. And it is not a doctoral dissertation. It is simply one of the greatest, most insightful accounts of the campaign in NW Europe, beautifully written by one of history's most charismatic and successful generals.The book begins with a collection of open letters written by Patton during the time of his campaigns in North Africa and Sicily. For cesnorship reasons, these letters do not contain much battle information, but they provide a unique insight into the man Patton was, and how he dealt with problems that were not military in nature. He discusses his meeting with French and Arab leaders in attempts to protect his rear while he defeated the Germans to his front. The letters from Sicily are similar, discussing not so much tactics but outcomes, reactions, and the like. These early letters show how much Patton was moved around, and the interesting places that he visited.The main part of the book covers Patton's proudest moments--commanding the U.S. Third Army. This section is wholly unique. Written shortly after they campaign ended with Germany's surrender, Patton describes the actions of Third Army from Normandy to Czechoslovakia. While he does not go into great detail about tactics and such, he provides a window into his own mind. The reader knows what he was thinking when he made his decisions, and the reasons that he made those decisions. In so doing, the reader gets a firm understanding of how an army worked in WW II. Also, he mentions his personal relationships with many different generals...ones you don't read about in history books. In short, this is a first hand account from the man who was a pure warrior.The concluding section is Patton's gift to future leaders. He was a student of warfare, and his own contributions to the art are invaluable. He discusses everything from the conduct of general officers, to what the best tactics for attack are, to how to deal with trenchfoot! In conclusion, anyone who enjoys military history, or just plain good writing, should read this fascinating book written by a man born for war."},{"Title":"War as I Knew It","review":"The book is composed of excerpts from the diaries of General Patton. It isn't the complete diaries but is fun and interesting. It's good to read something, in his own words, of how the general actually thought. It seems that General Patton had intended to write a book called \\"War as I Knew It\\". He didn't live long enough after the war to get it done. He does expound some about his philosophies and why he put on his war face to give the impression of being hard boiled, when in many ways he was very sentimental. He did not want to get soldiers killed needlessly. He made the \\"tough guy\\" act in order to inspire his men and psych them up for the job they had to do. His rough, hard, &amp; extremely thorough training made his troops among the best-trained and combat ready troops in the army. The hard training was to condition and train the men to know what to expect and how to react so they would not get killed for lack of condition or not knowing what to do. General Patton's biggest problem, not controlling what he said in public, is not treated very much in this book. His war principals are outlined at the end of the book. It's a rather short read and quite entertaining."},{"Title":"War as I Knew It","review":"A great book even after all those years. The reader gets a pretty good impression of Patton's personality an his way of thinking. The first part of the book covers his experiences in Northern Africa and Sicily from 1942 on. Besides the military aspects he describes how he learned to know the local cultures and we are reminded how well educated he was in some other sciences than war. The second and biggest part deals with the operations conducted by his Third Army from France to Germany, Czechoslovakia and Austria. Very informative are his views of Eisenhower, Bradley and Montgomery as well as the German side especially concerning the Battle of the Bulge. The third part is a personal view of tactics, the military generally and his career. All in all a great book for people interested in military history as well as leadership. A little drawback, as in many books covering military history, is the lack of good maps, the few maps in the book only give a very general impression of the campaigns."},{"Title":"War as I Knew It","review":"Patton's \\"War as I Knew It\\" is a good but not great collection of some of General George S. Patton's diaries from World War II. At times, it is an illuminating and interesting look at Patton and his views, but probably because it was edited by his wife and others after Patton's death, many interesting parts of Patton's life are glossed over or ignored. Anyone interested in Patton's war career or World War II would find this book interesting, and any current US Army officers should read this book for many of Patton's leadership lessons.The book briefly describes parts of the North Africa and Sicily campaigns, and I found it very interesting to read about Patton's meetings with the Sultan of Morocco. Most of the rest of the North African campaign was skipped, and after a few pages about the Sicily campaign, Patton is suddenly in northern Europe as the Third Army commander. Most of his writings about the European campaign give daily updates on the condition and position of his subordinate divisions. Fortunately, the book is replete with maps of most of the Third Army's areas of operations - something too many military history books forget.For anyone hoping to find Patton's insights and feelings about the controversial incidents during his command, you won't find them in this book. Most events are completely skipped over: the soldier slapping incidents are mentioned in two paragraphs on page 381 of 390 pages of text; there is no mention of Patton's difficult months after being passed over to lead the American D-Day effort and while serving as the \\"diversion\\" for a second invasion; there is no mention of Patton's comments and insults about the Soviet Russians as allies; and there is nothing about Patton and his tepid de-Nazification of his sector in Germany. Also, when criticizing many of his subordinate commanders and discussing the relief of some commanders, this book omits the names of those being criticized and only refers to them by position; and the reader has to wonder if these criticisms were whitewashed by the editors after Patton's death.Despite these shortcomings, this book still gives many insights into Patton's persona not found in most other works. Too often, Patton is portrayed as a one-dimensional commander whose success relied on the discipline of his soldiers and his obsessiveness with the attack. Anyone reading this book will quickly discover that Patton's brilliance as a commander was based on a well-developed command philosophy. Patton understood that his role as an Army commander was to support his corps commanders and give them the moral support necessary when they grew weary. Patton's flamboyant personality was part of this philosophy as well: for instance, he would always drive to the frontlines when visiting the frontlines but fly back to his headquarters, because he wanted his soldiers to always see him going forward and never see him leaving the front.This book should be read by all current Army officers, because many of Patton's lessons are timeless. He had a thorough understanding of the functions of his staff, and insisted that representatives from each staff section visit frontline units daily. The book ends two many chapters on his personal views of the Army: a chapter called \\"Earning My Pay,\\" recounting various anecdotes throughout his Army career and the lessons he learned; and \\"Reflections and Suggestions,\\" with tactical advice for soldiers and commanders.This book is mostly a detailed recounting of Patton's World War II European campaign. For the casual reader wanting to learn more about the real Patton, I recommend looking elsewhere. But WWII buffs and real George S. Patton fans will get a lot of insight from this book, and all current U.S. Army officers should read it for the timeless lessons that Patton teaches."},{"Title":"War as I Knew It","review":"General George S. Patton, Jr.'s diaries and letters were assembled into this book in 1947, two years after his death. His widow Beatrice Ayer Patton served as a capable editor. This edition has some new material and was reprinted in 1995 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of V-E day.Unfortunately with Patton's premature and unusual death in December 1945, (calm yourselves, conspiracy theorists) the post-war world lost its opportunity for the war's greatest memoir and its most unpredictable political leader. War As I Knew It is the next best thing, a full account of the leadership and strategic thinking of our greatest warrior.Readers will travel with Patton from his arrival in North Africa in 1943, through the campaigns in Sicily, Western France, Belgium, the Bulge, and ending in May 1945 in Austria. Lesser known events are related such as the initial fighting with the French in Africa. In many cases, Patton revisits towns and territory that he had first seen as a young officer in the First World War.Surprisingly, the book is also full of humorous stories such as unusual encounters with African tribal leaders, British generals, and French politicians. Cameo appearances include Marlene Dietrich, General T. Roosevelt (son of the President, who participated in the Normandy Invasion), and historical figures like William the Conquerer who influenced Patton's tactics.Patton greatly plays down the events that led to his downfall, only briefly mentioning the slapping incidents, although he does make a very forceful argument that malingerers are a great threat to morale and need to be punished with extreme measures. The press conferences in London and Boston that led to his dismissal from the Third Army are basically outside the scope of this book, as they occurred after V-E Day and receive only a footnote.On another level the book is chocked full of real insights into leadership that are probably more relevant today than in the 1940's. Patton is a clear proponent of focused planning, communication, speedy execution and offensive action.Here are some examples:It is vital to good morale that decorations get out promptly and on an equitable basis.Staff officers of inharmonious disposition, irrespective of their ability, must be removed.Time (speed) is more valuable than co-ordination.In war,the only sure defense is offense, and the efficiency of offense depends on the warlike souls of those conducting it. Successful generals make plans to fit circumstance, but do not try to create cirmcumstances to fit plans.Whenever a man gets a medal, he usually attempts to outdo himself and gets killed, whereas in order to produce a virial race, such men should be kept alive.I believe in fighting until lack of supplies forces you to stop, and then dig in."},{"Title":"War as I Knew It","review":"Having read Patton - a genius for war, I bought this book with great expectations. I believe the description of the war in Europe to be both accurate and enlightening. I find it hard to believe that in War as I knew it, there was very little on both Africa and Sicely. The fact that there was no refence to the death of Dick Jenson and the profound sadness Patton felt, surprised me. I also felt that there being no reference to his relief of Lloyd Freedendall, an officer Patton obviously disliked left the book short. However, as an admirer of Patton, I enjoyed the book overall. I recommend the book, but take it as it comes and don't expect what may not be there. Regards Tom Rawlings, Victoria, Australia."},{"Title":"War as I Knew It","review":"Patton's &quot;War as I knew it&quot; captures war and the experiences of it in raw and true form. Dedicated to his craft, Gen. Patton, thru his comentaries and diary entries, walks the reader thru day by day (in some cases minute by minute) accounts of a senior officer. From the &quot;Babtized by fire&quot; landings in 1942 North Africa, to personal reflections and &quot;not so politically correct&quot; comments and observations made after the war.Right or wrong, Gen. Patton spoke his mind...eloquently, profanely and retrospectively. He is quick to criticize yet equally quick to praise. This book is a welcome addition to any military historian's library."},{"Title":"War as I Knew It","review":"This book gives the reader an excellent insight into the mind of one of the most colorful and reknowned military leaders in history. The book is his war diary, so it is filled with dates and facts about the war, but is also meshed with the thoughts of General Patton on the course of the war. As a fan of Patton's, I found the book to be incredibly enlightening, especially the end sections on his views of the principles of military operations.I do have to say that if a reader is not a big fan of Patton, they may find this book to be a rather boring read. Part of the allure of this book is Patton's interpretation of events, so if you aren't into his views...well, there is no shortage of his opinions within!"},{"Title":"War as I Knew It","review":"Army Commander that he was, Patton, at critical times would send a letter to be read to his soldiers, commending them on their battle performance. On August 22, 1943, in Sicily, following the successful completion of Operation Husky there, he ended his letter to the Seventh Army, with which he had raced to Messina, with this sentence: \\"Your fame shall never die.\\" Fitting words to say to men who would see much death and destruction in the many days ahead. So, I've tampered with his statement somewhat, but I think it's fitting to apply it to him and his soldiers, given what they accomplished during WWII, and, to this day, the statement is true. His letters and methods are also a testimony to how well he cared for the men under him. The book does follow the movie quite a bit, though it is not credited as such; the diary begins in North Africa with the date of October 29, 1942. Patton encouraged all of his men to keep diaries, which this one is of the 3 U.S. operations he commanded: Operations Torch, Husky, and Overlord. At times, I would admit that his diary was not terribly interesting when he would speak of the different divisions etc. that were being shuttled here and there. I don't think he was writing to publish a New York Times best seller, just to document what actually transpired; also, I would think that should be a standard, wise habit to utilize in the midst of a major war. Most of the time, I found myself admiring Patton for his abilities to command and inspire. He took good care of his men, and I think there is ample evidence to support that.When they were on their way to Luxembourg and Germany, he asked his chaplain to write the \\"weather prayer\\", also in the movie, because of incessant rains and flooding which were slowing them down, causing a high incidence of trench foot and hampering efforts to provide air cover. I stumbled on an article that that chaplain, Msgr. James H. O'Neill published on October 6, 1971 in the Review of the News about him and how he dealt with this predicament. From what Mr. O'Neill wrote, the footnotes and other commentaries of Colonel Paul D. Harkin's in War as I Knew It, were a little off in explaining the significance of this prayer. He writes, \\"Many conflicting and some untrue stories have been printed about General George S. Patton and the Third Army Prayer. Some have had the tinge of blasphemy and disrespect for the Deity.\\" The weather prayer was printed as a Christmas card greeting and given to every single soldier, 250,000 men, underneath his command. An additional \\"Training Letter\\" went out to every chaplain, every officer under his command, a total of 3200 because Patton believed in the power of prayer. He told Mr. O'Neill, \\"Up to now, in the Third Army, God has been very good to us. We have never retreated; we have suffered no defeats, no famine, no epidemics. This is because a lot of people back home are praying for us. We were lucky in Africa, in Sicily, and in Italy. Simply because people prayed. But we have to pray for ourselves, too. A good soldier is not made merely by making him think and work. There is something in every soldier that goes deeper than thinking or working--it's his \\"guts.\\" It is something that he has built in there: it is a world of truth and power that is higher than himself. Great living is not all output of thought and work. A man has to have intake as well. I don't know what you call it, but I call it Religion, Prayer, or God. But the time is now to intensify our faith in prayer, not alone with ourselves, but with every believing man, Protestant, Catholic, Jew, or Christian in the ranks of the Third United States Army. \\"Those who pray do more for the world than those who fight; and if the world goes from bad to worse, it is because there are more battles than prayers. 'Hands lifted up,' said Bosuet, 'smash more battalions than hands that strike.' \\" His chaplain reveals in his article how the prayers were answered: \\"On the 19th of December, the Third Army turned from East to North to meet the attack. As General Patton rushed his divisions north from the Saar Valley to the relief of the beleaguered Bastogne, the prayer was answered. On December 20, to the consternation of the Germans and the delight of the American forecasters who were equally surprised at the turn-about-the rains and the fogs ceased. For the better part of a week came bright clear skies and perfect flying weather. General Patton prayed for fair weather for Battle. He got it...It was late in January of 1945 when I saw the Army Commander again. This was in the city of Luxembourg. He stood directly in front of me, smiled: \\"Well, Padre, our prayers worked. I knew they would.\\" Then he cracked me on the side of my steel helmet with his riding crop. That was his way of saying, \\"Well done.\\"\\" Patton had socks sent to all the soldiers of the (now) Third army to deal with the trenchfoot problem. He loved his men and his men loved him.From his diary, it seems that a large part of their success was how well the commanding generals worked so well together and were of the same mind. Patton felt that delays of any sort in the midst of battle were sure roads to defeat and death to be avoided at all costs. After every campaign in his diary, he shows the tallies of losses to the allies vs. the enemy. What he doesn't show, and what cannot be calculated, is the numbers of lives that were saved, soldiers and civilians, because of his swift methods. Many times he ponders, however, that if some orders had not been questioned, not only would more U.S. soldiers' lives have been lost, but we might have lost the war. Hmm.General G. S. Patton, Jr., I give you FIVE STARS, FIVE STARS!!!"},{"Title":"War as I Knew It","review":"General Patton was one of the more interesting figures history has produced. As a military history expert, I always prefer to read memoirs by the 'actors' themselves. Read this one. Rent Patton. Read Ladislas Farago's book (on which the movie was based). Then read this book. When you're done, tell me (whether you like the man or not) that you aren't at least impressed with the man's skill as well as knowledge of the enemy (specifically, the Soviet Union near the end of the war).You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"War as I Knew It","review":"Written like a private diary not intended for publication, Patton rambles through every week, month and engagement in which he superintended with personal anecdotes, historical quips, troop and corps movements, successes and failures, complaints about the high command, commendations for his staff, and nostalgic perspectives about Europe from his days in WWI. As a whole, this work is disjointed and picaresque. There are a great number of Pattonisms here though which pique the reader for the more notorious and famous episodes in the general's bright career. Since this is his only work, it belongs on the shelves of WWII enthusiasts, but as a classical reference on the war, it suffers greatly."},{"Title":"War as I Knew It","review":"So interesting to get inside Patton's mind. A no holds bared man. Was he killed? Who knows."},{"Title":"War as I Knew It","review":"This is an excellent book taken from General Patton's diary, It is a must read for anyone interested in how he had to overcome not only the enemy but worse, his own superiors who had to keep everyone happy at the expense of American lives. Even General Eisenhower admitted that he had no choice other than to keep the brass in Washinton happy as well as the British. Had General Patton been allowed to continue without being stopped at several critical points during the war, not only would that have saved many American lives as well as others including the Germans, but many of us who served under Patton feel that the war would have ended much sooner, that the conflict over Berlin would never have occurred as we would have gotten there first and that his concern that many countries were turned over to the Russians and ended up totally unliberated while we did nothing might have been altered."},{"Title":"War as I Knew It","review":"You can actually envision the war as you read it. Described to the T. Makes you feel you are there."},{"Title":"War as I Knew It","review":"Unfortunately, Patton doesn't describe the battle planning to the degree I had hoped.

Recommended."},{"Title":"War as I Knew It","review":"Well documented in the second world war, I knew before the readsing of this book that Patton was a general devoted to the armored weapon, advocating the offensive. This was far too short.George S. Patton wrote the newspaper's fighting from October 29, 1942 to December 5, 1945, just a few days before his accidental death in Germany. This newspaper is an important document for the understanding of history.What a great general! Soon the reader realizes that the author is a great man, not only because he is a military emergency, but because he is cultivated, sensitive and an outstanding leader of men.the state of ignorance by the United States of France, especially of Morocco, led Patton to amend two articles of capitulation which had been delivered by Roosevelt (a hard version, a softer version). Patton understood immediately that Morocco unlike Algeria, was a French protectorate and not French a department. It was then necessary to maintain the prestige of the French army to prevent the explosion of the country and consequently the mobilization of tens of thousands of American soldiers that Patton had not.Patton was a brilliant strategist. Francophile, speaking in French, he became friendly with General Giraud and much appreciated the high distinction of Catroux, representative of the free French (General De Gaulle). Patton had commanded a regiment in France during World War I, he loved France.Patton participated in the liberation of North Africa (including Tunisia), Sicily and landed in Normandy in August 1944. He quickly shoved the enemy, stalking into the reduced Brittany. Proving once again that he understood the importance of the symbol, as the head of the III rd Army, authorized General Leclerc (Scnd DB), then under his command, to liberate Paris. Advocating the offensive, thoughtful, quick, decisive, he bitterly regretted that the High Command emphasize support to the British General Montgomery (whom he held in low esteem, as the English troops this general commanded). Patton indeed thought to end the war before winter 1944 to 1945. Repeating its lightning success campaigns for his thesis.The hunting scene of the American III rd Army is exceptional:While he regrets the loss of 21,441 soldiers killed in front, the enemy lost 144,500, 386,000 injured (cons 99,224) and 1,486,700 prisoners!The victory over the material is also evident. 308 light tanks lost cons 1529 destroyed, 949 medium tanks against 858 Panther and Tiger, 175 guns cons 3454.Patton was a great general. The front cover of this book shows him with his pistol butt to ivory legacy of a past that he knew, that the end of western, particularly in the Mexican War where he was involved with the Army.Two important quotes:\\"In war, the only sure defense is offensive, and efficiency of the offense depends on the warlike souls of Those conducting it.\\"\\"Do not take counsel of your fears.\\"This man is a warlord, a noble legacy no doubt of his southerner's education. Obvious symbol of American pride, he is also naturally much appreciated by French citizens for his decisive action in the liberation of France.Thank you \\"Blood 'n guts\\"!"},{"Title":"War as I Knew It","review":"The timing of the delivery was speedy, but it came on a day when it was raining and it wasn't packaged properly.

I ordered two other books at the same time and they came packaged in a plastic shipping bag which I appreciated."},{"Title":"War as I Knew It","review":"Whereas we've all heard the weak-kneed, faint-hearted, army deserter types condemn Patton as bloodthirsty, this book reveals Patton the intellectual, the man who believes deeply in his mission and destiny, and one who is prepared to sacrifice life and limb in order to to honor his role in the history of the world.I found this book to be highly insightful, educational, entertaining, and motivating. I learned about strategy and received an interesting and unique glimpse into the mind of a truly great man. Patton was the cream of the crop - well educated, strong, courageous, and determined, and he had the intelligence and wisdom to back his decisions up. Would that we had a fearless leader like this today."},{"Title":"War as I Knew It","review":"Patton' memoir of his role in WWII.

Patton, Jr. died December 21, 1945 in Heidelberg Germany of injuries sustained in an automobile accident on December 9th of that year, a day before his scheduled return to America. His writings included a \\"full diary from June, 1942, until Dec. 5, 1945\\" and the manuscript of the book \\"War As I Knew It\\". The book was first published in 1947. \\"The text [of the published book] ... is ... precisely as it came from the General's swift pen with the single elimination of a criticism of one officer who, if he erred, most splendidly atoned.\\" (xiv: Introduction by Douglas Southall Freeman)The text lacks any detail of actual battles, other than broad movements at the level of Corps and Division. It is very much a rough overview, as the title suggests, of Patton's experience as a General in WWII. Its value derives from Patton having written it, more than for what is written within it. It is not the great book (we may imagine) he would have written later had he lived."},{"Title":"War as I Knew It","review":"A wonderful resource to see how the great general viewed the wars in which he took part. A great study in his personality and his ambition that will be enjoyed by all who admired the man."},{"Title":"War as I Knew It","review":"Gen. George Patton may have been the most successful battlefield commander of World War II. And he had a reputation for honesty and fiercely-expressed opinions. So I was disappointed by this relatively slim volume of reminiscences about his experiences in Africa, Sicily, Italy, and western Europe during that conflict. The introduction written by Douglas Southall Freeman, the great biographer of Robert E. Lee, tells us that Patton \\"kept a full diary from July, 1942, until Dec. 5, 1945,\\" four days before his fatal accident,\\" and Southall asserts that the diary entries are \\"always candid, frequently critical, and occasionally caustic.\\" I regret to report that I did not find that to be the case. The notoriously fiery Patton temper is rarely on display here, which prompts me to suspect that the diary entries were heavily sanitized for publication. (Patton's widow was the original editor this book, which raises my level of suspicion.) It is possible, however, that Patton, himself, exercised extreme discretion in deciding what to commit to writing. In either case, the result generally makes for dull reading.Some of what Patton has to say is intriguing. Patton frequently compares the casualties of the Third U.S. Army, which he commanded in France, and those of the enemy, and German casualties are consistently much higher. Patton's nickname was Old Blood and Guts,\\" but there is, in fact, reason to believe that he was more economical with his men's lives than the conventional wisdom occasionally suggests. Patton's competition with the British commander Field Marshal Montgomery is frequently on display. In August 1944, Patton reports that Montgomery wanted all American forces to stop their advance across France so Montgomery's could make a \\"dagger thrust with the Twenty-First Army Group at the heart of Germany.\\" Patton's colleague Gen. Omar Bradley was skeptical, stating that it would be \\"more like a \`butter-knife thrust.\\" In November 1944, Patton was visited in the field by Averell Harriman, the United States' Ambassador to the Soviet Union, who told Patton Josef Stalin had said: \\"The Red Army could not have conceived and certainly could not have executed the advance made by the Third Army across France.\\" A lengthy footnote reports that, in December 1944, Patton ordered his chaplain to prepare a \\"prayer for good weather\\" because the general was \\"tired of these soldiers having to fight mud and floods as well as Germans.\\" When the chaplain attempted to demur by saying, \\"Sir, it's going to take a pretty thick rug for that kind of praying,\\" Patton replied: \\"I don't care if it takes the flying carpet, I want the praying done.\\" According to Patton, when he saw Gen. Dwight Eisenhower, the Allies Supreme Commander, shortly after the Battle of the Bulge, Eisenhower never mentioned the efforts of the Third Army, and Patton clearly was hurt. (In March 1945, Patton clearly was pleased when Eisenhower attended a Third Army briefing and was \\"most complimentary.\\") And Patton shows no remorse for the notorious incident when he slapped a soldier in a hospital who clearly was suffering from a psychiatric disorder.But the chapter on the Battle of the Bulge is more typical. It contains some useful detail about one of Patton's most successful operations, but it is almost complete devoid of color and personality. For instance, one passage states: \\"On [Dec. 31, 1944], the Germans made seventeen counter-attacks against us, all of which were repulsed.\\" Is that all Patton had to say? A couple of pages later, he adds: \\"At midnight on the night of December 31, all guns in the Third Army fired rapid fire for twenty minutes on the Germans as a New Year's greeting. When the firing ceased, our forward observers stated that they could hear the Germans screaming in the woods.\\" Now that's interesting!Patton's account of his campaigns during World War II is an important document. I only regret that more of Patton's personality did not come through here. One other interesting historical note: The footnotes, which are very helpful, were prepared by Col. Paul D. Harkins, who served as Patton's Deputy Chief of Staff. After his promotion to general, Harkins commanded the United States's forces in Vietnam in the early 1960s. Harkins clearly was a better staff officer than a commander."},{"Title":"War as I Knew It","review":"I was quite disappointed with this book. Given its title, I was not prepared to spend endless pages reading about his non-military activities. Often it was basically travelogue and who was present at formal luncheons. Much of the coverage of the various campaigns was more listing of the order of battle with little description of the tactics, strategy and events of the battles. The last 85 pages, however, made my purchase seem more worthwhile but I would recommend checking it out at a library."},{"Title":"War as I Knew It","review":"Years after winning or loosing wars, or anything ever experienced, memories of men often fade and perceptions may change. George Patton was one of the greatest Generals in American history. Victories are the ultimate measuring standard of Commanders in any war. During the course of World War II General George Patton commanded two American armies, The Third Army, of the European theatre, the Seventh Army, during the Sicily campaign. Patton also commanded the Western Task force landing in French North Africa, Morocco, and the First Armored Corps in Tunisia. Patton's brilliant victories of the Third and Seventh Armies often overshadow perhaps his greatest achievement in that of restoring the shattered American morale after the devastating defeat at the battle of Kasserine pass in Tunisia. Often overlooked, amazingly, Patton restored morale and faith in First Armored Corps leading to the American victory at the Battle of El Guettar only eleven days after assuming command.The greatest strength of \\"War as I knew it\\" the diary of George Patton are the words of the man himself not the opinions or writings of others regardless of how gifted or knowledgeable. Evidently for political reasons at the bequest of General Dwight Eisenhower many of Patton's opinions were edited before the publication."},{"Title":"War as I Knew It","review":"Patton is easily one the best commanders in American history, War as I Knew It he goes over him many military accomplishments.

Patton, Jr., presents his World War 2 autobiography with \\"War As I Knew It\\". First published in 1947, this remarkable 425-page book has often been republished (including this review's 1995 paperback).This extraordinary study recalls the Allies' efforts from its Morocco landing (1942) to victory in Germany (1945) from the Major General's eyewitness 3rd American Army command. General Patton's gives considerable advice through many memorable epigrams:* \\"If I do my full duty, the rest will take care of itself.\\"* \\"...the fatalistic teaching of Mohammed and the utter degradation of women is the out standing cause for the arrested development of the Arab.\\"* \\"One look is worth a hundred reports.\\"* \\"...throughout history, wars had been lost by not crossing rivers...\\"* \\"It is useless to capture an easy place that you can't move from.\\"* \\"...one does not plan and then try to make circumstances fit those plans.

He was determined for Allied victory by mean of his command. He fought battles, argued strategy with fellow generals, toured corpse ridden shell falling battlefields, and pressed his army to victory. He disliked British General Montgomery, had immense respect for Eisenhower, and had profound sympathy for all fallen Allied soldiers. This book presents war-winning strategy.This book is recommended for all students World War 2 and those interested in the life of General Patton."},{"Title":"War as I Knew It","review":"This has to be one of those always-at-hand reference books that modern day military leaders pick up and consult. Not so much for the academic and technical resource because it of course, is a bit dated in that regard, but simply to understand and hopefully learn what leadership in it's ultimate pure form really is. Patton had it. It goes without saying that World War II would have been finished much different if it was not for his style and drive. Certainly the most quotable allied general of the war. Todays business leaders and managers (myself included) read books like \\"War as I knew it\\" and come away with a renewed confidence in the human potential. Patton pulled every ounce of self worth out of his men to achieve the final victory. It was his standing order. This book discusses in detail how he did that and why. All explained very clearly. His style was unorthodox, his demeanor sometimes in question, his spirituality vivid and some battlefield decisions nearly cost him his career. \\"War as I knew it\\" will read at times like a dull teacher giving a lecture. Stick with it and breath it in. This is full-on George Patton. It all still works in the 21st century."},{"Title":"War as I Knew It","review":"Well their arent enough words to describe the real genius of this man. Army & War are not childs play, and having served in the Military myself have the untmost respect for Gen Patton.Here is this book which starts with many a letters that he had written over the course of his Army life, most of the sentences in those letters are famous quotes now.Well, this is not a Military History book at all which to non readers of that subject would be a little boring. But this book is the journey of the man and his victories in the World Wars.This book is very Interesting, is full of Quotable quotes such as \\" The Object of war is not to die for your country, but to make the other Bastard die for his\\".It is easy to understand and basically a must read for anyone with a remote interest in the World Wars, Military History or Gen Patton himself.This book is also interesting in the regard that it talks about his associations with the other Generals during that period, namely Gen. Eisenhower, Bradley & Montgomery."},{"Title":"War as I Knew It","review":"This book is as valuable for the light it sheds on Patton's character as it is for the detailed accounts of his various European campaigns. Patton's directness (admittedly the book was a rough draft of what would have been published had he lived) confirms that he was a man committed to discerning and speaking the truth. Generous with friends and reticent with enemies, he appears honorable and entirely credible in his explication of the facts of the War. As for his opinions on the nature of war, they are very clearly encapsulated in the appendix, and are shown to be both learned and hard to refute.A large portion of the book is concerned with the dispositions of the Third Army; these sections would undoubtedly be easier to follow if more and better maps were included in the book."},{"Title":"War as I Knew It","review":"This book is a timeless insight not of only the art of war, but the balancing feat a military commander in the field must cope with in reporters, politicians and non combatant civilians. As one reads this masterpiece of a true genius, it's lessons are as relevant today in Iraq and around the world as they were in 1945.George Patton has proven right in every aspect in his predictions in this book of where the world was headed. He simply was thee best military commander along with MacArthur in World War II. The Germans feared him and the Soviets marvelled at him.The only regret I have in this book is the foreward written by a complete ignorant in Rick Atkinson who wrote that Vietnam was General Patton's fault, because he ushered in too much confidence into the American military. Not wanting to debate here Vietnam, it is though vital to point out it was not General Patton nor the military who were the problem in Vietnam it was the politicians. As General Nelson Miles stated, \\"It is easy to kick a dead lion\\", it was most distasteful to have a newspaper reporter write something about General Patton which was a lie.Patton's work honestly shows how he redefined war and the order of the army from the top down, setting standards of professionalism which the American military still operates at.This book deserves study, deserves credit and it deserves every equal the 5 stars General George S. Patton earned in service to his nation."},{"Title":"War as I Knew It","review":"War As I Knew It is a treasure trove of memorable anecdotes, analysis and opinions on military affairs from the greatest Allied army commander of WWII. There are gems on almost every page, but I offer two here that made the greatest impression on me and which I feel most exemplify the philosophy of Patton first in how to conduct offensive operations and second how to deal with dereliction of duty.Patton's take on offensive operations is no better illustrated than in his discourse with Manton Eddy, XII corps commander, who was concerned about his unprotected right flank. Patton tells him to advance in depth, division following division, and writes that \\"If I had worried about flanks I could have never fought the war,\\" and \\"...our Air Service could locate any groups of enemy large enough to be a serious threat.\\" This sounds more like Heinz Guderian than any American general.In section V of \\"Reflections and Suggestions\\" Patton states that soldiers who fall asleep at their post, shirk in battle or who are absent without excuse for a long time should be executed, and that army and corps commanders should have the authority to order said executions.These are only two of the most memorable passages from War As I Knew It, which is filled with innumerable other episodes and opinions on the conduct of war, as well as many entertaining ethnological observations."},{"Title":"War as I Knew It","review":"The war/anti-war movie Patton some years ago gave us a storehouse of anecdotes and images about this larger-than-life character. Some of the conventional biographies about Patton get lost in the many contradictions between his various public and private personae. War as I Knew It, though falling in the time-hallowed military genre of &quot;leaving one's own record&quot;, presents a fascinating set of contradictions as poignant as any cinematic fantasy about Patton. The work is quite short, andtells a more or less chronological set of anecdotes about the Italian and German campaigns, coupled with a set of observations on war generally. The anecdotes are organized in almost despatch or diary-derived smatterings, while the general observations of war are modeled on classical war instructive material from past times. One is consistently surprised at how many &quot;colorful myths&quot; about Patton prove to have a basis in reality. One is also consistently aware of how Patton's world view, biases and prejudices marked him as very much a man of his own era, rather than the noble warrior from the distant past he imagined himself to be. The work contains a large amount of self-congratulation, but it can also tell very heroic stories in fairly low key. The liberation of Bastogne, during the Battle of the Bulge, is told in a fairly understated fashion. Although in the text Patton owns up to only two flaws in his military campaigns, one significant, one very minor, one still has the idea that deep down he understood not only the advantages but also the drawbacks of the &quot;always attacking&quot; role in which he cast himself. The racist remarks contained in portions of the book were reasonably tame in their time, but resonate very poorly today; Patton himself seems aware of the controversy, as he sometimes takes pains to couch his remarks with conciliatory statements about the bravery of those he denigrates. The reader is not bogged down with military jargon in this book, but gets a real feel for Patton's gift of rapid mobilization of armored divisions. Patton's sense of history and culture, though sometimes emphasized with a curious false modesty, are nonetheless quite notable.I came to this book feeling that Patton was a complex character, not easily understood. Having read the work, I find him no less complex, no less disturbing, but even more mythical than the movie had led me to believe. One does not leave this book liking the man better than before reading it, or really understanding the man, but the book is nonetheless an absorbing read about a curious character indeed."},{"Title":"War as I Knew It","review":"This book is an excellent account of General Patton's battles in WWII. In his own words he describes some moments of the campaigns in the European Thater of Operations including North Africa. But this book is not only account of the battles, but it also contains events telling us stories about Patton's personal experineces and showing us that a war is not just battles, but also many other things."},{"Title":"War as I Knew It","review":"It is interesting to read how a historical figure thought and felt about the events in which they participated. Here you get to see what Patton thought not what others think he thought."},{"Title":"War as I Knew It","review":"I wanted a feel for the real George Patton and found the character played by George C. Scott in the 1970 film \`Patton.' In other words, Patton, both in the book and movie, really loved war, was unselfconsciously himself, personable, humorous, vainglorious, undiplomatic, tireless, and (along with MacArthur in the Pacific) one of the best soldiers this country has ever produced.Patton gave stats of the Third Army's activities in terms of troop numbers and movements, killed and injured, equipment lost, and enemy equivalent information. The accounts in both the Mediterranean and European theaters were rather dry, but you do get a sense of the man, his drive - which is what I wanted. He was relentless in stressing speed and offensive action, and was fiercely competitive with the more defensive General Montgomery, which again reflected the movie character.Early in the book, his accounts of the ceremonial events in Arabia were often very funny as he dealt, as best he could, with the cultural differences. He had a way of explaining these events that made you almost laugh out loud. No disrespect. I hope, to the people of that region, but Patton was simply being himself.The scene in the movie where he ordered the chaplain to pray for good weather for an upcoming battle actually happened. The chaplain was a little conflicted about it since it would affect casualty and death figures, but complied anyway. Patton actually gave him a medal later since the \`result' of the prayer was a needed good day for the upcoming battle. I don't think that scene made the movie.All in all, he came to life as the George C. Scott character for me and worth the read."},{"Title":"War as I Knew It","review":"He was one of the top Army Generals ever, almost as good as my hero, MacArthur. Patton had a fiery personality to fit his personna as a legendary warrior. He was adored by many as the brilliant stratagist he turned out to be, but loathed by some for his dictatorial manner. There was a movie made about his life. He might have been pictured as being a harsh taskmaster but, hey! that's what war is. But not in civilian life toward an old woman, McCrum; this is his personal and candid account of his activities during WWII taken from his diaries.This series of books was about 'a world on fire.' Many are eyewitness accounts by the men who fought in a global conflict. These are the brave men and their gallantry, moving sagas of survital and stark tragedies of untimely death.Wasn't it Patton who termed the phrase, \\"War is Hell\\"? On July 28, 1944, General Patton over the Third Army assisted the First Army to drive back the enemy in France. By the end of August, the Germans were on the run. Patton wanted to make a rapid advance to cut off the enemy but SHAEF did not concur. Bradley was very sympathetic. All gasoline supplies and ammunition went to the First Army leaving Patton's Third Army with no gas and they were stuck with no way to proceed. He was heartbroken. His own words: \\"It was my opinion that this was the momentous error of the war.\\"There are many ways to think about war, even that in Viet Nam where Whitt was one of the elite Rangers. To comprehend ourselves, \\"we must know the people we once fought against.\\" Fighting in WWII was the final experience for fifty million soldiers, all heroic men. We must understand our past as an honor to those dead who can no longer choose. They exchanged their lives in a hope for this future that we now inhabit, though hardly peaceful. I know one thing, not a one of thos soldiers would have treated me as harshly without seeing me in person as that dictor McCrum did on the phone. Though the fight took place many years ago, each of us remains as a living part of it. I was just a baby, but I am of the Scots-Irish heritage and we are fighters for good causes, not just in war times."},{"Title":"War as I Knew It","review":".... man did [Patton] know how to fight a war. I would want him leading a column into battle, but not running the war. He just was too direct to be a great leader.This book is insightful and honest. Just like the man. I enjoyed it and was reminded of a few of the poorer boses that I have had. I think it was true that he was born a few centuries too late.The book is a good read about a not so good man-but a great field general."},{"Title":"War as I Knew It","review":"This book was difficult for me to follow. It seemed to be written more like a diary or personal notes and maybe he didn't have time to fill in the blanks. To tell you how confused I was, one moment I thought I was in North Africa and the next he's talking about Italy. I said, \\"when did I get to Italy?\\" On the other hand, you do get a feel for who Patton was and he does give some good advice for tactics and he had some very interresting views of how digging fox holes dropped [spirits]. I didn't notice any mention of him slapping the soldier that he took so much heat over.I'm not going to give up on his writing and will some day try to read another book by him. So with that in mind I would recommend trying something else. Either another book of his or as I have done but not read yet, a book by Omar Bradley, \\"A Soldiers Story.\\""},{"Title":"War as I Knew It","review":"I read this book translated to portuguese, here in Brazil.In this book, you could see the General Patton's histories and informations.The best part of this book is, when Patton tells about war tatics.Patton doesn't talks only about war and weapons.Patton tells about Islam.He loved the Kuran, but he writes that, Islam put moslens under fearful, fatalistic apathy.Patton also writes against black americans at war.Under no doubts, Gal. Patton was a (not fanatic) racist.Some believes in Patton's times were correct then, but now are outdated.To exemple, Patton claims that M-1 Garand rifle is the best rifle for war.After 60 years later, M-1 rifle, is a museum or colection rifle.Patton also doesn't tells us , that M-1 Garand was designed by a canadian, not an american.Patton was an american patriot and a very capable World War II general."},{"Title":"War as I Knew It","review":"flamboyant and irrealistic data of german losses ( see german sources ...KTB/OKW. etc. )"},{"Title":"Plucked From The Fire","review":"This is a fine and inspirational account of a man who relied on God in his time of need.

It will help the reader understand God's grace and love, as well as improve his or her knowledge of the Bible.

The encouragement it gave me in knowing how strong this man's faith was at such a crucial and fearful moment in time.. and how he actively asked Jesus to help him.

William Hennessey, one of the authors, is from this area. When I read about how Stanley Praimnath escaped from the World Trade Center in the newspaper article I thought it would be a fascinating book. My local bookstore didn't have it, so I ordered it directly from the publisher at rosedogbookstore.com. The book came in five days and was well worth the wait, truly awesome.

I feel sorry for all the real victims that lost their lives on the dreadful day."},{"Title":"Naked Heartland the","review":"Finally there comes a book that does justice to Bruce of LA's work. It is merely a start: the photos in this collection deal with Bruce's early efforts at photographing the male nude, miles removed from his signature pieces of oiled-and-pumped bodybuilders in the 1950s and 1960s, and miles away from California. There is a definite charm to these images, a naivete that is preferable in many ways to the later works. Most of them feature ordinary men in humble, prosaic settings that evoke the works of Walker Evans and other itinerant photographers of middle America in the 1940s. The images reveal a charming aspect of that world with their dingy, apple-pie interiors that one only finds nowadays in early TV reruns and on the American Movie Classics channel. The male nudes planted in these settings hint at a subtle truth about men of the time and about American life generally. What's more they pose intriguing questions about the circumstances behind the images. One is tempted to piece together narratives, for in an age before Elvis and Rock in which male bodies were covered most of the time, one can't help but wonder how it was possible for Bruce to capture so many men in such uncompromising and revealing poses? That we're only discovering them now implies several possibilies: that there was an agreement that the photos would remain uncirculated; that Bruce himself considered them early works and therefore not worthy of reproduction; that legal restrictions about male frontal nudity precluded the possibility until the 1960s, at which time they were already dated; or perhaps all of the above. We can only be thankful that we have this book to round out the current image of Bruce as a photographer of slick hardbodies. These photos shock doubly in that they expose both the softer side of Bruce and a more hard-core side of middle-American life in the mid-twentieth century."},{"Title":"Naked Heartland the","review":"I returned to my copy of Naked Heartland after reading the negative review here, perplexed. What I found was the same excellent book I remembered -- not just Bruce's extraordinary early photographs, but also the printing and design, are, as far as I'm concerned, splendid. There are some typos, but this hardly seems a grave (or unusual) problem in a photo book from a foreign publisher. The volume is clearly a labor of love, reclaiming and rescuing a lost world of homoerotic experience and images, as well as a thoroughly professional and serious undertaking. This is a gorgeous book that I can give the highest recommendation."},{"Title":"Naked Heartland the","review":"What A Find. Incredibly crisp, clear photographic reproduction that takes you back to a seemingly more simple time in what appears to be the rugged mid-west. These photographs are far from the more professional, technically lighted, studio column props and heavily oiled beefcake models featured years later that made Bruce Bellas famous. This is truly a must have for any fan of vintage male photography."},{"Title":"Naked Heartland the","review":"This collection of photographs are stunning, I had never heard of the photographer until I chanced on this wonderful collection. That they were taken in the 50's makes the erotica much more subtle but beautiful. I could spend hours staring at these amazing pictures."},{"Title":"Naked Heartland the","review":"Customers who buy Naked Heartland-and the vast majority will be either gay men, photographers, or sociologists-will experience both the pleasure of a formerly hidden slice of American History and the supreme disappointment of a, theoretically at least, \\"coffee-table\\" hardcover book whose quality is the worst I've ever seen. Bruce Bellas' studio work of the 50s and 60s is deservedly famous; it's arguable that the elegance and perfection of his images and prints equals those of any American photographer past or present. That he flourished in the tawdry, hidden world of so-called \\"physique photos\\" does not denigrate his achievement nor diminish the beauty of his work today. This book is from private collections of very early Bruce, before his studio was set up in L.A. The images are stunning, informal, and far more erotic than one would think-people really did have sex before the fig leaves fell in the mid-60s! However, this is a book from a publisher who apparently has never heard of graphic design, art direction, or typography. It is the ugliest book-for $50-that I have ever seen. The English text is filled with unbelievable typos, apparently introduced during production. A competent proofreader could have fixed this up in less than an hour. Worse, about 10% of the photos are filled with vertical stripes-artifacts that indicate either a dime-store scanner and/or complete incompetence in terms of production. The printing-barely adequate, with a single black ink, is subpar. And the type looks like Mac 1984 desktop publishing. It's absolutely awful. So, although I would rate the content 5 stars, I wouldn't even give the book itself-the product-a single star. Bruce of L.A. deserves much better-such as the earlier Bruno Gm&uuml;nder collection-and the greatest tragedy is that this material fell into the hands of people who know nothing about art, or at least book design. (By the way, I was an art director for 30 years before retiring and have designed many books.) This hideous book is probably all we will ever get of this material, and more's the pity."},{"Title":"How Things Are Made: From Automobiles to Zippers","review":"If you enjoy learning about how things are made and how they work, then you will find this book a treasure trove of information. It goes beyond the more elementary &quot;How Things Work&quot; series, because it also covers the history, manufacture, materials, quality control, future evolution, and additional reading for many common household and technical objects. Behind its clever denim jeans pocket-clad cover, the book presents an alphabetical arrangement of items from airbags to zippers, including pencils, salsa, tires, helicopters, compact discs, lightbulbs, and many more.Besides the basic information mentioned above, there are sidebars and boxes containing additional fascinating facts about the products. Here are some examples:- The YKK symbol you see on most zippers stands for Yoshida Kogyo Kabushikikaisha, the manufacturer of most zippers since 1939.- The &quot;pearl&quot; in pearlized nail polish is actually produced from small pieces of fish scales and skin.- A guitar craftsman is known as a &quot;luthier.&quot;- The largest consumer of rubber bands in the world is the U.S. Post Office.Not only is this a valuable reference for specific items you want to learn about, but you will enjoy opening it at random for the pleasure of discovering something new about something very ordinary."},{"Title":"How Things Are Made: From Automobiles to Zippers","review":"I sent this informative book to my nieces as part of their Christmas package.

How about water: how is water made?There are many interesting devices and objects that are manufactured in clever and creative ways. Few of them are in this book. There's a couple of interesting subjects: jet engines, guitars, helicopters. But some are very incomplete - the chapter on watches focuses entirely on electronic quartz watches.

Building Little Italy tells the story of the early Italian immigrant to the City of Brotherly Love, complete with the everyday challenges and hurdles faced by this fledgling group. This book brings to life many new details and is in many ways groundbreaking, as little if any has been published in this area before. Dr. Juliani provides a painstakingly researched tome, with statistical information beautifully complimented by wonderful photos. No rocks are left unturned. For those interested in Italian American or European cultural history, Juliani allows you to step into the shoes of an early Italian immigrant - attempting to adjust to a new nation while trying to maintain ties to his people. Some of the immigrants met with more success than others. Several early Italians in Philadelphia contributed a wealth to this ethnically rich city, and others were on hand to see many historical events. In addition to being a fascinating cultural read, Building Little Italy is an excellent reference tool for those studying this area on a scholarly level. This volume will be a worthwhile addition to the bookshelf of many. It is wholeheartedly recommended to any readers interested in Italian American culture or research."},{"Title":"Building Little Italy: Philadelphia's Italians Before Mass Migration","review":"This book is fantastic in revealing the early Italian history in Philadelphia, Pa.

No, I didn't wake to read what would happen next-I had to save the women!The Radicals is set in New Zealand and the mystery begins when Al Brookes and his wife Jan stumble across an abandoned camper in the bush. They report the find to Chief Inspector Jim Gilliard at Wellington Central Police Station. Jan goes home to be with their adopted daughter Janine while Brookes assists Gilliard with the investigation. Gilliard informs Brookes a headless, fingerless, male corpse has been found. They suspect it is that of a missing French tourist, but they've not found his female companion. The only clue they find in the camper is a camera. The last picture on the film in it is of a group of people in the middle of which the two tourists are the only white faces in a sea of brown and there isn't a single clearly recognizable face among the brown ones. All the men in the group had either moved, bowed their heads, or covered their faces as the photo was taken. The only clear feature about them is the insignia worn on the front of their jackets identifying them as a local chapter of the Maori gang that has been terrorizing the area for years, intent upon driving all white people back into the sea and taking back New Zealand for the Maori race.Two more headless, fingerless, male bodies are found. Jan is concerned for the plight of the woman whom she fears is either dead, sold into slavery, or being tortured. She knows the depravity the Maorists are capable of and since there are no clues to the girl's whereabouts, Jan suggests a psychic be called in. With no leads and a shortage of personnel, Gilliard relents and calls in the psychic but the magistrate refuses to issue a search warrant for the area the woman pinpoints. The Council of Civil Liberties would be sure to create a stink if the rights of any of the Maori citizens were disturbed. Gilliard sends Brookes to scout the area. And then Jan and Janine are both abducted.Ever so slowly Brookes and Gilliard identify the leader of the gang, the gang's objectives, safe houses and crimes. They proceed so slowly, so carefully, with such caution in fact, that when life interferes with my reading, the case interferes with my sleep. The tension is nearly unbearable.To say this book is well-written, the characters well developed, the settings well drawn, the plot captivating, the action lively, is gross understatement. This is one of the most intense novels I've ever read.-Sumera Majid"},{"Title":"Polo ponies;: Their training and schooling,","review":"This book was written years ago and is outdated in parts especially the section on bits and biting it assumes that the progression is snaffle to Pelham and doesn't look at the use of gags and running reins which have become standard and not at the kinder but effective three ring bits which some of the more innovative pro players have started using.HoweverThe general information and schooling techniques are fantastic.

Maybe not in the way I remembered but there. It is a great way to learn about Biblical characters, in that she gives them feet and you can walk around with them.

She has a wonderful gift of filling in the rest of the &quot;Painting&quot; that the Bible doesnt have(i.e. the culture, the geography, the desciples daily lives,etc.). Mostly, you get to sit at the feet of Jesus and hear just what it might of been like at the actual events. The agape of Jesus permeates this work. Moved me very much and made me a better man of God. A must read and then pass it on book!"},{"Title":"John Son Of Thunder","review":"Most of us think of John as the lucky disciple - the one who didn't die a martyr. Ms. Traylor makes the point that his lot may have been the hardest of all in this fictionalized account of the life of the young man who stood at the cross with Mary and the old man who wrote the book of Revealation.Living to be an old man meant, for John, the horror of seeing everyone he ever loved die - not only Jesus but his earlier mentor John the Baptist, his brother James, best friend Peter, adopted mother Mary and even the young disciples following Paul. It isn't until the end of his life that he comes to understand, through what he learned from Christ, that it's our souls and not our bodies that count. Only then is he given the rather dubious gift of the vision of the Apocalypse, ad he finally understands why he was meant to survive his loved ones.The book is quite biblically sound, with the possible exception of the notion that Mary sister of Lazarus was the love of John's life - and althought it's not mentioned in the Bible there's no real reason why it couldn't have been true. All the characters are well written, so you feel awful when John looses them even though you know what's going to happen (I especially liked the charming portrait of Peter's brother-adoring and painfully shy &quot;little&quot; brother Andrew and the powerful, heartbreaking depiction of John the Baptist's last thoughts). A good addition to your biblical fiction library"},{"Title":"John Son Of Thunder","review":"From a christian perspective, the book follows the book of John exactly. Small mentions that most readers might miss - such as the fact that John was a disciple of John the Baptist - are picked up on. The author does embellish a lot, and while this breathes amazing life into the characters, it makes it difficult to keep a true perspective of what really happened and which part is imagination. All the same, this is an engrossing, difficult to put down book!"},{"Title":"John Son Of Thunder","review":"I have never enjoyed a book as much as this one, it was hard to put down.

I am an avid reader and an aspiring writer. In my many years of digging deeply into a story and its characters, I've appreciated the works of many great writers. I must say that Ellen Traylor's books are so well written and the truth in the Bible is interwoven perfectly into the fabric of the story, you feel that you truly are reading a purely non-fictional story.In fiction it is an absolute that characters have fabricated character development as often do settings and backgrounds, but her stories are well researched and woven to be so believable.... anyone who knows the Bible well can appreciate even more the way she puts \\"authenticity\\" into her characters as she makes them come so alive, you just know they are exactly as she portrays them...amazing writer!"},{"Title":"The Family Bed : An Age Old Concept in Child Rearing","review":"This book is incredible! I'm adding it to my collection to pass along to my friends and family. Listen, if you dead set against co-sleeping then don't read it. But if you're open to the idea and just want some validation and reassurance that following your gut is the best parenting tool you have then READ this ASAP. I love that she uses historical and anthropolgical examples of bed sharing. The author emphasizes that the crib and idea of separate sleeping quarters is a new standard that goes against our true natural parenting instincts. I can't say enough about this book.

Both my husband and I felt re-assured with our decision to keep our son in bed with us aftering reading THE FAMILY BED. Cameron will be one year old in a couple of weeks. He is a happy, affectionate and well adjusted baby. With my husband who works away from home during the day, evening and bedtime are the quality time for both my husband and my son to spend together. Cameron loves getting ready for bed at night because he enjoys cuddling up in the comfort of both his parents. We also have a ritual of reading and singing to Cameron before bed. I truly believe that this is the reason why Cameron is so very close to his father. My husband also feels better being away at work during the day because he still gets to enjoy sharing quality time with our son in the evening and at night.

I, myself, found it very helpful and encouraging. The book gave me a different perspective on child rearing practices in a modern world. Although the author strongly advocates sharing sleep with children, she does mention that it is only good if it suits all the parties involved. It is a good lesson in tolerance towards an unusual methods of bringing up children."},{"Title":"The Family Bed : An Age Old Concept in Child Rearing","review":"When I started reading this book, I loved it. It made me feel good about my decision to co-sleep. After the first few chapters though, I felt like some kind of [weirdo]. I was picturing my husband and I sharing our bed with our baby and toddler and then him moving to his own room. But in the author's world, children stay with their parents until whenever they feel like it and then they go sleep with siblings. God Forbid they ever sleep alone!I think co-sleeping is great. I really do...for some kids. We tried the Ferber method and our son screamed for two hours straight. We tried it again and he screamed again for two hours straight. I knew in my heart that I couldn't do that to him again. But if I had a kid who happily fell asleep in their own crib, they'd be sleeping in their own crib. Each child is different. The author of this book makes you feel like you're a horribly selfish person if you don't make your children sleep with you...if you want any private time...and if you want sleep. She even goes into this tyrade about how adults are too obsessed with getting enough sleep.What she wants is a world with adults walk around like tired zombies and the go to sleep cuddled with their ten and eleven year olds.I found the epilogue especially offensive. It's written by another person (but still, the author chose to have it in there) and they talk about the evils of modern science...including artificial insemination and test tube babies. What are they trying to say, that only those biologically equipped should have children?Well, am I still going to co-sleep? Of course! My husband, my son, and I love it. Just as every Muslim is not a fanatic terrorist, not every co-sleeper is a crazy fanatic weirdo!!"},{"Title":"The Family Bed : An Age Old Concept in Child Rearing","review":"This book is very silly.

READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"The Family Bed : An Age Old Concept in Child Rearing","review":"I read this book and my wife checked out another book on the same issue. The single most thing that amazes my wife and me is that there is even a debate about co-sleeping. We grew up in a different culture and co-sleeping is the most common approach every parent uses in our culture. Some use a variation where they put the crib in their bedroom right next to their own bed.Look, we can't generalize. I believe that there are 2 key variables involved in this decision. First, the sleeping \\"stability\\" of parents. If parents are not all over the bed at night, child is relatively safe. We bought a king size bed just before our daughter was born to make sure that all 3 of us had plenty of room in bed. The second variable is the child. Our daughter is very energetic and she wouldn't stay in a crib for 5 seconds if we are not around. Our next door neighbor's son, on the other hand, can sit in his stroller for all day with a pacifier in his mouth and not complain. This kid sleeps in his crib in a separate bedroom and doesn't cry at night.Ultimately for us, it boils down to one thing - we are crazy about our girl and want to enjoy every possible moment with her. Then why in the world would we leave her in a crib by herself? That's why we believe that all parents should consider co-sleeping option because we think it's best for the child.(Culturally, another thing that leaves us bewildered is why women don't breastfeed even when all the medical research touts its benefit to the child, including a recent Danish research that found breast-fed children to have higher IQ. But this is for another review...)"},{"Title":"The Family Bed : An Age Old Concept in Child Rearing","review":"I read this book in 1978, while I was pregnant for my first child. It fit so perfectly with my own thinking and also gave me much more information. This gave me the ability to defend my own family bed practice. I grew up being one of nine children. We were all welcome to our parent's bed. So it seemed normal to me. I was so glad to actually read a book about it. Recently, I bought this book to give to my niece at her baby shower. She really enjoyed it, too. It is written in an easy-to-read way with just enough historical facts to make it credible. I will give it as a gift to young mothers again."},{"Title":"The Family Bed : An Age Old Concept in Child Rearing","review":"As very young parents, we were forced by circumstances to put our first child's crib right up against our bed in our room. I made the crib mattress level with ours, dropped the railing on the side against the bed, lashed the legs of the two together, and filled the small gap with a few old towels. Well, he never slept in the crib itself (it filled with toys and stuffed animals), but its presence made it safe for him to sleep with me in bed on that side, and NOT between me and my husband. We did it this way again when our daughter was born years later, though we didn't have to. I recommend this to everyone expecting a baby. Between this and breast-feeding, we avoided nearly all the problems other new parents moan about, like sleep dep, colic, earaches, and bedtime tears (my daughter never cried AT ALL til she was 3 or 4 months old!). And no, our sex life was never hindered. Happy babies sleep SOUNDLY! This book came out the same year my son was born, and i discovered it a year or two later...it was not the source of the idea for me, but it saved me many times from &quot;expert&quot; opinions that what we were doing was wrong! It is a bit dated and yes defensive, but bear in mind, in 1978, in a major metropolitan hospital, i had to FIGHT to be allowed to breastfeed at all! Our son is now about to graduate from college with honors; both children are very secure, focused, and wise people, with none of the self-destructive or reckless characteristics common in youth. I do attribute this LARGELY to the family bed approach."},{"Title":"The Family Bed : An Age Old Concept in Child Rearing","review":"I was looking for a book to help me with my decision of having a family bed. Not to read a woman's tirade about how poorly Americans are raising their children. She also states that children who aren't loved, are sexually frustrated and that sex should not be a priority in your marriage. This woman needs to wake up and realize that a happy marriage usually wants to have sexual relations with the partners -because they love each other, not b/c they are sexually frustrated and unloved children.

(In fact, it works great for some families, and very poorly for others, depending on both the parents and the kids. Keep an open mind, and see what works best for your own family.) Tine Thevenin is *not* the author to read if you want a sane defence of this practice, however, nor practical tips, either. For example, when asked the most common question, &quot;where do the parents have sex if their kids share their bed?&quot;, she goes off on a tirade about how Americans are so sex-obsessed--why would you want to have sex with your spouse, anyway?--and then talks about how it used to be considered okay to have sex in front of kids, or even *with* them, if you can believe it. What a ridiculous way to defend co-sleeping! Why not just suggest another room, or something? Thevenin is strongly against the use of contraception--it's morally wrong--of mothers' working outside the home, etc.--and thinks you should be, too. All in all, this is among the worst books I've ever read. If you want a better book on the subject, go read one of Sears' baby books, instead."},{"Title":"The Family Bed : An Age Old Concept in Child Rearing","review":"I just finished reading &quot;The Family Bed&quot; and what a relief it was! This book relieved much of the guilt I had felt for not instantly knowing how to parent my children in the ways that I would have chosen had I been better informed and more strongly supported. The edition I read is the 1976 one that I got from the La Leche League library. I am definately going to buy a new copy and buy copies for several friends. This is definately a wonderful book for new parents. I have told several friends about it and they are all anxious to read it next!As to the comments made by another reviewer that she is too traditionally Christian in her viewpoint, I didn't find this to be the case, even though I am not a Christian, nor traditional. I found her views refreshing and uplifting. I also felt that the question of &quot;marital relations&quot; was well addressed, merely presenting what other couples have chosen to do (which did not include having sex with the child). Other, more bizarre cultural practices were touched on, but not put forth as suggestions.The author is a La Leche League leader and a mother who shares some wonderful insights, suggestions, and loving support of attachment parenting techniques with the reader.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Family Bed : An Age Old Concept in Child Rearing","review":"We practiced the family bed with all four of our kids and it was great! No nightmares, no nightlights, just lots of hugs in the morning. The fear of rolling on your kid and suffocating it is silly.

I was a single mother for the first 9 years of her life, I had come from an abusive home, and had no family to speak of to help me along the way. I read books on baby care, parenting and home schooling, but most of all I followed my heart.Which brings me to Tine's book. This was one of the first books I read just shortly before Veronica was born. While all the people around me were telling me to put the child to bed and let her cry, to separate her from my own space and allow myself personal time, and to not spoil her by carrying her in a sling or my arms, Tine's book gave me the freedom to follow my heart and instincts on how to raise a child with compassion, and not with adult selfishness.I hold my hat off to Tine for writing on this topic in a world that seems so ill-prepared for it and I also give her some credit for helping me present a responsible, adjusted, and confident daughter.The Family Bed : An Age Old Concept in Child Rearing"},{"Title":"The Family Bed : An Age Old Concept in Child Rearing","review":"I received the book quickly, it was a bit more 'Used\\" than had been stated, but still ok for my own use, but not to give to someone else.

Its hard enough maintaining a secret, intimate, sexual relationship when kids come. With a &quot;family bed&quot; it is impossible. We became a &quot;family&quot; but really lost our desire for each other. Maybe the bed sharing did not cause this, but for many years now (my &quot;kids&quot; are 23, 21, and 18) I have wondered how much it contributed to our divorce. We parted friends, but not lovers.

I read my sister's copy of this book, as she practices the family bed. She also has children who can ONLY be put to bed by their parents lying down with them. Since we have this great thing called electricity many parents prefer to stay up a little later than their children, but the children grow to rely on the parental snuggling to fall asleep. It makes the children difficult to put to bed when babysitting for them (or in this case, impossible!) Also there is some silly &quot;historical&quot; type chat that seems anecdotal and unscientific.

He stayed in the NICU for 2 full months before he was allowed to come home. He came home attached to many machines and monitors.The 'good' nurses in the NICU quietly approached me one by one to urge me to let my son sleep in our bed. It was as though they were messengers of secret information. One nurse highly recommended The Family Bed.I didn't get the book and my son didn't sleep with us. Then one night, his monitors went off continually. I thought it would be the night he died. To comfort him, we brought him to bed with us....all 4.9 pounds of him. His monitors never went off again.I went out and bought the book. I read it with great interest. It was easy to follow. The author was obviously passionate about bringing children into the 'family' bed. It was moving and compelling at the same time.The basic point I got out of the book was this....who do you want your children attached to? The teddy bear? The blanket? The passifier? Or, do you want them attached to you?We live in a society that wants kids, but doesn't want to be bothered by them. They grow up looking for 'what' to trust instead of 'who' to trust.I know have three children. All three have slept with us. Our bed is the 'safe' place. They are 6, 5, &amp; 3.

[With so many other rooms in the house, I'm amazed at some of the other reviewers who say they couldn't have a sexual relationship with their husbands... We've certainly not had that problem.] Our family is a very close and happy one, and my husband and I love nothing better than waking up all cuddled up together with our sweet little toddler in the mornings. I'd recommend the &quot;Family Bed&quot; [or &quot;Co-sleeping&quot;; &quot;Sharing Sleep&quot;] to any family that would like a close knit, loving, happy family unit.That having been said, I kind of hate this book. While I suppose it is something of a &quot;Classic&quot;, I dislike the author's language on the subject [she does seem to rant and rave a bit, which is unneccessary and annoying in my opinion]. I disliked her chapter on Sex [seeming to think it was unneccessary between spouses or that there was something wrong with wanting to have sex with your husband - as opposed to offering good advice on how to have a great sex life AND a Family Bed]. She also makes a couple of allusions to sex WITH children that made my skin crawl. I found parts of this book very upsetting and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, regardless.If you want some great books on Co-sleeping or &quot;Family Beds&quot;, check out &quot;Three in a Bed&quot; by Deborah Jackson, and &quot;Night Time Parenting&quot; or any of several other books by Dr. William Sears &amp; his wife Martha - I found these MUCH more helpful, sane, and constructive."},{"Title":"The Family Bed : An Age Old Concept in Child Rearing","review":"This book is helpful because it does not imply that there is one correct way to raise children. The author, Tine Thevenin, has a wonderful theory that a good parent is one who really listens to what a child asks of them. I was one of those people who vowed never to let my baby sleep with me, but after having my son in June 1998 and not sleeping more than 3 hours at stretch since, I have changed my attitude. I was sick of angrily getting out of bed every two hours to try to comfort him and finally tried bringing him in bed with me and my husband. Now we all are much happier-my son has the comfort of his parents nearby, I get a lot more sleep and my husband does not have to try to deal with a crying baby and a psycho wife in the middle of the night. This book is wonderful because it tells you to trust your instincts and not worry about what other people think of your parenting choices. It does not say that people who share their beds with their children are better parents, it just says to do what works for your family. Good common sense, if you asked me. Each child is different and each family is different. Many babies have not read the books that say they should sleep through the night at 3 months! If you too are tired of getting out of bed many times a night, taking your child into your bed may be the answer and this book can give you some background about this age-old practice. It is good to read if outsiders give you a hard time about it, too! If you are an attachment parenting advocate, this book will be right up your alley."},{"Title":"The Family Bed : An Age Old Concept in Child Rearing","review":"Great book about the theory behind having your children sleep with you - but if you know that's what you want but want some practical help about where to make love with your partner and about getting the child to sleep when you're not ready for bed, etc. etc. this is not the book - I'm still looking for one."},{"Title":"The Family Bed : An Age Old Concept in Child Rearing","review":"This book is really wonderful. My husband and I read it before our baby was born, and felt that it made good sense. We loved seeing our baby and young child so happy and secure with us.

What it didn't do was give me any help at all at dealing with the difficulties we encountered. I needed advice on helping my child not to stay attached to my nipple all night, just because I was there, how to get him to sleep before my bedtime, and how to maintain intimacy with my husband, particularly while dealing with the first two problems. All of these have solutions that we continue to work out for ourselves, but this author's comments were not helpful. Being told that sleep wasn't really that necessary, or that I don't really need a sex life was not going to make my husband supportive at all, and I wasn't too happy about it either.

My son is 6 months old and he has slept with me since the day he was born - even in the hospital. After a few sleepless nights of sitting up to breastfeed, I finally realized that lying down to nurse was wonderful. So - to the book. My parents had all of their children but me sleep with them. (Mom says she was &quot;reading a different book&quot; with me). Once they discovered LLL and co-sleeping that was it for them. It was wonderful to finally read the book that changed their minds, even at a time when the &quot;experts&quot; were against co-sleeping.The author does a great job of laying down why the family bed is the best place for children. Just as breastmilk is the BEST food, co-sleeping is the BEST thing for kids. She never says it is the best thing for parents...but that's the point. Being a parent is about sacrifices...but who better to sacrifice for than this sweet wonderful little person who is yours to raise into a BIG wonderful person.For the money, this book is a great WHY book. I agree with other reviewers that not a whole lot of HOW is found. If you are already a co-sleeper and want something to give to your parents or in-laws to explain WHY...this is great."},{"Title":"The Family Bed : An Age Old Concept in Child Rearing","review":"We co-sleep and love it, but this book wasn't much of a help. Three in a Bed is better, and the Sears' Baby Book is best. With the latter, you're also getting a lot more for your money, since it covers all aspects of child care and illness."},{"Title":"The Family Bed : An Age Old Concept in Child Rearing","review":"My husband and I have been married for 9 years and have 3 children ages 6, 4, and 2. Our family bed is awesome! When we make the decision to become parents it results in sacrifice on our parts for many years to come. With our first two children we used a bassinet next to our bed and then the crib in the other room. At times we would bring them to bed with us - but this was usually when nothing else would work and we were exhausted and needed sleep.With our daughter we made a different decision from the night she was born (at home). She was in our bed. I have had more sleep since her birth than I did in the four years prior to that. And my husband and I have a more intimate relationship than ever before. And our sex life is more active, more creative, and much better now than it was prior to having kids.One of the problems with our culture is that we have lost the ability to listen to our instinct and do what is going to be best for ourselves and our family. We have become reliant on what research shows us or what the doctor tells us is best for our family instead of following our hearts and using common sense. This includes books as well. We seem to think that someone else is the expert and when we follow their advice and things don't work out perfectly we blame the person who gave the advice instead of ourselves for the choice we made.Prior to writing this I have read all the reviews posted to date and I hear a common theme - that sex lives suffered or intimacy was diminished because of practicing the family bed. And that many disagreed with the statements in the book regarding sleep and sexual relations. Becoming a parent involves sacrifice. And sometimes one doesn't get as much of these things as one would like. But it needs to be remembered that practicing the family bed is not to blame. As new parents loss of sleep is to be expected and most women don't feel like having sex for a couple months anyway. A marriage requires consistant and constant work and committment - as does parenting. A great sex life does not constitute a strong marriage; intimacy does, and if your own bedroom is the only place in your house that you can have sex, well that's pretty boring...No single book can completely tackle any one given subject - I think The Family Bed is a great book, and offers some really good insight. I have recommended it to all my friends and family who were expecting."},{"Title":"The Family Bed : An Age Old Concept in Child Rearing","review":"This book is a great introduction to the benefits of the family bed and sharing sleep with your children. The author is very passionate, and she has a lot to say about attachment, teaching children to depend on people rather than objects, and creating a laid-back, responsive, and loving environment. I can see where some people may be turned off by her intensity, but I find passion refreshing.I disagree with those people who found the book to be \\"creepy.\\" Nowhere in the book does Thevenin advocate sex with children, nor does she advocate foregoing sexual intimacy with one's partner. What she DOES do is reference other cultures and how they treat sexuality and the family bed. She also gives parents (albeit just a little) information on how to maintain sexual intimacy while sharing sleep with their child(ren). She also mentions co-sleeping as a form of PREVENTION for incest and sexual abuse... not as a way of encouraging it.This book, while heavy on philosophy and the \\"whys\\" of co-sleeping, does lack helpful and important information on making the family bed a reality. There are snippets here and there of practical information, but it certainly isn't a manual. If you're looking for a good reason to put your baby in bed with you, then this is your book. If you're looking for a how-to guide, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Million dollar profiles;: Intimate biographies of 27 of the most fabulous life insurance salesmen of this era","review":"Unless you are REALLY interested in who the heavy hitters in the insurance business were over sixty years ago this probably isn't for you.

Supplementing Ogai's text with his own research, McClellan covers the span of her difficult and remarkable life from her marriage to Chusai, the births (and deaths) of her children, the death of Chusai, and her latter days spent moving all over Japan with her family, trying to eke out a meager living. Japan at this time was going through significant changes as power was wrested from feudal landlords and &quot;restored&quot; to the Emperor Meiji. As a result, Io's entire life changed; born to privilege and affluence, she and her family lost both their status and their income in the restoration. What is amazing about Io is how unconventional she is, and how her story resists the stereotype of the demure, powerless woman (especially in 19th century Japan). Io is not afraid to carry a dagger and pull it out and threaten to use it on thugs who would harm her. And after her husband's death she declines invitations to live with relatives, opting instead to maintain her autonomy even with its threat of greater poverty. She is exceptionally well educated, and learns to read English in her sixties. But McClellan is also careful to place Io's story within its historical context, reminding us of the real limitations she faced because of her sex. He still surmises, however, on her opinions on the issues affecting her quickly changing society, such as women's voting rights and Western scholarship. Above all, Io is portrayed as a woman who combines qualities of strength and courage with tolerance. These are the exact qualities one needed to survive in the world she inhabited, and her possession of them ensured, no doubt, her remarkable success."},{"Title":"Woman in the Crested Kimono: The Life of Shibue Io and Her Family Drawn from Mori Ogai's Shibue Chusai","review":"This was a delightful read, one I'd come across by chance when it was mentioned in Hanley's Everyday Things in Premodern Japan. It tells the story of a woman named Shibue Io, who lived during the mid-19th century and died in the 1880s, her life spanning the late Edo period and the early Meiji. She was the wife of a scholar-physician named Shibue Chsai, the subject of a long and very detailed biography by the great Meiji writer Mori gai. McLellan, rather than translating gai's book itself, extracted only those parts concerned with his remarkable wife, Io, and then interpolated his own musings and commentary on the woman and her times. He also provides excellent documentation in the form of endnotes, which give the book a necessary grounding in historical research. We follow the life and times of Io as she marries the well-respected Chsai, bears a sizable brood (not all of whom lived long), raises and educates her children, is widowed, and endures the hardships that came to families associated with the samurai (or bushi) class during the time of the Meiji Restoration. This exceptional woman was extremely well educated for her time, and several of her children were themselves involved in scholarly pursuits. Io was not only intellectually inclined, she also--having been given martial arts training--had considerable physical bravery, as described in several vivid anecdotes. The book pursues the story of her husband, and each of her children, and by the time the volume concludes, after only 150 pages of narrative, we feel we have come to know not only Shibue Io, but her entire family, and a number of persons closely associated with the Shibue. Moreover, we get a marvelous picture of what life was like for an upper middle-class Japanese family living in Edo during the closing days of the shogunate, and how topsy-turvy things became when it had to adjust to the social, economic, and political upheavals surrounding and succeeding the Restoration. McLellan's commentary has just the right touch; knowledgeable and sensitive, and always helpful in engaging the reader's interest in and sympathy for the cast of characters whose story he (and gai) is telling. He keeps the narrative clear, reminding the reader of who individuals are when they reappear in the story, and continually offering valuable insights into the cultural and historical circumstances of the times, including the place of women. This is a book that anyone interested in 19th-century Japanese life should read; since it was published in 1985, I regret not having known of it before, but I'm delighted to have finally made its acquaintance."},{"Title":"The Best American Short Stories of the Eighties","review":"'This book demonstrates clearly why this series is so popular and respected. Ravenel chose 2 stories from each of the annual collections. These collections are edited by Ravenel, an editor at Houghton Mifflin, and a guest editor. The guest editors were mostly big literary names - I was not sure that I trusted each one of them, but not to worry, there were a couple of disappointments, but for the most part this was a terrific collection which introduced me to some wonderful writers. There were a couple of familiar names with fine stories that I had not seen before: Joyce Carol Oates's \\"Nairobi\\": a tale of emotional prostitution among the well-to-do; Bowles's \\"In the Red Room\\": a typically cool and disturbing piece; and my hero Russell Banks's \\"Sarah Cole: A Type of Love Story\\": a twistedly amusing account of a romance between a handsome young gentleman and an unattractive lower class woman. There were a couple of stories that I have read before and enjoyed revisiting: Carver's \\"Cathedral\\" and Robert Stone's powerful '\\"Helping\\". A few disappointments were encountered as well, such as Mavis Gallant's boring story, and Cynthia Ozick's predictable holocaust tale.Alice Munro's \\"Meneseteung\\" was fabulous, one of the best things I have read in a long time. She is a marvelous writer, capable of vividly imagining a setting and creating full characters, not to mention a master's grasp of the language. Peter Taylor's long story \\"The Old Forest\\" was almost a genteel piece, written with a stately pace and feeling, about a young man's encounter with and unintentional participation in the troubles that can come up when class divisions and sexual attraction come into contact. Robert Coover and Donald Barthelme contributed interesting surreal pieces. Charles Johnson's \\"Exchange Value\\" was an intense and bizarrely humorous story from the ghetto. Wright Morris's \\"Fellow Creatures\\" is thoroughly charming, the account of a crusty old gent's growing appreciation for the members of the animal kingdom - this should be a favorite of vegetarians everywhere. Susan Sontag's \\"The Way We Live Now\\" is a fine look at how a group of NYC aesthetes deals with the AIDS crisis when it comes home to one of their number. Charles Baxter's \\"Gryphon\\" is an enigmatic but amusing piece about a schoolteacher who is, well, a little off. Tim O'Brien is well known as a writer that deals with the Vietnam War very effectively in his fiction, and I have wanted for some time to read something by him. \\"The Things They Carried\\" does not disappoint; it starts out itemizing a list of what US soldiers carried through the jungles and naturally develops into a depiction of the pain and misery of that experience.

While biblical hermeneutics are in view, it really concerns how we interpret any text. Thiselton has one major concern: are there standards of meaning that go beyond any particular society and embrace all humanity, or not? Thiselton argues throughout the book that there are, while thoroughly and (I think) fairly presenting the alternative viewpoint(s). His major supports include the later Wittgenstein, the speach-act theory of Austin and Searle, and (to a lesser extent) the eschatological vision of Pannenberg. His major targets are the deconstruction of Derrida and Barthes, the pragmatism of Rorty and (some but not all) liberation theologies, and the reader-response theory of Fish. In a typically understated British way, he cheerleads for the one side and pans the other through the whole book. In both modes, however, Thiselton keeps an impressive critical distance (most of the time) in admitting both to the strengths of those he opposes and the weaknesses of those he supports. While difficult, I know of no better one volume treatment of the subject. A thorough and discerning work for the serious student."},{"Title":"New Horizons in Hermeneutics","review":"For advanced students in biblical hermeneutics, this book is indespensible. No more comprehensive analysis of the history and present state of this field is available anywhere. Thiselton traces the more significant developments in hermeneutics in great depth from Schleiermacher up to the present day. In the earlier sections, Thiselton has a tendency ramble. His style becomes significantly more concise, particulalry as he moves toward the contemporary era and the impact of general literary studies on biblical hermeneutics. One of the problems with most discussions of hermeneutics is that they stay almost exclusively on the theoretical level, and rarely venture into application of the methods dsicussed. Thiselton's work is somewhat uneven on this count. The application of some methods is presented and critiqued, while in other areas the biblical text never comes into view. Thankfully, Thiselton does move in determined fashion toward his own hermeneutical perspective, outlines his principles clearly, and offers a preliminary application to some Pauline texts. Biblical studies students will be frustrated that developments in hermeneutics are not more consistently related to the history of biblical exegesis. The hermeneutical assumptions and implications of source and form-criticism, for example, are never discussed directly. These criticisms aside, Thiselton has taken on an immense task and, while his execution is not perfect, there is likely no scholar in the world who could surpass his performance in this vook."},{"Title":"New Horizons in Hermeneutics","review":"New Horizons in Hermeneutics critically assesses almost the entire range of hermeneutical schools of its day from a stance that had largely, if not entirely, been formulated in Thiselton's thinking from as early as 1976.Thiselton basically argues that hermeneutical theory needs to be rebuilt programmatically so as to overcome the dichotomies and one-sidednesses inherent in broadly positivist, broadly existentialist, broadly structuralist, broadly post-structuralist, and broadly neo-pragmatic approaches - whether to theory or practice. This rebuilding requires a considerable modification of Gadamer's thought along seven axes.First, dialogue needs to be broadened at the level of pre-understanding such that as many traditions as possible are allowed to contribute positively to the hermeneutical conversation. Notably, Gadamer's tradition requires correction from that of Pannenberg and T.F. Torrance, from that of the later Wittgenstein, from that of Saussure, from those of Schleiermacher, Kierkegaard, Heidegger, and Bultmann, and from that of Austin, Evans, Searle, Recanati, and others. This is not at all to say that Gadamer was not well read (!), but rather to say that these traditions should have been allowed to contribute more positively to the critical synthesis within the preunderstanding with which hermeneutical problems and questions are approached. Notably, Gadamer lacks the revealed Christological criterion of the tradition of Pannenberg by which traditions can be interpreted against the broader background of the narrative wholes of eschatological anticipations of history-as-a-whole (metacritical explanation) or by which they can be socio-critically evaluated by a Christological ethics (metacritical evaluation).Second, Heidegger and Gadamer fail to find a philosophy of history that properly accounts for both Dasein's subjectivity (a hermeneutic of selves - not understood transcendentally) and a hermeneutic of traditions without over-emphasising one or other of these two poles in a dichotomous manner that violates the unity of historical reality - a unity that must somehow embrace a process that produces both a posteriori differences and a posteriori continuities whilst also moving towards an eschatological whole. Neo-pragmatic attempts to divorce present reading communities from historical traditions and their operative influence violate the philosophical axiom of the unity of history that resonates with a theology of the unity of creation.Third, Gadamer and Heidegger thereby fail to properly reinstate subject-object conceptualisation - even in its properly historically embedded form premised upon historical continuity and difference - in relation to the critical testing of the transmitted content of traditions against anticipations of trans-temporal, trans-contextual criteria. That is, theology provides solutions to the problem of the metacriticism of traditions and societies left by Heidegger, Gadamer, and even by Habermas and Apel though they fully realise the issues at stake. Ricoeur rightly attempted to reinstate the explanatory dimension of hermeneutical understanding, but had inherited too much of the thought of Heidegger and Gadamer to achieve this adequately or escape their historical, epistemological, linguistic, and interpretative theoretical dichotomies. Notably, Ricoeur's middle period excursion into dialogue with structuralist approaches left him with too strong an intra-linguistic notion of textual effects to the neglect of 'behind-the-text' factors that embed intra-linguistic effects within an extra-linguistic background of speech-actions. A greater consideration of theories of conversational implicature would have solved this problem, thereby allowing Ricoeur's epistemological 'explanatory' axis to be better grounded in the dialectic between past and present horizons.Fourth, Gadamer fails to overcome the artificial linguistic dualism attendent upon Heidegger's construal of the language problematic from within the coordinates of the epistemological embeddedness and centrality of Dasein for whom propositions and assertions represented a disparaged derivative mode of thinking. Further, these dualisms led to an artificial ontological prioritisation of language over history that Gadamer fails to properly eradicate, and which Ricoeur fails to fully overcome. By contrast, the later Wittgenstein overcomes the linguistic dualism by embedding all language within human (and we might with Thiselton add divine) speech-actions of various kinds - including assertions and propositions of various types. By implication, dualisms or dichotomies are removed when the language problematic is construed from within a theory of action that, in turn, presupposes a broader philosophy of history in which the unity (but not uniformity) of history is the precondition for all language and understanding. The structuralist tradition wrongly tried to return to a kind of idealist notion of language grounded in basic 'formal' oppositions, thus divorcing language from a properly historical perspective. Post-structuralism rightly deconstructed the 'formal' axioms of Western philosophical writings by showing them to be literary devices, but also failed to construe the language problematic within an adequate philosophy of history. This led to a kind of dichotomy between a still-idealised precondition for linguistic flux and shifting 'histories' construed linguistically. The result was a kind of 'docetic' approach to language and textualities that artificially divorced language from historical continuities and traditional criteria. This then allowed texts to have potentially endlessly indeterminate meanings constrained only by present readers.Fifth, in relation to Western culture and culture criticism more broadly, then Habermas and Apel were right to seek a basis for trans-contextual and trans-temporal criteria against which the interpretations, interests, and practices of traditions could be evaluated, though their lack of a theological dimension rendered their success limited. Thus, these thinkers rightly tried to flesh out the metacritical side of Gadamer's thought by moving beyond an explanatory dimension towards an evaluative dimension. By contrast, Rorty and Fish violated both a theological basis for metacriticism and a philosophical criterion against which historical texts could reshape reader-horizons on the ultimate basis of the unity of historical reality. Liberation and feminist hermeneutical strands which presuppose meta-socio-critical theoretical frameworks may be affirmed in this attempt. Those that presuppose - even in disguised form - socio-pragmatic theoretical frameworks are largely rejected on the metacritical grounds that they adopt the power-abusers own strategies of self-assertion - whether at the level of 'interest groups' or individually. The socio-pragmatic 'solution' is thus a formula for disastrous social conflict and fragmentation with no criteria for exposing abuses of power other than personal narratives. The basis upon which it does this is a self-assertive suppression of dialogue with the philosophy of history - a dialogue that would have shown that texts can indeed impact readers from beyond their own horizons. Links with readers' prior concepts can be maintained whilst simultaneously extending the grammar of those concepts and superimposing them in new ways. To say otherwise is like saying one cannot add to a Lego set. Tradition may come to speech in the language of the readers, but reader horizons can still be transformed beyond a phenomenology of self-discovery and self-imperialisation.Sixth, in relation to a hermeneutic of selves, then Gadamer's near-reduction of selves to the products of a hyposticisation of the inter-subjective and suspiciously near-intra-linguistic tradition-background requires correction by the emphasis on individual subjectivity as found in Kierkegaard, Schleiermacher, Heidegger, and Bultmann. Whilst subjectivity is de-centred by virtue of its situatedness within a larger socio-historical and ultimately theological historical process, it is not neglected altogether. Thus, there remains a place even for a stress on personal narrative as in socio-pragmatism - so long as this does not then become a basis for ethics.Seventh, Gadamer's hermeneutical circle requires modification in that distancing and fusion need to be recast in more properly historical terms over and against an overly intra-linguistic perspective (by appeal to the later Wittgenstein, Austin, Evans, Searle, and Recanati), in more properly epistemological-metacritical evaluative terms over and against mere assessments of difference between horizons (traditions can distort truth), and in less linguistically dualistic terms in the sense that in the later Wittgenstein's partly parallel notions of noticing and showing propositions can function so as to highlight Gadamer's own emphases on broader rationality and on effective history. The Saussurian tradition can also help lend specificity to Gadamer's notion of distancing. the particularity of the textual horizon, of reading goals, and of reading interests means that no single interpretative model or model of textuality can be imperialised. Fusion - especially in biblical hermeneutics - is not only a matter of actualisation, but also of divine speech-acts operating via the biblical texts so as to shape readers according to promise. This involves appropriations and applications in the extra-linguistic world in which divine promises will be fulfilled. This in turn contributes to the hermeneutical circle at the level of the processes of tradition such that tradition can neither be imperialised in a static form that over-emphasises the past (cf. premodern hermeneutics) or the present (cf. postmodern hermeneutics) nor naively rejected (cf. modern hermeneutics).It should also be noted that Thiselton adds two final chapters on the practical implications of the different approaches to interpretation that he covers in New Horizons in Hermeneutics. A major thesis is that no single model of texts and no single interpretative strategy can be imperialised. Nor can textual action be divorced from the dimensions of actualisation, appropriation, and application. Nor can textual action be divorced from extra-linguistic 'behind-the-text' factors - pastoral theology should not reduce the biblical texts to functions of the present horizon, but the genuine merging of two distinct horizons is required. None of this indicates that Thiselton fails to achieve a unified new theoretical subtext for hermeneutics, even if that subtext (outlined above) remains provisional itself. Rather, Thiselton's unified hermeneutic at the level of theory allows for multiple models to be applied at the level of practice - simply because Thiselton's over-arching but provisional and programmatic theory allows for historical and textual particularity in a way that precludes over-arching 'Method'. And by this last sentence, we are NOT indicating that Thiselton is simply 'Gadamerian' (see above)!I can thoroughly recommend New Horizons in Hermeneutics, though most of the framework outline above is already implicit in Thiselton's earlier work, The Two Horizons. In disagreement with one of the other reviewers, I must stress that The Two Horizons may well be the first work on hermeneutics to overcome the problems of dichotomies that has plagued the discipline for the last half-century. Admittedly, the above analysis of Thiselton's thought cannot be read off the surface of New Horizons in Hermeneutics. Nevertheless, Thiselton himself affirmed a considerably expanded version of this overview when I presented it to him in celebration of his 40 career - a career which is producing even more fruit now than at the time when New Horizons in Hermeneutics was written. Why Thiselton still hasn't been properly recognised as the first person to achieve a unified theological hermeneutical theory in the history of the discipline is cause for grave concern."},{"Title":"New Horizons in Hermeneutics","review":"Anthony Thiselton is Professor of Christian Theology at the University of Nottingham and author of a number of other hermeneutics volumes including Two Horizons: New Testament Hermeneutics and Philosophical Description, Thiselton on Hermeneutics: Collected Works with New Essays, The Hermeneutics of Doctrine, and Hermeneutics: A Historical Overview, as well as commentary on 1 Corinthians (NIGTC) and The Living Paul.This is the second time I have made my way through New Horizons in Hermeneutics: The Theory and Practice of Transforming Biblical Reading. I first read this volume, along with Two Horizons and Thiselton on Hermeneutics two summer ago when I was working heavily on hermeneutics and interpretation theory. New Horizons in Hermeneutics is best described by Thiselton himself as \\"a description and critical evaluation of all the major theoretical models and approaches which characterize current hermeneutical theory, or which have contributed to its present shape.\\" (pg. 1). The book is meant for both those involved in scholarly hermeneutical study and Biblical scholars. This second audience means special attention in New Horizons in Hermeneutics will be given to applying these hermeneutical approaches to the Bible.The first chapter introduces the moorings involved in recent hermeneutical study and outlines the theme of each chapter to come. The first three chapters discuss the nature of textuality and the recent post-modern attempt at textual deconstruction. Before focusing on the the most recent interpretive trends Thiselton moves backward. In chapter 4 there is an excellent discussion on pre-modern interpretation focusing on the role of tradition and allegory. The fifth chapter then develops the interpretive assumptions of the Reformers, from Luther to the English. The history lesson comes to an end with a overview of Schleiermacher's system in chapter six and an application of Schleiermacher's, Dilthey's and Betti's approach to Pauline texts.Chapters 8-14 are the heart of the book. Here Thiselton lives up to his standard and gives in depth analysis of the current interpretive and hermenutical theories. The discussion ranges from existentialism, to Speech-Act Theory, Paul Ricoeur, Socio-Critical theory, Liberation theology, Literary theory and Reader Response. This section is not simply a critique of these various theories and Thiselton commends that which is positive in each case. In the final two chapters, Thiselton combines his critiques and affirmations to formats an alternative to the standard approaches, which draws from and add to them. He calls it \\"The Hermeneutics of Pastoral Theology.\\" The most enduring part of these chapters encourages Christian readers to remember that their sinfulness effects their interpretation and their interpretive systems do not escape their idolatrous tendencies. If we rely on our own abilities in Biblical interpretation we will have betrayed the Gospel story of the Cross and Resurrection we are seeking to better understand. A wise word.With such a deeply philosophical nature, what role does this volume have in the tool box of Biblical scholars and Bible teachers? The first thing that must be noted is the difficulty of this text. While I do have an undergraduate in philosophy, I am not a professional trained philosopher and I found this book challenging to read at many points. I needed to go slow and rehearse what Thiselton was claiming about each position and then register his comments on it. I relatively well acquainted with most of the models Thiselton interacts with and I found most of his comments to be either on target or quite illuminating. With that said, I would encourage more pastors and Bible interpreters to spend more time considering their interpretive assumptions and methods. Here the chapters on Speech-Act Theory and Literary Theory have the most relevance for Biblical exegesis, both of which have had significant impact on Biblical interpretation in the last 20 years, in part thanks to Thiselton. In addition, while I found some Thiseltons discussion on Reader-Reader response and Liberation theory a bit too accepting, their is much to learn from his descriptions and interaction. Finally, Thiselton's discussion on the role of text and reader having a cyclical effect of change is quite useful for pastors and any Bible reader interested in better understanding the hermeneutical spiral.For those without previous work in philosophy of language or 20th century continental thought I would suggest that you start with Hermeneutics: A Historical Overview or The Hermeneutics of Doctrine from Thiselton or Is There Meaning in This Text? by Kevin Vanhoozer. For those more comfortable in these areas, New Horizons in Hermeneutics moves Thiselton's work in Two Horizons forward by interacting on a very high level with the litany of options facing the interpreter today."},{"Title":"The Divine Comedy: Text With Translation in the Metre of the Original by Geoffrey L.

Although suited for an introductory course on poetry, I'm not sure why the publishers (Stanford UP) would think that this volume ... is a better deal than the other recent Stanford UP volume, The Collected Poetry, which includes some of Jeffers's prose (Prefaces/Letters) and is more comprehensive ...This is a slim volume--about the size of Hass's previous collection (Rock and Hawk, now out-of-print). But it is vastly superior in text and style to The Selected Poems (thin book, red and blue cover, ...).I highly recommend this text. It contains the \\"Best Of\\" Jeffers's poetic gems, such as \\"Shine, Perishing Republic,\\" (apropos for our current times), and \\"For Una,\\" to name a couple.Jeffers was an amazing American poet. For once I disagree with Vendler's estimation of his poetic merits and craft. I would recommend Jeffers to a reader in the same spirit that Hass, C. Milosz, Wm. Everson, and Bukowski recommended that we listen to his prophetic voice. Jeffers's work embodies the Carmel landscape and cosmic essence of Northern California. Yet his voice is universal and resounds with tragic wisdom.I also recommend Hass, Milosz, Everson, H.

Hugh Thomas begins shortly before the outbreak of the war and tells the story through to its completion (essentially 1936-1939). It is somewhat long, but the story itself is so compelling and Thomas' writing so good that it sucked me in and moved along nicely.I have only a couple of gripes. First, if someone wants a short introduction, this may not be the book. I am sure there are other titles out there that will give you the basic facts in less time. As I said, however, reading the book was entertaining enough that I did not mind at all. As an example of an interesting factoid that emerges from this book, it seems that a substantial portion of the treasure from America that Spain won in the 16th century was given to the Soviets for safe-keeping. It is still there.Second, while the book is strong on narrative, it is a little bit weak in analysis. What is especially lacking is an understanding of the factors that led to the outbreak of war in the first place. The books starts with a short chapter describing Spain in the early 20th century and plunges directly into the events leading up to the war. While the suspense before the outbreak of the war is palpable, the basic question of why a country would degenerate into civil war is hardly touched. In fairness to the author, he may have deliberately chosen to focus on the war itself rather than its causes. On the other hand, the discussion about why the Nationalists defeated the Republicans is fairly good. Two factors stand out. First, the Republicans were crippled by in-fighting amongst the factions, a fact that is admirably discussed. Second, the Nationalists received substantial help from abroad.Author background: I am not a historian, but have read a handful of books on Spanish history."},{"Title":"The Spanish civil War","review":"This 1994 edition (a 2nd or 3rd revision of the first edition put out c. 1980 I believe) is apparently not available because a newer revised edition is coming out in November 2001 with updated information no doubt--you should pick up this latest coming edition. Understanding the subject of the Spanish Civil War has been plagued by two major obstacles: 1) The use of the Spanish Civil war as merely a prelude to WWII by historians of the English speaking world, i.e., crudely lumping in Franco and the Nationalists as just a Spanish variation of Facism; this ignores the study of Spanish history in its own right and the unique and tragic facets of Iberian history; 2) The use and abuse of the Spanish Civil War as an ideological forum for anarchists and &quot;Trotskyite&quot; anti-Stalinist communists, again, mostly from the English speaking world. The biased accounts of Anglo/American/Canadian leftists of this period (as well as Hemingway's romanticized fiction) have distorted and confused the event in the eyes of the English-speaking world. Its good to see an English scholar clear up this mess. Thomas' account clearly delineates the various factions and their goals on both sides, pointing out that lack of unity and in-fighting of the various factions of the left-of-center Republican side (if &quot;Republican&quot; is even a proper term to use by the time the Stalinists were done with it) was probably more decisive in leading to its downfall than the outside pressure of the Nationalists (who were by no means unified in ideology, but greatly more cooperative amongst themselves than the Republicans). The &quot;cowardly&quot; stance of the Democratic Western countries is made understandable and must be seen in the context of their own instability and weakness of the time. In retrospect, any aid to Republican Spain would have probably only helped the Stalinist-controlled communists complete their strangle-hold on the Republican coalition government, the other factions--especially the anarchists--being severely and savagely purged by them (my own opinion). In any case, Thomas' outstanding research and balanced account of the event allows each reader to draw their own conclusion without undue ideological bias. If you read only one history of the Spanish Civil War, this is the one to have."},{"Title":"The Spanish civil War","review":"When I moved to Barcelona, Spain in 1980, people were still talking about the Civil War. They had only recently been allowed public discussion of such topics since the death of the dictator, Franco. So, the war was still very recent for a lot of people.I couldn't understand who all the factions were and what the background of this conflict was when listening to people talk about it. I found this book, read it and it told me everything I wanted to know. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in this era of Spanish history. Very well-written and readable."},{"Title":"The Spanish civil War","review":"THe Spanish Civil war is apparently one of the most written on moments of the 20th century, and even if this is true, this book stands out as one of the best full, one volume, histories of the event, which began in 1936 and ended in 1939. The war is fascinating because it pitted so many competeing ideologies against one another. It was a war of secular versus religious. Of Rural versus urban. Of fascist versus communist. of democracies(sort of) verus autocracy. It was in some ways a popular war versus militarism. It was a 'world war in minature' and a war of 'two revolutions'. Thomas is the best chronicler of this, and his higly readable account is must read for everyone interested in the origins of world war two or Spain, or world history in the 20th century.The Spanish civil war was a defining experience not just for Spain but for the various administrations across Europe in the 30s. It saw the mass intervetnion of both Stalins Russia and Mussoluni and Hitler. it saw international brigades raised across Europe to fight for one side or another and one found in Spain German communists, having come from exile in spain, fighting against the German condor legion. Thomas's is slightly weak on his exploration of the origin of the war, perhaps because he does not weight the sheer chaos that was taking place, in part this is due to hsi non-judgemental method of writing, and he should be praised, but one wonders, why he does not give a better detail of just how total chaos had gripped the countyrside in 1936. He seems to underestimate the red terror, but in the end he is quick to see that both Franco and the Communists wanted only dictatorship in the end, their was no good in the war, only bad, and the end could only be negative. A fascinating account about a fascinating topic.The military anlalysis is good as are the character descriptions, with a fast lucid style and standard British whit, the text is good for the historian or the laymen.Seth J. Frantzman"},{"Title":"The Spanish civil War","review":"This is one of those massive, serious books you mean to read (to impress yourself as much as learn what's in it). I have had it for years on my list, but never had the courage to crack it until recently. Happily, once I started it, I simply could not put it down, even though it took me months to read.The situation in Spain in 1936, when the civil war began, was dauntingly complex. On the right, there were the traditionalists, including monarchists, staunch catholics, industrialists, militarists seeking glory for Spain in Morocco, and various fascists and authoritarians opposed to the idea of a republic. They were divided into a multitude of parties, factions, charismatic leaders, and simple brutes. On the other side was a collection even more fractious of anarchists, communists, socialists, marxists, liberal democrats, atheists, and left-leaning regional liberation movements. Caught somewhere in the middle were separatists in the Basque regions and Catalonia - the only industrialized regions of Spain - and the emerging middle classes. This added up (perhaps) to more political parties than existed in Weimar Germany, along with Italy its coeval in poorly united nations that were seeking a clear identity in the 1920s.At this time, many of the old certainties were in precipitous decline due to local historical factors. First, after the Inquisition and in spite of the many flowerings that sprung from the counter-Reformations (e.g. the Jesuits), the Catholic church had grown rigid and in many quarters was murderously despised. It could offer no leadership and little comfort in the face of the upheavals that the republic was experiencing. Second, the monarchy was decadent and incompetent, a shell that had been in decline since the apogee of the 17th C. It too offered nothing to address the increasing chaos. Third, the military was involved in a terribly costly colonial war, for some ill-defined glory of Spain, and was corrupted by bizarre notions of duty and privilege, embittered by lack of opportunity, and ignorant of the evolving society by its isolation. The enlightenment, it seems, had never taken root in Spain, nor had the popular revolution as in France.The political configuration was similar to Weimar, a Parliamentary democracy that was unable to impose order or forge consensus, yet the country was for the most part appallingly poor and underdeveloped. As the world fell into economic crisis - Spain was prosperous during WWI as a supplier not fighting - the tensions of both class and generational conflict were added to the ideological crisis, provoking the left (mostly anarchists at the time) into mob violence that reached unimaginable excesses: churches were burned down, bourgeois were thrown off of cliffs, clerics murdered and raped, dignitaries and nuns were disinterred and mutilated, etc. This rightly evoked horror among the traditionalists as society appeared to be completely breaking down; they found champions in the military, including Franco, who was a hero general in Morocco, and quickly moved into a leadership position. Nonetheless, a dazzling array of social experiments were undertaken - money was abolished in some regions, collectives established that eliminated ruling elites and even managers, marriage was abolished in favor of free love and association, etc. It is a reminder that the narrow social-political spectrum that exists today - capitalist democracy - is only one way that societies might have chosen to organize themselves, an entirely different trajectory on which to evolve; this alone is worth the price of admission.In 1936 in the name of order and traditional values, the military staged a country-wide coup, taking over about 2/5 of the country. The opposition republicans occupied the N and E of the country, with all of the industry and most of the international legitimacy. This is when Spain became a crucible testing ground for the battle of ideologies that culminated in WW II as well as military technology. The fascist powers backed the military and Franco, providing aid and, crucially, highly trained personnel. Not only did they test military strategies, refining among many techniques the Blitzkrieg (piercing lines with concentrations of tanks rather than using them as supporting supplements to infantry), but their men were \\"blooded\\", i.e. trained in killing in ways that would be applied on an industrial scale from 1939. The USSR did the same, but also required the republicans to pay with Spanish gold. As a result, both the fascists and the communists became unifying centers of power within their respective spheres, muscling out other factions and applying brutal force against erstwhile allies. Meanwhile, Britain and France attempted to stay neutral and keep the other powers from interfering in a \\"domestic\\" matter. Finally, to complicate matters, everyone was sending volunteers to fight for their causes, often arriving without clear contractual limits and hence becoming virtual slaves to their respective military establishments. The IRA, for example, sent volunteers to both the fascists and anarcho-communists!The republic, in spite of its superior resources, was at a fatal disadvantage in their anarchic disarray before the unified command structures of the rightist military. As Thomas says, it cut like a knife through butter, with steady losses of territory before a final collapse in 1939. The brutal violence, arbitrary executions, ideological proscriptions, and simple murder are as frightening as they are unbelievable to those of us used to orderly lives based on rights and law. It is a reminder of the savagery that existed in places that we see today as orderly extensions of our cultures. Social experiments accelerated, on the left of course but also as patriarchal dictatorship on the right. Many participants acted like the war was just a day job: one combatant (a pilot and machine gunner) used to eat breakfast with his family, fight until lunch, take a siesta, fight again a bit in the afternoon, then retire the the cafes for late night conversation and drinking with his companions.I had read another of Thomas' books first, Rivers of Gold, which was a great disappointment, getting lost in detail with little narrative thread and seemingly meaningless asides. This book is so much better in narrative, focus, and evocation that there is absolutely no comparison. That being said, the book is encyclopaediac and simply too long, with so many references to obscure politicians that it is hard to follow and the names just fly out of the book. Indeed, the index (mostly proper names) is 100 pages! This makes it a slog, particularly at the beginning. But there is no doubt that this is the definitive masterpiece against which all subsequent histories will be judged. The principal failing of the book, in my reading, is that Thomas does not sum up and interpret the outcome of the war, which he leaves to the reader to find elsewhere. I expected more judgment or at least perspective.Recommended as one of the most serious explorations into the 20C. This conflict, along with that in the USSR and Hitler's Germany, is absolutely necessary to study if one wants to understand the world today. The greatest thing I take away from this is that our experimentation with politico-social systems is probably far from over, even if we Americans like to flatter ourselves that we have achieved the right combination of stability and dynamism that others should emulate."},{"Title":"The Spanish civil War","review":"If all that you know about the Spanish Civil War comes from the works of Papa Hemingway or Pablo Picasso, this well researched history is for you. Thomas' work is well researched and librally cited throughout. He reviewed the surviving documents for both sides and interviewed many of the surviving players including Germans and Russians involved in a War which was a training ground for the European Dictatorships in preparing for World War II.Thomas lays out the causes of the war in part one. He gives us a breif history of the various parties of the Left and Right and their grievances which lead to the revolt against the Spanish Republic and Franco's Right Wing Dictatorship which ruled Spain until the 1970's.His review of the campaigns and international intrigue make for a good review of the events for non Spaniards who may not be familiar with this bloody period of European History where tanks, terror bombing, and blitzkreig were used for the first time.His discussion of European diplomacy in the book shows all the major players including the Germans and the Russians looking for a way to leave Spain without losing face and without triggering another World War before anyone was ready. In the end World War 2 nearly started a few years early and would probably been a two front war at once.He looks without judgement at the atrochities committed by both sides Republican and Nationalists which were horrendous enough to make their Nazi and Stalinist Soviet advisors cringe.A very Good History of the Period Leading to World War 2."},{"Title":"The Spanish civil War","review":"Simply put, the best account there is of the Spanish Civil War, the bloodiest ideollogical conflict of the 20th century. Mr. Thomas' book is both unbiased and committed. Full of facts, few maps, no photographs (none that I remember), and spellbinding reading! Don't miss it!By the way, why do you rate some books with stars and others not? Just asking."},{"Title":"The Spanish civil War","review":"Hugh Thomas's book is a great source, but I found it a difficult read. If you need more information on various characters, this book is for you. If you want to get a greater understanding of the events and timeline, do NOT make this your first choice.He does an excellent job tracking the changing faces on the republican side, and the international diplomacy around the war. But political backstabbing and diplomatic skulduggery get tedious after a while. He discusses the more significant campaigns in passing, but almost as though this was just a backdrop for the politics and diplomacy. He covers the high points and low points of both sides' conduct, but can't keep out his pro-republican sentiments - and won't admit them, either. The republicans might round up political prisoners, and eventually execute a lot of them on trumped-up charges, but the nationalists engaged in ruthless repression, murdering their political enemies. I would say that he does try to explain to the secularist how much of a threat many Spaniards felt from the attack on the Church. He downplays many of the statements from the republican government on this issue, and he treats the Church in most of the discussions as merely another political party, so it doesn't go as far as it might. And a favorite of mine, he does go into some economic figures which are, at least in my opinion, critical in understanding many wars. He clearly demonstrates the tough times the nationalists were having with their command economy and the republicans with their hodgepodge of independent states and collectivist ventures.And there are then the quirks which I found made the book hard to read. He spells \\"jail\\" in the older English way -\\"gaol\\" - which, for an Englishman in the 1950's is understandable, but that takes a toll. He spells Hungarian names with umlauts, but not German ones, preferring the added -e. But then in footnots, the umlauts are there. Huh? He also uses some nearly-German grammar at times, with sentences like \\"on this day died Durrutti\\". He only roughly proceeds in chronological order, so one understands politics 8 months at a time, and then reads about two months of fighting, and then 14 months of diplomacy, and then the ninth month of politics. This makes for very difficult reading and understanding of the relationships between the events.And finally, the lack of insight. A reporter is someone who goes and find facts and relays them. Historians show the relationship of those events in the sequence of time to other events. He keeps saying that there is always the threat of war and various actions were made to avoid greater war, but never explains how/why wider war might have resulted -- just trust him. He clearly shows how the collectivist venture failed in Spain, but then dismisses it with a wave of the hand, because the war detracted from work. Well, did it or does collectivism fail everywhere? And how did the nationalists become 'fascists', and how did their economic policies differ from the republic's? It seemed like a golden opportunity to point out that fascism is a form of socialism, but he missed it. And that the nationalists are 'fascists' is a given, with no proof nor with any examples of decisions that ideology made them take.Overall, I'd have to say good reference, but poor reader. It really is more like a collection of newspaper clippings than like a history."},{"Title":"The Spanish civil War","review":"How can a book published such a long time ago be \\"revisionist?\\"Simply, because Hugh Thomas revised it, and in the process has made a much more complete and unbiased book. In its original form, it had a definite pro-Republican bias, but each succeeding edition corrects a number of detail and prejudices. I read it a very long time ago, and it was enthralling, and as a young student in Spain, I just gobbled up the details, which are still relevant for Spain today: I wish the current Spanish (Socialist) government could have such a balanced viewpoint on the subject. In fact, in this book neither of the sides is particularly more in the right than the other... for me the worst and most prejudiced book is Paul Preston's, which shows only one side of the story. Anthony Beevor's book is perhaps easier to digest, if you don't want to know EVERYTHING about this conflict.Just read the other reviews for the details; to sum it up, this book will help you to understand how the Civil War was a product of hundreds of years of Spanish history, and the relevancy of this conflict to more recent European and world history. In particular, this battle, and its healing by the years of the Transition here in Spain, are particularly relevant for Latin American countries which have emerged from dictatorship (an incomplete process, I fear), and even for Russia... I worked together with Gorbachov in the Madrid Conference on the Democratic Transition in Spain, and he takes an intense interest in the process.An engrossing book, requiring a bit of effort for the non-historian, but a classic which will continue to be read for years to come."},{"Title":"The Spanish civil War","review":"As the 70th Anniversary of the beginning of the Spanish Civil War is approaching this writer is reviewing some important works that militants should read in order to draw the lessons of the defeat of the Spanish revolution. The writer has been interested, as a pro-Republican partisan, in the Spanish Civil War since he was a teenager. What initially perked my interest, and remains of interest, is the passionate struggle of the Spanish working class to create its own political organization of society, its leadership of the struggle against Spanish fascism and the romance surrounding the entry of the International Brigades, particularly the American Abraham Lincoln Battalion of the 15th Brigade, into the struggle.Underlying my interests has always been a nagging question of how that struggle could have been won by the working class. The Spanish proletariat certainly was capable of both heroic action and the ability to create organizations that reflected its own class interests i.e. the worker militias and factory committees. Of all modern working class revolutions after the Russian revolution Spain showed the most promise of success. Bolshevik leader Leon Trotsky noted that the political class-consciousness of the Spanish proletariat was higher than that of the Russian proletariat in 1917. Yet it failed in Spain. Mr. Thomas' history of the period, if only indirectly, gives some answers to the reasons for that failure.When I say indirectly I mean just that. Mr. Thomas's history is strong on the main events, actions and points of the struggle. Militants, unfamiliar with the events of the Spanish Civil War can profitably use this history as a basic reader. However, if a militant is seeking to draw the lessons of the Spanish Civil War this book is not an adequate source and he or she must look elsewhere. Furthermore, Mr. Thomas makes no pretense to offer such a perspective and this writer would argue that he was hostile to any perspective but the view of high European, especially British, governmental politics. Fair enough. There is still plenty of basic information to be gleaned from this work.The Spanish Civil War of 1936-1939 has been the subject of innumerable works from every possible political and military perspective possible. A fair number of such treatises, especially from those responsible for the military and political policies on the Republican side, are merely alibis for the disastrous policies that led to defeat. Mr. Thomas' work analyzes those policies. Unfortunately, he is not sensitive to the base of society that actually fought, endured or fled the war. What Mr. Thomas does find is the furious nature of the struggle in Spanish society between the old agrarian- based economy and the newer capitalist- based economy; the religious tensions caused by the breakup of the old agrarian society and the tensions between believers and church-burners; the struggle between centralizers and federalists which formed the core of the unresolved national questions, especially in Catalonia; the intense political struggles within the broad sections that supported both left and right, especially the role of the Stalinist police apparatus; the international ideological political factors that played a role, if not as erroneously assumed the decisive factor; and, finally, the burning personal antagonisms that in a civil war pit brother against brother, family against family, town against town, etc.. With the caveat mentioned above-read on."},{"Title":"The Spanish civil War","review":"I think the two best choices for a book on the Spanish Civil War are Hugh Thomas' The Spanish Civil War, and Antony Beevor's The Battle for Spain. Thomas' book (this one) is extremely well written, and extremely informative. But it's 930 pages (in the Modern Library edition). Beevor's book is 432 pages (in the Penguin Books edition). I tried reading Beevor's book several times, but it didn't have what it takes to hold my interest. His paragraphs would quite often make me stop and think \\"What?\\" Now I'm well into Thomas' book, and it's still fascinating. But as the difference in size of the two indicates, you'll need to set aside a lot more time to finish Thomas' book. But if the size (and completeness) doesn't put you off, Thomas' book is an excellent history book. The writing is a pleasure to read (it flows smoothly and naturally), and Thomas' grasp and explication of his subject is among the best in histories I've read."},{"Title":"The Spanish civil War","review":"Hugh Thomas account of the Spanish Civil War is the most thorough version of the events written to date. His writing style makes the reader believe the entire account could be fiction. It is very easy to read and you hardly feel like you are reading history at all. The Spanish Civil War is one of the most devastating conflicts of the 20th century. It is the precursor to World War II and showcased as well as trained some of Germany, Italy and Russia's top talent. The sheer devastation of tactics involved bullied a civilian population and decimated a country. The rise of Francisco Franco and his victory over the communists was made possible by fascist intervention. The democracies of the world worked hard to try and effect a peace but they were unsuccessful against the determination of the fascists and the communists to prolong the conflict. This is a complicated conflict to understand but Hugh Thomas tries to simplify it as much as he can. This is the best start to understanding the Spanish Civil War and for those who want to understand how World War II began."},{"Title":"The Spanish civil War","review":"I picked up this book after readingThe Second Son: A Novel, by Jonathan Rabb which was set in the Spanish Civil War. My curiosity piqued, and as the subject is one of the many never mentioned in U.S. schools, I decided to learn something about it. My knowledge was pretty much limited to: comments my mother made about collecting trading cards during the 1930s with gruesome pictures from the Spanish Civil War; that Franco and the Nationalists beat the Republicans; and there were lots of communists running around somewhere.Let me tell you, this is one detailed, well-researched volume. From knowing essentially zero about this subject, I can now say that I know more than I'd ever hoped to know!Well-written in a clear and concise narrative. Thomas recounts events from the late 18th century, which led to the formation of the Republic, and the politics and events which directly led to both the Rebellion (by what became the Nationalists) and the subsequent Revolution within the Republic by Anarchists, Socialists and Communists.A very complex and highly confusing situation is rendered clear by author Thomas. Detailed assessments of not just the military struggle, but of all the parties involved on both sides, as well as those who tried NOT to become involved at all. Thanks to this book, I have a new understanding of just exactly what Anarchism is--and it's NOT simply chaos and lack of order, as the casual use of the word implies today. Details, too, on the Marxists, Communists, Liberals, Radicals, Revolutionaries, Socialists, POUM, PSUC, labor unions, Nationalists, Monarchists, Carlists, Falangists, Catalan separatists, Basques and more. The narrative documents as well, the involvement of the Russian, German and Italian governments; the \\"non\\" involvement of the French, UK, US and other governments; the role of \\"volunteers\\" in the Republican armies; naval matters; murders and reprisals; \\"terror\\"; and politics.Amply documented sources, many from first person accounts of events and some from interviews the author conducted himself. Giant bibliography, if you care to read more. Reasonably unbiased account of the events that transpired as well as reasonably unbiased characterizations of the participants in the tragedy that was the Spanish Civil War. I whizzed through this book quickly and it held my interest well. Not at all a boring tome.I give FIVE STARS to THE SPANISH CIVIL WAR by Hugh Thomas. Scholarly, yet eminently readable.

It not a painting that would find a home over a mantelpiece; it is painful to study, and conveys the horrors of war even more than the works of his fellow Spaniard, Goya. Hugh Thomas has written the definitive history of this gut-wrenching war, perhaps without the required \\"distance,\\" since Franco was still very much in power in 1961. But it is difficult to imagine that it will be superseded. As for capturing what Dali foresaw, his prose is more dispassionate, but he has done an admirable job: \\"Within a month nearly a hundred thousand people perished arbitrarily and without trial. Bishops would be torn to pieces and churches profaned. Educated Christians would spend their evenings murdering illiterate peasants and professional men of sensitivity. The majority of these crimes were the work, on both sides, of men convinced that what they were doing was not only right, but noble. Nevertheless these events inevitably caused such hatreds that, when some order was eventually established, it was an order geared solely for the rationalizations of hatred known as war. And it would be quite wrong to think that there was much repugnance at this development. Spaniards of all parties leapt into the war like the cheering, bellicose crowds in the capitals of the rest of Europe in 1914 at the start of that war of which, perhaps subconsciously even in 1936, the people of Spain felt they should have been a party.\\"Thomas has written a rich, dense, detailed account. He has clearly mastered his material, and his account is not for the casual reader. The first fifth of the book addresses the social and political causes of the war; Spain was a deeply divided society, with the power of the Church and the rich upper classes threatened by the rise of the labor and the anti-clerical forces. Throughout the book he balances the accounts of military action with the shifting political forces of the numerous factions involved. The maps included in the book are excellent references which detail the advance, and ultimate triumph of the nationalist forces.As we know now, Spain was a \\"dress-rehearsal,\\" for World War II. The Western Powers, mainly France, Britain and the United States adopted a policy of non-intervention. This was not matched by the Axis Powers, Italy and Germany, who used Spain as a training ground for its men, and a testing ground for their tactics and weapons. The Soviet Union was the chief supporter, in terms of aid, of the Republican forces. Leftists in the Western democracies volunteered, forming the International Brigades, with Americans in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. Membership in the later would be grounds for suspicion, or worse, during the McCarthy era. As Thomas notes, some observers say that the sole reason for a Nationalist victory was the support from Germany and Italy, but he gives a more judicious and balanced answer, identifying five critical periods, and concluding that it was mainly the timing of outside assistance. He also indicates that much of the reason for the outcome was the relative unity of those on the Nationalist side, and the disunity and conflict of those on the Republican side.A few reviewers criticize Thomas for not being \\"balanced\\"; specifically they feel he was too \\"pro-Republican.\\" It is a difficult charge to weigh, like saying various World War II histories were not balanced because they portrayed Hitler as evil. Franco very much had fascist tendencies, but did manage to keep Spain out of WW II. Thomas's \\"tribute\\" to him was to call him \\"the Octavius of Spain,\\" a reference to the Roman emperor who managed to survive the civil wars of Rome, when virtually all others did not.Today Spain is at peace. In terms of numbers, the impact of the civil war was more catastrophic than the American Civil War. Thomas estimates that 600,000 died, out of a population of 25,000,000, whereas the numbers in America were also roughly 600,000, out of a larger 32,000,000. The higher percentage dead and the greater proximity of time may be one of the reasons that 90% of the Spanish population opposed their country's participation in the Iraq war.The civil war reverberates in numerous other ways as well. Just in terms of language, the nationalist General, Mola, gave us the term, \\"a fifth column,\\" meaning a subversive group, when he talked about how he would seize Madrid - it was from those within. Only last week the NYT ran yet another article which seemed to confirm that Capa's famous picture, of a Republican soldier at the instant of death, was faked.I started the review with a painting, and will end with another, Pablo Picasso's \\"Guernica.\\" He painted it in honor of the civilians who died there, in the first deliberate aerial attack on a civilian population, with no military motive. It was a careful, controlled \\"experiment\\" by the Luftwaffe. The painting is at the United Nations, and when Colin Powell gave his speech advocating the invasion of Iraq, with the inevitable aerial bombardments, the painting was covered up, a not very subtle tactic to erase the lessons of Guernica from our memory.Hugh Thomas carefully describes the attack at Guernica, as well as the rest of the war, so the lessons cannot be covered up. His book is a wonderful historical account, and deserves 5 plus stars."},{"Title":"The Spanish civil War","review":"I am not an historian, and only read history as a defensive maneuver against remaining forever ignorant of history. For me, filling in the gaps I have about history is a continuing and a lifetime struggle. Thus, I prefer history that is succinct and in summary form, not as literary art, as this tome seems to be.What I had known about the Spanish Civil war was what I had gleaned from all of the pre-WW-II spies and noted journalists who all ran off to Spain to fight against Franco. This of course included the most famous of them Ernest Hemingway and the notorious trio of British spies: Philby, Burgess and McLean -- all of whom spoke eloquently about the importance of the Spanish Civil War and went there as volunteers to fight.This is a 1100 page book and one either has to have a love for good historical literature, or be committed to seeing the book through to the bitter end. Neither of these were my goals. I simply wanted to ferret out enough about the war to fill-in my own ignorance, since everyone \\"in the know\\" seemed to think the war was a pivotal event in pre-WW-II history. Thus, I only read books one and two, and skimmed the rest of the book.For my purposes, I found this book well written, but was like pulling teeth to get the \\"straight skinny\\" on the causes of the war and its larger implications.What I learned about the Spanish Civil War is this:It was the European battleground and rally point for the emerging and competing ideologies of the times: namely, between Fascism and Communism. But also it was the contact point for a collection of related sub-struggles that although, they were prevalent in most other Western societies, were particularly magnified and exaggerated in Spain. And here we mean the struggle between elite and rural society; between capitalism and barter-based agrarianism; between Catholics and Protestants (and non- believers); between the national unity parties and separatists and anarchists; and finally between left and right.And thus the war was a defining experience, not just for Spain but by palpable example, for most of the rest of Europe. Like a magnet, it drew Fascists and Communists into an arena where these palpable ideological tensions clashed and got played out first through the shed of Spanish blood, and then ultimately spilled over into the Second World War.At some point, I intend to go back and read the last two books, but for now, except for fully understanding what actually triggered the war, I think I have a good feel for what the war was about.Three Stars."},{"Title":"The Spanish civil War","review":"Hugh Thomas's THE SPANISH CIVIL WAR is probably the best account of this tragic episode in Spain's history, and this revised edition hopefully expands and corrects the original edition, published in 1961. The paperback edition should make this classic readily available at a reasonable price."},{"Title":"The Spanish civil War","review":"This book also details the most history on the topic, concentrated in one place. Although sometimes billed as a \\"heroic\\" tale of many various people rising to their occasions, a better description might be a very long TV drama about what the many important personages said to each other, how they treated each other, and when. Such a story with this level of detail clearly took massive research to complete. In fact, the amount of detail could be said to come close to that of Will Durant's typical history works.The Spanish Civil War, among other things was a terribly tangled affair, especially to a Spaniard living in a disputed area at that time. Most of the time Thomas clarifies who was for/against whom. His short glossary of organizations and acronyms at the beginning of the book is particularly helpful. Sometimes, though, he tangles the relationships more. One could attribute this to the book's historical approach. Thomas tells the history as it unfolds contemporaneously, often day by day. To those who have suffered through high school texts which take a historical thread at the expense of events happening at the same time in other places (this reviewer included!), the author was scrupulous about not skipping around in time. This is a fair approach, even if it can be confusing in itself. The reader will have to keep the \\"larger historical picture\\" in mind as the pages pass.Some maps, and some pictures would have been helpful to the book."},{"Title":"The Spanish civil War","review":"Hugh Thomas succeeds in presenting the complexity of the Spanish Civil War in a single tome. He has included the proper amount of background to the conflict to allow the reader to gain an in-depth understanding of this very miss-understood war. Thomas mixes the right amount of statistics and personality in this very readable comprehensive history. This is the yardstick against which other chronicles of the SCW should be measured."},{"Title":"The Spanish civil War","review":"Detailed and objective this is the touchstone of anyone who is serious about studying the Spanish Civil War. It has all the grit, politics and dark savagery of the conflict that was the precursor to WW II"},{"Title":"The Spanish civil War","review":"This is a very good book but at times it can be tough sledding with all the names and political acronyms. It is very effective on the political issues leading up to the civil war but a little less so on the actual battles. Many here are claiming a republican bias but I didn't see it. I felt he was very fair and gave good coverage to the Falange leaders and priests who were imprisoned or murdered without anything resembling a fair trial in republican spain. It does appear after reading this that the Italian army under Mussolini was always incompetent and that the German Condor legion could punch way above it's weight class and that Franco's victory had almost as much to do with the Germans and his loyal Moors than republican infighting and believe me this book covers endless republican infighting."},{"Title":"The Spanish civil War","review":"There's still no book like Hugh Thomas one to understand what-how and why was the Spanish Civil War, a real trainning just before II World War. Thomas has written it 50 years later from first Edition in 1961. During this time he has been searching for places,testimonials and facts to bring us this definitive revised issue."},{"Title":"The Spanish civil War","review":"For me this book was fantastic. I'm finishing up my undergraduate degree and this was the FIRST book I read (and one of the most cited so far) for my senior thesis. I am writing a 110-page research paper on the Spanish Civil War (in Spanish) that will dictate whether or not I graduate.This book is amazing - it gives you all the facts, background, everything you need to know to find out what happened from before the war during the wars of succession and into the military coups of Primo de Rivera.However, this book is not for the light of heart. It was intended as a major academic work, so it's not exactly a straight narrative that will sustain you on the beach.In sum, read this book if you're hungry for knowledge, but pick something with a more narrow focus if you're looking for a more gripping narrative."},{"Title":"The Spanish civil War","review":"I very much enjoyed reading Hugh Thomas' work. He does and excellent job of sorting out the many and varied groups on both the left and the right who struggled for power during this terrible conflict.In addition, I learned many things about the war that I never knew previously. For example, I was unaware as the extent of the persecution of the Roman Catholic Church in Spain during the war. Given that Spain is overwhelmingly Catholic I assumed the church passed thru the war relatively unscathed. How wrong I was.Mr. Thomas paints a factual yet horrifying picture of how the so-called \\"republicans\\" who were in fact mostly communists, burned churches, raped nuns and tortured and executed priests. There are accounts of Catholic faithful being forced to swallow rosary beads, thrown down mine shafts and gored to death by bulls in bull fighting rings.The most awful irony I learned was that the International Brigades, so glorified in the west, were responsible for many of the worst anti-Catholic atrocities. I was especially horrified to learn that these brigades titled themselves after such great men as George Washington and Abraham Lincoln.Wherever your political sensibilities lie you will very much enjoy reading Mr. Thomas' well researched and well written book."},{"Title":"The Spanish civil War","review":"excellent history book, a lot of details.

The result is a history that tells you what you want to know and what you need to know."},{"Title":"The Spanish civil War","review":"This book is a good classic, but analizes over all politics of tis terrible war, from the distance of a British scholar.We see: Spain, 1936, half a million Km 2, 26 million population. A big proportion of illiterates, some intellectuals and a an army whose dorsal spine is colonial, accustomed to a cruel war in North Africa against the moors. Social inequality is enormous. Communism and anarchism grows up easily in the four bigger cities, Madrid, Barcelona, Sevilla, Valencia, more industrialized. Republic is the legal government but it's unable to stop, fires, murders and disorders against Catholic Church and conservative people.In the dawn of the 12 July in Madrid, tension and hate explodes: captain Jose Castillo of Republican assault police is murdered by a falangist gunman. Immediately, his comrades kill Calvo Sotelo, main leader of the conservatives: the fire of Spanish Civil War is ignited.The Republican government has had the caution to separate geographically the most suspicious generals, but these, secretly have done during months his confabulation with encrypted messages. The rebel army of Africa has to pass the strait of Gibraltar, and they get that by the aid of Italian and German planes, Savoia S- 81, and Junkers Ju- 52. Yes, at first, German minister of foreign affairs denies interest in Spanish demands of rebels nationalists, but Hitler studies the conflict and orders directly aid to Franco together with Mussolini: operation Feuerzauber is on. Republic wants to buy modern weapons from democratic France and Great Britain, but these countries are afraid of Nazi Germany and also fear an communist Spain so, they denies armament to the Republic. Only Stalin envies tanks and aircraft, so during three years in Spain ha to be a confrontation between Italian and German tanks Carro Veloce 1'3, Panzer Pz Kpwz and Panzer I against Russian TB- 26B and BT- 5. In the air, Junker Ju 52, Heinkel He 11, Savoia s- 81, Fiat CR-32, Messerschmit BF 109B, Junker Ju 87 Stuka and Savoia Marchetti will figth against Potez 540, Dewoitine 370, Hispano- Nieuport 52, CASA- Beguet XIX, Polikarpov I-15 and I-16, Tupolev SB-2 and Polikarpov R-Z. Navy is almost all in Republican hands, but high officers are killed by crew as these are prone to the rebels, and simple soldiers are unable to govern ships and over all, the artillery.Division into the Republican side between anarchist, communist and another factions drive them to disaster, unable to build an united army. Instead, rebels or nationalists of Franco are hardened troops -\\"Legionarios\\"- accustomed if necessary to face close combat with knife or bayonet in the teeth against the Moors or Rife&ntilde;os of Morocco. The legacy of this war is truly unknown but is calculated between half or one million killed. Many, foreign idealists, some from the USA in the two sides."},{"Title":"The Spanish civil War","review":"It's been a while since i read such a poor work like this one.I had my hopes when i started reading this book.But as i read it,i realized the author doesnt care about the reader because he never explains anything.He never explains who's who, what's what.He just describes what he's seeing but without troubling himself with explaining the reader important facts necesarry to understand.His narrative is dull and,simply put it,boring.It makes you wonder if the author was being punished and writing this book was his punishment.I never really understood what was going on in Spain at that time,nor did the author made any effort to explain it to you.I had to stop reading it at page 198 and then i tossed the book.I realized that explaining the different situations and turmoils of the Spanish Civil war is difficult but Mr Thomas just makes it more confusing.Right now i am reading Anthony Beevor's Spanish Civil War and,altough i am just on page 54, the book is good and with good and simple explanations as to what really happen in that war.Dont even bother with Mr Thomas' book."},{"Title":"Lecume Des Jours","review":"This is not a review but good news for all of us who have failed to find this wonderful book in English.

The story itself is wonderful, but the way in which it is written is themain reason why this novel is one of the best I've ever read. And reread. Boris Vian is like a magician the way he puts words and sentences together and makes itall a brilliant work of art. It is a real &quot;language party&quot;. This book has been called &quot;one of the most beautiful contemporary love stories&quot;, but don't expect sappyromance. This is bizarre, it is surprising, it is totally different from any other &quot;love story&quot;, and above all: It is hillarious. A friend of mine tried to read a Norwegian version this book on atrain from Paris to Normandy, and she just had to put it down because of all the funny glances she got: she was laughing and choking constantly, tears runningdown her cheeks and mascara all over her face. It is so funny, you just can't stop laughing, even during the sad and rather grotesque scenes. The optimism ofColin in spite of successive tragic occurences in his life is just amazing. And the way Vian describes it is even more appalling. This book could be looked upon asa modern fairytale, a critisism of society, a love story; whatever you like.

And upon completing it, I was at loss for words. At loss for breath. I had changed into another person. To me, this book was a rite of passage. I knew that from this moment on, there was no need for me to read another book - ever.

As a surrealist, he was closely associated with writers such as Queneau and Bataille, but he also knew Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir. As the translator of Van Vogt, he played a major part in rekindling French interest in science-fiction. He achieved instant notoriety with the publication of &quot;J'Irai Cracher Sur Vos Tombes&quot; in 1947, a book which was confiscated by the police and which formed the basis of the much-maligned film &quot;I Spit on your Graves&quot;.Published in the same year, &quot;L'Ecume des Jours&quot; -- or as published in English, &quot;Froth on the Daydream&quot; -- marked the beginning of a radical departure in Vian's career. Superficially a love story exploring the hopes and foibles of untroubled youth, it manages to combine the fantastic, the grotesque and the poignant in a matchless blend. The result is a book which has survived the test of time so well that it seems even more appropriate now than when it was written.The opening scene shows Colin in his bathroom, carefully trimming his eyelids with a pair of nail-clippers. He lives in an ideal world where mechanical gadgets perform the mundane tasks and where all the best cooks swear by Freud (Clement rather than Sigmund). This utopian paradise is described with an endearing naivety, rendered all the more charming by the improbable characters who float through it, sometimes literally.Colin's friends, Chick and Lisa, are disciples of the philosopher Jean Pulse Heartre, whose lectures they attend with passionate zeal. When Colin meets a girl named Chloe and decides to marry her, he is so ecstatic that he gives away a quarter of his fortune to Chick and Lisa so that they may also get married. Chick, however, fritters away the doublezoons on copies of Jean Pulse Heartre's works, including &quot;A Bouquet of Belches&quot; bound in coarse-grained morocco and &quot;Choice Before Eructation&quot; printed on an unperforated toilet-roll.After Colin and Chloe's wedding, the dream begins to turn sour. Colin's favourite cook, Nicolas, grows surly and indolent. Chloe falls ill on her honeymoon and discovers a mutant water-lily expanding in her right lung. Chick spends the remainder of Colin's money on a pair of Jean Pulse Heartre's trousers and a pipe bearing the marks of his teeth. In anger and frustration, Colin slices off the head of an ice-rink attendant and kicks it into a ventilation shaft, suffocating most of the other skaters. The colours of the city start to fade and the landscapes become monotonous and bleak.When Chloe's illness becomes more serious, Colin is finally forced to seek employment to pay her medical bills. He finds a job in an armaments factory, growing rifle-barrels out of his vital organs while being buried in a mound of soft earth. Unfortunately, he is ill-qualified for the task and can only produce blunderbusses. As Colin and Chick sink deeper into poverty, Lisa runs amok with a heart-snatcher and kills the bookseller who provides Chick with Heartre's books and even the great philosopher himself (his heart is shaped like a tetrahedron). Chick dies at the hands of the police and Chloe ends up in a pauper's grave.Throughout &quot;Froth on the Daydream&quot;, Vian maintains an air of ingenuous implausibility, but the whimsy conceals a darker vein that leaves a slightly bitter aftertaste. His particular skill lies in rendering the totally absurd not merely acceptable but also somehow logical. This novel remains the best possible introduction to literary surrealism as well as one of the very best examples of the art."},{"Title":"Lecume Des Jours","review":"I read this book 15 years ago, it really changed my look to literature, to language to life.

Like the one that, at least some of us, have always wished to experience.The whole story has, unfortunatelly, a tragical end. But then, it wouldn't be one of the nicest books I have ever read. Only to express myself better through similarity, it is Jamiroquai's \\"Falling\\" that makes me think of Collin's falling in love with Chlo&eacute; - except that Collin's love is 'returned' - they both love each other dearly and very much.The whole story is divided in two parts - two worlds where love stays the same (even grows!) only the encompassing world undergo (terrible) changes. It's the careless world of Colin's and Chloe's love before they get married, full of warmness that only two suns may produce, and of the world after their wedding. The moment they say final yes at their wedding, Chloe gets ill and the whole preceding atmosphere suddenly changes from \\"happy\\" to \\"gloomy.\\" As I said, the love stays, even gets greater, but the whole story then leads to an inevitable tragical end...In Vian's own words it's a history that is \\"...entirely true as I made it up from the beginning to the very end.\\" [\\"...entierement vraie, puisque je l'ai imagin&eacute;e d'un bout a l'autre\\"] I would not quite say it is wholly made up although it's only my opinion. Yes, the story is a bit unreal, perhaps exaggerated, but I think it needs to be in order to let us feel and (hopefully) realize, that as 'panta rei' (as Time flows by) we should pauper our friendships and, when being loved and loving ourselves, then we should love sincerely and happily."},{"Title":"Lecume Des Jours","review":"Ce livre est un chef-d'oeuvre que l'on d&eacute;guste du d&eacute;but &agrave; la fin et que l'on appr&eacute;cie de plus en plus &agrave; chaque relecture.

Written like a surrealistic dream, readers that find hard to imagine alternate realities won't probably appreciate this work as much as those willing to go with the flow and submerge in the wave that Boris Vian throws to his public.Both couples face different challenges. The Colin/Chloe battle a terrible disease and Chick/Alise the horror of slow decay brought by dependence.Although the story in itself evolves on dramatic events, the pure genius and unbelievable sense of humour of Vian makes this book extremely funny (and certainly helped to inspire a lot of \\"non-sense\\" comedians sketches).

Considering its small size, reading this book was certainly rewarding. The author explains in a vivid and easy to understand style the problems that disturbed Einstein, the way he thought about them, the groundbreaking theories he put forward to explain them and their implications on our understanding of the universe. In my opinion, the most remarkable thing about this book is its vivid and easily grasped depiction of the working of Einstein's intellect; how he was deeply disturbed by inconsistent phenomena which people had taken for granted for hundreds of years and how he performed ingenious thought experiments to arrive at remarkable theories that seem to contradict our very common sense."},{"Title":"The universe and Dr. Einstein","review":"While some of the scientific results stated in this book have been overtaken by the advancement of knowledge, overall it still remains an excellent primer on Einstein's work. It begins with a history of physics as developed by Galileo and Newton and then describes in detail the famous Michelson-Morley experiment that eliminated the hypothesis that light travels through \\"the ether.\\"This crisis in the fundamental structure of physics was resolved when Albert Einstein developed his theories of relativity. The combination of the special and general theories of relativity is a refinement of Newtonian physics that explained most of the special case anomalies that the physics of Newton could not.Using clear and understandable language, Barnett explains these theories without sounding patronizing or sacrificing broad detail. Some of the basics of quantum mechanics and the cosmological ideas of the big bang and a closed, expanding universe are also mentioned."},{"Title":"The universe and Dr. Einstein","review":"This book has a foreward by Albert Einstein himself and was created to express in simple terms what his theories were about.

Noble\\"The Universe and Dr. Einstein,\\" by Lincoln Barnett is a great book. I've enjoyed it immensely. I've now read it twice. It has an introduction by Albert Einstein verifying its credibility to the \\"lay\\" reader.Well, from one lay reader to another, I have two criticisms: One is Mister Barnett's conclusion with regards to the existence of a God: and the second has to do with a reference on page 24 to Quantum physics and \\"freewill.\\"On page 24 Mister Barnett states that because of a Mr. Heisenberg's \\"Principle of Uncertainty\\" brought forward in 1927 which hypothetically states the impossibility of determining both the position of an electron and it's velocity at the same time, man may honestly and truly be possessive of a free, undetermined will.If this seems to you to be a rather drastic jump in logic and common sense, I'm with you. What the possible randomness or even factuality of an electron's position or predictable course, has to do with Man's freewill, I'm at a loss to figure out.Mister Barnett goes on to express that the nature of probability in Quantum physics brings into question the notion of Causality and Determinism. I interpret this to mean that because the human race is at the moment unable to technically determine or predict the actual position or future direction of a particular electron, simultaneously, the Universe may truly be without direction, randomly established, and of an unpredictable indeterminable cause.I would presume that in pointing out this Heisenberg principle, Mr. Barnett would be challenging the existence of a God. This is not the case. In the conclusion Mr. Barnett uses the third law of thermodynamics, the Hubble notion of an expanding and eventually destructive universe, and Einstein's notion of the non-existence of space (an aether) as a proof of the existence of a God.So, Mr. Barnett establishes Man's freewill with the Heisenberg principle of uncertainty, and God existence via the third law of thermodynamics, Hubble's expanding and self-destructive universe, and Albert Einstein's theory of relativity. And supposedly Albert Einstein, himself, has read this book and agrees with it. Wow! I'm at a loss for words. Where do I begin?First of all, I don't think that you can have it both ways. You can't on the one hand claim that the Universe is without cause, undirected and unpredictable and that therefore man is in charge of his own destiny and totally free; and on the other hand claim that because the Universe is on an inevitable path to its own destruction, that this destruction implies a Creation and the inevitable existence of an all knowing, (non) deterministic God. How can God be in control of the Universe and not in control of Man?Freewill is an argument that has two directions. The Philosophical argument has always been with the nature of God and His relationship with Man. How can Man be free in relation to an Omniscient, Omnipotent, and all knowing God? If, as the religious and theological philosophers contend, God must of necessity be \\"actual\\" and not \\"potential,\\" how could He have then created man, with all knowledge of man, and then not in some way be responsible for Man's actions or for Man in general?The argument is, if there is a God, as defined above, then - Man of necessity must be determined. Man may have the ability to make choices, but whatever his choices, God \\"knew\\" or must know the results.The second argument with regards to man's freewill deals with his physiological and psychological makeup. Man as we now know has a genetic code (DNA). His physical structure and individual design is pre-programmed to a degree by this genetic code. It is so accurately programmed that we are now experimenting with the notion of \\"cloning\\" exact replicas of ourselves. Regardless of this new discovery, the very fact that a man is a man, or a particular thing, as opposed to \\"any\\" thing is determination enough to substantiate the notion that man is not self determining, or totally free. Because Man's choices may be indeterminant or even infinite it does not follow that Man is totally free or even possessive of \\"freewill.\\" Because a monkey is provided an infinite variety of bananas to choose from, it can not then be concluded that the monkey is possessive of \\"free\\" will or even that he is possessive of a will to choose freely. Man is limited by the fact that he is \\"a\\" man.Psychologically man is as much a formation of his learned \\"environment\\" as he is the product of his genetic code. Man is limited by what he is genetically, and also limited by what is made available to him environmentally. So man is \\"determined\\" and limited in terms of his genetic makeup and his environment. In this respect man is not possessive of a total freewill even if there is no God. God or no God man is not \\"free,\\" nor is he in possession of a \\"free\\" will.So, what does Heisenberg's indeterminate, unpredictable electron have to do with Man's freewill? How does an unpredictable electron suppose an undetermined individual man?What does Heisenberg's unpredictable electron have to do with the theory of causation?The implication seems to be that if Man can not predict the course or position of a particular electron then nothing is predictable, or he can make no predictions about anything? And therefore, since everything is unpredictable man himself is therefore totally undetermined and consequently without limits in his ability to choose - and therefore possessive of \\"freewill.\\"Does the unpredictable path of an electron have any bearing whatsoever on the atom that it is involved with? Does the course that this electron eventually chooses, have any bearing on the structure or known and predictable properties of the atom it is involved with? Does this electron's position or direction make for any changes in the atom involved? Does this electron's unpredictableness have any relationship to this particular atom's other myriad of relationships?If this electron jigs left as opposed to right is an atom of gold changed to an atom of silver? If nothing of any consequence is changed, then for all practical purposes couldn't Heisenberg's Principle of Uncertainty be placed right along side the \\"aether\\" as in Einstein's theory - in other words, of no consequence?David Hume supposedly dealt with the principle of causation a few centuries ago. But without even reading David, I am sure that he did not make the notion of causation untenable. He may have destroyed the notion of establishing an efficient cause or a primary cause, but not the notion of \\"causes.\\" Without the notion of causes, even if they be varied and multiple and difficult to pinpoint, we could establish no theories and certainly no principles or facts of nature.Without causes and our ability to determine them, we have no knowledge, nor do we have the hope of ever having any. All science and all of our accumulated theories and knowledge are dependent on our ability to determine events by studying causes. Without this little trick our search for knowledge is condemned to perpetual ignorance, and all that we now claim to be knowledge is unfounded.How does Heisenberg's theory question the foundation of causes? Isn't Mr. Barnett in fact using Heisenberg's theory of Uncertainty as a \\"cause\\" in establishing his theory with regards to Man's freewill? If the theory of causation has been challenged or compromised by Heisenberg's Principle of Uncertainty then how can Mr. Barnett establish Mr. Heisenberg's Principle as a \\"cause\\" in his establishment of his own theory of Man's freewill?What has this electron got to do with one's belief or non belief in the existence of God?A believer in God, Mr. Berkeley, for example, would simply say that whatever choice this electron makes, you can be sure that God knows about it. There is also the theological notion of spontaneous creation. This notion explains the Universe as God's work in progress. God, in effect, recreates the universe moment by moment, instant upon instant - thus not only accounting for \\"change\\" but miracles also.On the other hand from the non-believer viewpoint; is predictability of the habits or idiosyncrasies of Mother Nature a proof that the Universe has a Creator, or merely an observation that the Universe is, at present, conforming to certain predictable physical phenomenon? If certain physical phenomena are permanent, unchangeable, repeatable and infinite, would this imply anything more than the fact that these phenomena are permanent, unchangeable, repeatable and infinite. And if the reverse were the case would the conclusion be any different? To point to something that \\"is\\" and say that it \\"is\\" only because of something that isn't, is not reasonable. God is being viewed in this case as an unconfirmed suspicion or an illogical impossibility.In conclusion, with relation to God, Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle changes nothing. The unpredictable Heisenberg electron neither verifies nor disproves the existence of God.With regards to causation and determinism the philosophical arguments still remain as they have always been. There are causes. Determinism is still a philosophical and theological paradox - inevitable when combined with the existence of an Omnipotent God.Freewill is not a paradox. It is confusion in terms. There is no \\"freewill\\" as such, but this does not negate man's ability to make choices or to make selections between what is perceived as either good or evil. The case for Man's genetic determinism and his psychological and environmental determinism in this regard certainly cannot be dismissed for the convenience of society and/or religion - civil or Divine Justice. The Cosmology of the Universe remains indeterminate with or without Heisenberg's wayward electron.Note: This is only one third of my complete critical review of this book.

The key chapter 4, for example, try to explain tunnel concept left and right, but it mixed the general encapsulation and tunnel, and the verbose wording didn't make it any clear. Using tcpdump trace to explain some of the field is both a blessing and curse, depending on how you look at it - I think the book is sort of strong in specific details but weak in overall conceptual pictures - however most of those details have been better documented in the RFCs.Another example - when talking about generic tunnel skeleton using FreeBSD as example (ch 4.8), where some code snippets are presented, I feel some background and detailed illustration of flow/drawing is necessary to clear up the concept and why it correlates prevoius sections, but none given.It may sound a bit harsh: though the author try to emulate Rich Steven's style and dedicate the book to him, but it is hard for me to say the end product can really live up to Steven's standard."},{"Title":"Vpns Illustrated","review":"VPNs Illustrated is a great book for those wishing to understand network traffic at the packet level. Author Jon C. Snader was inspired by the earlier TCP/IP Illustrated volumes, and tries to reproduce the Tcpdump-style material found in Stevens' classics. The level of detail found in VPNs Illustrated easily outweighs any problems this book might suffer, so I recommend you read it for in-depth knowledge of VPN traffic.The book is divided into three parts. Of these, I found Part I (\\"Background\\") to be of questionable value. The introduction (ch 1) should not have been a chapter, and ch 2 (\\"TCP/IP Overview\\") should be replaced by a reference to existing volumes on TCP/IP. The crypto overview (ch 3) could also be replaced by a reference to other books, although as a non-crypto guy I found it a helpful refresher. The last chapter in part 1 finally gets to more subject-specific information, covering PPP, IP-in-IP, PPPoE, GRE, PPTP, L2TP, and MPLS tunnels. I really liked reading the author's criticisms of certain protocols like PPTP and L2TP. He should have included Tcpdump traces of MPLS, since the other protocols featured packet data.Part II included chapters on VPNs (ch 5), SSL (ch 6), SSH (ch 7), and \\"lightweight\\" VPNs (ch 8) like VTun, CIPE, Tinc, and OpenVPN. Some of this material is very deep and probably unnecessary for most readers. The author explains messages exchanged by almost all of these protocols, which is information I've not seen elsewhere. Some may consider these descriptions obscure, while others (probably researchers and developers) will appreciate the analysis.Part III covers IPSec. Ch 9 (\\"IPSec\\") should be part of ch 10 (\\"IPSec Architecture\\"). The remaining sections thoroughly address IPSec (11: AH; 12: ESP; 13: IKE; 14: the future of IPSec). I think chapters 10-13 are the best IPSec material I've read. They made more sense than others I've seen, although the complexity of IKE made ch 14 difficult to follow.Throughout VPNs Illustrated, the author is not shy about sharing criticisms of various protocols. This is extremely valuable. He also repeats sound advice on practices to avoid (like static preshared keys) or measures to consider (defeating replay attacks). Because he illustrates so many protocols, he compares and contrasts them to emphasize key points. He also frequently cites authoritative sources like Schneier and Ferguson.To achieve a fifth star in a second edition, I would like to see the author incorporate my previous suggestions. I would love to see configuration files for all of his examples in the appendices. He can move existing examples out of the main text to improve readability. Every protocol should have a corresponding network trace analysis, and the traces should be posted on a Web site. I would also like to see a summary of his thoughts on what makes a great VPN protocol, and then his ratings for various implementations.You won't necessarily be able to implement the VPN software discussed in VPNs Illustrated by simply reading the text. You will gain a great understanding of how they work, or sometimes, don't work!"},{"Title":"Vpns Illustrated","review":"NOTE: This book is not for everyone, if you have not invested at least 40 hours looking at network traffic, I would recommend you pass.This book is zero fluff, it makes you want to spin up your scratch boxes and follow along. In fact I did just that, I have to switch to a new ISP that requires PPoE and I was always curious how that worked, the book gave me just enough of a clue to interpret what was passing in and out of my house.The world has a new grandmaster of tcpdump and I have seem some pretty good ones over the years. Once I designed a T-shirt for a SANS conference with the hexadecimal output from a tcpdump; only we flipped it so it was running down the shirt and rendered in green, to resemble the matrix.The packet was a DNS reply. In the additional records we said good things about SANS; after all, gotta market to eat. There was an error intentionally placed into the shirt and we designated a prize for the first attendee to find the error. A student walked by wearing the shirt and the \\"4500\\" in the hex field caught one of the instructor's eye. She followed him around murmuring, it is sideways, UDP, DNS, a reply, there are additional records, wait a minute that pointer entry is wrong. We watched in amazement, when she was done and looked up, the entire SANS faculty bowed to her. Because a mal-formatted packet can kill a packet analyzer the world needs people like Judy and Jon.This is not a beginner book and Jon expects you to catch the 4500 stuff pretty fast. However, if you have followed the discipline of tcpdump instead of some packet analysis tool that spells out everything this book can take you to the next level.VPNs Illustrated is rich in diagrams, including packet headers and state diagrams, examples of network traffic, and cartoons that explain the architecture of the system, or network. It is amazingly well edited, my only nit is on page 93, line 1 spacing off by one character.The book has a strong linux bias, if you are a Windows person, you will be able to follow along for about 60% of the book using Windump, but you will not be able to use the tools or source.This is the perfect reference for the person that knows networking and wants to really invest in taking it to the next level.Finally, the dedication to Rich Stevens was over the top and heartfelt appreciated. I will never forget the man who taught me how to read a packet."},{"Title":"Vpns Illustrated","review":"Authors put everything into an easy way to understand and every details of VPNs explained.

Just what I wanted"},{"Title":"Vpns Illustrated","review":"Given the complexity of VPN I was hoping to find a book that could explain key technologies in a concise and an organized manner. \\"VPNs Illustrated\\" does contain a wealth of technical information, but it failed on both counts.The book offers unnecessary detail when trying to explain key concepts. It is so disjointed that the author is reduced to constantly referring the reader to other chapters to find information that is needed to understand a specific topic area. For example, the critical topic of IPSec is first introduced during a discussion of L2TP.The book contains factual errors such as a typo describing \\"OC4\\" when the author meant to say OC48.Overall, I was very disappointed with this text. It needs to be proofread and completely reorganized."},{"Title":"Columbus vignettes II","review":"I bought my copy of Kenneth Young's 'Rhodesia and Independence,' brand new, soon after its publication in 1967 and the price was '42s[hillings]' (2.10). Out of curiosity, I looked recently for a copy in nice condition (as mine still is) and the price was 30.00. Also out of curiosity, I tried to work out what 30.00 would be in Zimbabwe (the former Rhodesia) and it wasn't easy, but the nearest I could find was approximately Z$7,436,000,000,000,000. So, both the UK and the former Rhodesia seem to have suffered inflation, the latter rather more than the former.Of course, I read the book when I bought it and have dipped into it several times since. I have re-read it in full in the last week or so and all I can say is that it is not only an excellent summary of Rhodesia's history from the days of Cecil Rhodes himself, but also a superb survey of the events leading up to and surrounding Rhodesia's unilateral declaration of independence (UDI) from what was then still seen as 'the mother country,' the former colonial power that was Great Britain.And in his survey of those events - a revelation then to most of us, for many of the ins and outs were kept secret by successive British governments - Young reveals the proof of what many suspected up to and following UDI, namely, the double-dealing and duplicity of those successive British governments. Neither the Conservatives under that old fraud Macmillan or the straighter Sir Alec Douglas-Home nor 'old' Labour under the extremely slippery Harold Wilson come out well, either in the book or in retrospect and, in observing present-day Zimbabwe, it is difficult to conclude other than Great Britain was governed by ignorant and bigoted fools. Of course, some will say that Rhodesia was also governed then by ignorant and bigoted fools, but the proof of the former being true and the latter being inaccurate to say the least is contained, chapter and verse, in Kenneth Young's still-authoritative book.It is sometimes amusing and sometimes educative to read history in the making from the perspective of, say, forty-two years ago. This stuff is far from amusing and represents historical education at its best, especially for those who have little understanding of why Rhodesia (sorry, Zimbabwe) became an internationally-recognised wreck. The Rhodesian Prime Minister, Ian Smith, had his faults, of that there is little doubt, but his faults were minor and trivial set beside the monstrous errors made by British people - people who called endlessly for 'one man one vote,' whereas what happened, as in many other 'independent' African countries, was government by the one vote of one man. In poor Zimbabwe's case, the one vote is that of Comrade Robert Gabriel Mugabe.Mr Young's work represents a dispiriting view from the distant past, but I recommend it whole-heartedly - even at 30.00!"},{"Title":"Drama of the English Renaissance: Volume 2, The Stuart Period","review":"This volume (w/ its companion) covers the other people who were writing plays at the time of Shakespeare. And there are at least two things to be said about that: 1) even if Shakespeare had never been born, this period probably still represents the most vibrant, remarkable body of writing for the stage the English language has ever produced; 2) the fact that Shakespeare was born means that these wonderful plays go mostly unread. (If you've seen &quot;Shakespeare in Love,&quot; you get a sense of the vitality of &quot;the scene.&quot;) This is Great Stuff! From the lyric power of Marlowe's verse, to the learned wit of Jonson's comedy and the purgative bloodletting of Webster and Tourneur, an entire world of theater is put before you in these volumes, a cosmos beyond the Globe. These authors are not interesting merely as context: there are examples in here of people doing things Shakespeare couldn't do. And even if you come away thinking the Bard was still the best of the lot, you'll have a rich appreciation of just what an accomplishment that is."},{"Title":"The Saudi Arabian Economy: Policies, Achievements, and Challenges","review":"Thoroughly enjoyable and easy flowing reading even for a layman ..

This is a must-read for any person desiring to learn about Saudi economy."},{"Title":"The Saudi Arabian Economy: Policies, Achievements, and Challenges","review":"This is the first book of its kind I know of: nobody has ever dealt with this subject at such length before.But there are some good reasons for this:1. Did somebody say \\"royal family\\"? A discussion of the Saudi economy MUST begin with the royal family. That is the basic equation of the Saudi economy, from which everything else is derived: how much money do they take off the top of the oil earnings, and how much is spent elsewhere?In saying this, I don't mean to criticize the royal family: they've done a lot for Saudi Arabia (building roads, schools, hospitals, etc.), but the plain fact is they take a cut. How much? What happens to the money? How much is left over for discretionary spending and infrastructure development? Entitlement programs?Yet oddly, the ROYAL FAMILY ISN'T MENTIONED IN THIS BOOK! Check the index. I wonder why? Could it be because Mr. Ramady is a professor of economics at King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals in Dhahran, and that if he specified how much the royal family was taking, he would be quickly arrested?If he were based in London, this book would have a lot more credibility. But if the man is being permitted to be walking around free inside Saudi Arabia, that can only be because he's whitewashed or ignored the situation.As it is, this book is useless. Not, of course, being able to talk openly (or even knowingly) about the elephant in the room, the royal family's finances (which are, after all, the font and regulator of the country's economy), Ramady simply snows the reader with a swamp of questionable statistics. This is like discussing the U.S. economy without being allowed to mention the tax rate or the federal budget!How much money the royal family takes and how much is left for other purposes is the foundation of everything else in the Saudi economy: how can one possibly write a book and fail to mention these figures?2. ALERT: statistics in Arab countries, especially Gulf countries with oil-predicated economies, are usually fake and cannot be trusted. It's not like the West, folks, where you could hop on a .gov website and find out how much the Prime Minister earns or how much Congress allocated for this or that-and basically trust what you're reading.No, they don't believe in transparency and accountability the way we do. I have met many, many people in the Arab world whose jobs consist, basically, of manufacturing statistics. The higher-ups tell their myrmidons what they want the statistics to be, and those numbers are made to happen.There ain't no \\"Freedom of Information\\" act or accountability or anything like that in Saudi Arabia. You simply can't trust the statistics spewed out by any business or by the government.Yet here is a man who has collected a load of statistics and developed a book from them. Given the unknowable and unverifiable nature of such figures, what could such a book possibly be worth?3. Cultural differences.Mr. Ramady, you're not fooling me. Although your book has a lot of slick graphs and charts, it's so dry and clinical that it's useless.What I'm saying is that the author studiously avoids cultural explanations, instead simply giving a deluge of numbers, implying they're completely analogous with similar numbers applied to Western economies.Take, for example, unemployment. The level of unemployment in the Saudi economy is certainly sky-high, but whenever you see a figure cited, it really ought to be accompanied by a gigantic asterisk.This is because Saudi unemployment is not like unemployment anywhere else in the world. Young Saudis don't want to work their way up the ladder: they all want to START OFF as managers.This is their idea of the perfect job: they stroll in about 10 a.m., grab a cup of qahwa, kick their sandals off, and begin leafing through Al-Wattan. Every business, in their dream world, will have, say, 98% managers and 2% Bangladeshi workers who do all the real work.There are plenty of jobs in Saudi Arabia. But, owing to reasons of Arabic pride (or perhaps because they're not yet desperate enough), the youth of the country will not deign to take them.So what do you mean -- what does anybody mean -- when you give an unemployment figure in this country? Unaccompanied by any cultural explanation, what meaning could it possibly have? That this is the percent of young people who truly could not find jobs? That this is the percent of young people who could not find jobs as vice presidents directly out of high school? Or something in the middle?Yet such frank cultural discussions are totally absent from this book: it's all a bunch of graphs and charts based on highly suspect or unrepeatable data.4. Er, also: is it just me, or look at the other reviews of this book as of the date of my writing: they have all been written by people with common Arabic names, they all give the book 5 stars, they were all written within a couple of days of one another, they all basically read the same, they all have nearly the same length, and none of the reviewers has reviewed any other Amazon products.I would not put it beyond this \\"professor\\" -- or somebody involved with this book -- to have gotten on Amazon, quickly registered a bunch of dummy accounts, and reviewed his own book...I've seen a lot of useless books come out of Saudi Arabia, but this one certainly takes the cake."},{"Title":"The Saudi Arabian Economy: Policies, Achievements, and Challenges","review":"As an expat living in the kingdom and a student at KFUPM this title was of great use to me due to the fact that I'm a finance major. What Dr.Ramady has done in this one of a kind text is combine his extensive industry experience here in the kingdom and his dedicated research about Saudi Arabia in a flowing, eloquent text covering every major issue and aspect of the country's economy. A great tool for researchers & students indeed with an excellent bibliography showing you just how far and wide the author went in order to acquire the various data & statistics that are needed for such a comprehensive study of any countries economy.The author shows a deep understanding & appreciation of the kingdom's culture and people. Having said that, he has not refrained from criticism. The kingdom like any other economy is faced with many problems and it is here that the author's experience & research really shine through as he takes an in depth look at what the problem is, why it's occurring, what will follow in the future all while remaining non-confrontational to prevent antagonizing anyone and perhaps positively affecting the people of the kingdom and the people who wish to understand its economy.The book has greatly benefited my own research in Saudi foreign trade. After conducting a substantial search for material on the kingdom's export sector it was quickly apparent to me that there was a lack of meaningful qualitative data based on the various trade statistics available. 'The Saudi Arabian Economy' solved many of my problems. Interesting information such as Lebanon's role as a trans-shipment center for Saudi goods & specifically a table listing top Saudi exporters came in handy during the selection of companies for a questionnaire that I was preparing on the development of the Saudi export market all show that the book has not missed a single thing."},{"Title":"The Saudi Arabian Economy: Policies, Achievements, and Challenges","review":"Professor Ramady has done an excellent job researching and presenting the inherently interesting subject of the Saudi Arabian economy!I am an American working in Saudi Arabia who has a degree in Economics. Saudi Arabia provides a terrific case study in Economics with so many wonderfully unique issues - such as the petroleum-driven economy, efforts to diversify to non-petroleum industries, Saudi banking and the move to Shariah (Islamic) financing, the evolution of the Gulf's largest stock market, and Saudization of the work force.Beyond the meticulously researched and footnoted text, Prof. Ramady provides useful analysis of the published data, and also keen and accurate insights \\"beyond the numbers\\" based on his intimate knowledge of the subject matter and his qualitative research. For instance, many of the readers may not be aware that Dr. Ramady is quoted in the national press as an expert on the Saudi economy and stock market, whenever the newspapers want thoughtful analysis of the implications of the day's events here.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to study more about the socio-economic aspects of KSA or who loves Economics and desires to explore some terrific applications of economic theory."},{"Title":"The Saudi Arabian Economy: Policies, Achievements, and Challenges","review":"Form a first glance on this great book, you would find various virgin subjects that haven't been handled by any researcher' review or book on the economy of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.As a proud Saudi researcher and worker in the Saudi Islamic finance sector, I have found many subjects that were extremely important in any research topic concerning the economy of Saudi Arabia. Among the important subjects that have been handled by this book:1. Women in Saudi Arabia:Dr. Ramady handles this virgin topic by pointing out women's roles in the Saudi economy and especially the workforce, by looking their existing and future roles in the workforce.2. The Saudi mining sector:This sector is considered as a reserve asset to the kingdom. Dr. Ramady studies the distribution of the oil and mining sector among the regions of the kingdom, hence the need for specialization in each sector. Saudi Arabia, as Dr. Ramady describes, has a large oil-rich area in the eastern province along with a specialized region in oil related maters. On the other side, the kingdom has a mineral-rich region in the west with a specialized region that could handle such a resource.3. The national debt:This book handles the national debt bill by analyzing the Saudi budget and the growing expenses which holds back the ability to handle the national debt quickly. The kingdom has a growing wage bill, subsidy bill and interest bill that should be handled by the government.4. Privatization:The book explains in detail the different forms of government privatization such as BOT and BOO. The book then explains the steps taken in privatizing the Saudi Telecom Company. The book then handles potential privatization opportunities in the gas sector. The book also mentions the impediments in privatizing the electricity sector by comparing such experiences in other countries.5. Globalization:The book also handles the issue of globalization and joining the World Trade Organization, which is scheduled to happen by the end of this year. The book discusses impacts of such an event on Saudi producers and consumers in both the short and long term.This book is considered to be, to me and many other researchers who are interested in the economy of Saudi Arabia, a guidebook and a path in studying this country's economy by pointing out the important issues that control this country's economy."},{"Title":"The Saudi Arabian Economy: Policies, Achievements, and Challenges","review":"This book has provided a new angle from which people can look at the Saudi Economy. The country has been a major player in the world's economy ever since the discovery of oil. There have been several books in the past about this mysterious economy, but they have been from people living outside the Kingdom. Dr. Ramady's view is the first of its kind in a very long time to come out of the Kingdom itself.He has used his experience and vast knowledge of the country and it's people to give us a complete view on what Saudi Arabia has accomplished, is currently focusing on, and what challenges lie ahead.The best thing about this book is that it not only points out the fundamental weaknesses in the economy, but it also talks about the ramifications, and the way forward. It gives a bird's eye view of the Economy, which allows the reader to make sense of the Saudi policies.As a student, the book allowed me to obtain much needed data and information about the Saudi Economy and put things into perspective. Although everyone knows the importance and the Kingdom's reliance on the Hydrocarbons industry, the book points to other growing parts of the economy as well.The author has an unbiased view on the economy, as he praises the strengths of the Economy, and criticizes the lack of attention being put on the problems.The sections on 'The Financial Markets' and 'Key Challenges' are extremely interesting. The first part is made interesting due to the fact that author has spent over ten years in the Saudi banking sector. For instance, he has brought to light some previously un-talked about issues such as shareholder concentrations in Saudi Banks. The latter part regarding the Key challenges talks about issues that are extremely important for the future success of Saudi Arabia.The incredible wealth of facts and figures in mentioned in this book point towards an impressive effort. This book should not only be read by the Saudi public and those who are looking for a better understanding of the Saudi Economy, but also by the Policy makers of Saudi Arabia themselves."},{"Title":"The Saudi Arabian Economy: Policies, Achievements, and Challenges","review":"It is pleasing to see that the book has attracted good reviews from readers and researchers, who have not been afraid to indicate their ethnicity unlike Gnoose review.. This person either has not read the book well or is another embittered expatriate who has an axe to grind against the Kingdom , given his s0- called knowledge about Saudis' coffee and working habits .. This is a serious book that addresses key problems, maybe not in the confrontational style that Gnoose or others wish for. For example1. Unemployment - If Gnoose had bothered to read , the Author brings this up and points out that the level of unemployment might reach a staggering level of nearly 48% - for males only - by 2013 , if no serious attempt at structural economic changes takes place .2.Cultural issues and work habits - this is explored in depth as being one key constraint in the Saudisation policies, and the Author also examines in detail the impediments faced by women in Saudi Arabia, ..3.The good Professor also examines in depth the failings of the Offset program - something which other , Western researchers have not picked up on, and this is certainly not the hallmark of a Professor who is afraid to speak up his mind ..4.Did the previous reviewer read the sections on the treatment of foreign workers and their contribution to the building up of the Saudi Economy ? This is social and cultural issues , I believe , unless I totally misunderstood the concept..Finally the Royals are mentioned - revisit the index and see CP Abdullah's name and more important , READ the section on the workings of a RENTIER economy which illustrates the drawback of this system of income distribution ..Ofcourse, the book might not be everyone's cup of tea, especially for those with predisposed prejudices and notions about the region ,and Saudi Arabia in particular. That there is a lot that needs to be done in the Kingdom is undoubted - but to gripe about the Royal Family and ignore other changes and the nuances of the workings of the Saudi system is to miss on the changes going on today .. So many times others, outside the region ,have been blinded on these finer points - just look at the mess in Iraq and the previous advice of the so called experts in our Western world. Whatever its shortcomings , this is a valuable and serious piece of work on Saudi Arabia.. Ofcourse those who cannot stomach data and statistics can always read novels such as \\" Under the Veil. or Beneath the Veil or In front of the Veil \\" etc to reinforce stereotypes.."},{"Title":"The Saudi Arabian Economy: Policies, Achievements, and Challenges","review":"I consider this book written by Dr.Ramady as one of the best books I've ever read about economy in Saudi Arabia.Since I'm Saudi, and this book is realated to my field, I can say that comparing with other books on the Saudi economy written by western Professors and researchers such as Cordesman and Wilson, this book is the most up to date and brings out social issues more clearly while the other authors concentrated on political issues which distracted from the economic analysis.Dr.Ramady's book guided me in some reasearches that am doing now, it was very valuable for me and I assume it will be an excellent source of information about our economy for everyone.What am sure about is that this book is not the kind of books that you read only once, this book (at least for me) will be read many times due to what its author showed of high analysis skills."},{"Title":"The Saudi Arabian Economy: Policies, Achievements, and Challenges","review":"Web Link of the review:[...]\\"New book analyses Saudi economy thoroughly\\"A new book has been recently published that should generate interest in Saudi Arabia's economic development, and will appeal to both students and lay readers. \\"The Saudi Arabian Economy: Policies, Achievements and Challenges\\", was authored by Dr. Mohamed A. Ramady, a visiting Associate Professor of Finance and Economics at the King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals.The Kingdom continues to attract international attention given its geo-strategic political role. Serious academic work and research is often hard to find and most writers tend to be from outside the Kingdom without access to first-hand data or quality sources. This book is one exception. The Saudi economy has changed almost beyond recognition since the oil boom days of the 1980s, and the Kingdom itself has changed economically, socially, and demographically. Written by a long time observer of Saudi Arabia, this book brings forward the main challenges facing the Kingdom.In this second edition version, Dr. Ramady, a professor of economics at KFUPM and former international banker, uses several overlapping themes to establish and develop a framework for studying the fundamental challenges to the Saudi economy, as well as using his personal experience from working in the Saudi banking sector. From the onset, he argues that the pace and diversity of reforms instituted by King Abdullah, Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, have been the cornerstones upon which the current economic change is built. The legal and commercial reforms are praised, as well as the decision to use the accession to the WTO in 2005 to push through other administrative reforms.Despite progress in this sector, Dr. Ramady opines that the private sector has still not effectively stepped in to take over from the government - as the major engine of growth and sustained job creation - as hoped for in the various Saudi National Plans.An area which the author finds comfort with, however, is the Saudi capital market without its previous excesses, the opening up to foreign players and investors to give it depth and especially the role of the Capital Market Authority as probably one of the most effective regulators in the Gulf, a far cry from the earlier establishment period. The shielding of the Saudi financial sector from the excesses of the recent global financial crisis under the relative conservative regulatory regime of Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority is also dealt with in detail, as well as the effects of globalization and the opening up of the Saudi financial sector to a new wave of foreign banks since the Kingdom's WTO accession.The author examines how Saudi banks have recently started venturing abroad and the problems of global supervision of such institutions in light of global financial contagion, as witnessed during the recent global financial crisis.This edition deals in some detail with the hydrocarbon and minerals sector, including the emergence of the competitive petrochemical sector as being one of the few winning cards that Saudi Arabia gained on its WTO accession, but Dr. Ramady is more pessimistic about the long-term viability of some Saudi industries, especially those that still depend on heavy government subsidies which have to be reduced in line with WTO accession commitments.Other areas of pessimism are still the slow pace of privatization, the obstacles faced by Saudi women in effective participation in the national economy and the sceptre of looming unemployment, especially that of uneducated job seekers, amongst a young population.The policy of Saudization is examined closely and the author feels that a new approach of free market forces and changing the current sponsorship laws like Bahrain, might bring about a greater degree of market labor supply flexibility, but that overall the Saudi private sector is resistant to Saudization for many reasons, chief of which is the availability of cheaper foreign labor.Not all is pessimism though, as Dr. Ramady highlights recent successes for the Kingdom such as the liberalization of the foreign direct investment regime under SAGIA's auspices and the improved ranking in global competitiveness and business ease, which put the Kingdom ahead of other GCC economies.Saudi Arabia's place in the Gulf Cooperation Council, as well as its evolving strategic economic relations with China and other countries are analysed in depth, but the author believes that the common currency plan might now be put on a back burner and that the pressure to de-peg from the dollar has also eased, given the recent problems in the Eurozone and the reluctance of other players such as China and the EU to replace the dollar as a currency of reserve or the foreseeable future. Unlike earlier low inflation eras, Dr. Ramady believes that Saudi Arabia has now to learn to live with periods of relatively moderate to high inflation rates.Altogether, this edition is a welcome addition to Saudi researchers as it brings together a compelling narrative on recent developments affecting the Kingdom in a dispassionate manner, and has included a comprehensive reference list for those researching the Kingdom.

Author John J. Donohue takes what is perhaps the deepest look yet in print at how and why our society understands and perceives martial arts as it does. I will relate a few concepts here from each of the eight chapters of the book. The author's thoroughness and inclusiveness have made it impossible to touch on all of the topics which he connects connects in each chapter. The majority of the author's practical Martial arts studies have been in Japanese arts, so Japanese terminology is used in most circumstances (definitions offered, glossary in back too). This should not be construed as a bias _against_ non-Japanese arts, but instead as the author admission of the limitations of his own experience. It does not in my opinion, impact the ideas he imparts, which go beyond where an art may have originated and probe concepts most combative arts possess. Donohue manages to put concepts that we've known existed into words--and he does so skillfully.In chapter 1, \\"A Warrior Dream\\", Donohue considers mysticism in the martial arts, writing, \\"An overly mystical approach to the martial arts is usually symptomatic of a lack of familiarity with them on the part of Western observers. (11)\\" He links the quest for self-definition to a sense of accomplishment through acquiring skill, and the exploration of the mystic. The second chapter, \\"Form and Function: Martial Systems in Cross-Cultural Perspective\\", Donohue examines combative and martial practices in cultural perspective. He takes for his examples among others, the expansion of the Zulu as a result of their innovative military system, Josephus remarks on the extensive training of Roman soldiers as cause for their success, and the tendancy to teach soldiers in modern military forces basic yet efficient training, touching on how technology has lessened the dependence on hand-to-hand skills for survival on the battlefield.In the next chapter, \\"The Asian Martial Arts: Just So and Just-so Stories\\" Donohue shows that the ways in which martial arts are interpreted are the result of many factors. He offers a brief history which covers the development of martial arts in Japan and China, and then the relation between moral and mystical belief in martial arts, and prevailing religious/philosophical practices of the cultures in which they developed such as Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism. Discussed in-Depth are the notions of Ki, Haragei, and Mu-shin, etc... Chapter four \\"Martial skills, Marginality, and Moral Force: Mythic Dimensions in the image of the American Warrior\\" seeks to explain why martial arts are so popular with Americans, and how they fit into the myth of the rugged individual as competent fighter. He shows that most films which cater to this genera contain similar elements meant to suggest to the viewer the independence of their main characters. An interesting chart compares \\"Shane\\" with \\"Lethal Weapon\\" and \\"Above the Law\\".\\"Training, Adaptation, and Elaboration: The American Dojo\\" is the fifth chapter, and deals with heirarchy, organization, rank, and structure...and the lack of those things in some cases. Chapter six, \\"Mystery and Mastery: The Added Dimension in the Martial Arts\\" concerns itself with the reliance on mystical and quasi-magical explanations of qualities such as Ki by many American martial artists, and how many prefer Asian combatives because they possess this dimension. Chapter Seven, \\"The Search for a Center\\" tackles the idea of conforming to the norms of the martial arts group in dress, behavior, and practice. The last Chapter, \\"Wave People\\", covers the diversity of meaning that can be found in the symbols of martial arts.The insights offered by John Donohue in this book put my practice in a new perspective. There are different ways of seeing and experiencing martial arts that go beyond variations of style or nationalistic flavor. For a deeper understanding of what we're doing and why we're doing it, give this book a try."},{"Title":"The necessity for systematic theology (Studies in systematic theology)","review":"Rousas John Rushdoony (1916-2001) is the controversial founder of the \\"Christian Reconstruction\\" movement; this 1979 book anticipated his desire for a comprehensive systematic theology, which he finally published in 1994Systematic Theology (2 Volume Set).He wrote in the first chapter that systematic theology \\"is a comprehensive, unified statement of what Scripture as a whole teaches about God. The revelation of God in Scripture is brought together in summary and comprehensive form, and the results of Biblical theology, the exegesis and analysis of Scripture and its meaning, are organized and set forth... Without systematics there is no word of God, and, indeed, no such God as His revelation in Scripture sets forth.\\"He charges that Karl Barth's God is \\"a limiting concept, the product of a man's imagination,\\" and that Barth (e.g.,Church Dogmatics A Selection) gives us only a \\"systematic exposition of his unbelief; he cannot give us a systematic theology of the God of Scripture.\\" (Pg. 2)After quoting Cornelius Van Til, Rushdoony asserts that human action requires that unified knowledge. \\"Man's being requires a systematics, and he will either live or die in terms of it. His faith will lead him to action or inaction, to suicide or to life.\\" (Pg. 10) He concludes caustically, \\"The end of all non-systematic apologetics is absurdity\\" (pg. 26), and \\"Anti-presuppositionalist theologies and philosophies reduce God to the level of okra.\\" (Pg. 34)Near the end of the book, he says that it is not wrong for a theological \\"specialist\\" to study Barth, Moltmann, and the like---\\"PROVIDED he has had a firm grounding in sound theology and in good theologians first of all... IF he knows his Bible, and IF he is thoroughly grounded in sound theology and Christian presuppositional analysis, then he can profitably deal with the enemy's thought, and effectively cut out the ground from under the opposition.\\" (Pg. 71)Even if you have read Rushdoony's later complete work, this outline is definitely a book to study if you are interested in Rushdoony's thought, or in Christian Reconstruction/Theonomy in general."},{"Title":"Molecular Basis of Breast Cancer: Prevention and Treatment","review":"Great book, I'm currently borrowing it from the med. school library.

The selection of pictures is decent, although there is one photo that I suspect is from the 1912 Scott expedition (of a tracked motor-sledge; the Shackleton expedition had only a car with it).

The author does an excellent job in covering the forts of the Great Plains describing their construction, history and the human element. Of course, not every fort can be covered, but this book does cover the key forts and provides a good sampling from the fully stockaded forts to those open posts that usually had nothing more than a blockhouse. Like most Osprey books, this one is well illustrated. This book is a must for anyone really interested in the American West in the 19th century."},{"Title":"Forts of the American Frontier 1820-91: Central and Northern Plains (Fortress)","review":"A nice introduction to the forts built in the American West during the 18th century. Detailed sections on fort types, defensive features, and construction methods (depending on distance from resources and labor available) follow the section on evolution of fortifications.A snapshot of life in the forts reveals privation, exhausting labor, severe weather effects, and long periods of isolation broken (rarely) by Indian attack or forces staging from the fort to attack Indian settlements.The section on forts under seige or attack is neccessarily brief but isn't really the focus of the book. As with most Fortress series books this volume finishes with a look at surviving examples, somewhat rare in this case.Where this book really shines is in the detail drawaings and plates. The illustrations are easily comparable to a larger book, which generally has more information, but at several times the cost.Highly recommended as an introduction or general reference to the 19th century American West."},{"Title":"Forts of the American Frontier 1820-91: Central and Northern Plains (Fortress)","review":"Book had much more information than expected regarding military strategy and fort/base design in the West. Great illustrations too."},{"Title":"Forts of the American Frontier 1820-91: Central and Northern Plains (Fortress)","review":"I'm an historian and archivist by training and I come from an army family, so it's not surprising I have a long involvement with military history. And I've always made a point, when I travel, of trying to visit any nearby posts with an early history, especially those now managed as parks or historic sites. In the early 19th century, the U.S. Army established a growing string of fortified posts to lend support to the expanding line of frontier settlement. Most of these were temporary in intent, but some, like Ft. Riley and Ft. Leavenworth, became permanent installation. Fort Snelling opened in 1825 and was still operating as a recruit training center through 1945. (This shift to permanent status was more common in the Southwest, but this volume is concerned with the northern plains.) The author is a public school teacher but he's done a pretty good job here of tracing and explaining the gradual development of the post system, the types of fortifications constructed (and the reasons behind certain types of architecture), what day-to-day life was like there (boring, mostly), and how they functioned in wartime, which meant the Indian Wars. In a departure from Osprey's usual design, this series scatters the color plates through the volume instead of putting them all in a single signature (newer printing technology), so the reader needn't flip back and forth. Also, from the 1850s on, there's a pretty good photographic record available of army posts, and the story is further enhanced by photos of modern reenactors, mostly at Ft. Larned, Kansas.

I am not a specialist in Middle English, so I cannot say what was lost in the translation into Modern English. I have a copy of the B-Text version which is in Middle English, and if you are like me and have no background therein, this is definitely the version to possess.It was written circa 1380 and gives an excellent account of life in Plantagenent England and the behavior of the people. The money economy was relatively new, and he saw the negative effects that it had upon both the secular authorities and the Church. The poem is written as an allegory in which the author tries to reconcile the needs of human society with satisfying our Lord our God. Similar to Pilgrim's Progress, the author has a vision, in which he is encounters different aspects of humanity (Covetousness, Sloth, Soul, Knowledge, etc.) on his attempt to find Truth (or God). It is definitely not light reading, and there is so much deep thought that one has to spend a lot of time reading it slowly, as I am sure it was done in the 'Middle Ages'.The author thought that End Times were near after the Black Death and the utter corruption amongst secular and clerical authorities at the time. The fact that something so penetrating and inspirational was written and found such an appreciative audience that it has survived till now shows that the society then was not so bad. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"William Langland: The Vision of Piers Plowman III (Early English Text Society Original Series) (Vol 3)","review":"The poem of 'Piers the Ploughman' is often considered to be anonymously composed, as the name William Langland was less an authorial designation as it was an inscription on the back of a manuscript - it would be as if I would be assigned the authorship of the O.E.D. because, in some future time, the only remaining copy was missing the title pages, but still had the hard-cover with my 'ex libris' impression on it. Be that as it may, Langland is considered at least as likely an author as any other, and becomes a sort of stand-in, an 'everyman' for his time period. A few details of this Langland are known - he was a wanderer, a constant reviser (the poem goes through several revisions that scholars have designated as texts A, B, and C (and some argue for Z). This is not a spiritual autobiography, as J.F. Goodridge states in an essay about Langland in another edition, but there are no doubt autobiographical elements in the text. That the lead character is named 'Will' helps in this identification.This poem stands alongside Chaucer's 'Canterbury Tales' as one of the great products of Middle English; this also has the character of being a different sort of Middle English than Chaucer's more courtly, continental influenced variety. Thus, it gives breadth to the history of the English language. Langland is often ranked as a great English poet on a par with Spenser, Milton, Wordsworth and Yeats, as representative of his age both in topics as well as language facility.This epic poem deals with themes familiar for the time - like Dante and Milton, Langland deals with the grand ideas of the meaning of life and the destiny of humankind. However, unlike Dante and Milton, Will and Piers the Ploughman do not go through a mystical, otherworldly adventure or journey, but rather stays rooted to the earth. These are dream sequences, but these too need not be otherworldly - they are things that can happen to every person. The ideas of the seven deadly sins, the virtues, the church, and the images of heaven and hell are very much rooted to regular society images of the same. The discussion of the allegorical characters, aptly named Do-Well, Do-Better, and Do-Best, does much for the moral teaching of this poem, which would have been of primary concern to the author.Langland's text is often more Old English than Chaucerian in ways. It is far more alliterative, a strong component taken from Old English. Also, it is less metrical in rhythm than Chaucer - there is a pause in each line akin to older English poetry, but the metre is less secure.This translation is done in alliterative verse by E. Talbot Donaldson (the 'E' stands for the very olde Englishe sounding name of Ethelbert). There are notes, essays and other helpful material provided by Elizabeth Kirk and Judith Anderson. There are over 50 non-related texts of the poem that have survived the Middle Ages, that vary from minor to major changes throughout. Reconciling these is rather like attempting to reconcile the gospels of the Bible, and then adding to that task the discovery of other non-canonical gospels. It leads to rich discussion, but less agreement.The introductory material helps set the stage for reading, and the appendix gives a more thorough development of 'The Dreamer' from the C text.Perhaps one of the reasons I like this text so much is that the persons involved were known to me, or friends of friends. Donaldson was the founding editor of 'The Norton Anthology of English Literature', a broad, wide-ranging text. However, it was 'Piers Plowman' that was to be a continuing favourite study for him.This is one of the classics of English literature, perhaps the least known among them."},{"Title":"William Langland: The Vision of Piers Plowman III (Early English Text Society Original Series) (Vol 3)","review":"This poem is very unique. Langland conveys many moral issues that will always be part of human existence. The poem is written in the beautiful, alliterative style. It is not quite a standard allegory and perhaps this is why I enjoyed it so much. It is masterfully composed and Piers' vision is accutely realized. Langland has an artistic touch that grabs hold of a reader and also manages to import a message. I would recommend a version that has both the original text, with all the idosyncratic spellings, and a modern English translation. Reading this is like reading Dante, Chaucer, or the Gawain Poet. A lot to chew on but well worth the trouble."},{"Title":"The Lovers","review":"This is a novel based on a short story from 1952. Unlike many such extended stories, Farmer succeds to create a coherent whole novel without boring material just intended to stretch a story to novel lenght.The protagonist of &quot;The Lovers&quot; is Hal Yarrow, citizen of the Haijac Union, a totalitarian teocracy that has replaced the USA after a world war decimated most of the human race. Stifled by the unrelenting control by the state-church and its police over every aspect of his life, he is offered a way out of his bleak existence when he is drafted as a linguist for an interstellar expedition to the planet Ozagen, a world inhabited by a native species with a very complex language.Things are not quite what they seem; the ostensibly peaceful scientific expedition is actually intended to pave the way for human colonization, starting with genocide by germ warfare on the native species. While Yarrow is working together with the local inhabitants to learn more of the world, the spaceship crew is working on producing bioweapons lethal to the natives. During a trip trough the wilderness, Yarrow meets Jeanette, a human survivor of an earlier, failed colony, founded by people who fled the Earth before the Haijac Union established hegemony over the western world.Yarrow falls in love with Jeanette, and he realizes he would not be allowed to meet her, or any human not approved of by the state-church hierarchy and its local commissar, Pornsen. The existence of other humans on the planet is not known by Yarrow's superiors, and he decides to keep it a secret. As his secret love affair with Jeanette continues, he begins to change from a loyal subject of the state-church to a rebel. His love to Jeannette gives him the courage to bluff his superiors in a game of deceit that will cost him his life if he is found out.&quot;The Lovers&quot; was considered controversial when it was published in 1952, since the explicit treatment of sexuality was anathema at the time (although modern readers are unlikely to find anything offensive in the book). Farmer has expanded the original story to create a beleivable background. A perfectionist may complain over minor detalils; for instance why are the local aliens only a few centuries behind the humans in technology, when both have evolved in a 15-billion year old galaxy (a common paradox in science fiction) ? Actually, technology transfer between the failed human colony and the locals would explain the narrow technology gap between humans and aliens, but Farmer misses the opportunity to explain the paradox. The near simultaneous evolution of two different intelligent alien species on Ozagen seems rather far-fetched, and would require a better explanation then mere coincidence. Another problem is the ability of local symbiotic species to easily adapt to the human presence. Farmer could have elaborated more on this detail, but all in all, the biology is convincing.The literary treatment of the aliens in the book as different, but morally equal beings (neither monsters nor idealised noble entities) is a hallmark of Farmer's humanitarian values. In the end, the aliens with their inferior technology turn the tables on the humans, simply by relying on human arrogance; although the leaders of the expedition are paranoid towards their human subjects, they do not expect the simple locals to outwit them.My minor objections are trivial in the context of a story that dates back to the fifties, and still remains a gripping tale of passion, rebellion and grief. The plot could easily have become a clich&eacute;, but Farmer injects new life in old ideas. Not much of the science fiction written today will still feel this fresh a generation from now."},{"Title":"The Lovers","review":"This book is one of Farmer's best. The story and the concepts are familiar - but the way the plot unfolds does so with a wit that never fails to amuse me. Pornsen the Gapt, the small, perverse policeman/religious overseer/moral guardian -who harrases poor Hal Yarrow throughout the book.I throughly reccomned this book to those fans of Farmer who haven't experienced the other side of his creativeness.5 stars"},{"Title":"The Lovers","review":"If you like odd quirky science fiction, you'll like this.

Readers who want a &quot;behind the scenes&quot; look of life in the White House without all the needless commentary should purchase this book immediately!! This is a must read for anyone interested in political life."},{"Title":"Heartbeat: George Bush in His Own Words","review":"&quot;Heartbeat&quot; is a collection of excerpts from the speeches and writing of President George H. W. Bush. The compilation delineates those &quot;core&quot; values that defined the policies and personal goals of Bush's presidency. The book is organized into chapters corresponding to his presidential years (1989-1992) with an additional chapter concentrating on his post-presidency. The writings,which characterize the &quot;core&quot; values consistently addressed, are presented in sub-sections in each chapter. These are: Faith, Family, and Friends; The Vision Thing; A Legacy of Service; and In the Arena. This is a convenient organizational tool which allows the reader, should he/she choose, to follow a particular thread through each of the four years of the president's term. Of course one may choose the conventional method of a chapter by chapter reading. I actually did both, occasionally flipping back and forth through the chapters as I read to remind myself of a particular point previously made.I found the book to be absorbing and entertaining reading. Having visited the Bush Library in College Station, Texas, I was not surprised by the sense of honor, duty and love of country that permeates the text. Nor was I surprised and the wonderful rather self-deprecating sense of humor that pops up in sometime unexpected places.All-in-all this is an effortless way to get an elementary grasp of the issues and complexities which confronted America at a time when events leading to The World Trade Center atrocity were already continuing to build."},{"Title":"Mastering Guerrilla Marketing: 100 Profit-Producing Insights That You Can Take to the Bank","review":"Jay Conrad Levinson wrote Mastering Guerrilla Marketing to reinforce basic marketing principles that are necessary to carry out any kind of effective campaign.

If you have already been exposed to the basic concepts of Guerrilla Marketing (see book of this name by the same author), you are ready for mastering this powerful technique.The best way I can explain what's in the book is to say that this 250 page book breaks down the Guerrilla Marketing process into 100 small steps or components. Each step has a particular insight (the insight is always in italics) that is the central focus and the author spends 2 pages explaining this insight.For example - insight # 25 is about telemarketing. The author explains that 20% of any sales organization brings in 80% of the sales and suggests that the rest of the organization could benefit by using the scripts from these highly successful group of people. Six ways to make a telemarketing call successful are outlined along with the telemarketing strategy that guerrilla marketers can follow.Although these insights are not that deep and the material surrounding the insights not that revolutionary, almost everything in this book has been known to work if implemented correctly. This book is best used in conjunction with the other books in the Guerrilla Marketing series. As with the other books in this best selling series, the price is so low that you can't lose buying this book.The only downside to this book is its weak coverage of Guerrilla Marketing insights relating to the Internet. Of the several books I own by the same author, I see the same trend in all of them. Since most of these books were written before the Internet took off, any coverage seems more like an afterthought and not really integrated with the rest of the material. Other than that, I can sincerely say that this book provides great value for the price. Good luck with your Guerrilla Marketing plans!"},{"Title":"Mastering Guerrilla Marketing: 100 Profit-Producing Insights That You Can Take to the Bank","review":"... You could have the most incredible life altering product and it won't mean anything if you don't market it properly. That's why I was so earger to read this book. It had gotten great reviews and it was talked about often but when I read it I was so disspointed. There was nothing novel or exciting about the advice given in this book; it was at times too general and too detailed to be of much use. After I had read Mastering Guerrilla Marketing, I read Guerrilla PR Wired by Michael Levine. This book was also highly recommended and I was slightly apprehensive. But I was pleased. The writing was sharp and intelligent, the advice was up-to-date and relevant, and the theories were right on target. Mastering Gerrilla Marketing tries but it comes up woefully short."},{"Title":"Time Capsule 1942 (a history of the year condensed from the pages of time)","review":"\\"Time Capsule/ 1942\\" records the events of that pivotal year when the tide of battle turned in World War II, as seen by the editors of Time as it happened, week by week. It was the year of sinkings of merchant ships within sight of the U.S. mainland, surrender in the Philippines, and Operation Torch, the landings in North Africa. Meanwhile Japanese Americans were relocated away from coastal areas, Rep. Lyndon Johnson went into a combat area and returned to report to President Roosevelt, the Coconut Grove Fire killed 484 patrons, White Christmas became a hit and the St. Louis Cardinals won the World Series. Other books have the advantage of hindsight, but the Time Capsule series gives us the first hand reports of how events were viewed at the time. For that it provides a unique perspective of a most important year."},{"Title":"Time Capsule 1942 (a history of the year condensed from the pages of time)","review":"While the time capsule books published by Time magazine are all an excellent way to obtain a summary of the year, it is surprising that the image on the cover of this one is actress Rita Hayworth. Given that the Japanese were winning the war throughout the Pacific, and the Germans held the European continent and still seemed capable of defeating the Soviet Union, having a beautiful actress grace the cover seems rather absurd. Most of the pages are devoted to news of the war; even the entertainment and business news is largely war-related.If you are interested in a brief yet thorough recapitulation of the year 1942, then this book will suffice. Most of the war news is dark, at this point in time, few knew that the seeds of ultimate victory had been planted, yet in hindsight it is easy to see them."},{"Title":"Time Capsule 1942 (a history of the year condensed from the pages of time)","review":"While the time capsule books published by Time magazine are all an excellent way to obtain a summary of the year, it is surprising that the image on the cover of this one is actress Rita Hayworth.

Of course she spilled the blistering liquid on the sexiest, most popular professor on campus, Sean O'Flynn. As his Irish brogue makes light of the accident and leaves her knees weak, Maeve finds herself wildly attracted to the Irishman, even after he leaves her feeling humiliated. Determined to even the score, she pulls the greatest practical joke she's ever managed with her &quot;Plan Revenge.&quot; But when Sean gives a whole new meaning to &quot;stiff shirt,&quot; the joke's on Maeve!The counterbalance to humor, dark memories plague both Maeve and Sean, as fire and pain haunt each. Maeve only allows Puss, her gray cat, hear her inner secrets. On the other hand, Sean is like his poetry--a mix of beauty and ugly, carrying eternal memories of Ireland's violence and wonder. Adept at keeping others at bay, both Maeve and Sean are inexplicably drawn to one another. But miscommunication and self-recriminations threaten their tentative relationship and, unless they can learn to share their pasts, they can never share a future.Smart, sexy, and sassy! IRISH LULLABY by Leta Nolan Childers challenges the searing memories of the past while igniting the erotic flames of the present. The smell of lavender, the touch of rose petals and the sight of flaming red hair bring this novel vividly alive.

The reason is that as an artist, I really do appreciate a colorful, extremely visual book on this kind of subject. This book is more in line with a traditional textbook. The text is almost entirely delivered in black and white but there is a CD-ROM to liven things up. This text's main ace in the hole though is that it is extremely well written while having a TON of information you will need for in depth penetration into this most complex program. If that is what you need, this is the book. I notice it is sold at my college as a reference work. I think it would work extremely well as a text, much better than &quot;Visual Quick Start to Photoshop&quot; used by my college (absolutely terrible) and better even than Adobe's own &quot;Classroom In a Book&quot; (previously reviewed). If I were just starting Photoshop, I would start with the &quot;Learn Photoshop Visually Book&quot; (previously reviewed) and then I'd use as my main 2 books, to go deeper into the program, the &quot;Photoshop Wow&quot; book (previously reviewed) and this book. I believe that you could go awfully far with these 3 books, these latter two having CD-ROMs to aid you. I also can't recommend highly enough that you add onto having these 3 books, signing up at the free Online Adobe Expert Center for free online tutorials and the fabulous free online users' forum. I've picked up some tips at the users' forum that are in no book. I consider &quot;Classroom in a Book&quot; optional to these others but worth having if your budget allows. Another fabulous resource is the Photoshop magazine, fully visual, in full color, with full tutorials. I buy mine at Borders but really should subscribe to it. I suppose a text that looked like this magazine is out of the question due to prohibitive color reproduction cost. Too bad as that would really be something."},{"Title":"Inside Photoshop 7 (Inside (New Riders))","review":"I bought this book based on rave reviews, and was sorely disppointed.1. The book tries to be all things to all people, and the author does own up to this in the introduction, stating that &quot;...we're talking a core of reference chapters surrounded by parts in the book which appeal to different audiences.&quot; Beginners will be frustrated in that there is no overview describing the Photoshop GUI environment, unclear instructional detail, and lack of a clear instructional path through this weighty tome, and more advanced users will be bogged down by the verbiage, redundancy, unclear instructional detail, and missing contextual explanations of why the learner is doing the steps given.2. Yes, the writing style is &quot;approachable,&quot; &quot;casual,&quot; and &quot;fun,&quot; but I prefer a less weighty book (literally) that gets to the point. The Hands-On-Training books are a good example of this approach. I don't have time for silly jokes (&quot;Make two-toned bananas by detailing the ends with green. They will also stay fresher this way&quot;) and overly informal writing (&quot;No sense in hangin' around now&quot;).3. There are very few illustrations and screen shots to display the tool references and steps, and those that exist are too small, requiring the reader to physically move the book closer and squint. This isn't easy with a 1000-page book.4. The organization of the information lacks logical progression, and information is repeated throughout the book. For example, the author gives a detailed accounting of the layer and paint modes, taking 3 1/2 pages, in Chapter 1, and essentially repeats it in Chapter 4. It really shouldn't be in Chapter 1, which is aimed at beginners, as it just gets in the way of working through that chapter.As an intermediate user of Photoshop, I had hoped to find a book that went beyond the basics, giving good explanations not for just how things work, but when and why to use them, along with good working, interactive examples. This book has a ton of information, as previous reviewers pointed out, but it's not clearly enough designed for me to bother with it, except as an additional reference. I will need to look further."},{"Title":"Inside Photoshop 7 (Inside (New Riders))","review":"The authors managed to make Photoshop 7 a delight to learn, and the book, an entertaining reading. It has two important qualities that became obvious as I read on: (1) it can sustain my interest to learn more and work the exercises, and; (2) the authors tried their best to help the reader really understand Photoshop principles. The style's upbeat, and the book's organization, clever. Photoshop core principles were presented first then it's practical use as applied to photography, the Web, art, and just plain goofing around. Makes a lot of sense. Although the images were in black and white in the book, they have proven to be good guides. There were plenty of screen shots of dialog boxes, which tool to use and what the images should look like. They help to ensure that you don't get lost. The actual tutorial images were in full color in the CD-ROM, many of them nicely rendered in 3D.The observations in the previous review, \\"Several Areas of Ommission\\" are valid ones, though. I did find one exercise (Inverting and Refining A Shape Layer, page 185) that seem to have missed a step. Figure 5.29 on page 228 didn't quite look like what it was supposed to. But except for a few minor typo errors all the projects thus far were clearly explained and finished as written. I repeated some of them just for the fun of it. Odds are, any book this size (1000+ pages) would likely take its own share of minor errors. Overall, it was very well written.I am on the last 3 chapters of the book (no skipping) and I can say for certain that the authors were careful to give the reader consistent quality instruction right from the beginning. All the toturials were very interesting. There was not a dull moment! The other advantage of this book was that it was written by several people, who apllied their expertise on specialized chapters. My only complaint is that the they couldn't be reached for clarification on the item on page 185. It has been a wonderful experience learning Photoshop 7 and I am glad I had this book as my main guide."},{"Title":"Inside Photoshop 7 (Inside (New Riders))","review":"Alot of material in this book. As a new user of Photoshop I followed several of the step by step explanations only to find there were some steps missing in going from A to B, and incorrect reference to Figures that were used for reference (particularly in Chapter 9). I found this very annoying. When you pick up on the errors the authors attempt at humor then really falls short. Maybe this is a good overall book on a very complex piece of software but I had nothing else to compare it to. I hope there is something better out there or I believe many beginners will give up on Photoshop. I gave up on this book. Again, because of some step omissions the beginner may find himself scratching his head as to what to do. I had to play with the images to find out it wasn't my lack of understanding but poor editing of examples."},{"Title":"Inside Photoshop 7 (Inside (New Riders))","review":"Bouton has done it again! He is masterful with Photoshop and unique in the clear way he goes through the tutorials included in the book (which it is full of).

Not only can you see what area of the program Mr. Bouton is talking about in any particular tutorial but there are also arrows pointing to the important parts of the screen.Not only are the tutorials clear and easy to follow but Mr. Bouton has a fun, easy to read style so you will remember the procedures, even if you are reading it away from your computer.The other great thing about this book that makes it stand out from others is Mr. Bouton's love for 3D graphics.

A highly recommended read."},{"Title":"Inside Photoshop 7 (Inside (New Riders))","review":"I was entirely new to Photoshop 7 and so I decided to go thru the book page by page. The first chapter led me thru steps, but I wasn't sure what I had done when I was thru. I was instructed to select tools that I had no reasonable way of knowing where they were located, many hidden behind tiny icons which I have come to realize is Adobe's M.O., but very frustrating to a new user. The cutsie humor is lost on a frustrated reader trying to locate a tool. Some of the time he describes in detail step by step how to do an exercise but you're not sure what you are trying to achieve. The next time he assumes you know how and you don't have a clue where to start. After the first few chapters he surprisingly starts to tell you more detailed step by step instructions. Once I figured out on my own where many of the tools, option bar selections and palettes were I got a lot of information out of the book and have gone on to enjoy it."},{"Title":"Inside Photoshop 7 (Inside (New Riders))","review":"Granted I'm just starting to get my feet wet but this is the best book I've come across so far. The Classroom in a book series is good to start out with but to get really in depth, this is where to go. Unlike the Bible series, it gives you excercises and shows you what the tools are supposed to accomplish. I've talked to old pros of photoshop and they swear by it and as a rookie, I swear by it. I just wish a book like this existed for the other programs I'm working on. Can you tell I like it?"},{"Title":"Inside Photoshop 7 (Inside (New Riders))","review":"This book was simply awful. While I am very computer literate, I was completely new to photoshop 7 (and to photo-type software in general). This book decided to start by throwing me into the deep end of the pool and hoping that I could swim. I couldn't.Not only were the explanations completely unclear, they make you do exercises without telling you why your're doing them; you can't learn when to take a specific series of actions if you don't understand when/why they would be appropriate.Finally, the index was completely useless, at least to a beginner (perhaps if I had used prior versions it would have been more useful).Overall, I found this book to be completely worthless. It's been sitting on my shelf gathering dust since about a week after I bought it (which was how long I tried to muddle my way through it). There MUST be better books on the subject out there. Try one. Any of them!"},{"Title":"Inside Photoshop 7 (Inside (New Riders))","review":"Once again the Inside Photoshop 7 book has outdone the previous version. Just when you think it can't get any better they update and bring in additional authors adding to the tremendous value. There are some authors which joined in on this version making it a blockbuster of a book. You'll learn all the core techniques of Photoshop by performing the many tutorials throughout the book. There is a section that allows you to &quot;Get Your Feet Wet&quot; where you can get creative even when you have no idea at all of what you're doing. But don't worry, it's all covered in-depth through the book.Not only do you learn all the core functions of Photoshop but there are specialized sections such as, Photoshop for photographers so you can get to making money faster! I like goals like this. Some of the other special sections are Photoshop for Artists, Special Effects with Type and Animation scripting.The authors present a task then they determine what needs to be done then provide steps to accomplish the task. By understanding what the task is and what needs to be done to accomplish is you are armed with the methodology to apply to your own work."},{"Title":"Inside Photoshop 7 (Inside (New Riders))","review":"This book really showed me the in's and out's of Photoshop 7.

It's a church that branched off of the LDS(The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints). Just so you don't confuse the 2 churches. A few, I know @ least 2 churches-the reorganized and the flds(the fundamentalist)that have taken the LDS religion and changed it to the way they wanted it to be. They are in no way affiliated with the LDS church. The teachings are not the same and their doctrines are not to be confused with the doctrine of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. The others are merely sad branched off churches that people always seem to confuse with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints."},{"Title":"THE LADY FOR RANSOM.","review":"This is probably the most historically accurate novel that I have read that takes place in Constantinople/the Byzantine Empire. The story was pretty good, but not great. I don't think I have read any of Alfred Dugan's other books, so I am not sure if he writes this way in all of his books, but his style of writing was vaguely reminiscent of Anna Comnena's \\"Alexiad\\". However, I could not quite figure out what the title had to do with the story since the main female character was not held for ransom, although her husband was.Anyway, there aren't a lot of historical novels out there that are set in the Byzantine Empire, but this one was wonderfully accurate when compared to a couple of others that I have recently read, Michael Ennis' laughably stupid \\"Byzantium\\" and Cecelia Holland's \\"Belt of Gold\\" which was ok (way better than \\"Byzantium\\") but not as good as this."},{"Title":"THE LADY FOR RANSOM.","review":"I do like Alfred Duggan. This one is about a Norman knight Roussel de Balliol serving as a mercenary in Constantinople. I very good book tightly written as ever by Duggan with no superfluous writing but leaving no doubts to the imagination about the conditions being described."},{"Title":"THE LADY FOR RANSOM.","review":"This was one of Alfred Duggan's early historical novels and was first published in 1953. It tells the story of Roussel de Bailleul (Balliol being the anglicised form of the place he came from and where his family had its fief in Normandy). Roussel was a historical character and younger son and a knight, who like thousands of others across France, Flanders and Germany, had to either make a living for himself by hiring his sword or enter religious orders and become a monk. Some did both, starting by being mercenaries before retiring to a monastery in their old age, in particular when they had not succeeded in carving out a fief and building a castle for themselves. So Roussel became a mercenary and a captain, leading his own war band and seeking armed service from those that would employ him. Despite being generally presented as a Norman (there are two places in Normandy to bear the name of Bailleul), he may also have been a Frank (or more accurately a Flemish, since there is also another place called Bailleul in the North of France), although this is much less likely.Duggan chose to have Roussel's story told by Roger, his squire, a fictitious character who chose to retire from the world and become a monk after the death of his beloved lord. Roger tells his story to a bunch of young Norman knights in Southern Italy as these are about to embark for the Byzantine Empire. These are part of Bohemond's army and of the Frist Crusade, some 20 years after the events that Roger tells. Apart from telling the glorious deeds of Roussel, their predecessor who, after fighting with Roger of Hauteville in Sicily went to Byzantium and fought for the Emperor against the Turks, the story is also the occasion for these young knights to learn about the fabulous and threatened Byzantine Empire, of which they knew little.At the time of its publication, Duggan's novel was well-researched and he made use of all the available primary sources, whether the Norman ones (and Geoffrey Malaterra in particular) or the Byzantines ones (Attaliates, Nicephoros Bryennios, grandson of the character in the novel who bears the same name, and Anna Komnena, daughter of the emperor Alexis Komnene and wide of the historian and general Nicephoros Bryennios). His concise historical note, where he indicates the choices he has made and the elements of fiction that he has introduced, is in itself quite remarkable. While Roger the (narrator), and the very name of Roussel's wife (Mathilda in the novel) are made up, just like the personalities of Roussel's children, we do know that Roussel's wife paid his ransom after his first capture, and that he had offspring.Some elements included in the novel show the book's age. For instance, the Normans (or, more generally the Franks) at the time did not distinguish between knights and mounted sergeants at the time. They were all \\"milites\\" during the 11th and early 12th century. The social distinction between the two, and the heavy warhorse which are alluded to in the book as being characteristic of the Franks and Normans (the destriers) would only appear around 1150.There are a number of other similar points that can be made. However, to the extent that the story is told by Roger, a half-Norman and half-Greek from Apulia (Southern Italy), what could otherwise appear as glitches can pass to a large extent as gaps in the knowledge of the story-teller or as his misunderstanding of some traits of Byzantine civilisation which were unfamiliar to him. Having the story told by Roger and the events seen through his eyes turns out to be one of the book's main strength, and probably also one of the elements which have allowed this novel to largely withstand the test of time. Some elements, however, cannot quite be explained away, such as having the population of Southern Italy speaking \\"Italian\\". They would in fact have spoken Lombard, or various dialects derived from Latin, or Greek, or (Norman) French for the Normans, but there was no such language as \\"Italian\\" at the time. However, most readers will probably not notice and, among the few that will, most will not mind or care too much (me included) about this and a few other glitches.This book also exhibits another quality. By describing Roussel as a charismatic leader in the way he does and through the eyes of his devoted squire, Duggan manages to make what would have otherwise been a ruthless mercenary captain into a rather sympathetic and almost honourable but flawed and ultimately unsuccessful character. The real Roussel was very probably not as likeable but the way Duggan has presented him makes the reader empathise with him and feel almost sorry for him. No mean feat in itself, and another reason for liking this book, re-reading it and very much enjoying it.Accordingly, this book turned out to still be worth about four stars, despite it age and its glitches."},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"When you are tired of the endless controversies in current Biblical scholarship, when you're worn down from the specialist studies of language in this or that gospel, or the cynical books that claim to expose this and that redaction, when you want merely to exist in a rich, vital, eloquent literary world, securely based in scholarship itself, in which Second Temple Jerusalem comes to life, in which you can see Nazareth as if you were there, in which you can feel the pulse of the commerce and communications, and pilgrim crowds of the time of Christ -- then pick up this book. Dip into it by subject or time period. And you'll love it. Of course it was written by a believing man with a great generous soul. But it's thoroughly documented, and has immense and timeless insight to offer on many subjects. For some, it might be a rich corrective to the mini-series, and movies about Jesus which portray his surroundings as so meager and primitive, with no sense of the grandeur of the Holy City, and the complexity and variety of the village life that Jesus might have known. Jesus didn't live in the Stone Age as motion pictures and documentaries would have one believe. He lived in the busy world of Augustus and Tiberius Caesar. And this book embraces that period with vast wisdom and knowledge. It is outdated, yes. But the period in which it was written (late 1800's) is no doubt partly responsible for it's profound simplicty and overwhelming charm. Happy reading."},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"While somewhat outdated, The Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah remains a magnificent reference to the historical and cultural setting to the days of Jesus of Nazareth. Although written some 70 years prior to the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, Edersheim's great work still offers highly valuable information and insight on the Gospels and related events. One of the more striking features of the book is the appendix list of 400+ Old Testament passages which were tagged by the ancient rabbis as being messianically applied. An absolute must for anyone who wish to study the Jewish expectations of the Messiah surrounding the days when the Nazarene Carpentar walked the Earth. Place this vintage masterpiece in your library, and you will find yourself going back to it time and time again."},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"This classic work is a goldmine of information about the context of the Gospels. Many of the events and sayings in Jesus's become even clearer when we understand the widespread Rabbinic teachings of His day. Edersheim's insight into the famous \\"Thou art Peter\\" is most interesting -- yes, Jesus was speaking Hebrew but he DID mean to distinguish petros and petra, because these names had also been incorporated into Hebrew and Aramaic. It's also very important to see how Jewish writers interpreted Messianic prophecies to see that the NT writers were following accepted procedure.For something more modern, I recommend Dr Arnold Fruchtenbaum's books, especially Messianic Christology."},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"I was given a copy of the above referenced book as a birthday gift in 1990. I began reading it in 1992 and completed it within 3 months. I picked up the book again in 1998 and have read it, in its entirety, at least once a year since then. I truly consider myself more then a casual reader of this magnificent work! That being said, my review...For the believing Christian, this is a must read. For the skeptic, consider yourself remiss to overlook this book and for the Non-believer, this work will renovate your thinking. Edersheim has put together a true masterpiece herein. His depth of research on the subject matter is totally comprehensive. A commitment of 7 years, in almost complete solitude, was made to the writing of this book by he and his daughter.Literally thousands of footnotes, drawn from nearly every major Jewish writing of the time, are listed on the pages of this book indicating the intense discipline and scholarly effort enforced by the writer. An impression of truth and trustworthiness almost overwhelms readers as they have literally noted in conversation with me as I have passed this book along to many friends and acquaintances.This book is a bon-a-fide \\"best effort\\" to set before it's readers the daily foot steps of Jesus of Nazareth so that His words and works may bring us to an understanding of Jesus The Messiah that will blaze with a brightness that will light every other understanding.Finally, to put oneself to the task of completing this book is an undertaking. However, as noted by Edersheim himself, we are called to look upon Jesus with intent and resolve before we will see him as the \\"God-Man\\". ( St. John 6:40)"},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"Alfred Edersheim's heritage as a Messianic Jew gives the description of Jewish culture in &quot;The Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah&quot; an authenticity that a non-Jew would be hard-pressed to duplicate. The culture of Israel during the Roman occupation comes alive in Edersheim's writing in a way that goes beyond scholastic study by blending his own Jewish heritage, archeological fact, and keen spiritual insight. Any serious student of the Gospels or the Epistles would benefit from the insight of Mr. Edersheim because so much of the imagery in the account of Jesus is steeped in the culture of Israel as it progressed from Abraham to Herod. Used as a reference, &quot;The Life and Times&quot; is indexed according to verses and events and gives Bible studies the context for the illustrations of Jesus. Read as a book, Edersheim is ponderous, however, a contiguous reading would give a person a consistent Hebrew framework which the New Testament fit into 2000 years ago. &quot;The Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah&quot; has become a fixture in my library which, second to the Bible, is now a standard starting point in my study of Jesus, the Messiah."},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"In Bible school I had to use this book as a resource in writing several papers.

Lots of information on early Judaism, carefully footnoted from primary sources. In the footnotes, lots of arguments with other scholars, chiefly German (as was typical in the late nineteenth century). Some of author's weighing of evidence will have been challenged in the 100+ years since this book was first published, and new sources will have been discovered; new archaeological sites too. But this is still a good starting-point, if only for the quantity of early sources that are collected in one place.2. Florid prose.3. This reprint edition has more than the usual number of typographical errors. Most of these are harmless, but sometimes they change the sense. E.g., on p. 304: \\"We are _not_ in some measure prepared to follow the worship on that Sabbath in Nazareth\\" should read \\"We are _now_ in some measure prepared...\\""},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"The book itself is very intriguing, written by an amazing scholar.This edition handles the umlaut better than the other versions; however, struggles with Greek letters.

This new edition is so full of typographical errors that sometimes the reader will have to intuit what the author really wrote. It is clear that the proofreaders of this edition were not actually reading; they were simply following the little red lines under the \\"misspelled\\" words. This has resulted in some truly bizarre apparent statements by the author, unreproducible here due to copyright laws. Disclaimer-- I have not purchased this book, merely checked it out of the library."},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"The author's preface is dated 1886. Biblical scholarship has changed a lot since then, most notably with the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls and the Nag Hammadi library. Many of Rev. Edersheim's conclusions will have been refuted in the 130+ years since this book's original publication.For me, the author was at his best when he was dealing with _facts_, such as the details of Jewish life and society in Palestine during the time of Jesus. Unfortunately, being an Anglican priest, he cannot resist the temptation to preach - so he spends pages upon pages telling us what the story MEANS instead of just telling the story. I enjoyed his exposition on the parables in Book V, but most of his preaching was tedious and overburdened with Victorian-era sentiment.Edersheim also argues incessantly (with other Bible scholars whom he often names in the text or the footnotes) in favor of the authenticity, earliness, and \\"Jewish origin\\" of the gospel of John - a position which to me seems indefensible. He also insists on \\"harmonizing\\" the gospels into a single continuous narrative while also insisting that all four are literally, factually, and unerringly TRUE. This approach does not hold water, and watching this otherwise talented scholar & historian flounder through a mire of faulty logic and circular reasoning has only strengthened my conviction that the Victorian dream of a \\"Gospel Harmony\\" is an unreachable goal. Edersheim must undergo strange intellectual contortions to hold to his belief that the gospel writers 1) never made mistakes, and 2) never made stuff up. In one passage he points out Luke's specificity of historic detail as \\"evidence\\" of the truthfulness of his tale, and a few pages later points out Matthew's vagueness & lack of detail as proof of his veracity. You can't have it both ways!! Edersheim never gives the Classical/Antique era's writers any credit for imagination & inventiveness. Furthermore, he seems to have no understanding of Non-Christian myth nor how good stories are told.The book is huge: 1,491 pages, not counting the index and the Roman-numbered pages in the introduction to both volumes (bound together in this one enormous edition but retaining their two separate paginations). As other reviewers mentioned, there are lots of typos, and the old-fashioned prose often bogs down. I felt every one of those 1,491 pages. This book took way too long to read ... but ultimately I'm glad I read it. It's a treasure-trove of information as well as misbegotten opinions. It is probably something that should be experienced by anyone who's got the interest in the subject matter, and the patience to turn that many pages - but its flaws are too numerous for me to award it more than 3."},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"This book was recommended by my pastor and because I wanted to know more about Jesus I ordered it and will order another to give as a gift.

He lived from 1825 to 1889.His best known work is The Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah. As he said, he took seven years to complete this project. He isolated himself and devoted full time to his writing with only his daughter Ella as his researcher, proofreader and inspiration. This is indeed a tribute to a devoted daughter and skilled researcher in her own right.The volume of 1100 pages is not a devotional book. It has many devotional thoughts, but this is a scholarly work with historical details filling every chapter. You can tell by reading the extensive research and writing ability which into this tome.If you want to know about the times in which Jesus lived and glimpses into His life, then this book will be a good one for you. For example:The Gospels present a great deal of tension between Jesus and the religious leaders over rituals and the Sabbath. Edersheim explains this controversy where Jesus rejected the numerous ritual rules for everyday life and especially for the proper observation of the Sabbath. By the time of Jesus the religious authorities had created a burdensome system of do's and don'ts that even the devout hard a difficult time following. The Jerusalem priesthood was corrupt and the cleansing of the temple by Jesus was more than just a simple act.In addition, you are presented with graphic descriptions of the Herod Dynasty. King Herod and family left a bloody mark on Judaea before and after Jesus. It was a bloodline conceived in the worst possible elements of human nature. The Herods sought to build a second Rome in Judaea.If you have a serious interest in this subject, then I recommend this book to you.

I find it exciting to sense Jesus being brought to life in beautiful English. It is a little daunting to bounce back and forth between the author's references and the text but it is well worth it.

It has some good insights into the life of Jesus, and it will help pastors and teachers of the Word in their search for information that will preach.The book has some weaknesses that keeps it from being the top contemporary resource on the life of Jesus. Number one: The book is not easy to read. It is technical and tedious, and demands alot from the reader.Number two: Edersheim operates under the assumption that everything he knows about Talmudic tradition was also true in the first century, and we simply do not know if this was the case.Number three: The scholarship in this book is more than a hundred years old. I think the best features of the book are the preaching tidbits sprinkled throughout the volume.Having said all that,I think that if you are looking for the best Jesus biography, you'd be better served with Jesus and the Gospels by Craig Blomberg. The scholarship is recent, the prose is engaging, and the volume compresses an amazing amount of information in its 450 pages.

He was born and raised a Jew but converted to Christianity as a young man. He provides insight into Jewish history and background to the gospel narratives like no one else I've read. A couple of problems with this work though, it can be very hard to reference. When searching for a particular parable or passage you have to search through the chapter headings one by one to see if you recognize the content. Furthermore, Mr. Edersheim is so unbelievably wordy it can be frustrating waiting for him to get to the point, but this is typical of late 19th and early 20th century biblical expositors.

The stories are not sappy or sticky like that of the Disney versions and not dark and scary like that of the Grimm Brothers style. Their just a little scary and still have an amusing yet pleasant ending. I have been reading these stories to my kindergarten students for years and they truly enjoy them - often using &quot;advanced&quot; reading skills (predicting, applying themes and ideas etc...) while I do read aloud. Many of the tales are classics (Rapunzel, The Fisherman and His Wife), but the two that stand out are Cinderella (3 balls, a GOLDEN slipper and pitch...) and The Six Servants (many subtle references to the trinity with it's multiples of three in the story line - early &quot;Christian&quot; propaganda). The language is rich, vibrant, alive and classic - just classic enough for excellent questioning. I highly and strongly recommend this book to collector's as well as teachers, and parents alike.

Join Coll and his friends on their bold and dangerous journey to Annuvi"},{"Title":"Coll and his white pig (Holt owlet)","review":"This work was published in 1965 and is still around to this day. There are reasons for this. To begin with, it is a well written story in the folktale mode with a timeless quality about it. It is one of those stories of fantasy that simply will never grow old.Coll is a farmer in the mythological land and kingdom of Prydain. Coll had been and adventurer and warrior in his younger days but has reach the time in this life where he simply want to settle down, raise vegetables and tend his orchards. He made a plow of his sword and beanpoles from his old spears and sparrows nested in his leather fighting cap. He loved his vegetable plot and his orchards, but most of all he loved his best friend, his white pig, Hen Wen!Now Hen Wen is not an ordinary pig by any means, no, no, no! Hen Wen also happens to be an oracle and when she is spirited away in the middle of the night my mysterious dark riders, Coll finds he has no choice but to begin another adventure...an adventure and quest to save his beloved white pig. Every hear of the \\"Lord of Land of Death?\\" Well, you will with the reading of this work!On his journey Coll is joined by a cast which includes Oak-Horn, a timid stag, Ashwing, a clever owl; and Star-Nose, who happens to be the High King of the Moles. This band of friends begins an amazing adventure into the unknown and encounter magical enchantments, evil kings and warriors and much evil.This is a rather short work, but one that packs a very good story into a very short space. Told in a mythological mode, it is enhanced by some wonderful illustrations by Evaline Ness.This is an ideal book to introduce the young reader to the world of fantasy writing; of mythology and adventures and quests. On one hand it is a simple tale, but on the other it causes or forces the young reader to actually think. It can be, as it should be, a bit of a challenge and this is a good thing. There is no dumbing down here what so ever, something we see all too much of these days.I like this book and do hope it stays available and is not lost as so many of the good old reads have been over the past several years. I do highly recommend this one.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"A French Song Companion","review":"Pierre Bernac's _Interpretation of French Song_ has long been the indispensable reference volume for singers and coaches of this rich musical literature. The focus of the present volume is somewhat different, more comprehensive in its listings of composers (any composer of significance who set French texts is included, resulting in some surprising listings, Bernstein and Dinu Lipatti, for example), but less didactic in terms of pronounciation and performance. The translations by Richard Stokes are so good that one wishes even more had been included. Graham Johnson's commentaries on composers and songs are readable and full of insight. There are useful indices and suggestions for further reading. Altogether, this is a comprehensive and fascinating volume for both performing musicians and other lovers of French art song."},{"Title":"A French Song Companion","review":"A French Song CompanionThis is a superb book! A wonderful source book for deepening one's knowledge of the French art song repertoire. Although not primarily concerned with helping performers to interpret the songs (unlike Bernac in this respect), it contains extraordinarily perceptive and insightful commentaries on the songs, grouped by composers, and should open many doors to most listeners and performers. I cannot recommend it too highly."},{"Title":"A French Song Companion","review":"This book is encyclopaedic in its coverage and is an indispensable guide for anyone who is interested in French song, but particularly for singers and accompanists. There are many useful translations of poems - not just the well-known ones but obscure ones too - and honest appraisals of the work of almost every composer who has set the French language to music. The book is constructed in such a way that it is very easy to use, with separate indexes for composer, poet and title. The main part of the book consists of individual articles on each composer, arranged alphabetically from Jean ABSIL to Jean WIENER, describing their oeuvre in general and individual cycles and songs in detail. The length of entries varies in proportion to the composer's (or work's) perceived importance, but there is also a subjective element that takes into account how they rate in the authors' estimation. Thus, Debussy, Faur&eacute; and Ravel get enormous entries, as one would expect, but Honegger gets a generous three pages plus several poem translations, whereas Vierne (whose songs have the edge over Honegger's in my view) is only allowed a mere half page and no poems. The style of the writing is always entertaining, never dry, and it is quite unfair that so talented a musician as Graham Johnson should also be such an accomplished writer! Fellow m&eacute;lodie singers, I guarantee that you will find this thoroughly researched and carefully produced book to be a real treasure trove and an inspiration for expanding your repertoire. It's one of the few books that I own which are permanently in use and never get put back on the shelves my bookcase."},{"Title":"A French Song Companion","review":"The merits of this collection of French art song lyrics is that it is extremly comprehensive. It contains the English translation of most French art songs.

This book came in particularly when I was listening to the complete Duparc songs."},{"Title":"A French Song Companion","review":"helpful reference for all french song. Very conprehensive an excellent reference for style and lanaguage a must have for performing french repertoire"},{"Title":"A French Song Companion","review":"One should think of this as Pierre Bernac's \\"Interpretation of French Song\\" written by and for new generations of scholars and performers.This is the absolute definitive guide to the history of French song with translations of almost all of the repertoire (some poems that are not in public domain may be omitted). This book is a must-have for performers of the repertoire, but is not specifically written with performance in mind. Rather, it provides valuable context for every song in the repertoire and complete composer biographies. Prospective buyers should read \\"How to use this book\\" (pg. xxxi) for more information about the rigorous cross-referencing and indexing that are among its most useful features.With authorship by legendary collaborative pianist Graham Johnson, performers can be sure that the most relevant information is included. Song scholar Richard Stokes provides assurance that the information provided meets the highest academic standards, evidenced also by its publication by Oxford University Press.The importance of this book to the interpretation of French song cannot be overstated.What this book does NOT have, especially compared its scholastic predecessor by Pierre Bernac, is specific instructions regarding interpretation. While this is a shame for those hoping to learn some of Graham Johnson's secrets, it avoids the inevitable conflict that arises--as in the Bernac--when contemporary interpreters choose to go against the author's performance suggestions. Further, those who have heard Mr. Johnson speak on the subject know that performing without regard for previous interpretations IS one of his secrets.All said, this is a valuable book that is worth owning rather than visiting a library for, and I do not regret a penny spent on it."},{"Title":"A French Song Companion","review":"This book never stops delivering.

If you search elsewhere, you'll see that I've reviewed another of his books with very high praise. But this one has troubled me somewhat. Some of the stories are utterly remarkable, with some truly outstanding writing. Well, *all* of them are quite well-written, researched to the hilt, and then laid out for the reader to grapple with. And grapple we do.I can't help but compare this Waldrop with the one I met in 1988. This one is far more cynical. This one has withdrawn into his own interests completely. This one is much harder to relate to. If anything, he's an even better writer than he was before. (When you do get what he's writing about, it's a knock-out blow!) Perhaps I should say, he's more eccentric?But, I think I agree with another reviewer here, in that I wondered several times...WHY was this story written? Does it stand alone, if one is unfamiliar with the research? Some of them do, yes! Others maybe do, maybe don't. Still, his senarios remain completely convincing, and one feels compelled to see them through. Overall, well worth the read (definitely!), but not as classic as his earlier stuff."},{"Title":"Going Home Again","review":"Howard Waldrop's latest collection of &quot;alternate reality&quot; SF defies all convention. His &quot;what if the Nazis won WWII&quot; story brings Shemp Howard, Zero Mostel, Peter Lorre and Brecht's widow together in an absurdist play about a journey to Mars, the Red planet. Fats Waller and Tom Wolfe hang out on a dirigible. Three Mexican luchadors fight off ancient Aztec gods. That's just the beginning. Each story also has an afterword which also solves the riddle of the alternate reality and gives an insight into Waldrop's writing process. Waldrop's books never hang around the stores for long (he has about $6 in his bank account) and his stuff can be shelved under Science Fiction, Literature or anything else.

In fact, the appearance of more than three Waldrop stories in a single year is considered by many to be one of the signs of Armageddon. Waldrop is a craftsman, sometimes nurturing ideas for years before he sits down to write. He is a genre unto himself--each story is unique.This collection is proof positive of all the statements made above--his craft and painstaking attention to detail are evident in every sentence. Over the course of nine stories, Waldrop entertains and enlightens, casting a spell over readers. You don't read a Waldrop story, you experience it. As James Blaylock states, \\"...most of them keep resonating as memories of experiences lived rather than read.\\"Four of the nine stories in this volume deal with alternate histories. \\"You Could Go Home Again,\\" finds author Thomas Wolfe and musician Fats Waller returning to the US after attending the 1940 Olympics in Japan. \\"Household Words; Or, The Powers-That-Be,\\" describes Charles Dickens at a public reading of \\"The Christmas Garland,\\" an alternate version of \\"The Christmas Carol.\\" Accompanying these tales are \\"The Effects of Alienation,\\" a story Waldrop wrote \\"to find out what effect Hitler winning World War II would have had on Peter Lorre\\", and \\"Flatfeet!,\\" a tale which, among other things, explores the theories of German philosopher Oswald Spengler, who argued that civilizations are subject to the same cycle of growth and decay as human beings. Each reads as though Waldrop is recounting actual events, convincing the reader that even if these things didn't happen, they certainly could have.Other stories include \\"The Sawing Boys\\" (a reworking of \\"The Brementown Musicians\\"), \\"Occam's Ducks\\" (a look at black American film actors of the 1920s), \\"El Castillo de la Perseverancia\\" (an \\"SF wrasslin' story\\"), \\"Scientifiction\\" (wherein a member of a race of intelligent insects visits our reality), and \\"Why Did?,\\" (featuring Benjamin Compson, Lenny Small, Rhoda Penmark and Holden Caufield as inmates of a unique asylum). Whether dealing with fairy tale writers who speak perfect Runyonese, paying tribute to his favorite character actors, or working with emotionally and mentally disturbed characters from American literature, Waldrop writes with authority and panache--his creativity is a true marvel (this is the reason the story descriptions are minimal, since part of the pleasure in reading these stories is watching the plots unfurl). Combining seemingly disparate elements into a cohesive whole, he extracts every drop of story value from his subject matter.In his introduction, Waldrop says that \\"the stories, contrary to the popular notion, have gotten harder, not easier to do as time goes on.\\" He obviously sweats the details, which explains both the quality and paucity of his output. It's also clear he feels compelled to write, despite the fact that \\"You absolutely cannot make a living writing short stories...\\" Be of good cheer, though, because Waldrop promises to keep writing as long as editors keep buying and readers keep reading. I'm not worried about readers, because Waldrop makes fans easily. Editors, however, should take heed--it would be a crime to let a natural resource like this go to waste."},{"Title":"Going Home Again","review":"What do the following have in common?Keystone Kops, vampires, werewolves, mummies, and Oswald Spengler!

All the Texas science fiction writers were there, plus writers from Oklahoma and New Mexico and Louisiana (there were, and are, more of them than you might think), and the climax of the weekend was always The Howard Waldrop Show. Howard would read a recently-completed story (which might have taken a decade to write) to an SRO audience, complete with costumes and visual aids. In addition to always being great fun, you could absolutely count on hearing a story that was never less than superior. It has been argued by folks who ought to know -- many of them other writers -- that Howard Waldrop, the Trout-Hunter, is among the very best science fiction writers of his generation. The problem is, most fans of hack writers like Robert Jordan have never heard of him. The problem is, Howard's rate of production makes a glacier look like an Olympic sprinter. He's written one novel and co-authored another in the past thirty years (he has two more he's been working on for several decades), but his forte is the short story, of which this volume is the fifth collection. All the nine stories here are well worth reading, though my favorites are \\"Scientifiction\\" and (especially) \\"Flat Feet!,\\" which combines Hollywood, Attorney General Palmer, and Oswald Spengler. Waldrop is droll, arcane, erudite, and extremely inventive, and his stories require some knowledge and participation on the part of the reader; maybe that's why today's younger sf readers don't appreciate them. But they don't get much better than this. Long may he wave."},{"Title":"Going Home Again","review":"I'd heard people talking about Howard Waldrop, but I'd never read him before (except maybe one story).

And the introductions are just as interesting."},{"Title":"Going Home Again","review":"Since this is the 4th Waldrop collection I've read, one might think praise would be effusing from me. Yet, I confess I don't get it. His stories are well-written, if lacking in narrative tug.

Of all I've read in the past, only one story - &quot;The Ugly Chickens&quot; - has the feel of a classic.

Kennedy convincingly illustrates how these white societies were able to create a distinct and unified culture. Presenting a new interpretation of white settler society, Kennedy analytically demonstrates how the social identity of white colonists was radically recast to accommodate their special circumstances. Kennedy's study is of long lasting importance to the field of African history because it reveals the powerful dynamics of solidarity within colonial societies which consequently enabled them to create and maintain a system of domination over the indigenous African population. While the majority of historians have primarily focused on the social divisions within the settler populations, Kennedy asserts that economic, ethnic, and social differences were secondary to the overriding need for unification. Kennedy remains balanced in his approach by conceding that a certain amount of social friction within the colonies cannot be denied. Yet, he also sustains that the preoccupation of Marxist historians with the internal fissures of white society neglects to appreciate the external strength of the community. Through an analysis of the particular experiences faced by white settlers, Kennedy portrays how white settler society was not simply a transfer or replication of European national traits onto colonial society in Africa. He holds, \\"this was the distinguishing feature of the settler culture: not in the cherished values of the settlers' European heritage, but in the centripetal forces that distorted that heritage by securing it against all change.\\"(192) To further establish this claim, the author effectively applies knowledge of social psychology to interpret and explain the pathological behavior of the white settlers. Kennedy's compelling argument is fully supported through his analytical utilization of many sources and statistical evidence. The extensive use of well documented private and official manuscripts further validate Kennedy's persuasive argument. Unlike many documents on colonialism, the volume appears to be written without prejudice and without reference to a preconceived view of determents. While historically solid, Kennedy's work brings a fresh, unbiased insight to the inner workings and far-reaching impact of white settler colonists. As Kennedy has firmly established in his study, &quot;Islands of White,&quot; settler culture was the expression of the white community's delicately held position of dominance in the order of imperial Africa. In order to maintain this dominance, white settlers exerted strong social power to shape and control their identity and position. The significance of Kennedy's book is in its illustration of the power group solidarity can have in shaping a community and its neighbors."},{"Title":"Larson, duke of Mongolia,","review":"Reading this extraordinarily modest book, you have to read between the lines to understand the whole. A Swede goes out to Mongolia as a missionary in 1893 and winds up staying for 35 years, dropping out of the proselytization biz early on. He starts dealing in horses and in some fashion ends up as advisor to top Mongols, knowing everyone in the vast grasslands, and loving the Mongol way of life. You find out very few personal details. He came to know Mongolia as few Westerners ever did, pace Marco Polo. He married an American missionary, he got rich, but he never became a writer, just penning this most matter-of-fact description of life among the nomads, lamas, and princes of that faroff land back in the days before the commissars turned it into a mini-Stalinist hell for 30 years. I was sure, after reading this most fascinating book, that Larson was not responsible for the title. The publishers no doubt tacked those words on to attract attention. He never mentions this \\"duke\\" deal. The author's descriptions are full of color and life, even if his style is somewhat dry. He gives details of marriage and other life cycle ceremonies, of nomad daily life, of the Mongols' love of horses, of the Living Buddha who ruled spiritually from Urga (now Ulaan Baatar), of missionaries, merchants, and the political history of his times. Trained anthropologists might have written more technically about various aspects of society, but Larson's description is anthropological without any effort. Roy Chapman Andrews may be more dashing, with colorful episodes of hunting and dinosaur eggs, but Larson is the real McCoy. If you want to know about Mongolia back in the period 1895-1925, you should get your hands on this book."},{"Title":"The Facts on File Dictionary of Weather And Climate (Science Dictionary)","review":"The revised edition of Dictionary of Weather & Climate offers high school and college-level collections over 2,000 cross-referenced entries defining and exploring terms used in meteorology and climatology.

This comes with translation, however, and the work of turning it to English remains highly poetic, beautiful, and was clearly the work of a master in both languages. The other detraction is a stylistic one. Mahfouz's chapters all follow the same basic formula: Qindil arrives in a new place; Qindil's guide gives him a brief rundown of it; Qindil explores the city; Qindil meets with a religious leader; Quindil gets in trouble because of a woman; Qindil leaves.If you get past that, which seems not to be an insurmountable request, the work is an incredibly well crafted piece which explores the depth behind religion, religious freedom, hedonism, tolerance, perfection, and humanity.If you like John Steinbeck or Toni Morrison, you're likely to enjoy Mahfouz as well. Clearly, he is a writer who puts considerable thought into the meaning, the higher purpose, of his work."},{"Title":"Journey of Ibn Fattouma, The","review":"A young Muslim undertakes this allegorical journey to to reach the Utopian land so often described in the books he hasread. As he travels from one land to another, he is exposed to values, beliefs, and cultures so alien from his own, he isforced to reconsider his beliefs and ideals which he holds so dearly. Slowly he begins to undertand the power ofinterpreting a situation in its real context, rather than a percieved one tainted with dogmatic beiefs of the world fromwhich he has arrived."},{"Title":"Journey of Ibn Fattouma, The","review":"This book is nowhere near as rich as the Cairo Trilogy. It doesn't have the same level of depth of thought and is too short to give you that panoramic of Middle Eastern mentality that he does in the Trilogy.That said its a quick read. It has a few interesting thoughts on man's search for the perfect way of life. It often seems like a scant political commentary, but Mahfouz's book doesn't have to be limited to politics. It goes beyond, somewhat reminiscent of Siddhartha to pursuing something very individual.However, I wonder if the translation is really giving me the full picture. Compared to other translated works I've read by Mahfouz, this one seems overly simplified. Like reading a children's book at times."},{"Title":"Journey of Ibn Fattouma, The","review":"Mahfouz is a very talented writer. The literature is very rich and the devices he uses contribute to the fascination of the reader with the character of Ibn Fattouma. At times even, readers will become vicariously sullen or extatic because of the skillful characterization. The concepts in this book about post-modern religion and the role of an intellectual are great fodder for discussion and will keep people who love to think engaged for a while, but the plot is not as strong as the writing or interpretative aspects. The debacles that Fattouma faces on his journey are not very engaging always and at times deviate from realism (deviation from conceptual implications). When reading the book, I imagine that most people will be waiting anxiously for the next glimpse into Fattouma's psychology and analysis of the world around him and few will pay attention to the actual plot and sideplots."},{"Title":"Journey of Ibn Fattouma, The","review":"After reading three previous book by Naguib Mahfouz, I figured I hadn't read anything impressive so why read any more. However, I came across a couple of his books at a library sale so I picked them up cheap. I must admit, I found \\"The Journey of Ibn Fattouma\\" an enjoyable and interesting book. It was a bit simplistic (all of the four books I've read by Mahfouz qualify as novellas). In it, we follow the title character as he searches for the land of perfection. Along the way, he visits 5 different States each unique in one or more aspects. Ibn Fattouma discovers that each unique aspect of each State has its' appeal but is ultimately a destructive trait that challenges his Islamic faith.I won't go into details since the book is easily read and understood. However, I will say that I appreciated how his brief observations and experiences gave a clear and impressive understanding of the world through the eyes of a Muslim.

Each of these countries shows social and political institutions similar to the ones we know, be it a kingdom, a democracy or a totalitarian regime and with much humour Mr Mahfouz depicts in a fairytale like prose the absurdities of each system.The last chapter is called The Beginning because after visiting five lands, Gebel finally comes into view far in the distance on top of the Green Mountain and Quindil is about to ascend its winding path."},{"Title":"Journey of Ibn Fattouma, The","review":"I am a fan of Naguib Mafouz, and I eagerly picked this novel up, hoping that it would be as transporting as Arabian Nights and Days. The journey of Ibn Fattouma disappoints: it has nowhere near the lyricism of Arabian Nights and Days or the sophisticated interweaving of fable, magic and reality.Readers who enjoyed the Cairo Trilogy, a series of three realistic novels, and who want to sample Mafouz' more iridescent writing should not start with this book. That written, The Journey of Ibn Fattouma does have things to offer those interested in political science, false utopias, or even fledgling democracies.Others reviews on the page have eloquently captured the different societies that Ibn Fattouma visits on his journey to Gebel. I wondered throughout the book if this was a parable for the Tower of Babel, a story found in the Christian Old Testament, the Hebrew Talmud and the Muslim Koran. In the story as I know it, God punished the Summerians for building a tower to heaven because they were trying to become God, or at least outshine him. The Tower becomes a symbol for perfection, and like many perfections, an unobtainable one. Thus, it was interesting to me that after Ibn Fattouma visits all these supposedly perfect societies Haira, Halba, Aman ('hope' in Arabic), he finally reaches Gebel, situated on a mountain."},{"Title":"Journey of Ibn Fattouma, The","review":"It is a wonderful masterpiece as 1984.

Finally is the libertine (like mashreq) yet ordered (like hayra) hilba ( an egyptian sweet made up of many mixed ingredients, a melting pot if you will) where the muslims drink wine, suggestive of america. Ibn Fatouma choses none of these in the end, and goes on to utopia (gebel or mountain), stopping on the way to &quot;cleanse&quot; himself at the land of the tree, a suggestively bhuddist like area, before :heaven? what will? what should?"},{"Title":"Journey of Ibn Fattouma, The","review":"This short novel offers a very interesting and contemplative exploration of the difficult political systems.

Visits with different societies, with different governments and the wise men who define and idealize \`their' systems also show failures from wars and inequities as our \`hero' visits and twice finds loves to settle in with local wives and families. Less monothematic than Voltaire's Dr. Pangloss in Candide, the story has some of the same broad strokes and encourages pause for reflection. We learn he will likely reach the goal of his quest but will never know whether he chose to stay or was unable to return to teach his homeland. We reflect on the character of our own state and life. All is not for the best in the best of all possible worlds (with apologies to Dr. Pangloss)."},{"Title":"Journey of Ibn Fattouma, The","review":"But perhaps this is the truth in Mahfouz' words; there is not always fulfillment. Ibn's journey was enchanting, although his attitudes sometimes thwarted me. He is in a constant state of contradiction. His constant dreams of a &quot;settled&quot; life never hold true becuase of his restless heart. Half the book I spent convinced he brought upon his own heartache by the constancy of his travels [and leaving Samia], but the other half I was content to think it was the laws of the lands that molded his fate.

But the Journey of Ibn Fattouma was a stunning disappointment: it's a collection of simple morality tales that seem to me, at best good for children or young adults. The writing has none of the artistry of a Borges or Calvino, which was my hope: it feels flat-footed and plods aimlessly along from place to place, a bit like the protagonist of the fables. Indeed, for somebody interested in rich journeys to imaginary places, Calvino'sInvisible Citiesis a far, far better book, a masterpiece in comparison.

These are fun stories to be read with one eyebrow cocked, for they were doubtless written tongue-in-cheek.The cover blurb of the 1964 paperback is \\"The damndest book you ever read.\\" I might not go THAT far, but it's a fun read, and comes from a guy whose creative net stretches across the Arizona horizon."},{"Title":"Genocide in satellite Croatia, 1941-1945: A record of racial and religious persecutions and massacres","review":"One of the great books written about Croatian genocide against Serbs and Vatican's involment in this holocaust.

However, the author's writing style differs greatly between names, and I was somewhat dissapointed with this book."},{"Title":"Sleeping Arrangements","review":"Although I adore this author, I prefer her much more as Sophie Kinsella. When she writes as Madeleine Wickham she lacks the wit and humor that won me over. The characters in this book are not particularly likable and share very different values than I do. Subjects like infidelity, teenage sex and teenage substance abuse are taken very lightly and almost passed off as nothing. The ending seemed a little too picture perfect for the \\"realness\\" and meatiness of the rest of the book and basically left me no better and no worse for having read the book."},{"Title":"Sleeping Arrangements","review":"I am a HUGE fan of the Shopaholic series so I eagerly embraced this series of books by Madeleine Wickham. That being said, I felt as though the characters were stiff and I found I couldn't relate to them. Two families find themselves sharing a villa for vacation, and unbeknownst to the rest of the family one wife and the other husband used to be lovers. Akward? To say the least! However I just was even interested enough in the situation and story to even finish the book which is highly unusual for me. The story just seemed to drag from one angry depressing moment to the next. I think I'll just stick to the Shopaholic series and leave Madeline Wickham books alone."},{"Title":"Sleeping Arrangements","review":"Having read most of Sophie Kinsella's novels, I was eager to dive into her work under her real name, Madeleine Wickham. What I have found is that the Kinsella works are more like adult fairy tales, where everything works out with a happy ending. In her Wickham works, the endings are more true to real life. So if you are wanting a fantasy happy ending, please do not bother with the Wickham works as they will be too much of a downer for you.Now on to the actual book. I enjoyed \\"The Gatecrasher\\" much better. I felt that these characters were way too self-absorbed. Each one wanted to meet the desires of his or her own Id constantly. Amanda actually turned out to be my favorite character of all, mainly because she acted like a real person to me. The rest were too one sided. I hated the Nanny in the book as I felt she was way over the top. I did enjoy the ending because it didn't have the fairy tale ending. It gave a real-ending to the problems presented in the novel.As for future reading, I think I am going to stick to her lighter fare under Sophie Kinsella."},{"Title":"Sleeping Arrangements","review":"I usually love this author. I knew exactly what was going to happen next. Very disapointing."},{"Title":"Sleeping Arrangements","review":"Maybe I'm outgrowing chick lit? Or maybe this was just crap. I'm not sure. The last few chick lit books I've read have not really been enjoyable to me, so I'm sort of leaning towards the former; but maybe I'm just making bad choices. There were not any characters in this book that I liked. They are all reprehensible, selfish and annoying. Two families are thrown together in the same house for a week of holiday and it's starting to look like it wasn't an accident. The books that Wickham wrote under the pen name Sophi Kinsella are highly enjoyable fun. But the ones written under her own name have been barely more than average in my opinion. This one is just pretty bad. I wish I could go back to my self two weeks ago and take this away."},{"Title":"Sleeping Arrangements","review":"It's hard to believe that Sophie Kinsella wrote this. She's come a long way in her writing since then. It was almost like a child wrote this book. Her books since and including the Shopaholic series are clever, witty and the characters are always endearing. These characters were very one-dimensional. It had a nice premise but just didn't follow through for me."},{"Title":"Sleeping Arrangements","review":"I can see how this book might have been pretty interesting as a character study, unfortunately, I didn't like any of the characters. They seemed just a little off and a bit phony - not quite two-dimensional, but flat in some respects. And a lot unbelievable in others, especially in ways that screamed convenience, plot-wise. Speaking of plot... it was a bit thin, as well. Sure, the main premise was understandable enough, the old ploy of throwing enemies in together and seeing what happens. But the problem is that nothing really extraordinary or interesting does happen. It's all very predictable and clich&eacute;d, and the ending is a complete disappointment.On the up side, the writing was very easy to read and I sped through the book in one sitting.I wouldn't particularly recommend this book to anyone, but the writing this author has done under the name 'Sophie Kinsella' is far, far better and I suggest you check out those before you pick up this one."},{"Title":"Sleeping Arrangements","review":"Chloe is just about ready to pull her hair out, so her family's Spanish vacation is coming at a perfect time. She, her partner Philip, and her two kids, Sam and Nat, desperately need the time away, so she's thankful that her old friend Gerard has offered them his villa. All of a sudden a little unsettled about the fact that she and Philip have been together for years but never gotten married, Chloe wants to use the trip to figure out what their relationship means. Philip needs to stop worrying about work and just relax, but it's hard knowing that your bank has just been bought out by a bigger company and no one knows yet who will be fired.Hugh Stratton is looking for the chance to finally get to know his two young daughters, Octavia and Beatrice. He needs a break from his busy job at a large conglomerate bank. His wife, Amanda, just needs to calm down and de-stress. She feels like a single mother and is quite the control freak, keeping tabs on the staff remodeling her house while they're gone. She's even hired a nanny, Jenna, to watch the girls so that she and Hugh can have some quality time alone.The Strattons have just managed to find the villa and settle down and relax when strangers drive up to the door, claiming that it's their villa. It could be a simple mistake, except they all know Gerard. They decide that the only thing to do is to try to fit all nine of them in the house. It's big enough, physically, but it can barely contain all of the personalities inside.It wouldn't be all that awful to share a vacation with another family, except no one knows that Chloe and Hugh have a history together. As they're grappling with what being back together means, Chloe's 16-year-old son Sam is smitten with Jenna, whose attempts at relaxing everyone (\\"Stocking up on the old cigarettes and booze. Joke!\\") just makes them even more tense. Then another connection between the two families surfaces --- this time between the men. Both families are more and more annoyed, and the couples are oblivious to the kids and Jenna learning that maybe this wasn't a mistake after all.SLEEPING ARRANGEMENTS is an entertaining romp akin to any comedy of manners. If Shakespeare lived now and dealt with children, nannies, vacations and layoffs, he'd be proud. There's just enough comedy and romance to make this book about a vacation a perfect vacation read. Or beach read. Or weekend read. Wickham, who also writes as Sophie Kinsella, is an old pro at comedic tales that surpass the normal boundaries of chick lit. The story and its characters are lovable and dimensional. Everyone in it is grounded and human, and no one walks into the story with a Cinderella life that can't be explained. These are all people with complicated histories, which do even more for the relationships they have and develop with the others.Love and marriage, sang Frank Sinatra, go together like a horse and carriage. But it's much more complicated than that, says Wickham. Her novel shows us the many nuances that come with any long-lasting, functional relationship. Still a quick enough read, SLEEPING ARRANGEMENTS will leave any reader satisfied.--- Reviewed by Sarah Hannah G&oacute;mez"},{"Title":"Sleeping Arrangements","review":"Each new release by Madeleine Wickham (or Sophie Kinsella, for that matter) excites me to no end.

This is the story of two families who are struggling -- one with tension about a possible job loss, the other with redecorating crises. Both desperately need a vacation, and both have been promised the loan of a lovely villa in Spain by a family friend. Unfortunately, they have all been promised the same villa on the same week. Hilarity ensues. Well, no, not actual hilarity, but a more mature variation of hilarity -- hidden pasts, new beginnings, uncertain endings. Wickham is a clever writer and she creates believable, complex characters within a few lines, but I didn't find this cast too likable, nor was I very interested in their problems. Still, it's always a pleasure to read a master, and Wickham is a gifted writer."},{"Title":"Sleeping Arrangements","review":"Like many other readers I came to explore Wickham's books because I enjoyed the shopaholic series she wrote as Sophie Kinsella. Unfortunately I have found the other books she has written both as Wickham and Kinsella (as well as to some extent the later books in the Shopaholic series) to be a mixed bag. Some, likeRemember Me?andSwimming Pool SundayI have found to be well written, enjoyable reads. In others (especiallyThe Gatecrasher) I found the characters to be underdeveloped and quite frankly, unlikeable. Thankfully this book for me fell somewhere in the middle. It wasn't as entertaining as the shopaholic series, but I found the story line compelling and more relatable than in some of her other books.Sleeping Arrangementstells the story of the drama that ensues when a friend double books two families in his Spanish villa for the same weekend. As if the chaos of cramped corners wasn't enough, forbidden romance develops and old secrets rise to the surface. All throughout Wickham also throws in unexpected twists and turns along the way to keep the story interesting and allow us to see different sides of the characters.Even still, this book felt about an mile wide and an inch deep. I enjoyed the general story line of the book and found it to be compelling, but I couldn't want to know more about the characters. I felt like I really didn't get enough of their back stories to really understand their motivations or personalities. They seemed likeable and realistic enough, but I wanted to know more to truly get involved in their stories.I also did not care for where some of the storylines ended up at the end of the book. I did like that like some of her other books she left the ending very open ended, while still resolving some of the major issues in the book. However, some aspects seemed too quickly resolved.Overall though I still enjoyed this book. It was definitely not as funny or involving as the Shopaholic series, but still was written in a compelling manner with enough twists and turns to hold the reader's attention. If you've never read any of Kinsella's/Wickham's books I would highly recommend starting with the Shopaholic series first. If you've already read the Shopaholic series and are looking to branch out, this is definitely one of her better reads. However, I will say that I thinkRemember Me?andSwimming Pool Sundayare more enjoyable reads."},{"Title":"Sleeping Arrangements","review":"This was my first Madeleine Wickham book.

Stellar supporting characters arrive in the form of the inscrutable Ice Queen Amanda, the wily villa owner Gerard, and the brilliantly cheeky nanny Jenna. As with Kinsella/Wickham's other novels, the strength and complexity of the characters, as well as a delicious finale ending, are what transcend her books from the confines of an otherwise predictable chick lit plot.Add in the gorgeous descriptions of Spain (picturesque villa, lemon trees, oh yes), and the semi-predictable plot can be forgiven by a book that begins playfully and ends perfectly.

To what, we don't know.When Gerard loans each of them the villa (telling them separately, of course), they each think they're in for a delightful holiday.Hugh and Amanda arrive first and have already settled in, with their children and their outspoken nanny Jenna, when Chloe and Philip and their two children descend.A great deal of chaos ensues as they try to straighten it all out. Well, the house is huge, after all...they'll just make do.But what unfolds in the following days is the unlayering of secrets, old wounds, lost love--while other unimaginable events transpire to turn this into so much more than a routine vacation in Spain.Will the past histories of the individuals be revealed? Can they go back in time and change the choices they made years before, and if so, what will these choices mean for their futures? And did Gerard plan and manipulate these events for some unknown agenda of his own?You'll find the answers in these pages, but while you're discovering it all, you'll have a rollicking good time exploring the relationships between the characters and coming to understand, with them, that sometimes, you just can't go back.A lively, enjoyable read, I gave it five stars."},{"Title":"Sleeping Arrangements","review":"I was a little leary of reading this book after reading the reviews but I thought I would give it a try.

Chloe is a seamstress who is tired of squeezing women in dresses a size smaller than they really wear and a recent takeover in Philip's company has left him wondering if he will have a job in the near future.Amanda and Hugh are going through a rough patch in their marriage. Philip is obsessed with work and spends so little time with his family that his children barely even know him and Amanda is currently stressing the redecoration of their home.When both families receive an invitation to their friend Gerard's villa they each look forward to a restful week in Spain. What they find out when they arrive is that Gerard has accidentally double booked his villa and they end up having to share it as every hotel in the area is fully booked.To make matters worse Chloe and Hugh were once a couple whose relationship ended badly and their respective spouses have no knowledge of the past relationship. Faced with the shared sleeping arrangements stress mounts between the couples and soon all the adults are fighting between themselves and Chloe and Hugh are drawn to each other again.Overall I thought the book was an okay read but I was a little disappointed in it. I love Wickham's writing as Sophie Kinsella in the Shopaholic series and really enjoyed The Wedding Girl by her but Sleeping Arrangements was a let down. The characters were not as likeable as characters in her other books. Hugh is a major jerk throughout the whole book, Philip's lack of a backbone was annoying, Amanda is too uptight and Chloe was just not likeable. The only bright spot in the book was the nanny, Jenna. She had a weird sense of humor and always made the scenes she was in surprising. I'm really on the fence about recommending this one so I'll say read it if it's readily available but I don't recommend searching it out."},{"Title":"Sleeping Arrangements","review":"In case you aren't aware, Madeleine Wickham is none other than the true identity of Sophie Kinsella, the author of the popular Shopaholic novels. Wickham uses her real name when she wants to write edgier chick lit (is there even such a thing?). In my experience, I've found that I don't like Wickham's novels as much as Kinsella's; the lack of character growth was a frustration in The Gatecrasher, and it seems that trend has continued in Sleeping Arrangements.I did enjoy Sleeping Arrangements and found it to be quite amusing. The main character, Chloe, was an appealing character, and surprisingly, Amanda was more than she first appeared to be as well. Philip was a bit frustrating, but eventually grew into a better character. The real disappointment lied in Hugh. He was shallow and flighty, and I just flat out disliked him. I understood the nature of his past with Chloe, and why there was an attraction between them, but it really seemed like there was no reason for her to be attracted to the person he had become. I really just didn't like the character.Besides that, the book is fine. It's nothing remarkable, but it's an enjoyable chick lit read that is mindlessly entertaining. Anyone will probably have fun reading it, but promptly forget about it as soon as they move on to their next book. Those of you who haven't read any of her work, stick with Sophie Kinsella. Remember Me? was funny, had a great storyline, and was thoroughly enjoyable - read that one instead of this!"},{"Title":"Sleeping Arrangements","review":"I was surprised a bit by this book, in that I was expecting a very Shopaholic type of story since this is the same author for those books as well (though she writes under a different name, Sophie Kinsella). Instead, I got a story that was a lot more family and relationship oriented, which is not a bad thing at all. Just different. Despite this surprise, I really enjoyed what I read, and the story is a very funny romp about a summer vacation gone awry. It is a great summer beach book and will make you chuckle quite a bit. Just don't expect to get a Shopaholic like story from it! I would recommend it."},{"Title":"Sleeping Arrangements","review":"I should start by saying that I am normally a huge fan of any book written under Madeleine Wickham's nom de plume of Sophie Kinsella. That's probably why I felt that this book was such a disappointment. I went into it expecting wit and charm, but I found myself feeling completely let down and unenthusiastic about finishing the book.My first issue is that characters. There are very few books out there where you look at all of the characters and just think that they are all horrible. I've read books with sociopaths and serial killers that had more decency than these characters. They all seem to be lacking perspective and none seems to truly realize just how good their lives are. They find excuses for their behavior, whether it's rage over a lost lover or depression over being kicked to the curb by your employer. It almost seems like when toddlers end up in a massive pinching session and blame it on another kid because the other person started it. I just wanted to scream at them for their petty attitudes and bickering.Other than the annoying characters, the book was extremely boring. There was very little flow to the story. There was nothing fun or enlightening. The book was just kind of a \\"what I did on my summer vacation\\" essay from elementary school that was stretched out over 300+ pages. I think an elementary school student would have probably come up with something a bit more compelling, though.There were some parts that I did like about this book, but the bad completely outweighed the good. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone I know, unless I really and truly thought that they deserved to be bored out of their mind."},{"Title":"Sleeping Arrangements","review":"I have read quite a few of Miss Wickham's/Kinsella's books, but was rather disappointed with this one. I just didn't care about any of the characters. It was an easy read and vaguely entertaining, though predictable. But I can't really recommend it. Try Gatecrasher or something by Marian Keyes or Isabel Wolff instead."},{"Title":"Sleeping Arrangements","review":"I love Sophie Kinsella's books and thought I would enjoy one with her as Madeleine Wickham, but this was just not even close to the quality I was expecting from her. I found myself quickly skimming just to get to the end and call it a day. It was not a \\"page-turner\\" in a positive sense of the phrase. I did not feel attached to any particular characters. The plot jumped around which made certain excerpts seem pointless to the storyline. The nanny was just downright annoying. I'm all for characters you love to hate, but there was no love here. The whole reason behind the two families getting stuck at the same villa was stupid. I was hoping for a clever reason behind it all, but I was extremely let down."},{"Title":"Sleeping Arrangements","review":"I agree with the average rating - this is a solid 3 stars. I like Madeleine Wickham's writing because it's definitely different than when she writes as Sophie Kinsella. It's certainly less fluffy. There were some cute, sweet parts of the novel. But there were also some grittier aspects of the plot that I wasn't really expecting. It delves a lot more into marriage (dysfunctional ones) and relationships (husband/wife, lovers, parent/child) than I realized. It's a bit more serious than a fun, vacation read. I thought it was going to be pretty predictable, but there were some twists at the end that I didn't see coming. Overall, it was a good read, just not as good as some of Madeleine Wickham's other books."},{"Title":"Sleeping Arrangements","review":"Madeleine Wickham (aka Sophie Kinsella, author of the popular Shopaholic series) explores this question in Sleeping Arrangements. Two married couples are at a crossroads. Hugh has spent so much of his life climbing the corporate ladder he has had no time for his family. His wife Amanda has turned her considerable energy to renovating and redecorating every square inch of their home. Hugh's former girlfriend Chloe is an overworked dressmaker whose partner (never to be husband) Phil is facing to possibility of being laid off from his unsatisfying bank job. The two couples both accept an invitation to vacation in Spain, unaware that their mutual friend has deliberately double booked the families. Chaos ensues as four unhappy adults interact and, in one case, rekindle a romance. Can these relationships weather this storm? Finding out is great fun as Wickham uses her trademark wit to look at the stresses and strains which result after the first bloom of romance has faded. This is not as riotously funny as some of her other books but a cheerful and thoughtful book."},{"Title":"Sleeping Arrangements","review":"Sleeping Arrangements is the \\"newest\\" installment from Madeline Wickham (aka Sophie Kinsella of the Shopaholic series). First published in the UK in 2001, Sleeping Arrangements is newly released in the United States. It was easy to get caught up in the holiday arrangements gone awry storyline. Chloe who once loved Hugh, but is now raising two boys with Phillip, is off to a family holiday in a borrowed villa in Spain. Hugh, who is now married to Amanda and the father of two girls, is also on his way to Spain for a much needed family holiday at the villa generously loaned by his old school friend Gerard.With a sharp eye for human foibles and current storylines, Wickham brings the once lovers together and lets the fun begin. Can Hugh convince Chloe he made a mistake when he left without an explanation all those years ago? With the merger of the bank Philip works at with a huge computer firm, is Phillip in danger of losing his job? Will Amanda ever get the wallpaper hangers to stay on the phone? Will Chloe finally be able to understand Hugh's abandonment? This is a quick read and doesn't require much investment. There is one side story line involving the nanny and a teenager that I found distasteful. The story moves quickly and the dialog is sharp. That having been said, this was a fun summer read."},{"Title":"Sleeping Arrangements","review":"As always, Madeleine Wickham (Sophie Kinsella) has an amazing sense of humour and timing in her books. I enjoyed it from front to back."},{"Title":"Sleeping Arrangements","review":"This was a completely ordinary book. Not good, nor bad. I picked it up knowing exactly what I was going to get, and I got it. So I honestly cannot sit here complaining.The story is pretty straightforward. Two families looking for an escape from their ordinary lives and problems decide to take up their friend on his offer of lending them his villa in Spain. Here's the catch - unbeknownst to the families, their friend has promised both of them the luxury of his villa on the SAME week. Chloe and her family arrive at the villa shocked to find it already occupied by Hugh and his family. Not only that, but Chloe is shocked to find that out of ALL people, it had to be Hugh she runs into.Chloe and Hugh - predictably - share a secret past together that neither one of their partners are aware of. A past that took place fifteen years ago. Hence, the awkwardness and drama begins.I didn't really mind this book the way I usually might have, but that is only because I picked it up knowing not to expect any profoundness. It's a very quick, easy summer read - superficial, shallow and uncomplicated. What drama did occur, occurred quickly and painlessly.What I didn't like is that Chloe and Hugh actually slept together - and then tried to make it into an \\"I had to do this to get over it\\" thing. I mean come on, so one summer you spent every night together having sex, but that was FIFTEEN years ago. You are with your partners now, you have kids, and you have grown up, are you serious?! You are still hung up on that? What a farce.I did like the fact that they both chose to stay with their families and to work out their individual problems and move on, but I didn't like that they had to actually have sex in order to get to this eye-opening revelation. I found Chloe very annoying at certain points, and was on Philip's side most of the time, as I actually understood where he was coming from. But I found Hugh even more annoying, and pretty much just disliked him till the very end.All in all, it's a quick read. Don't expect too much and you'll be alright."},{"Title":"Sleeping Arrangements","review":"I LOVED the Shopaholic series, and I thought this would be some light, funny reading since it was by the same author. But I pretty much hated the book, as much as I hate to admit it! I read the whole thing, hoping it would get good, but as another reveiwer said, the characters were awful. I didn't like any of them. I really think any half-talented tenth grader could have written the same thing. Most of it is about Chloe, who has to be one of the whiniest, most illogical and overly emotional character ever. Everything makes her want to \\"cry out\\", even things that don't even happen. She really was so lame. My level of contempt for this character surprises me, I think it represents lazy, contrived writing. Overall, the book was just boring and left me confused as to how it could have been written by the same author who created the witty and hilarious Becky Bloomwood!!"},{"Title":"Sleeping Arrangements","review":"Sleeping Arrangements by Madeleine Wickham was a good, light read. An enjoyable story perfect for a beach day. Will definitely read more of Wickham's work."},{"Title":"Sleeping Arrangements","review":"This book is by the same woman who wrote the Shopaholic series. Had I known that, I wouldn't have bothered with it. Didn't hold my interest, and there was too much British slang for this Yankee. Others probably loved it, but it just wasn't for me."},{"Title":"Sleeping Arrangements","review":"I love this author, especially when she writes as Sophie Kinsella. This book was a fun read, but seemed too short. I enjoyed the characters, and the plot had it's share of twists and turns."},{"Title":"Sleeping Arrangements","review":"This was my first read any of Wickam/Kinsella's books. I picked up the pb version at the airport on a return trip and found it very entertaining! I found the humor, strained circumstances, characters/relationships all realistic (a bit too close to home in some cases) and, yet, enjoyable. It's an easy, light read that I highly recommend. Will plan to read other books by this author, just not sure which series to choose."},{"Title":"Sleeping Arrangements","review":"I really enjoyed this story. It was a good \\"fluff\\" book, just fun reading. I recommend this to anyone who has enjoyed Sophie Kinsella stories."},{"Title":"Sleeping Arrangements","review":"I loved Confessions of a Shopaholic so much that as soon as I finished it, I ordered Shopaholic Takes Manhattan from Amazon. While waiting for that book to arrive, I stumbled across this book in the bargain section at Barnes & Noble and picked it up since it was written by the same author. Unfortunately for me, it did not live up to my (high) expectations.To start, I will say that it was well written and I enjoyed reading the dialogue very much. Wickham/Kinsella writes such honest and realistic dialogue that really shapes and builds each of her characters so well. Having said that, I found the use of the phrases \\"Right!\\" and \\"Joke!\\" to be over done and just really kind of strange. I didn't get it! Ultimately, I didn't find the main storyline particularly compelling, which is unfortunate, and I also had a hard time understanding what some of the sub-plots had to do with the story at all (example: Sam & Jenna's tryst and the constant joint-smoking references throughout the novel).Wickham's writing seemed to lack the very thing that makes her works as Kinsella so engrossing - a sharp wit and humerous prose that will make you laugh out loud as you read. I'm sad to report that this book just didn't do it for me. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't as good as I had expected - it was just OK. I will continue to read this author's work because I know how good it can be.Lucky for me, Shopaholic Takes Manhattan arrived today so I can start fresh on that one tomorrow!"},{"Title":"Sleeping Arrangements","review":"I have read all of Sophie Kinsella's novels, but \\"Sleeping Arrangements\\" was my first by \\"Madeleine Wickham\\". It was alright- I read it fast, it was a very quick read good for the beach or the swimming pool. It wasn't as funny and witty as her Sophie Kinsella novels, but I will surely look into her other novels by \\"Madeleine Wickham\\".. The only thing that I didn't like about this book was the ending left a bitter taste in my mouth and I found myself thinking \\"That's it!?\\" Worthwhile read though."},{"Title":"Sleeping Arrangements","review":"This is a great book. Fun easy reading! I have read alot of Sophie Kinsella books and didn't know that Madeleine Wickham is the same author. I plan to buy and read others by her"},{"Title":"Sleeping Arrangements","review":"As a big fan of Madeline Wickham (aka Sophie Kinsella), I was excited to see this novel at the local bookstore. Although the characters depicted in Sleeping arrangements are more mature in age than previous works by Wickham, they lack the depth and likeability typically portrayed by Wickham. This book is a quick read and enjoyable, but overall I would recommend skipping Sleeping Arrangements and reading one of Mrs. Wickham's other books; Cocktails for Three or The Wedding Girl."},{"Title":"Sleeping Arrangements","review":"Sophie Kinsella (writing here as Madeleine Wickham) is a fabulous writer, but this book does not let that show. Sleeping Arrangements is full of characters that are hard to like and situations that are just awkward. After you slog through the book you come to an absolutely boring ending, but in all honesty you're just glad it's wrapping up. Don't give up on Sophie's later work because of this; she gets much better!"},{"Title":"Sleeping Arrangements","review":"This book was a little rough to start, had no idea what to expect, While I love all her writings... this one didn't seem like my style of reading...boy was I wrong! I couldn't put it down after chapter 2! Very Good!!"},{"Title":"Sleeping Arrangements","review":"Winsome is the best word to describe this book...it is a breezy, delightful story about domestic troubles and the allure of past romance. If you liked any of the Sophie Kinsella books, you will want to read this one. It's the same author!!!"},{"Title":"Sleeping Arrangements","review":"If you enjoyed the Shopaholic series which Wickham penned as Sophie Kinsella, you'll relish Sleeping Arrangements, especially as narrated by actress Katherine Kellgren. She has an appealing voice that easily expresses emotions with inflection or tone. Having appeared on the stage in London, New York, and Frankfurt, she's also a whiz at accents (many will remember her well for her reading of a Princess Diana bio). Careful listeners will note with appreciation how she carries off a change in the perfectionist, Amanda.Speaking of Amanda, she has a new kitchen which is her pride and joy. She's wed to Hugh, who labors almost 24/7 to keep her in the style she wishes. Nonetheless, Amanda always seems to find something else that needs to be bought or done. They have two young children, but Hugh feels like he's on a constant treadmill. What he needs is a respite, a vacation.Relief comes in the form of his good friend, Gerard, who lends the couple his luxurious villa in Spain.Chloe also needs a vacation from making wedding dresses. Her partner, Philip, has worries of his own - he's concerned that the takeover of his company may cost him his job. This once happy couple is enduring a strained relationship. You may have guessed - help comes in the form of Gerard who offers Chloe the use of his Spanish villa.Now, leave it to Wickham - Gerard has put both couples in the villa at the same time, and Chloe and Hugh aren't strangers - he's the guy who stole her heart some years back. What a mix-up or was it?Sparkling dialogue, likable, amusing characters, sharp wit are Wickham's trademarks, and they're all at the fore in this winsome, winning romance.- Gail Cooke"}]`),H={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:A,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},C={class:"card-container"},L=["disabled"],x={key:0},P={key:1};function M(n,a,s,u,r,i){const c=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[a[1]||(a[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",C,[(e(!0),t(g,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),w(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",P,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",x,"See more"))],8,L)):p("",!0)])}const B=d(H,[["render",M],["__scopeId","data-v-6d3d456f"]]),E=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/10.md","filePath":"quotesmag/10.md"}'),W={name:"quotesmag/10.md"},q=Object.assign(W,{setup(n){return(a,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(B)]))}});export{E as __pageData,q as default};
