It contains a section on why some peoples and societies came to dominate others. Guns, Germs and Steel is that section made into a book.I found this detracted from my interest somewhat, as I was already aware of Diamond's broad conclusions and why he had reached them before starting the book (conversely, I found that section of The Third Chimpanzee very interesting). I have no regrets, though. Reading the books in the order they were published allows us to understand Diamond's thoughts and research better, as we get to follow his progress.I talked in my earlier review of The Third Chimpanzee about the dangers of man-with-a-hammer syndrome (those who focus only on a narrow discipline are likely to interpret all findings through a single, distorted lens - just as a man equipped only with a hammer tends to see everything as a nail). Jared Diamond is an exemplar of the opposite: he started off in medical research, then pursued a parallel second career in bird ecology, evolution and biogeography and is (or was) learning his twelfth language. I greatly admire the way he synthesizes huge amounts of data across several disciplines to arrive at his striking conclusions.Guns, Germs and Steel - as with another book on Munger's list of twenty recommended books, Garrett Hardin's Living Within Limits - is both a terrific book on its specific subject but also provides a superb broader example of how to think critically.A couple of examples might help to illustrate what I mean. The first is a theme of both of Diamond's first two books: searching always for the ultimate rather than the proximate explanation. Eurasian technology, germs and societal structure were key factors that allowed Eurasian societies to dominate the others. However, Diamond asserts that underlying these proximate factors were the ultimate factors of the plant and animal species available for domestication and the general geography.The availability of far better plant and animal species allowed farming and animal husbandry to take hold much earlier in Eurasia. This allowed much higher population densities - both of humans and their domesticated animals. This in turn led to a larger incidence of powerful human epidemic diseases - which in a number of cases originated from the domesticated animals. The more efficient food production and higher population densities in their turn allowed for specialisation, as societal classes could exist whose practitioners did not have to provide their own food (including professional soldiers).Thus, the ultimate factors determine the existence of the proximate factors. Most people never see beyond the proximate factors - which appear to explain the outcomes, but in fact do not. This is an extremely important lesson.Charlie Munger's mental models, for example, can be best viewed as an attempt to distil the way the world works to the simplest underlying (ultimate) reasons. This approach carries two massive benefits: if ultimate explanations exist we cannot understand how the world works (become 'wise') without knowing what they are (or even knowing that we should be searching for them). And secondly, it is much easier to remember and make use of fewer, simpler underlying factors.Once you begin looking for ultimate factors, you begin to see them everywhere. The search for underlying reasons is usually explicit (or at least implicit) in all of the really good books. Karen Pryor shows this clearly in \`Don't Shoot the Dog' (one of my favourite books that I have just re-read):\\"These principles [of training with reinforcement] are laws, like the laws of physics. They underlie all learning-teaching situations as surely as the law of gravity underlies the falling of an apple. Whenever we attempt to change behaviour, in ourselves or others, we are using these laws, whether we know it or not.\\"The second excellent example of an approach to problem solving from Diamond is one of Charlie Munger's favourites. Diamond calls it the Anna Karenina principle, after the first sentence in Tolstoy's novel:\\"Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.\\"Diamond explains what Tolstoy means: in order for a marriage to be a success, it must succeed in many different respects. The failure of any one of, for example, sexual attraction, agreement about money, child discipline or religion can doom a marriage - no matter how positive all the other factors.Diamond then uses this principle to show us why so few animals have been successfully domesticated (because every one of at least six significant factors must be present for a species to be a suitable candidate for human domestication):\\"This principle can be extended to understanding much else about life besides marriage. We tend to seek easy, single-factor explanations of success. For most important things, though, success actually requires avoiding many separate possible causes of failure.\\"This principle underlies the reasoning behind the Harvard School Commencement speech Charlie Munger gave in 1986 (included in Poor Charlie's Almanack). In it Munger inverts the problem of achieving a good and successful life by telling his audience how to virtually guarantee a miserable and unsuccessful life. By avoiding the key causes of failure, one is likely to end up with success by default: sometimes difficult problems are best solved (or even can only be solved) backwards.As Sertillanges says: \\"What is knowledge, but the slow and gradual cure of our blindness?\\" I am grateful to Diamond (and Munger, who pointed me towards him) for helping me to see a little better."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Jared Diamond's work gets to the heart of the question: how did Europeans come to colonize most of the modern world when the Africans and Chinese had such a long head start in human history? The interesting answer is notGuns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies, but rather how Europeans came to acquire those advantages much more quickly and efficiently than other societies (Native Americans, Africans, etc.) The four-part answer begins with the advantages of a dominant East-West axis (which Eurasia has) versus a dominant North-South axis (which Africa and the Americas lack). This East-West axis leads to greater success in food production, a sedantary lifestyle geared towards creating and accepting new technologies and diffusion of useful inventions, thereby giving the ability to outnumber and outfight societies who lack this natural geographic advantage. Diamond is an anthropologist who spent over 30 years studying the myriad ethnic groups of Papua New Guinea. A modern-day historian could never have written so broad a work. Diamond does not hesitate in going back tens of thousands of years continent-by-continent explaining what was and how it came to be. He makes good use of the 400 pages and is dead on most of the analysis.Alas, Diamond's greatest strength is also one of the book's weaknesses. There is a tendency to go in extreme detail in cases where this is unnecessary to make his point. There are many more pages on the various language families (and subfamilies, and sub-subfamilies) of various regions of the world than what is required. While this might be extremely appropriate for a scholarly journal, Guns, Germs and Steel is clearly intended for a mass-market audience. Occasional pacing aside issues aside, Diamond's work is surely a must-read for those grand historical debates that come up frequently politically-oriented social circles.The updated 2005 edition includes an epilogue chapter detailing the role of Japan in Guns, Germs and Steel. This was left out in the earliest editions."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"One of the most important books of our time; it single-handedly wipes out every justification for racism, and gets to the roots of why humans groups are where they are presently.

Nevertheless, I learned a lot and will read definitely read \\"Collapse.\\""},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Guns, Germs, and Steel is a great read, with provocative ideas that pose a grand unifying framework (I would not describe this as a \\"theory\\" for reasons explained below) for how to think about cultures, civilizations, and development. However, the argument is actually much more limited in scope than what the readers are liable to get out of the book--and I could not escape the feeling that Diamond was subtly encouraging in his prose the somewhat more extreme interpretation that is not necessarily warranted by his argument alone.Make no mistake: the core of the book is the comparison between whey civilizations that arose in Eurasia went farther than its counterparts in Africa, Austronesia, or the Americas, not necessarily what parameters guided the paths of development the civilizations that appeared within these mega units. The larger geographic scope and greater biological diversity within the larger mega units provided greater external limits on possible growth and development for the societies that emerged therein. So, it came to that some civilization from Eurasia would have been much more likely to conquer the Americas, rather than the other way around. But what about the different civilizations within these mega units? I don't think the framework offered by Diamond can be meaningfully used to compare, say, why the Spanish, rather than the Chinese or the Persians, came to conquer the Incas and the Aztecs. In the mega-unit framework, after all, Spanish, Chinese, and Persian civilizations are equivalent--they are all Eurasian civilizations that had access to similar natural endowments and remained in constant contact with each other, either directly or indirectly, that facilitated transfers of technology amongst them. I don't think this book can contribute much to the question of what differentiates among these civilizations (which, I'd expect, would be of much greater interest to the present day readers since, like or it not, very little of the New World civilizations survive as major forces shaping today's world.). That should belong to the realm of social sciences--as some reviewers suggest, David Landes' book might be a useful contributor.Yet, Diamond tries to superimpose his framework onto analyzing inter-civilizational differences within mega units, and that seems rather ineffectual. In the original edition of the book, the chapter on China seemed rather naive and underinformed on the topic--specifically, he seems to buy too much into the notion that a homogeneous \\"China\\" exists, both historically and at present, as opposed to a diverse \\"West.\\" The new edition (which I had not read) is supposed to contain a chapter on Japan, built on the premise of explaining the alleged uniqueness of Japan's civilization--and that'd seem even more problematic not only because of the potential inapplicability of his framework to the case as well as the disputable premise itself. Diamond's article in the June, 1998, issue of the Discover magazine sparked a storm of controversy especially for the latter reason).All in all, then, Diamond's work provides an excellent insight into why the modern world is dominated by Eurasian civilizations, but no more. Eurasia is complex enough that there is much variation to be explained within--and this book really cannot explain intra-Eurasian variation. Readers should constantly remind themselves of the limits of its applicability."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This was purchased to listen to during a cross country trip in the car.

Apart from their status as European countrymen, it was the fortuitous confluence of guns, microbes and steel technology which all but ensured their success at colonizing regions occupied by peoples who lacked such historical fulcrums. It should be unsurprising, given this lethal mixture of offense, why invading states comprised of so few have been able to conquer, kill or otherwise displace indigenous societies comprised of so many. These asymmetrical collisions suffuse human history, and it's no secret that its retelling lends specific favor to Eurasian societies rather than those of other landmasses.In Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies, Jared Diamond, author of The Third Chimpanzee, seeks to answer why history unfolded so differently among the various continents. Not contented with the proximate explanations listed above, Diamond forages deeper to uncover the ultimate explanations of why some societies procured that fateful triumvirate of factors and why others did not. Explicitly then, why does history record Francisco Pizarro and his confederates storming the Incan Empire and capturing Emperor Atahuallpa in that momentous 1532 collision at Cajamarca instead of Atahuallpa and his band of warriors sailing east, assaulting the Spanish Empire and seizing King Charles I? Which initial conditions facilitated the depopulation of so much of the New World by so few of the Old World?Traditional solutions to these questions often involve genetic or innate differences in race and intelligence among disparate populations, and it is these traditional explanations which Diamond hopes to sweep away. With a starting point of the tail end of the last ice age circa 13,000 years ago, Diamond takes a holistic approach to deconstructing the broad patterns of history. This is no picnic of a task. As Diamond himself points out, compressing 13,000 years of nuanced history into roughly 400 pages works out to \\"an average of about one page per continent per 150 years, making brevity and simplification inevitable\\" (408).To Diamond's great credit, Guns, Germs, and Steel represents the metamorphosis of a topic of impenetrable scope into a cohesive, persuasive and not overly prolix piece of historical literature. He begins by surveying the natural differences among the continents, noting the variations in ecological and biological diversity as well as the orientations of the main axes of the continents, all of which had deep import for the evolution of complex human societies, namely the divergence of larger food-producing cultures from smaller bands of hunter-gatherers.As it turns out, the last ice age played a significant role in the course of this progression. Compared with all other natural disasters, ice ages tend to have the most severe and lasting effects on the planet, dramatically disrupting not only climate but the chain of animal and plant life struggling to survive there. The Pleistocene ice age drove countless of the planet's large mammals to extinction, especially those indigenous to North America and Australia. Europe and Asia, on the other hand, suffered fewer local extinction events of their large animal species. This outcome presented more options (a full thirteen of the major fourteen domestic mammals were confined to Eurasia) for animal domestication, defined as the regulation of an animal's breeding and food supply.\\"Thus, part of the explanation for Eurasia's having been the main site of big mammal domestication is that it was the continent with the most candidate species of wild mammals to start with, and lost the fewest candidates to extinction in the last 40,000 years.\\" (163).Of equal importance is the inequality of wild plant species distributed across the global landscape. Here again, Eurasia is lopsidedly advantaged in terms of ecological and topographical diversity. Home to the greatest seasonal variation as well as the largest zones of temperate Mediterranean climate, Eurasia is saturated with the most diverse plant life.\\"The Fertile Crescent and other parts of western Eurasia's Mediterranean zone offered a huge selection to incipient farmers: 32 of the world's 56 prize wild grasses. That fact alone goes a long way toward explaining the course of human history.\\" (139).Diamond discusses in detail the cultural shift from hunting and gathering to food-producing, emphasizing that it was a gradual process. In those environmentally amenable regions of the globe, crop farming and pastoralism offered several benefits over the hunter-gatherer lifestyle - primarily related to time, effort and payout - and precipitated an incremental transition from complete dependence on wild foods to a diet mainly supported by food production. Peoples inhabiting less fortunate regions of the globe either carried on as nomadic hunter-gatherers or were displaced by invading farmers. Australia is perhaps the best example: as the most infertile and biologically most impoverished of the continents, it contained the largest population of hunter-gatherers into the modern era.For all of its benefits, the advent of agriculture around 8500 BC sponsored the most pestilential of side effects: increased human exposure to deadly microbes living inside domesticated animals and plants. Food-producing societies evolved resistances to these pathogens over time, or they were wiped out. First contact with foreign germs can upset the balance of a society more than any other contributing factor, and this is exactly what happened when colonizing food-producing societies encountered natives who did not share their immunities. This was, in fact, the most important factor for each of the major collisions throughout history, including the fall of the millions-strong Aztec Empire by Cortes and his mere 600 men, as well as the greatest population shift in all of human history, the initial 20 million North American Indian peoples being reduced by 95% in a matter of a century as a result of European conquest. In terms of their contribution to human depopulation, germs should clearly precede guns and steel in the book's title.To illustrate the tangential benefits of food production, Diamond enlists the reader on a voyage of deductive reasoning to link the various positive feedback loops, as he calls them. In highly paraphrased form, it is laid out as follows. Whereas the hunter-gatherer existence was nomadic, food-producing gave rise to more sedentary societies. This, combined with the fact that farming created food surpluses, provided for denser human populations. With increases in human populations came greater variety of roles to be filled within the community, facilitating the appearance of social hierarchy and political structure. The more sedentary existence meant more time could be devoted to innovation, and the denser populations meant more people who could potentially craft new metal tools, invent writing systems, and pioneer other technological leaps. This low-res snapshot can hardly do justice to the detail with which Diamond presents the material.In this way, food production served as a springboard for human innovation, which then radiated out to surrounding populations. To Eurasia's benefit again, it is the landmass with the most navigable terrain, easing the spread of agricultural and technological developments.Diamond traces the patterns of history by connecting dominant cultures to the largest environmental palettes of domesticable biota and to the regions most congenial to technological diffusion. Thus while literacy, political organization, firearms, advanced ship technology, and infectious disease are the proximate causes of Pizarro's overthrow of the Incan Empire and Vasco da Gama's success in East Africa, Diamond insists it was their ancestors' enduring success in cultivating the local flora and fauna which sits at the bedrock of history's narrative.As is the case with any work of this breadth, any assumed monolithic pattern is fraught with qualification. Diamond is careful to mention caveats throughout, such as some of the exceptions involved with homogenizing Eurasia into a unified landmass. He notes that food production should not be synonymous with monotonic progression in any one category, referencing the Japanese injunction against firearms and China's decommission of its maritime fleet in past centuries. The many nuances cited throughout are a testament to Diamond's attention to detail and responsible professionalism.FINAL THOUGHTSOne of the most fascinating gifts of history is found in the interactions among past peoples and the ripple effects of those interactions. Guns, Germs, and Steel sits above the vault of human history, providing first-stage explanations to account for its winners and losers. To a great extent, it furnishes a new hermeneutical lens by which to view history, or at the very least a soak test for assessing historical anecdotes. While Diamond was not the first to connect environmental factors to ruling states, Guns, Germs, and Steel is one of the greatest syntheses of the encompassing subject matter compiled to date. He debunks with crack empiricism the alternative hypotheses for history's manifest imbalance of power, leaving a well-reasoned case in their stead.I can only add to the avalanche of praise that has been directed toward this book. It is an academic read, to be sure, but I found it optimally dense so as not to turn away readers less interested in every detail. Some have dispraised Diamond's repetition of common themes, but I personally found this helpful as it allowed the material to ossify more easily in my mind. The book also serves as a model of scientific rigor, as each chapter is fastidiously referenced in the ending bibliography. Guns, Germs, and Steel has forever changed the way I view history and even modern society. If I had my say, this would be standard high school reading across the country. This makes the short list of books which demand to be read at least once. Polymathic in scope, unwavering in its cogency, Diamond has penned a major contribution to our historical understanding which has stood the test of time. I only wished I had read it sooner."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Good piece of work. Inspires thought and conversation. Authoritative? No. Possible, yes. Researched extensively. Good fodder for late night dinner discussions."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"\\"Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo [material possessions and technology] and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?\\" (p. 14). Jared Diamond says that this question posed to him by a New Guinean prompted him to write this book. He seeks to answer why Europeans successfully imposed their empires on people in places like New Guinea, Australia, Africa, and the Americas, instead of being colonized by them. Why did Western Eurasia come to dominate the other continents rather than become subservient to them?While many treatments of this subject presuppose some form of racial superiority, Diamond searches for what he calls \\"ultimate explanations\\" (p. 10). \\"Ultimate\\" for him means evolutionary biology. He is a professor of geography at UCLA and is a staunch Darwinist. Social Darwinists of the 19th Century used Darwin's theory of evolution to postulate the superiority of the Anglo-Saxon race.Diamond, however, rejects race, religion, and culture as being relevant to the question of the uneven development that prevails in the modern world. The answer for him lies in evolutionary biology and geography. He offers some convincing arguments regarding the process of ancient history; when he tries to explain the modern world, however, that his framework lets him down.The title \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" comes from the historical fact that those societies that had access to better weapons and technology, or that were more immune to dangerous germs tended to conquer, decimate, or absorb other societies. To illustrate, Diamond inserts historical accounts where one civilization destroyed or absorbed another. One account, drawn from eyewitnesses, describes how the Spanish conquistador, Francisco Pizarro annihilated the Inca Empire of King Atahuallpa (p. 69-74). The Incas had never seen horses before, so were mesmerized by the 62 mounted Spaniards who accompanied 106 foot soldiers. Furthermore, the South Americans had no guns or steel swords to match those of the Spaniards, but only clubs, maces, axes, and slingshots. That is how a total of 168 Spanish troops defeated 80,000 Incas and captured Atahuallpa at Cajamarca in 1532. Even before this one-sided battle, Spanish smallpox had killed the previous Inca King Huayna Capac and most of his court in 1526. Smallpox spread in an epidemic from Panama in advance of the Spanish armies. While the Spanish troops had developed immunity to this killer disease, Native Americans had never been exposed to it, and hence were extremely vulnerable to it.The question for Diamond is, \\"Why did the Spanish have guns, immunity to smallpox, and steel technology, as well as horses, while the Incas had none of these things?\\" His answer is intriguing, as he traces the history of food production and animal domestication, which he calls \\"a short history of everybody for the last 13,000 years\\" (p. 9). Noting that guns, germs, and steel come from urbanized and industrialized societies, Diamond says that food production is the key to this development. Whereas Diamond believes that all human societies were originally bands of hunter-gatherers, some areas of the world became centers of food production when wild plants were domesticated and cultivated. The rise of early societies from bands to tribes to chiefdoms to states depended on the native plants and animals more than on the intelligence or race of the people.It turns out that the best staple foods and the most easily domesticated animals came from the ancient Fertile Crescent of the Middle East. Other locations where food production originated included West Africa, Ethiopia, China, New Guinea, Eastern United States, Central America, and the northern part of South America. While the people of those areas successfully domesticated plants and animals, the available varieties did not compare with those of the Fertile Crescent. For example, 33 varieties of large-seeded grass species were indigenous to Western Eurasia compared to 23 varieties in the rest of the world (p. 140). Similarly, Western Eurasia succeeded in domesticating 13 indigenous species of large mammals compared to one species (the llama) in the rest of the world (p. 162). Despite having 51 indigenous species of large mammals, Africa has never successfully domesticated any of them. Australia had only the red kangaroo to start with.By domesticating sheep, goats, cattle, pigs, and horses, Western Eurasia augmented the production of its grains through the use of draft animals and manure for fertilizer. In addition, these animals were useful for meat, milk, clothing, or for military purposes. This analysis proves that Western Eurasia had a strong head start in food production and hence in the formation of complex societies. But what about the diffusion of these advantages to the rest of the world?Diamond relies on geography to suggest why rapid diffusion of ideas and technology happened in some parts of the world and not in others. He observes that Eurasia has an east-west axis whereas the Americas and Africa are oriented north-south, and Australia is isolated. Crops, domesticated animals, and the technology that grew up with them were transmitted from the Fertile Crescent to Ireland in the west and to Japan in the east by the time of Christ. The fact that this transmission went along the lines of latitude ensured the viability of the crops and animals in their new locations.In the cases of Africa and the Americas, the north-south axis created obstacles to the diffusion of food production and other advances. Food that grows well at one latitude may be unsuited to other latitudes. The transition from temperate climate to tropical also prohibited physical movement as deserts and jungles result from the changing climate. Thus, South American llamas and potatoes never spread to Central America before Europeans invaded the Americas, because of the tropical forests between these two regions. Similarly, Mexican turkeys and sunflowers never arrived in South America. Even Mexican corn, squash, and beans took several thousand years to reach the Southwest United States because of the intervening desert. The only draft animals in the Americas before the arrival of Europeans were llamas in South America, so when wheels were invented in Mexico, they remained useful only for children's toys since there were no animals available to pull wagons. The Mexican wheel never teamed up with the South American llama in the precolonial period.This lack of diffusion in the Americas also made the people vulnerable to the diseases that the colonial powers would later bring. Ironically, contagious diseases tend to rise from the close contact between people and domesticated animals, so those places like the Americas, Africa, and Australia that were starved of domesticated animals were also the places where European diseases decimated the indigenous populations.The Sahara Desert hampered the diffusion of livestock from the Fertile Crescent into Africa. When these animals did cross that barrier, tropical jungles with tsetse flies, which carry a disease deadly to domesticated livestock, inhibited their spread into southern Africa. Africa had its own diseases, like malaria, to which Africans had developed immunity but Europeans had not, that prevented Europeans from displacing the original inhabitants to the extent that they did in Australia and the Americas.Thus, Diamond offers a non-racial analysis that explains well why Eurasia had such a strong head start over other parts of the world in food production, domestication of animals, immunity to diseases, writing, technology, and military conquest. He has done a great service by showing that the different rates of diffusion of important ideas had nothing to do with the innate intelligence, race, religion, or culture of the people. In this sense, he has rendered racist theories of history obsolete. Every race had the ability to develop the same technology, but not the same raw materials.On the other hand, his analysis is sufficient only up to the time when Europeans conquered much of the world. After that, previous advantages were lessened by the interchange of ideas, technology, writing, advanced food production, and medical science to most nations. Today, of course, deserts, jungles, oceans, and even diseases offer little resistance to the spread of new ideas. So if we are looking for an explanation for the world as we find it today, Diamond has more difficulty with his framework. For instance, he has trouble using his theory to explain why Europe conquered the world and not China. Since he uses non-racial Darwinism, there would seem to be no good explanation for how the innate advantages of the Fertile Crescent ended up in Europe more than in China. Diamond's disregard for religion and culture is a weakness when it comes to the modern world and the differences that we find in it."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"The author's premise that domestication of animals, the availability and cultivation of high protein grains, the fact that the europeans carried highly contagious severe diseases for which they had developed immunity and/or resistance to gave them a major advantage over the rest of the world in terms of the western world's ability to dominate major areas of the world is very true in my opinion.However, I think he did not give enough credit to the contributions of the Romans and the Greeks before them in developing warefare to a fine art (even though they did not have steel, gunpowder, nor advanced naval vessles or navigational experience as the western invaders of the new world did) and the influence of written languages based upon the Latin Alphabet and based upon the common root language latin which supported knowledge transfeer and communications as contributing factors to the success of the western world over the new world and major areas of Asia."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Lucid, well-written, ably-argued, and vehemently anti-racist.This book sets out to answer the question of why different societies progressed at different rates and why some societies were able to dominate others so well. Diamond presents his theory that environmental factors are at the core of the answer.Starting with the development of agriculture and animal domestication, history is traced through the spread of the original crops of the Fertile Crescent. Societies that were early in developing agriculture were able to settle into sedentary societies which allowed for increased population capacities and in turn the development of technology.The title of the book refers to the ways in which advanced cultures were able to overrun less-advanced cultures. The scenario repeats itself throughout history, from the first push of Homo Sapien Sapien into the European territory of the Neandertals, to the decimation of the American Indian at the hands (and germs) of European colonists in the Americas. Diamond points out the difference in technology and disease immunity and traces backwards through history to find the causes of these differences.He is able to make the arguments of cultural superiority without resorting to arguments of racial intellectual superiority. Through his clear exposition, the reader is able to follow how some societies were able to succeed and some to fail as dictated by the environment in which they lived. The reader takes away from all this that racial advantages were due to chance rather than bigger brains or higher natural intelligence.Diamond added a chapter about the Japanese in this latest version. However, it does not seem to fit in well anywhere. The rest of the book is about the societal adaptations to the environment, but the Japanese chapter is about the genetic and cultural evolution of the Japanese people. It's interesting, but out of place.In all, this is a magnificent book. It lays a foundation for the understanding of all further history, and stands up well to competing theories of human societal evolution. 5 enthusiastic stars for this book."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"The read was brilliantly constructed by a multi-disciplined author. His thesis is provocative and stimulating. I kept feeling that had he been a trained theologian as well, the book's title might have been: \\"Guns, Germs, Religion and Steel.\\" Never-the-less it was well worth reading."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This book isn't the easiest read in the world but it's worth the effort.Jared Diamond has the very unmodern chutzpah required to \\"take on\\" the grand sweep of history. He is trying to get to the root of what \\"complex society\\" depends on which explains why societies evolved differently. His ideas are persuasive and better yet based on simple provable/disprovable facts.I'm not enough of an expert on history/biology/geology/etc. to furnish arguments for or against his ideas so see what others have said. I can only say \\"wow\\" to what he is trying to accomplish here. If I had one critique it would be that this book could use a little editing. It tends to go off on tangents but even the detours are fascinating forays into the orgins of everything."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"What processes enabled certain societies to become powerful and innovative? Why did Europeans come to dominate much of the world and the New World? Why did history unfold differently on different continents? These are the questions that this culturally significant work sets out to answer. For the most part the author does a good job. Without going into detail some of the reasons are; the east-west axis orientation of Eurasia as compared to the north-south axis orientation found on other contients like Africa and the Americas, Eurasia's abundance of plants and animals available for domestication as contrasted to the scarcity of them elsewhere, Europeans resistance to germs that were never encountered till modern times by native american peoples, and agriculturally producing societies with dense populations that could support a sedentary lifestyle where people were able to innovate and create new technologies. These explanations for why certain peoples displaced others or why certain peoples such as European colonists who settled Australia were able to form literate agriculturally producing societies in contrast to Aborginies who had been there for 1000s of years and never managed to do it are much better than previous outdated ones. The causes and reasons leading to different histories of different peoples have much more to do with geography and environment as opposed to being caused by innate differences in the peoples themselves. The author has obviously researched the subject in-depth (as far as possible upon him) and presented his findings in several chapters. The chapters take these reasons and expound upon them while offering evidence and showing different chains of causation. I found the book mostly interesting and lively although it read somewhat slow because of the statistics and facts contained throughout. By the time you get to the end of the book you will definitely have the themes of it pounded into your head as the author details them over and over. In my opinion it would have been better to condense redundant details but still a fantastic book that's definitely worth a read. Sometimes I found myself getting a little dulled because in the latter part of the book the author focuses on the expansion of languages and the conclusions we can draw from them as to whom settled where and when. Some of the other parts of the book were a little techincal as well but there were also some fascinating chapters that kept your attention like the ones talking about the Spanish invasion of Incan lands. I recommend this book for its ability to change racist (and incorrect) views of human history and also its ability to enlighten and hopefully educate humans to the point of understanding causes of events and outcomes better. Good read."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I would like to praise Guns Germs and Steel on several aspects.First, as everybody quite agrees on, GGS lays a logical framework for the history of the human species. (second) Diamond wrests this enormous task with seeming ease, although it is obvious that he thoroughly criticised his ideas before writing them down. But we don't read the mind bendings and difficult times he had while doing this self-criticism: we just read the end product, the points he makes, what he accepts, what he refuses. It is as if he wrote a volume that was several times larger than GGS and then he took only the notconfusing crystallized ideas and put into GGS.His writing style is excellent. He is not self indulgent in using excessive grammar and handsome vocabulary. Even at the most colorful instances in human history he narrates, he doesn't get carried away in the language he uses.At all chapters, I felt the presence of an author who really thought on the issues he tells, never conceals the facts, never tries to find ways around.The main idea of the book is awesome, and this is much glorofied anyway (for good reason). I am more struck by the fact that a content this complex and this overwhelming is given in such a good structure. What I observe in myself is while reading a science book, even if I admire the book, when it's finished all I have is an impression of the book and a few examples that I remember. On the contrary, after I finished GGS I found myself talking about the main idea of the book to people for hours. GGS achieves this by the amazing simplicity of its language, its unpretentious style and its repetitions. Yes, repetitions, which is normally regarded as drawbacks becomes a way to make the reader really understand the idea. Certainly, repetitions are not mere repetitions but the main ideas repeated in different contexts. In this aspect, the seemingly high volume of the book also doesn't become an issue because of the ease of reading it."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I really enjoyed reading Jarel Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel. No doubt that the topic proposed by this book is fascinating, and the first pages very promising. Maybe because of that, as you go through you may feel some disappointment.For people who, like me, might be not familiarized with History and Anthropology, the book is full of interesting anecdotes and stories. But, since the scope of the book is very broad, and J. Diamond himself is not a historian, it is likely that the book must contain many imprecisions that might irritate to some people familiarized with some of the topics. That should not concern to the reader. The important thing of this book is the methodology (an approach similar to the Natural History, based on ecological and evolutionary concepts) that he emplys to explain the course of the human history during the last 13000 years, and the generalizations that he provides to explain the outcomes of it. No doubt that some of the explanations provided by Diamond to some issues, for example for the flourish of European societies over China, or India, during the last centuries are clear oversimplifications, which are to be improved by other authors. In that sense, I also think that the reader should not worry too much about it, since this book must be regarded as a pioneer work, more than as a finished conclusion.Among the main drawbacks, besides the oversimplifications (and omission of spiny problems), I would point that the book is too long, what seems unnecessary. The author wants to prove that were differences in the geographical features of the different continents what determined the different paces in &quot;development&quot;Eamong them. His idea is rapidly understood, but he repeats it too much. That's why you feel that the book is somehow loosing interest as you read. I also felt that his reasoning was deterministic in excess, not conceding the enough importance to random events (even with the same forces driving the course of the events, and starting from the same point 13000 years ago, our world today is just one of the many possible outcomes).Overall, I think it is a very good book, and I recommend reading it to anybody who wants to spend some time thinking about the past and present of human societies. Even if you disagree with the author opinions, I am sure that it will be interesting for you."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This has to be the book that brought into play, for me, a series of startling theories on the human condition. It is awesome as a starting point for gaining informaation on the world of genetics, evolution and the Human condition. It can be quite detailed but the writing style tends to be accessible, allowing for the book to draw you in. This also makes the the use of data and terminology far more digestable. As a critique of human history, it informs and analyses very effectively. It proves a most interesting read as you begion to discover the events that shaped and effected the course of human evolution and ultimately your oown existence. Mind Blowing! I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE AS IT WILL DFINITELY AFFECT THE WAY YOU UNDERSTAND YOUR OWN WORLD AND BEING!"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Reading this type of book was definitely a first for me. I've enjoyed reading various specific accounts of history, but to approach history in such an all-encompassing view definitely made me think and question some of my own thoughts and opinions. Because of that I would definitely recommend this to others. There are many times throughout the book that new ideas were presented and even if I didn't completely follow or believe the author's reasoning, the final conclusions oftentimes still made sense. I did find the book to be somewhat long though, and although the author's initial questions and his opinions/hypotheses on the answers to those questions got me hooked throughout the first few hundred pages, by the end of the book I thought he was starting to be repetitive and was just waiting for it to end. Still though just going through the process of thinking about the various questions the author proposed makes this book definitely worth your time."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Guns, Germs and Steel provides a really great comparison between different socities development through time looking at how and why certain peoples were able to conquer other people. It also how cultures developed or failed to by looking at things like culture, religion, geography, techonological diffusion, political structure, plant and animal life and so forth. It goes through history to explain how various factors influenced human development through time. Overall, it helps add a lot to one's understanding of world history."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This book would have benefitted greatly from slash and burn editing. It started with such promise. The chapter on Pizarro's conquest of the Incas was fascinating. It was pretty easy reading. The summary of the beginnings of agriculture and animal domestication, with references to landscape and climate, were also interesting. I felt like a lot of the rest of the book was beating us over the head with repeats of the same information. How many times do we need to be told that the Chinese invented the wheelbarrow or that Mesoamerica had the wheel but didn't use it for transportation? I feel the pain of professors who assign a page limit on papers and have to wade through filler students use to pad them out to the required page limit. My faith in the granters of the Pulitzer prize was shaken."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It provides a compelling, non-racist argument as to why the world's dominant culture arose on the Eurasian landmass. The book is worth reading simply for this reason. On the other hand, Mr. Diamond seems to dodge the more difficult question of why it was the European culture, rather than the Arabian or Asiatic, that came to the forefront - for all three had the same advantages according to Diamond's thesis. Still, this book is well written, interesting, informative, and a great conversation starter."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"As I write this, some 250 reviewers have preceded me. The last thing this book needs is my opinion as the 251st. The reviews have been educational and interesting, but in quibbling over details they miss the point of this book. Diamond has proposed an interesting new thesis and has supported it with a huge group of interesting examples. It's worth reading to consider the thesis and see if it bears scrutiny. To my way of thinking, it does. Is it the final answer to the question: &quot;Why did civilization advance in &quot;the West&quot; instead of somewhere else?&quot; I guess not. Has Diamond identified some key pieces of the puzzle? You bet!"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Reading Diamond is a bit like getting into an engrossing conversation while riding on a train. Suddenly, you realize that the train is at the final stop, while you were supposed to get off three stations back. Diamonds prose is so excellent, his arguments so compelling, his answers to questions that most of us had never thought to ask so persuasive that it is someting of a surprise to finish the book and realize that he has gone too far. Geography may be important, but surely it is not everything. If it were, why was Taiwan primitive while Japan was advanced and wealthy? Why was Holland the wealthiest province on the continent while Denmark was a nation of peasant farmers? Why did northern Italy lead the renaissance only to fall into backwardness, before resurging to become a powerhouse of twentieth century industry? Culture matters. Nevertheless, we are all in debt to Diamond. Rarely are such important ideas presented in such a well-written book. David Fisher's Albion's Seed comes to mind, and Diana Muir's recent Bullough's Pond, but it is rare to find someone who is both an original thinker and a good writer."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I thought that since the ideas of the book were so good, it didn't matter that they were written in a fairly repetetive manner. After reading some of the negative reviews I realize that for many people that read the book, the poor writing style disabled them from UNDERSTANDING the content. Dont let the unintelligent criticism below scare you, most of them are just proof that they didn't not really understand what the book was about.Although you will read an idea several times in this 400+page book (which could easily be reduced to 250'ish) it will nevertheless be an elightening, intersting and revealing idea.Definately a must read (and based on the negative criticism I would say a definate carefull read).Buy it now!"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel touches upon very important historical factors in the race for hegmony and world domination. While much of Diamond's thesis is neither revolutionary nor original, it captures many elements that explain why certain world civilizations thrived and others were conquered.While many on the right criticize Diamond's hypothesis, claiming that it does not account for the difficulties such as famines and plagues faced in Europe, they fail to see the greater picture that Diamond's thesis points to. It is not only resources, and location that affected who dominated and who was dominated, these factors alone did not create the modern world. Instead, coupled with these factors was competition. Where competition was greatest, there was the most incentive to change rapidly, to develop new methods of production and of warfare. When describing the Spaniards conquest of the native Americans, Diamond makes it clear that the Spaniards were able to dominate because becoming dominant in Europe was so difficult. Competition was the engine driving innovation, so the unorganized, quarrelling states of Europe succeeded in pushing ahead while the dormant and passive dynastic nations to the west and to the east stagnated after periods of incredible growth and development. There's no denying the validity of this claim and the impact of geography and resources on the fate of civilizations. A divided Europe comprised of many small, independent states was in constant flux and conflict. More isolated and unified civilizations like China reached their high period earlier on, achieving things millenia ahead of the Europeans, then stagnating in their advancement because there was no need to advance. There was no constant threat of conflict and competition driving innovation.This is no doubt a complicated and complex story, and a solid understanding of it depends upon an understanding of the arguments that Diamond puts forward so clearly in this book. A fascinating study, Diamond's book covers broad topics in an intriguing multi-discipline fashion, drawing upon many of the natural and social sciences to help shed light on this most formidable tale we call the story of man."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Before commenting on this book I would like to say something to all those people that consider the European race to be superior: DON'T FORGET THAT IT WAS OUR RACE THAT CREATED THE GREATEST MONSTERS IN HISTORY: HITLER AND STALIN.Now let's come to the book. I've read many of the reviews. Most people found it excellent, but some deplore that it was too PC, or that it focused too much on people that never bothered to develop civilization. For me, it was the first world history book i read that told me so much about extra-Eurasian cultures. The idea that European superiority could have something to do with genetics is in my view completely absurd. Just observe the people around you and tell me: do you really think that they have a superior intellect? I don't think so. If Africans, Asians or Native Americans had the same opportunities to education as Europeans and Whites in general have, they would surely be as performant as we are. Diamond also gives this argument, yet it is true that he spoils it by concluding that New Guineans are more intelligent than people born in civilization. His most important argument (and in my eyes the one that explains most) is the crop argument. The random distribution of &quot;domesticable&quot; crops and animals explains why some people invented agriculture before others. It is obvious that you can't build civilization without farming, and you don't invent farming from one day to the other. People living in the fertile Crescent did have to invent farming because it was almost given to them in a silver plate. They had the greatest choice, so they could pick the crops that gave them most benefits. Other people in other parts of the world did first have to find the crops that allowed farming. Just imagine how to do that in a rainforest where there are millions of different plants, only a few of which allow farming! The same argument counts for domestication of animals. Furthermore, the Mideast is at the crossroads of all trading routes of that time. It linked Africa, East Asia and Europe, more than the Central Asian and European steppes.Finally, one important argument against the racial theory is given in Diamonds book, but seems to have passed unnoticed by most readers. In the second or third chapter (i don't remeber which), Diamond presents the different evolutions in Polynesia. If race had played a role, all Polynesians would have evolved in the same way. Yet that was not the case at all. Some Polynesians (on the Chatham islands, for example), became hunter-gatherers again. Others maintained farming, but did not evolve. Others started to create empires (Hawaii and Tonga). The Easter island developped writing and build the famous Moai. All this was mostly due to geography: depending on which island they settled, Polynesians evolved differently, even though previously they had shared the same level of development. Atolls and other unferile islands developped hunter-gatherers;fertile ones allowed agriculture, volcanic ones allowed buildings and monuments made of stone, minerally rich ones (new Zealand) created a war culture, and the ones most blessed allowed empires (especially Hawaii).If that's not an example of how geography, and not race, shapes history, then I'll go and live in New Guinea."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"A think this is an excellent book that provides a very thoughtful analysis of what drives development in human history.To 'A Reader' who said that &quot;It proves the Bell Curve to be totally false&quot; - that's not the point of the book. The conclusion is that the differences in development between societies was not driven by differences in intelligence. Societies still MAY or MAY NOT have differences in intelligence.It still MAY have happened that different groups developed differing intelligence levels - maybe Native Australians are more intelligent than Europeans, or maybe they are not. That's best left to the empirical testing of statisticians with all their flaws.All that you can hope to get out of the book, besides a good read and some fascinating history is that you can't say &quot;Aboriginals are stupid because they were still living like savages when whites arrived&quot;.DON'T READ TOO MUCH INTO THIS BOOK."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Read this for a class.

This obviuosly had a tremendous impact: some basic facts are exposed in figures or tables, so I totally missed it.As for the book, the author does a great job in compiling lots of info on the origin of human cultures, and its impact on the development of different societies. Sometimes it becomes repetitive, since you get the same info over and over again, but nonetheless it is a great book with lots of facts that would otherwise would be tedious to read.So to wrap things up: A great book for history lovers; a huge FAIL for the e-book (buy the print version)."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I'd been told by a friend whose advice I value that I needed Guns, Gems and Steel in my library so I purchased a copy.

Near the end of the book (2005 edition), he talks about the evidence of the origins of the current Japan and Korean people. That really opens my eyes. On the part of China around 15th century, I know what he means, based on my understanding of Ming Dynasty (sea ban), it helps me move from a China-centered history view (from 2000BC to modern) to a global view.Maybe more or less we all come from the similar ancestors (I don't mean the single cell or DNA hundred million years ago), but due to limited knowledge, environments, and development, each tribe or nation evolved from a simple society to complicated one, and fought for dominance or survival.It is not a definitive history book.

Mr. Diamond doesn't deny that Westerners deserve credit for the advancements they made. He simply seeks to explain why these advances happened in one locale and not another, by one set of people but not by another.Although I read a lot of history books, here, for the first time, I read a comprehensive account of the origins of food production and basic agricultural technology, and how they impacted the development of civilization.This is a thick book but it is worth your time if you are intellectually curious."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Ok I got a lot out of this book.Like Yali, the charismatic New Guinean local politician who quizzed the author 25 years before the book was written wanting to know why Europeans developed so much cargo and brought it to New Guinea which had little cargo of theirs, I bought this book in a bid to understand why Africa and its inhabitants developed at a much slower pace than other continents. Was it a matter of fate? Or was the politically incorrect charge that Africans are innately inferior to their fairer skinned counterparts somewhat justified ?Jared Diamond makes a strong case for Geography's deterministic role in the evolution of societies. In other words, the rich societies of today simply won the geographical draft lottery (in terms of who got the largest continental pie/size, who got the most ideal conditions for farming, who got the most number of wild mammals suitable for domestication, and who got the widest variety of wild plant species ideal for agriculture) played over 13,000 years ago when modern man began to settle into village life in a few parts of the world. That decisive edge, reinforced over the last 13,000 years is what led to the emergence of an indomitable Europe that eventually came to lead the world due to its development of guns, germs, and steel.According to the Author, Eurasia got decisively lucky in more ways than one:The Late Pleistocene extinction decimated Eurasia's competitors by felling wild mammal species of most of North and South America and those of Africa that may have facilitated intensive farming instead of the hunter-gathering lifestyle which eventually became a big impediment to the development of rapidly evolving complex societies on those continents. Those extinctions left Eurasia with many more wild candidates for domestication than the Americas and Africas offered.Agriculture and Continental Size were huge enablers. Eurasia is twice as large as the next largest continent, Africa, and had a wide extensive landmass of fertile soil amidst a variety of wild life that were easily domesticated for animal herding and valuable crops that facilitated the development of intensive farming techniques that helped serve denser populations and formed the basis for the formation of complex organized societies. Denser populations tend to rise only under conditions of food production, populations served by food surpluses from intensive farming techniques were more likely to have non-farming specialists, technocrats, warriors and bureaucrats. In contrast, poorer societies such as hunter-gatherers without such advantages remained as hunter-gatherers living in bands which were far from ideal to produce crop surpluses available for redistribution or storage, and hence could not support and feed non-hunting craft specialists, armies, bureaucrats, and chiefs to enable them evolve complex societies.In turn, agriculture spawned lethal germs emanating from Eurasian's long advantageous exposure to domestic Animals which was as decisive in eliminating local populations in conquest as guns and steamboats were. As illustrated by the New world's conquest of almost 95 percent of the 20million American Indians; exposing the Indians to strains of germs the Indians had never been exposed to, and against which they therefore had neither immunity nor genetic resistance to.The development of writing was another essential agent in assisting the conquests of Eurasian Societies: by fostering the development of maps that were beneficial to sailors exploring new lands to conquer, by providing a new way of communicating and (through preserved records) inspiring later generations to conquest, writing played a crucial role in the course of civilization but could not have been possible without food production. Writing emerged independently only in the Fertile Crescent, Mexico, and China because those were precisely the first areas were food production arose in their respective hemispheres.I already told you that what brought me to this book was to understand why as an African, we've evolved rather slowly compared to everyone else? I got my money's worth somewhere in pg 399 where the author states that \\"the factor behind Africa's slower rate of Post Pleistocene development compared with Eurasia's is the different orientation of the main axes of thee continents. Like that of the Americas, Africa's major axis is north-south, whereas Eurasia's is east-west. As one moves along a north south axis, one traverses zones differing greatly in climate, habitat, rainfall, day length, and diseases of crops and livestock. Hence, crops and animals domesticated in one part of Africa had great difficulty in moving to other parts. In contrast crops and animals moved easily between Eurasian societies thousands of mile apart but at the same latitude and sharing similar climate and day lengths\\". In a nutshell, geography, and not biology, ultimately did us in.I found this book a bit of a slog to get through due to the author's interdisciplinary approach ( history, archaeology, evolutionary biology, sociology, cultural anthropology etc) which mirrors his career trajectory so far. One of the few bones I have to pick with the book, as so many other reviewers have already mentioned, is its lack of sources. I also thought the author strove, quite frequently, a bit too hard for political correctness in for example, sounding a bit patronizing to the plight of poor societies like mine. I admit it may amount to career suicide for a tenured professor to have done otherwise; but to my mind any reader who can't handle a little intellectual honesty no matter how inconvenient isn't ready to address the fundamental questions about the human condition. For some reason, the kindle version I purchased didn't have images due to copyright issues. A bit of a setback because I didn't have any maps handy to make sense of the strange locations that pop up at various points in this read and no thanks, I like to read with an internet connection as far from me as possible. Then lastly, there was the glossy treatment of why different parts within Eurasia developed differently which he addresses scantly in a later edition of the book.But GGS ultimately proved to be a great read for me, and highly recommended for anyone who wants a keener appreciation of the world we live in today. But be forewarned, you may never see the world the same way again which surely is a good thing."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This is a very illuminating book. Readers should pick it up, not thinking that they are going to get the final answer about the reasons for inequality, but at least getting another important piece of the puzzle for modern inequality. Jared Diamond writes this book to answer the question of a New Guinea native named Yali. Essentially Yali asked (to paraphrase) \\"why do you (Jared Diamond & the wealthy West) have so much, and we have so little?\\" Diamond goes out of his way to state that all racial theories of wealth and inequality are fundamentally mistaken. Instead, it was climatological factors such as soil, available crops, domestic animals, and the like, which gave Eurasian cultures a decided edge in food production. Food production was essential for larger populations, work specialization and invention. This in turn created the competitive edge, and led to the \\"guns, germs and steel\\" that helped the Conquistadors, and other European powers, essentially colonize much of the globe. Bearing an open mind, readers should find this a profitable read, and a fascinating part of a puzzle that has baffled many, and will continue to be of great importance. Diamond's expertise spans many fields, and his work is certainly one that will be recognized for years to come."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I've had this one on the shelf sine 2002. Not sure why I never got around to reading it but knew that I wanted to simply because he won the Pulitzer Prize for it. I can't believe that it has taken me this long to read such a fascinating book.Diamond takes a different approach than most other others of likewise material. His approach was to cover the non-western civilizations, or the civilizations as the western world came in to contact with them. What you have then is all the missing sections, all the how's and why's that you always had (at least I did) when reading history of ancient civilizations or wonder how some things are the way they are. Diamond details out the migration patterns of the world, shows how a crop moved from location to location, how animals were domesticated and which ones were domesticated on which continents. He breaks out first contacts in South America, Australia, New Zealand, Hawaii and South Africa (yes South Africa, with a huge desert in the middle of the continent it made it difficult to get to the southern part of the continent).Some nuggets that I came away with was the how of why civilization arouse in the Fertile Crescent and then spread East and West and ultimately dominated all other civilizations. That there were more domestic animals (in fact the majority were in the Eurasian continent), which were used as a food and power source, which led to population growth. The importance of the animals than comes in that it was their diseases that infected humans and built their immune systems up so that when they encountered other civilizations, notably the Americas which didn't have any domestic animals (of the larger animals only Llamas, and those were localized) and thus no built up immunities. Extremely fascinating information that I've always wanted to learn about and if I had only known it was all in this volume I would have read it back in 2002. Another gem? Madagascar was colonized by an Asian culture. Who'd a thought with it being so far away from the Chinese mainland and so close to Africa?There are some dry parts, such as the tracing of crops in certain regions and discussing how they came about to become domesticated. But the positives far outweigh the drier parts (for although they aren't as interesting they are still interesting enough). I would most certainly recommend.

A lot of the problems of today's world comes from the inequities of the civilizations of the past, and at first blush it can be confusing to students of history why the Spanish made ships and guns before the people of South America. Diamond explains that a lot of the development of history's civilizations depended on the domestic-able plants and animals in the area and the fact that Europe and Asia have a major axis that goes East to West where as Africa and the Americas are oriented North to South. This actually makes a big difference in terms of how easily crops can be adapted from neighbors. The major geographic barriers also play a role in how easily ideas and inventions can get spread between cultures. All of this paints a fairly convincing story of why people in one area progressed so much faster than others, giving us the world we currently have.As stated above, I only listened to the abridged audiobook of this book because that is what I had available, but I found the audiobook still very enlightening, unlike most abridged books that I've encountered. The full paper book is quite long, and so if you want an idea of the argument but not all the gory details, I do recommend the abridged version. In any case, I think this book makes a very important argument because it presents evidence that it wasn't something special about the genes of the people who became the conquerors, it was simply the luck of the land that they happened to inherit.More reviews at [...]"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Popular science books are the ones I am very fond of these days. How could I then miss reading this Pulitzer prize winning best seller on a controversial theme of human history. \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\" is the main title of the book by UCLA Professor Jared Diamond. This book strangely has two different subtitles for the editions from US (The Fates of Human Societies) and UK (A short history of everybody for the last 13000 years). In hindsight, I feel that the subtitle associated with the UK edition suits the contents of this book much better. Jared Diamond is the author of other famous books - \\"The Third Chimpanzee\\" and \\"Collapse\\".This book is unique in the sense that it tries to disprove the racial theory behind the disparity in the development of different parts of the world. Yali, a local politician, in New Guinea asks the reason for the superiority of Europeans over the other people (especially New Guineans) in the world. This question was raised by him to Diamond in the 1970s. The whole book is structured in such a way as to answer this Yali's question. Diamond through his experience of research he had performed on New Guinea for 30 years attempts to answer Yali's question. As he answers, the reader is taken through a roller coaster of a ride of the entire world history over the past 13,000 years.The book primarily focuses on the onset of food production to explain this difference. Diamond explains why food production which first originated in the fertile crescent region spread quickly into entire Eurasia. He ponders on the ability to domesticate available wild animals and the suitability of crops available for farming in particular. Further, he brings out the advantages of farming over the primitive hunter gatherer lifestyle prevalent in other places of the world. He also argues how this head start in domestication of animals and farming allowed Europeans to improve on their resistance to germs and helped them in technological innovation. He also provides archaeological evidences to support his claims.The other primary factor considered by Diamond is the geographical stretch of the different landmasses of earth. While Eurasia is stretched in the east-west direction, Africa and the Americas are stretched in the north-south direction. Diamond through appropriate evidences describes how the east-west latitudinal stretch allowed Eurasia to spread farming and domestication much faster to far off places than the other continents. Thus availability of crops and animals which can be domesticated and the geographical stretch in east-west direction are supposedly primary reasons for the domination of Europe over the rest of the world. This made them resistant to germs originating from different animals compared to the other people.Some European people might want to contradict the facts as provided by Diamond regarding the holocaust they launched on the aborigines of Americas and Australia. But Diamond brings out such facts through evidences such as the battle of Cajamarca in South America when a little more than hundred Spanish invaders killed thousands of unarmed aborigines of Inca empire mercilessly. He also explains how apart from the superior weapons Spanish had, the smallpox germs they spread helped them eventually colonize the whole of Americas. Similar fate awaited the aborigine population in Australia. However, New Guineans were more advanced and could resist the colonists.This book is a wonderful exposition of facts which are often not taught in school books where explorers such as Columbus and Vasco da Gama are treated as demigods. The main conclusion of the book is that Europeans did not dominate the world because they were people of superior race. It so happened through evolution that their area was more suitable for food production and thereby contributing to their superior technology. Further, Europeans were able to land in the right place at right time and thereby, at this point in the history of world they are able to dominate the other continents. It is nothing to do with the whites being superior to blacks or any other race in the world, for that matter. Diamond puts all the prevalent racial theories in trial and exposes their pitfalls through out this extra ordinary book.Though this book is a bit repetitive in analyzing the same facts and insisting upon them from different perspectives, I was able to appreciate the evidences provided by Diamond to support his claims. I could not find much detail about the societies in the Indian subcontinent in this book, which disappointed me as I have always felt this region had a rich history. Also, Diamond seems to concern more about the area around New Guinea and tries to propagate the findings there to support his claims on other parts of the world. This may not be applicable for all his claims. These drawbacks aside, this book is a very good read for anyone who is interested in a scientific viewpoint of human evolution over the past 13,000 years. I strongly recommend this book for those who are interested in popular science and evolutionary aspects of the world history."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Jared Diamond's 1998 Pulitzer Prize winning popular science book presents, in some circles, a controversial theme or even racist explanation for the differences in the development of societies over time. However, the author states early on \\"the modern world's inequalities: why did human development proceed at such different rates on different continents? Those disparate rates constitute history's broadest pattern and my books subject.\\" In addition, to counter the racist's question he states \\"History follows different courses for different people because of differences in environments, not because of biological difference\\"He proceeds in a well written logical progression to explain this thesis throughout the book starting with spread of humans around the world and the beginnings of civilization and the various rates at which they have developed. He proceeds to explain that there are four sets of factors which have caused the unequal speed and development of civilizations between the various continents. They are:1. Differences in the wild plants and animal species available for domestication.2. Factors affecting the rates of human diffusion and migration which differed greatly among continents.3. Diffusion between continents, which may also help build up and spread these domesticates and technology.4. Continental differences in area or total population size which with a larger area or population gives that society more opportunity to develop.Which brings us to his main conclusion: \\"All human societies contain inventive people which speeds development. It's just that some environments provide more starting material and more favorable conditions for utilizing inventions, than do other environments.\\"You will not find footnotes in this book because it is popular science and not a scientific treatise. However, at the back of the book, you will find a well-organized Further Reading section if you want to dig into more detail of his presentation and concepts.Overall, the book presented well the themes, concepts and overall conclusions, which I had thought for years, to be the reasons for the differences in societies.

It is a strained and selective exposition of history in a vain attempt to support the author's preconceived opinions, i.e., that geography determines everything, which even casual observers would conclude is nonsense. It completely ignores the roles of human creativity, innovation, energy, drive, and motivation. To Diamond everything is predestined by geography. This sounds vaguely religious, i.e., politically correct.To Diamond, physics, engineering, and mathematics would have been developed in New Guinea, if not for what?

The Eureka! moment. This book is kind of like the movie Hotel Rwanda: the movie was life-altering for me, and just made every other movie that came out that year seem tawdry and unimportant; it was one of those movies that everyone should see (especially Americans and Western Europeans) just to understand the world and its history better. Guns, Germs, and Steel is one of those books that everyone should read to better comprehend their existence at this specific moment in time.The premise of the book is revealed in the prologue in a conversation between the author and a New Guinea native who lives his very simple life in Stone Age conditions. The thesis that arises in their conversation is what specific events led to the fact that Europeans were the ones to reach New Guinea and interact with its people, and why it wasn't the New Guinea people to develop the technology and abilities to travel the world and make first contact with the Europeans.With the concept in place, Diamond sets about doing this in his conversational and, quite frankly, mind-blowing and ingenious way. As a professor, with studies in anthropology and biology, he has an astounding way of seeing things and being able to explain ideas in a simple manner that make so much sense and you're left saying to yourself: \\"Oh, that's how that happened,\\" or \\"that's why it's like that.\\" At times he can bog you down with details, mainly because he explains them on minutest and seemingly most insignificant level (such as different seeds around the world). And yet you are left with that adage of chaos theory: everything on this planet happens for a reason and has a knock-on effect.Some of Diamond's ideas that I found and still find most astonishing include:The reason the continent of Eurasia was able to develop to a much more advanced level than the rest of the world, with its complex empires, cradles of civilizations, and large amount of farming and domesticated species was due to its latitude on a specific east-west axis. The other continents -- North and South America, Africa, Australasia -- are all on a north-south axis. What does this difference mean? For one, climate is greatly changed the further north or south ones goes, which has an effect on the migration of people, animals, and plants, as well as the spread of information, technology and culture. Because of this, Eurasia was able to develop more crops and have them spread around the continent through trade, as well as the spread of domesticated animals, culture and more importantly, technology. The other continents did not have this ease, which Diamond explains in clear detail with facts and dates.Of course, I am vastly over-simplifying the book and it's really necessary for one to peruse its pages to get the full understanding. Another concept that I was very happy to be made so clear is the explanation of why whites conquered most of the world was not because they were a superior race in any way. And how is this simply explained? To use Jared Diamond's example:The Aboriginal people spent many thousands of years keeping to their simple ways due to the harsh conditions of Australia. When the Europeans arrived they were able to educate the Aborigines and share their technology and make it seem like these advanced whites were helping and \\"bettering\\" the Aboriginal people, and therefore making them civilized. And yet it was necessary for the Europeans to bring all their technology, culture and science with them for them to survive, otherwise they wouldn't have lasted a week in Australia. It had nothing to do with the Caucasian as a race, but everything to do with the specific parameters for living in Europe and developing the technology and culture under those conditions. This is made clear when Diamond talks about two European explorers from different background who set out, with all their technology and science, to cross the vast landmass of Australia. Neither of them made it to the other side; they both died under the severe conditions. However, the Aboriginal people frequently cross this landmass on their nomadic journeys and make it relatively unharmed.Overall, what I get from this book is: Why are we all fighting and killing and hating one another? After all the seemingly random events over the last two million years that led from the ape-like hominid to the homo sapiens sapiens of today, it seems all we should be doing is hugging each other and patting everyone on the back for getting through the whole mess and still being alive to tell about it. A lot of animals and dinosaurs aren't.But don't take my word for it: read and absorb the ideas of Jared Diamond and have your life and your ideas changed for the better.For more book reviews, and other writings, go to www.alexctelander.com"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"How did we get to where we are? This is a question sometimes asked by those who travel abroad and see cultures and societies quite different from their own. This is also one of those questions that lurks just below the collective conscious of the social sciences; why are different societies different, and why have some survived and conquered, while others disappeared or were absorbed? Jared Diamond provides us the answers, and does so using empirical evidence from the physical sciences like geology, geography, biology, ecology, climatology, etc...The author, a scientist living in LA, takes multiple strands of thought from previous work, and puts together a cogent and powerful thesis that explains why some societies became more powerful than others. Specifically, those societies that are situated on a land that runs East-West instead of North-South can spread different crops much easier because of similar climates going East-West than North-South. Likewise, those societies with coastline and vast forests to make ships, England and the Dutch, tend to expand overseas, and hence spread their cultures and people worldwide.Diamond also tackles one of history's great questions in this book: why is Africa, the home of man, also the poorest place in terms of human standards of living. Diamond argues that Africa is home to large animals that have evolved with man to the point that they are not easily domesticable; hence agriculture could not advance as far in Africa as say in Europe or Asia.Overall, a great book. This is probably one of the few recent books that does a thorough job of linking the physical sciences with the social sciences."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I'm only 1/2 way through this but it's a good read.

I don't think there is any doubt that you will benefit from reading this book. You certainly won't get any dumber.If I have any negatives, he gets down to details a little too often, and too deep, IMO. Hence, I from time to time, got bored just every now and then."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Risking a lot of precious time by dabbling into the realm of non-fiction, I must say that Guns, Germs and Steel by far did not disappoint.To appreciate what I considered to be the positive qualities of the book, I shall reiterate one of the concepts mentioned by Diamond in the final chapter: One can apprize history as a science, but must do so through ingenious eyes. Although I lack experience to judge history books adequately, I must say that the speculation present in Guns, Germs and Steel contributes positively and not negatively as other reviewers might suggest. The largest reason for this: the methods used in Diamond's speculations present to the reader a variety of scientific techniques of inquiry such as his use of etymology to determine the earliest inhabitant of a region or the biometeorological effects on migration across axes. Each individual chapter entertained my knowledge-craving druthers but it was definitely the cumulative effect-which Diamond capably summarizes every sub-section-that gives the book its substance.On a different not, regardless of the originality of the hypothesis developed in the book, the diction used, as well as the breakdown provided for each new concept introduced, give Diamond's book a pleasant legibility. Because of this quality, the ideas assembled are accessible to everyone and therefore completely disregard the fact that Diamonds thesis may not be the first of its kind. That is because if you're new to the discipline, it's probably new to you.However, I will, much like some of the other reviews I scanned through, offer a caveat concerning some redundancy. At first, I was not at all bothered but as I progressed through and approached the end, certain full-fledged explanations of his reasoning appeared where a simple reminder would have sufficed. This made the latter half of the book quite exhausting. Otherwise, I would recommend this book to anyone that is allured by a cocktail party conversation-starter; if anything, the hypothesis' equivocalness will be key in sprouting a lively debate among onlookers."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This is a slog to get through.

This book is an enthralling read for the evolutionary biologist, anthropologist, social scientist and layman alike.GUNS, GERMS, AND STEEL is a convincing discussion about the plausibility of arguments that centre around the challenging question of why population groups on different continents experienced widely divergent paths of development. Professor Jared Diamond, comes across as a firm believer in the theory of environmental determinism, presenting elegant arguments consistent with evidence provided from a wide range of disciplines, even as he skillfully evades the question of genetic diversity, including differentiated intelligence, among racial groups even though on several occasions we find Diamond subtly stating that he finds the average New Guinean more intelligent than the average Westerner. Beginning 13,000 years ago, the author illuminated the conditions or circumstances that may have facilitated development for some groups and inhibited the rise of others. Diamond argues that food production and domestication of wild species is of paramount importance in determining variable rates of development for different societies. Jared Diamond plays skillfully with the evidence at hand to present convincing arguments of how the spread of infectious diseases have decimated local communities and helped in the establishment of new societies, how the east/west orientation of continents proved to be conducive for transmigration of people, products, and technologies and how food production led to the growth of a predominantly hierarchical present day societies.On the whole, it proves to be an illuminating piece of work on the rise and fall of civilizations and societies from several interesting perspectives. Guns, germs and steel is a book bound to appeal to a wide audience."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"...While Diamond does state that cultural biases affect the adoption of technologies, and that technologically advanced cultures conquer, destroy or out-breed less advanced, he does not draw the logical conclusion or illustrate and inform the reader as to the logical outcome of his studies: that while technology has followed the path of least geographical resistance, and that the distribution of plants and animals has greatly affected the cultural evolution of different peoples, the density of human populations, and the speed of transportation has eliminated the geographic resistances of the past, and that cultures who do not adopt technologies, including the conceptual technologies of medicine, rule of law, individual freedom and market capitalism will be dominated by those that do. And that if the leadership of any nation, truly loves and desires the best for it's people, it must adopt these more competitive technologies as fast as possible, so that their people can produce and consume \\"cargo\\", rather than be the victims of others who produce more.This book is yet another missed opportunity for a reasoned scholar to use empirical information to illustrate how those culturally backward societies that still dominate our planet can advance the quality of human life, and instead, by the accidentally malicious act of politically sanitizing his work, provides solace to those who would perpetuate the ignorance, mysticism, primitivism and fear of the pre-rational, dark age cultures struggling against a tide of commerce, prosperity and rationalism.While it is true that the present-day members of any culture are not responsible for their current status, they are indeed responsible for actions that intend to maintain that status, their culture, and their beliefs. Diamond rewards us with the detail and accuracy of his analysis, but errs by not drawing the conclusions that would help peoples of the world actually benefit from his work.Hopefully, Mr. Diamond will provide a ten-year anniversary edition that fixes this mistake.For these reasons, the book should indeed receive a lower rating by reviewers. However, if a reader keeps this weakness of Diamond's in mind, then the book provides an interesting study in human technological evolution, with a wealth of data, and conveyed through both excellent voice and compelling storytelling."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This book is excellent.

Moisture and warmth can support huge masses of humans as well as house flies, mosquitoes and other insects that cause diseases of crowds like malaria, cholera, TB etc. These diseases cause so many deaths among people of densely populated civilizations that the surviving masses are left with plenty of food to eat and therefore they don't have to fight to snatch food for survival.In deserts the situation is entirely the opposite. There is very little moisture. Temperatures are extremely hot or cold. Land is mostly barren. And there is very little food there. Such habitats are not suitable for insects and there are not many house flies and mosquitoes around and consequently diseases and epidemics are not so common there.But humans do live there on those very scarce resources that deserts can offer. In the absence of killing diseases they multiply like rabbits and soon would die en masse if nature hadn't evolved for them another mechanism of balancing the population with the, more or less, constant and meager resources of the deserts: Constant warfare, killing and looting.You will never find centralized governments in deserts that are and remain isolated from large civilizations. Small tribes and clans live in a tribal system under laws customs and traditions which are there to promote and glorify fighting and killing and looting. The desert therefore becomes a natural training ground where all the male populations are transformed into very good warriors and fearless soldiers.These warriors though are confined to inter tribal warfare inside the desert itself and civilizations outside are immune to their destructive power for hundreds of years until a great man is born among them in whom are combined exceptional leadership skills with those of a warrior general.If and whenever this leader succeeds to pull out his desert men from internal conflicts and unites them under a single flag, he is ready to march his armies out of the deserts and out of hunger to annihilate the well fed and soft and clumsy armies of large civilization and to conquer, plunder and loot.Changez Khan of The Mongols was such a great leader. So was Mohammad (Peace Be Upon Him), the prophet of Islam. And, so was HE who led the Aryans out of the cold deserts of Central Asia and Massacred and annihilated the indigenous populations of India and settled his own people there as the new and permanent inhabitants.This pattern is so regular that it was worthy of mention by Jared diamond.The pattern of desert dwelling peoples fighting internally for hundreds of years to become hardened killing machines and then come out of the desert under the leadership of a great leader to subjugate rich and haughty civilizationsThis regular pattern of civilizations succumbing to the onslaught of united nomads' armies started from the very first civilization of Mesopotamia and carried on for the next ten thousand years until Changez Khan.Now though civilization has grown out of its infancy and has entered into its phase of maturity since the renaissance of Europe which saw an explosion in education, science, technology and industrialization. Whereas previously there was not much difference in the types of weapons with which both sides fought against each other, deserts men vs. civilizations' armies and the bravery and chivalry of individual soldiers engaged in face to face combat that decided victory and defeat, now it's the superior technology of weapons that alone decides who will win if these two old enemies march into the battlefield in these modern times. Civilizations have discovered the institutions of schools, colleges, universities, research laboratories, factories and big industrial set ups along with many other important institutions that, working together, keep supplying ever more and more advanced weapons of combat to their own armies thereby giving them the edge and advantage over desert peoples who just don't have the resources and the manpower to build this huge and resource hungry set up.Ten thousand years after its birth civilization has at the long last won this war once and forever against the allied armies of desert nomads. It has forever become immune to the power of nomads who get united under great leaderships.Now it is civilization against civilization in the battlefield that poses the greatest threat ever to our planet and our very survival. However this fact too is evolving towards betterment albeit at a snail's pace.Despite this one single and yet a very serious shortcoming \\"Guns Germs and Steel\\" is one of my best reads for many years to come."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"First, the book starts off as a bit of a tough read but if you wade through the first 100 pages it develops a flow. I appreciate the authors unbiased delivery of the facts--displaying no religious, political, or passionate bent that could distort his delivery.This is an important book that fills in the blanks of questions I have held since childhood on the very nature of human existence and how we ever advanced in the first place. Everyone should read this book."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I believe Guns, Germs and Steel is one of the more important books written in the last 25 years. Combinging anthropology, geography and linguistics, Diamond fashions an interesting and often compelling argument as to why civilizations developed where and when they did. Although a number of scientists have criticized a number of Diamond's conclusions, one thing cannot be denied: Diamond recast the debate about differences in cultures and civilizations, moving it away from race-based inquiries into a more logical,constructive, and empirically based dialogue. Moreover, he did so by posing a question brilliant in its simplicity: why was it that the Spaniards sailed across the Atlantic and conqured the Aztecs? Why didn't the Aztecs sail across the Atlantic and conquer Spain? Think about it. Then read the book."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"The author does a good job of explaining and defending his hypotheses but it takes >400 pages and there does seem to be some repetition.

The \\"guns and steel\\" less so."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This is a very rational, interesting, clear, well researched explaination of how and why humans and their various groups got where they are.

A must for anyone interested in human society, human history, or biology."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Diamond proposes that geography is the ultimate cause for explaining why societies developed at different rates across different countries. The idea is not new, but Diamond's book is probably the only book of its kind to cover it in detail while making it accessible to non-specialists and non-academics.Although the book is far from perfect (and Diamond addresses many of its weaknesses throughout), the central thesis is supported extremely well and deserves a perfect rating. It is a very important book that should be read widely because it deals with a topic of immense importance. It has tremendous explanatory power about the world and acts as a formidable rebuttal to theories based primarily on inherent biological factors for explaining history.Some quibbles:1) The book is often repetitive. This may have been done to drill the point home, but it was not necessary2) The idea that large mammals became extinct because they were not afraid of humans (because they evolved in isolation) in the New World, just seems absurd since there are many animals that evolve apart from humans but are nevertheless afraid of us. A combination of ice age and hunters without understanding of conversvation and preservation likely led to their extinction, and that's that. It may also be the foundation of such concepts of \\"respecting Mother Nature\\" that Natives learned as a result of their unwitting decimation of former game animals.3) The role of human biology is ignored a priori in the book's hypothesis. Since we know that individuals have had tremendous effects on the course of history, biological factors also must serve as ultimate causes for the shaping of societies and history. I realize that this is a much less tractable factor than environmental causes, so it's understandable to focus only on the latter, but there can be no doubt about its significance."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Still working my way though this book.

This is a good book with which to begin becoming acquanted with human history, and familiar with many of the important changes brought about to create the world we live in today. I wish the section on human expansion from Africa was longer, but there are other good books to learn about that from. Diamond always presents an opposing argument, and gives reasons as to why it doesn't work logically.

Basically, it's a history of humankind, more specifically, a history of those times and accomplishments of humankind that have created the world we know today; its inequities, differences, and similarities.It is extremely interesting, I've heard most of his arguments put forth piecemeal by people in the past, but this book looks to the evolution not only of people, but the larger societies of the world today, and of those that are unknown to the world at large, and his ideas of how these groups ended up dominant or peripheral.The four stars would be five had the end not been so repetitive; it was actually difficult to get through parts of the last chapters, but overall, for all the effort and linkages among anthropoligical specialties, it is an amazing book."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Jared Diamond's sheer knowledge was what impressed me most in Guns, Germs and Steel. The book was almost an enlightening experience for me, and gave me an entirely new view on humanity and how we've come to be who and where we are. I can still picture in my mind images of people moving around the world and watch technologies develop and spread across continents in certain directions, but not in others.

I didn't, though, and ended up really enjoying it.Why are societies today the way they are--some very advanced, others not much different from where they were millennia ago? Why were these advanced civilizations able to conquer more disadvantaged ones? What causes some countries to be disadvantaged in the first place?

Truely unique interwoven account of history and science. I'm not really a \\"science guy\\" but more of a history buff and I found this to be a great pre-text for history. If you like American or European history, this book is a great way to fill in some of the mystery between the start of civilization and the modern establishment of nation states.

It is the perfect overview of an incredibly wide range of scientific and social science topics relating to humanity's development. Perfect for a layman like me, because points are explained in a way that's very easily digested. (Actually, perhaps a bit too much... the author frequently repeats himself to make sure we remember what he said a few pages back.)You will feel a lot smarter -- honestly -- after you read \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\". It deals with important information, much of which I had either never heard or never really understood previously. I had any number of \\"wow, now I understand!\\" moments as I read it.The author is very forthcoming in specifying whether he is dealing with solid science or mere speculation, and everything he says rings true. And even when he gets a bit PC about the nobility of non-western cultures, he's also honest about their shortcomings. And the success of the West is put in a context that shows amazing cross-cultural similarities. The society that has \\"the right stuff\\" is going to prevail, often brutally -- and it's been happening in much the same way for 15,000 years, not just 500."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"The 28 page annotated bibliography, alone, would make Professor Diamond's book worthy of the purchase price.As an additional, priceless benefit he convincingly demonstrates for us the determining impacts of geography, environment, agriculture, epidemiology, and &quot;just-plain-dumb-luck&quot; upon history. By doing so, he cuts through racist explanations of history, as cleanly as Alexander cut through the Gordian knot.In Dr. Diamond's world, there is no such thing as manifest destiny. There are only people who are more, or less, blessed and joined together by their common humanity. That's an anthropology to which we can all subscribe!"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"A few years ago, I read an account in the New Yorker of an Eskimo man who entered Harvard and became a stellar student. I was surprised at this, and then, surprised at myself for my reaction. I had prided myself in possessing an egalitarian belief in the capabilities and talents of all people, and was caught up short when I realized that I had questioned the adaptability of a man from what we would call a &quot;primitive&quot; society.In his Pulitzer-prize winning study, Jared Diamond broadens our thinking, providing an antidote for the idea that people from one culture are innately superior to people from any others. He discusses factors like climate, animals suited for domestication, edible native plants, geographic barriers of desert and mountains, and epidemic disease.This book, despite being reader-friendly, is one that will take some concentrated time to digest. Diamond encompasses a variety of scientific disciplines---biology and anthropology, of course, but also physics and climatology, among others. He also incorporates the &quot;humanities&quot; fields of history and philosophy. In the final chapter, in what I see as evidence of both modesty and probing curiosity, he raises a number of questions for further consideration and study."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Motivating this book are two questions 1) When Spanish conquistador Pizzaro encountered Inca emperor Atahualpa, how did the former, with fewer than two hundred men overwhelm the latter with over 80,000? and 2) When the Europeans set up colonies on the island of new Guinea, why was it that they had so much stuff to trade, but the natives of the island had so little?The answer to the first question is, of course, that the Spanish had Guns, Germs, and Steel. Diamond does an outstanding job arguing for the pivotal importance of Germs in the equation. He clearly explains - using the idea of germs - why Europeans overran the Americas and Australia but not Africa. His agument regarding steel is notably weaker; but I think it does support his thesis adequately. I failed to detect a compelling argument for why Europeans had guns but others did not.The book's primary focus is on how civilization got started. He looks first at the cultivation of plants and then at the domestication of animals. Examining areas in Africa, Eurasia, the Americas, and Australia, he totes up the lists of suitable flora and fauna and evaluates their merits. He notes that it was the fertile crescent that harbored the most suitable grains, legumes (or pulses), and domesticable animals. No other location comes close to having this rich combination of natural resources. He shows that this explains the very early appearance of agricutlure and therefore of writing, religion, and law in this area (and in China).He also shows how any human advancement would spread more quickly in Eurasia than it would within the Americas and Africa. This gives Eurasia a double advantage; it can harbor more people by virtue of its agricultural practices and each person has greater access to new ideas because of strong east-west trade currents. Thus cultures in Eurasia could easily adapt ideas based on those of other societies instead of creating them from scratch.He concludes that any person who accepts his thesis of the forces shaping civilization - at least the necessary precondition to get started - would necessarily conclude that civilization's advances must inevitably run quickest on the Eurasian continent.A large portion of the book is focussed on the factors influencing the establishement of an agricultural system that is capable of supporting a whole large class of non-agricultural workers. The assumption, I believe, is that we already know that this is the primary requirement for the birth of a civilization. Still I was looking forward to Diamond's take on what happens after we all learn to read and write. I was hoping he might explain the ascent of the west since 1000 BC or 1500 AD. But he does not.He does not, for instance, argue why it was the British and Spanish, not the Turks and Indians who settled Australia and the Americas. This, perhaps is a different question. Yet it seems to be linked to the idea of frontiers and access to resources. For it is always when the full set of advanced cultural practices reach populations in the richest, most uncultivated frontiers and these ideas cast anew in the light of a new environment that civilization seems to gain its greatest momentum.He uses Polynesia as a microcosm for the world. In this laboratory, a group of people with the same genetic cross-section and same cultural practices embarked on a grand venture to settle all the islands of the Pacific some two millenia ago or so. The systems of government they set up and the level of civilization they reached were highly dependent upon the agricultual productivity of their citizens. Colonists on small islands unsuitable for agriculture became hunter-gatherers and lived in egalitarian societies. Those in productive lands organized into small states with strong chiefs or kings, each with their own little standing armies.The book is richly researched and solidly argued as far as it goes. But there are a handful of quibbles one might raise.1) The author tends to repeat himself. As the book progresses, the portion of prose that is a restatement of something said before becomes so high that this reader found himself skipping whole chapters.2) The author fails to provide a compelling argument about why China lagged Europe at some point after 1500. One wonders why the author did not simply use the argument at hand. Colonialism provided to Europe the raw materials necessary for industrial production. China was closed until two or three decades ago and so did not have adequate access to the raw materials that vaulted Europe and North America to their current place. The opening of China to the world has quickly closed this gap. In other words, the cultural practice that gave frontier states the advantage was the high value they realized in trade: of getting required natural resources and finished goods from other places instead of being closed off. The book's central thesis is that the first and most necessary condition for the success of a society lies in its access to the required resources, and that transport of goods and ideas is crucial to the success of this enterprise. For this book to fail to make this connection I find to be an astonishing lapse.3) Unless it is hidden in one of the skipped chapters, Diamond never starts to answer the second motivating question about 'stuff', even though it is a simple and direct extension of his fairly robust argument.This book is of crucial importance in counter-balancing our Darwinian view of the world. It was not that Europeans were better people by some genetic measure. (Darwin seemed to assume a single measure of fitness. But each environmental variable provides a different metric of fitness so the whole notion of one group being generally 'more fit' is utter nonsense.) It was that they had a body of technologies, cultural practices and diseases that naturally tended to overwhelm other groups. And that these ideas and practices (and sometimes diseases) are an inevitable advantage any agrarian or post agrarian society has over a less highly organized one. Europeans simply got a head start thanks to geography.There is much to learn, and much to contemplate in this book. Read It."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This book is the beginning of a long and necessary effort to answer the question: Why did Spaniards destroy and/or enslave people in South America --- and not the other way around? It makes sense to generalize and ask, Why did ANY particular group of people consistently dominate another in history?There has already been a lot of research into this topic that centered around intelligence: The Spaniards were smarter, that's why they dominated. But Jared Diamond rejects this conclusion immediately. Based on his experience, he doesn't think the colonizers have bigger or better brains, or higher IQs. So he goes looking for a materialist explanation, searching for the way that climate, crops, and animal domestication led to better immune systems and superior technology.This theoretical stuff isn't a large part of the book. Diamond makes his case briefly and then spends 90% of the book on facts to back it up. And the facts are impressive. Diamond knows a lot about agriculture and animal domestication. He writes about it clearly. The information is important and interesting, which makes the bulk of the book very easy to read.But does he prove his case? Well, obviously you'll have to decide for yourself. Personally, I think he came to his conclusions too quickly. The evidence is very good, but it's simply not enough. That leads me back to the beginning of this review --- this book is the START of a long research project, not the end. Reading this book is very easy, and it's likely to inspire you to read more on the topic. Jared Diamond might not convince you 100% that materialistic factors decided who dominated who, but you can't help but be impressed with the amount of information he's collected to back up his theory. My guess is that the IQ approach will wither away as this book begins to dominate the debate."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"The fact that a book that claims to explain the origins of human society doesn't contain a *single* controversial statement from the perspective of the politically correct left should perhaps come as a warning sign that this book is less of a revolutionary exploration than a reflection of current academic biases.That being said, this is an incredibly good book."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"In a world of myopic specialisation, here's a monument to informed generalism - and a book that makes both geography and liberalism respectable again. For Diamond argues cogently that chance geographical factors have strongly influenced the distribution of wealth and poverty in the world today. He believes, essentially, that the people of the Fertile Crescent, China and Western Europe were given the best opportunities to domesticate plants and animals - grains with harvestable seeds, animals which could be herded, and so on. They also had the best chance to build up resistance to diseases.The simplicity of the book's key ideas has no doubt aided its popularity. And Diamond downplays questions such as the Chinese Mystery - why did European prevail over that of China, which possesed a clear technological lead up to 1300 or so. Here Diamond simply offers up in brief explanation the new and credible orthodoxies popularised by Joel Mokyr's &quot;The Lever of Riches&quot; (a book of similarly detailed narrative style) and David Landes's &quot;The Wealth and Poverty of Nations&quot;.Diamond's story is the story not of Britain's advantage over Shanghai, but of Eurasia's advantage over Africa, Australia and America. And in truth this is story enough for one book.Some on the political and cultural right seem annoyed that Diamond is undercutting conservative stances on race and culture. There's more than a little irony here: 20 years ago Diamond's thesis would have been considered deplorably right-wing, neglecting the malign influence of European colonialism and neo-colonialism as documented by Marx and his successors. Now that the Berlin Wall's demolition has transformed Marxsts and post-modernists into fringe players, we're finally able to start an intelligent, nuanced discussion of global history."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"from the author of DREAMING YOUR REAL SELF: A PERSONAL APPROACH TO DREAM INTERPRETATION; and DREAM BACK YOUR LIFE.Diamond's overview of the many influences on the development of domestication of animals, agriculture, and the dominance of societies is informative as well as very readable. GUNS, GERMS, AND STEEL exposed me to information and ideas that had never been addressed at all in my traditional education. Reading it with a world map next to me, I enjoyed the discovery of continents and islands that I wished to could see first hand. Stimulated by this subject, I went on to read books by Matt Ridley and Robert Wright. I highly recommend Jared Diamond's other books, too. I don't think he is trying to be PC.

Indeed, this may well be the most important book one ever reads."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"By now you know what this book is all about and I guess you are reading the reviews to check if it is worth your time :)The initial chapters, where the author establishes the role of environment/geography in shaping the pre-historic way of life are very, very good. However, he then makes a giant leap of conjecture when he completely ignores the role of established culture(s) in paving the way for future developments. He briefly argues that culture may also be a factor of environment but by not supporting this claim in any substantial way, he asks the readers to assume too much and leaves us unsatisfied. To give a small example - according to the author, the middle-east had every advantage throughout history (in his terms) - then why is it that we find some of the most closed societies there? Environment lays the initial groundwork but it becomes less and less of a factor as culture/ethos take over. The present day US is another living example...no matter what the season/terrain, the lifestyle is almost the same everywhere.The best thing about GGS is its accessibility (it borders on entertainment) and is well-worth your time and effort. Without any doubt, it is a monumental work of scholarship. The book would have been even better if it were Part I of a II or III part series."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"[Strong 3.5 stars for its scope and development of the central thesis, but loses points for trying too hard to explain away non-European cultural failures.]The first line of Jared Diamond's Pulitzer Prize-winning opus is: \\"This book attempts to provide a short history of everybody for the last 13,000 years.\\" His central thesis is that luck of genetic distribution of domesticable plants and animals, particularly cereals and large mammals, gave a tremendous leg up to western Eurasia in the development of civilization. In other words, it wasn't poor choices or innate inferiority that caused most of the world to be dominated by European culture -- just luck.In a book with greatly wider scope than most nonfiction Pulitzer winners, Diamond pulls together long-term threads of farming, herding, languages, disease, technology, government, and religion. He attempts to explain how trends in all these disparate areas rather inexorably led to the cultural and economic state of the world today. While many of the author's arguments are subject to debate, the writing is lucid; it's easy to see why the Pulitzer committee gave Diamon the prize.To take to task all the debatable points in \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" would be a huge undertaking. I'll try to highlight a few.Diamond argues that the temperate Mediterranean climate (featuring wet winters and dry summers) of southwest Asia aided greatly in early development, then has to explain why similar climates in California, Chile, and southwest Australia didn't spur development in those places. Human actions (particularly deforestation and overgrazing) have turned what used to be called the \\"Fertile Crescent\\" into a wasteland, whereas this didn't happen in the similar southern European area. Thus southwestern Asia possessed the seeds of human development, but the locals squandered their head start. At that point Europe and eastern Asia had an equal chance of pulling ahead, and Diamond proposes that the geographical fragmentation of Europe gave it a competitive advantage over China's cohesiveness. But because he earlier claims that easy movement (for the spread of domesticable species) gave Europe a competitive advantage over America and Africa, this argument is not compelling.Diamond thinks that the different parts of the world were on a developmental par about 13,000 years ago. At that time there were many more potentially domesticable large mammals in the Americas than there are now. The evidence as to what the human presence at that time is mixed, but Diamond pushes hard to dispute evidence of any prior human occupation. He favors the \\"Clovis first\\" theory, which has humans first entering from Siberia across the ice age Bering land bridge not more than 13,000 years ago, carrying stone \\"Clovis point\\" weapons. Clovis points have been found in large numbers in mammoth carcasses in North America, and Diamond thinks they were developed in Asia and transported across Beringia. Mammoths are one of the many now-extinct large mammals. From the mammoth kill evidence, Diamond assumes hunting by immigrants from Siberia caused the extinction of not just mammoths but horses, elephants, lions, and all the other megafauna. But there are several problems with this argument. Firstly, there are more recent findings than those Diamond disputes to back up the earlier human occupation theory. Secondly, there are no Clovis points north of British Columbia, which would mean these genocidal immigrants fasted all through Alaska. And thirdly, while there are thousands of Clovis points in mammoth skeletons, to date we've found just ONE clovis point in an American horse carcass, and NONE in elephants, lions, or giraffes -- all at one time widely found in North America.All of this debate for later occupation of the Americas appears designed to buttress a secondary argument that American development got started too late to catch up with the Eurasians. But ironically, the Pleistocene overkill hypothesis, linked to a single overwhelming swarm of human invaders, argues against Jared Diamond's central thesis. If he's right, it WAS the Native Americans' own fault that they were later overrun by Europeans on horses, becaused they killed and ate all the existing horses on arrival.Diamond also has to resort to some hand-waving to explain why independent Mesoamerican invention of writing and wheels (used only in toys, rather than tools like wheelbarrows) never went anywhere. Similar weak arguments are used to explain why China went into cultural stagnation centuries ago. Ultimately, the author tries too hard to make all of history fit his model.In trying to explain why superior technology isn't necessarily accepted, Diamond trots out the old myth about the Dvorak keyboard being superior to the standard QWERTY layout, yet never finding much demand. However, Diamond's book came out in 1997, and the Dvorak myth had been debunked 7 years previously (Journal of Law & Economics vol. XXXIII (April 1990)). Diamond is left with no argument other than cultural superiority to explain why societies that adopt better technology succeed, and he rejects that position a priori.In his professional career the author has spent much time working in New Guinea. He thinks constant local warfare has made the average surviving New Guinea tribesman superior to the average descendant of European culture, and wants to explain why the people of New Guinea have so little \\"cargo\\" (wealth). But Diamond's focus on New Guinea as a model for global development is more elucidating to the author than to his readers.There are some problems with the book layout itself, including a surprisingly poor index. For instance, trying to look up horse extinctions in the Americas, I found references to horses under \\"Americas, animal extinctions in\\" that didn't appear under \\"horses, in Americas\\". Also, there are a variety of different maps with different levels of detail to show the migrations of peoples, languages, and domestic species. It's necessary to flip back and forth between the maps to follow the narrative thread.This is a good book to read, but a skeptical perspective is necessary while doing so."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Many of the criticisms of Diamond's book among the 250+ reviews below correctly point out its many flaws: the short shrift given to cultural factors, the over-emphasis on the regions with which the author is most familiar (e.g. New Guinea, Polynesia), sweeping and often unsupported generalizations, repititions in the body of the text, etc. However, overriding thesis on the vital importance of biological and geographic/geological factors in shaping the broad course of human history is a valid one and he argues it quite plausibly. The only problem is that Diamond's arguments begin to falter as he gets closer to the modern era, which is his own fault for not conducting the necessary research and thinking his basic ideas over more thoroughly. However, perhaps the most important aspect of \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\" lies in the public response to it (as seen both on this public reviews page and in the U.S. as a whole, where it was a bestseller and Pulitzer Prize winner), as people were essentially surprised at having human history presented in such a manner. This despite the fact that many of Diamond's basic points are hardly original, and specific aspects of his argument have been brought up and explained in much greater detail by other historians, anthropologists, etc., as even the most superficial glance at Diamond's own bibliography shows. This is indicative: in the U.S. at least, the basic impact of biogeographical factors on human history is hardly ever discussed in any depth (if at all) in high school and university \\"Western Civ\\" courses-either in lectures or in the textbooks. In this sense, Diamond's book is an excellent supplement to any study of world history, although it should be read critically."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"The book takes the point of view that geography determines the success of societies and cultures for ALL time. It is a good read for those who like to know more about human history, especially the early part (before 500 BC). However, the book's basic premise, that culture is of little account, is hard for this reader to accept. Some of the explanations are essentially 'just so' stories. Also, others may not be able too, but I can ignore Diamond's occasional bow to political correctness (e.g. Columbus &quot;discovered&quot; America; many pages on the evil Spanish conquistadores) and use the text to learn about Polynesia, Africa, and the Americas. Certainly, in the early stages of human history, geography plays a big role. It also dictates where people will face too many difficulties (due to limited resources or extreme temperatures) such that they won't succeed. But his overall theme is hard to swallow as an understanding of how some groups succeed, while others don't. In fact, he contradicts himself several times. Native North Americans were dispersed, so they could not get together effectively. Yet China is viewed as one big lump, which leads to an overly strong central government that stifles development. Well, which is it? (Or must it be 'just right' -- shades of Toynbee's challenge&amp;response.) The last chapter is absolutely the worst, because he is explaining differences between civilizations after (approx.) the year 1500. Yet by now everybody knows about guns and steel! His approach is to look at a map, and explain success or failure by whatever he happens to comes up with. Mountains that hinder travel? Or not enough to keep out the barbarian hordes? You get the idea.Still... it has much material that will please anyone who likes to pick up an encylopedia and read about this or that place or time in human history. And it is always good to keep in mind that geography has some effect.

However, &quot;IQ and the Wealth of Nations&quot; analyses the relation between national IQ scores and measures of economic performance. In one analysis of 81 countries for which direct evidence on national IQs is available, mean national IQ correlates 0.71 with per capita Gross National Product (GNP) for 1998, and 0.76 with per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for 1998. Other analyses consistently demonstrate national IQs predict both long term (1820-1922) and short term (1950-90; 1976-1998) economic growth rates measured variously by per capita GNP and GDP (mean rs ~ 0.60). Regression analyses of the 81 countries, and then of 185 countries, including 104 whose national IQs are estimated by averaging those from adjoining countries, shows the national differences in wealth are explained first, by the intelligence levels of the populations; second, by whether the countries have market or socialist economies; and finally, by unique circumstances such as, in the case of Qatar, by the possession of valuable natural resources like oil.&quot;IQ And The Wealth of Nations&quot; has a lucid, expository style. Chapter 1 reviews the various theories advanced over the last 250 years to explain why some countries are rich while others are poor. These include climate theories (temperate zones are said to be best), geographic theories (an East-West Axis is said to be best), modernization theories (urbanization and division of labor are said to be good), dependency theories (exploitation and peripheralization of poor nations are said to be bad), neoliberal theories (market economies are said to be good), and psychological theories (cultural values like thriftiness, the Protestant Ethic, and motivation for achievement are said to be good). While some of these theories almost certainly account for some of the disparities between countries, IQ scores turn out to be the single best predictor."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I was very disappointed with \\"Guns,Germs and Steel\\"- there's nothing new in this book and alot of amateurish speculation trying to be \\"important and new\\".

This book is seriously flawed- there are no notes or references; the bulk of the middle part is incredibly boring; and his conclusion that anyone occupying western Eurasia would have eventually ruled the world leaves out the very important factors of chance and CULTURE. I really can't do justice to all of the speculation, jumping to conclusions, disregarding of uncomfortable facts, \\"discovery\\" of already known facts, and denigration of accepted theories that goes on in this book. I took notes too lengthy to list here. Actual history (especially military history) seems to be one of the author's weak points, and he covers up his lack of knowledge with lawyeristic bluster. The crux of the book is the \\"collision at Cajamarca\\", when Pizarro kidnapped Atahualpa in front of a supposed 80,000 Inca warriors. No amount of fancy-pants theories about food production and crowd germs explains this incident if you leave out CULTURE. The Incas succumbed as if under a spell. Their cultural hallucination gave way to the brutal, reality-based culture of the Spanish. This book suffers from a smartypants attitude which is extremely annoying.

Deep in himself he may not stick to his ideas, because I wonder why he does not move to a third World country? Is he realist and ready to live according to his convictions?"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"There is a fallacy at the heart of Diamond's book that has not been noticed. What Diamond does is give the reader a story as to why this or that group of people did not develop a civilisation: that story always depending on there being some feature in their local environment that was lacking. The message is that Western civilisation was a matter of luck, of being in the right place at the right time. Had New Guinea tribesman been where the Romans were then they would have founded the Roman Empire instead.The trouble with this is that the existence of a story does not mean that it is the correct story or explanation. The fact that an environment (say that of the New Guinea tribesman) is non-conducive in some way does not mean that that is why civilisation did not develop there: civilization may not have developed there *even if it had been conducive*. That is, the non-existence of civilisation there could have been overdetermined by more than one factor. Yet Diamond's book is built on and around this logical fallacy with no apparent awareness of it.So why may civilisation not have developed in the places that it didn't? For an alternative explanation see the book IQ and the Wealth of Nations, by Lynn and Vanhanen. The brisk message of that book is that civilisations are built on intelligence, and where intelligence is not then, perforce, civilizations do not grow. People may be reluctant to swallow that bitter truth-but that will not make it go away.But without a refutation of this alternative explanation, Jared Diamond's book looks like a series of Just So stories-of the kind: why the lion doesn't laugh."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Helpfully, Diamond sums up his work:\\"Authors are regularly asked by journalists to summarize a long book in one sentence. For this book, here is such a sentence: \`History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among peoples' environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves.\\"His purpose is political: to convince us that present-day disparities in social, economic, and intellectual achievement among population groups is not attributable to biological differences. The glaring problem with the thesis: biological differences follow from environmental differences.According to the \\"Out of Africa\\" theory, modern humans arose in Africa and migrated from there about 100,000 years ago. If we accept Diamond's uncontroversial premise that Southwest Asia was a markedly different environment, that's an awfully long time for natural selection to work to fit the emigrants to a non-African environment. While the population that remained in Africa was evolving resistance to malarias, for instance, the emigrant population was adapting to its new environment(s) as it spread further across Asia and Europe. (The gene for sickle cells -- distorted red blood cells -- in the heterozygous condition protects against some of the malarias; but it does so at the cost of causing a serious anemia when it is present in the homozygous condition. Malaria is such a serious disease that a human population can afford the anemias in some individuals as long as other individuals are protected against malaria.)Environmental differences were crucial to biological/genetic differentiation as each new environment created a feedback loop that selected for fitness for that environment. Diamond's notion that after 100,000 years of such differentiation there are no significant genetic differences that affect success in present-day environments is inherently implausible and contrary to scientific observation of human biodiversity."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"In spite of what you may like or dislike about the so-called political correctness of this book, I find this book to be an elightening and compelling read.

Meanwhile the book is pretty entertaining and it helped me understand more in general about the topics of plant and animal domestication as well as linguistics."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Diamond takes on an extremely complicated topic that spans essentially all of human history and boils it down to some very basic premises. For example, he argues that Eurasia (i.e. Europe and Asia) enjoyed the advantage of the lion's share of the most desirable and domesticatable grains and large mammals. This advantage led to earlier agriculture, which led to denser populations, which led to more specialization, which led to better technology and organization, which led to societies better equipped to wage war and conquer their neighbors. Other reviewers, however, take Diamond to task. But is this premise really so darn controversial? The idea that the Fertile Crescent had a nice variety of native large-seeded, protein rich, perennial grains is not new. Heck, I learned as much in my History of Agriculture class as an undergrad (10 years ago). If you believe that Europe was somehow destined to rule the world because of some innate cultural and/or genetic superiority, this book is not for you.

I simply could not put it down."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"The book is the result of an attempt to explain why some civilizations (civilization is definitely not the correct word to use here. I am using it for lack of a better term. \\"A region occupied by a homogeneous ethnic group\\" is what I believe the author is basing his arguments on) came to evolve faster than others. The book consists of three parts; the first in posing the question, the second in developing theories as of why differences in speed of advancements in different civilizations occur, and lastly in applying the author's theories to different continents.The author attributes differences in available natural resources at the time of exploitation as reasons of disparities in speed of development. A typical argument of his would evolve as such (excerpt from chap. 9): \\"How can we explain the concentration of the Ancient Fourteen [domesticated animals] in Eurasia? ... One reason is simple. Eurasia has the largest number of big terrestrial wild animal species, whether or not ancestral to a domesticated species. Table x.x shows that Eurasia has the most candidates ... [Table x.x contains 1) candidates and 2) percentage of candidates actually domesticated] ... But why were Eurasia's horses domesticated but not Africa's Zebras? ... Efforts at domestication went as far as hitching Zebras to carts: they were tried out as draft animals in 19C Africa, and the eccentric Lord Walter Rothschild drove through the streets of London in a carriage by zebras. Alas, zebras become impossible dangerous as they grow older. Zebras have the unpleasant habit of biting a person and not letting go. They thereby injure even more American zookeepers each year than do tigers! ...\\"Diamond evidently adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy in his arguments. A quick, immediately palpable reason succeeds the initial question he poses, followed by an abundance of physiological and/or physical evidence. From the evidence yet another set of questions arise, which are in turn answered with more ample evidence, often times supplemented with historical annectdotes.Diamond's evolutionary/physiological/physical approach is not without precedents. The historian Ferdiand Braudel, as well as biologist Cavalli-Sforza for example used similiar arguments in their numerous publications. However none of their publications are as thorough in evidence and at the same time as accessible as this book. It was an enjoyable, and in a sense, relaxing read.With what little knowledge I have, I gather that evolutionary theories are in (for every social phoenomenon there seems to be an associated evolutionary theoretic explanation nowadays). There will be other ways in the future to explain the very same question Diamond attempted to tackle, but till then there will be more than enough time for Diamond's \\"historical science\\" (as he puts it) to evolve."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I have read all the previous 250+ reviews and I don't have anything terribly new to add. I can just say that personally as an African (one of the Bantu that Diamond refers to) I found this book FASCINATING as I had never been exposed to such a cohesive and comprehensive theory of the impact of geographical factors on human societies. Of course I knew that theories existed but not with this level of DETAIL and sustained EVIDENCE. In particular I was impressed with his elucidation of the importance of technology diffusion (Europe got most of its early technology from Middle East and China) and geographical isolation (Australia suffered from its relative isolation). The impact of the SHAPE of the continent was also an idea i had never considered. It was also interesting to learn of the relative levels of advancement of American, African , Aborignal and Eurasian civilizations. It emerges that on a global basis Africa was roughly parallel to America and that the Aborignal were the sole people to remain in the hunter gatherer stage. This makes sense considering the relative size, shape and isolation of the respective continents. This also corrected my previous erroneous belief that Africa was on the trailing edge of global civilization. Lets see ... Copper working in 2000 B.C., Iron in 1,000 B.C, Steel by early A.D, not as bad as I had thought , better than Australia certainly.The surprising early strength and unity of China was also another revelation to me, I had always assumed my Chinese friends were boasting when they talked about how old and advanced their civilization was. In this light current Asian success can be seen in its historical context: The foundation was laid down several millenia ago, the Western lead was really just temporary historically(last 500 years).Lastly, I expect that with modern technology the role of geography will be much smaller and technological diffusion will occur MUCH more rapidly than in the past. So in the next 1000 years we can expect to see technological differences between different regions to disappear as the barriers to technology transfer decrease.For once in my life I was glad for the scourge of Malaria! It seems Malaria was one of the chief reasons Africa was not settled by Europeans and Bantu ethnic groups were able to survive. I might not be here to write this if not for Malaria!!In conclusion I would like to agree with all of peggywb comments of August 18, 2000. I feel much more enlightened after reading this book."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Having read his impressive treatise on societal self-preservation, \\"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed\\", I was immediately drawn to Jared Diamond's earlier book, which has an even more ambitious scope in excavating the roots of civilization and how distinct priorities have defined the differences in societies. Beginning with a survey of human pre-history, covering the spread of humans around the world circa 11,000 B.C., he tries to ascertain which populations would develop dominant high-tech societies and which would continue at a stone-age level indefinitely. It's a fascinating premise that the UCLA evolutionary biologist and molecular physiologist carries off with credibility and aplomb. He effortlessly synthesizes history, archaeology, agriculture, linguistics, medicine and many other fields into an overall thesis that seems persuasive at its core, even if there are several observations that would be difficult to evaluate as completely true.The book's title reflects the three primary factors Diamond identifies as the key differentiators: the military technology to dominate one's neighbors, the infectious diseases that weaken societies not already exposed to them, and the industrial and political technology in areas that include literacy, economic and political structures, and manufacturing. Each chapter would make an intriguing book on its own. In one section, Diamond convincingly argues why domestication spreads more easily in areas with an east-west axis, where latitude remains the same, than in areas such as the Americas where a north-south axis requires domesticated species to adjust to different lengths of day and drastic climate changes. As an example, he states that corn from Mexico requires a longer growing season than the climate of Minnesota provides, and llamas did poorly in the Central American jungles and thus never reached more hospitable regions in North America. In contrast, goats were domesticated early in the Middle East and spread quickly from Spain to China.I was particularly drawn to his theories on social technology, in which Diamond suggests that denser populations required more complex methods of conflict resolution and more efficient means to distribute food. Better distribution and reduced conflict subsequently supported the elite class, who could then develop writing, accounting, and military strategies, consequently passing the learning of one generation efficiently to the next. Probably Diamond's most compelling thinking is focused on innovation, i.e., on how new technologies are put to new uses in a domino fashion. Examples he cites include the fact that the alphabet was streamlined from hieroglyphs and how Gutenberg's printing press was adapted from presses used to make wine. He shows how innovations can be spread through trade, copied by inventive observers, or acquired by conquest. For example, Chinese papermaking came to the Islamic world when an Arab army defeated a Chinese army at the battle of Talas River in 751 A.D. and found several papermakers among the prisoners of war. Obscure historical facts suddenly expose themselves as part of a larger social fabric.What I find most interesting is how Diamond shows how technology did not provide a global sense of manifest destiny, that in fact technology is sometimes abandoned or rejected by certain societies. Japan rejected firearms because they violated the samurai code. Polynesian settlers lost the ability to make pottery as they scattered across the Pacific islands. Many factors contributed to this loss, including lack of materials on many islands and reduced population densities that presumably made it difficult to train specialized workers. Between this book and \\"Collapse\\", it's impressive how Diamond moves confidently among so many disciplines. However, he does shortchange religion perhaps because the topic does not interest him. He simply objectifies religion as a justification for conquest and a method of inspiring personal sacrifice for the collective good. I just feel he underestimates the impact. But amazingly, this omission is trivial given the breadth of what Diamond presents here as he presents the ultimate differences in levels of development between societies. In his view, the reasons trace all the way back to how the world was built. Strongly recommended."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Diamond's work should be, but this edition is not acceptable as, a contentious college textbook.

Rather, I would like to focus (1) on the strenghts, and (2) the weakneses of this book.(1) It has been a challenge for scholars to explain the state of the world without making simplistic assumptions about human nature or culture (some races are inherently superior to others, some countries exploit others, some religions or languages promote technological change better than others, etc.).In this respect, Diamond proposes an alternative (very simple and intuitive) framework with which to study humanity's early development. His proposal is that geographical-environmental factors imposed constraints and therefore determined the opportuinity of any given human group to achieve societal or technological break througs.To name just a few of them, he presents very compelling evidence that a region's size and climatical characteristics determined the probability of the evolution of relatively high-yielding grain crops, which in turn increased the chances of any given human group to discover agriculture and to find it worth his while to switch from a hunting-gathering lifestyle to a life of farming.An agricultural life style, with its higher output of food per unit of surface would also result in higher population density and food surpluses, which in turn would create both the need and opportunity for achieving labor specialisation, which resulted in breakthroughs in government, science and technology (both commercial and military), and business.In this same manner he comments on the impact of the availability of domesticable animals (like horses and cattle) in some areas, which in turn helped to increase productivity in farming, transport and the military, not to mention that the parallel coevolution of such groups and beasts resulted in the development of diseases that wiped out competing societies that lacked immunity to it.You might be convinced by this arguments or not, but I believe that anybody with an interest in human history should read them very carefully. I personally believe that the evidence presented is massive but worthwhile.In this respect, I simply don't undestand those people who think that the book is too long. I agree that it is a bit repetitive on its main thesis, however, it couldn't be helped. As it is, the topic is extremely complex (not to mention controversial), so the only way to build a good case is to analyse the available data in the most thorough manner.(2) I am sure that a book of this scope, which combines evidence from so many fields (archaeology, anthropology, epidemiology, geography, ecology, etc.) must be weak on some areas, although as a whole, the general hipothesis seems very compelling to me.I don't agree with other reviewers that believe that he ignores all evidence that contradicts his thesis, although, I think that it is true that he failed in is intent of explaining why Europe beat China to the modern age, through geographical-environmental factors.This does not mean that his main hipothesis is wrong, it only means that he didn't know when to quit.At the present time, in which it is economically feasible to transport corn from one side of the world to the other at negligible prices, it is obvious that institutional factors (like trade barriers or an inadequate judicial system) are far more important than geographical factors in determining any country's economic success.Well, although that certainly was not the case in the 1500s, that was the time in which other forces, like technological breakthrougs in transport, trade, the military and political organization, among others, started to dominate the future of mankind (at least temporarily) rather than geography and environment.Nevertheless, I believe that this is one of the best books that I have read in a very long time."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Frankly, many books on history, biology, geography, or even evolutionary psycology, seem to skirt around the issue of why Europeans 'won', why the West dominated the world and other 'races' did not. This books finally ties all the loose thread together, giving a whole image, if in sketch, of the ramifications of those subjects as currently understood.Some of the not so favorable reviewers seem not to have read the book, or seem to be in basic disagreement with evolutionary theory or scientific theory. Diamond is apparently well versed in history, biology, archeology and evolutionary thinking. If not, he is a pretty good con man. His avoidance of teleology alone makes this book several notches above other works I have seen. &quot;Farming gives more food, so people turned to farming&quot; is not allowed here, since the proto-farmers would have no idea of how it would turn out!There are some faults. In the later chapters Diamond is not nearly as meticulous as he is in earlier sections. His sketches become 'sketchier' and apparently more open to criticism. However, I could find no real factual mistakes, especially in reviewing some source documents . In some cases he does not seem to 'demonstrate' his work, only giving the premise and conclusions. Since earlier sections were demonstrated in detail, the conclusions drawn are obvioius. I was just somewhat disappointed that Diamond did not detail those conclusions. These faults are trivial.The display of Pacific Islander history was particularly enjoyable. Compairing and contrasting the resulting myriad societies, and their interactions with each other and finally the 'outside' world sets the tone for the rest of the book. The other sections, describing areas of the world, too are gems to anyone seriously interested in history.If you want a clearer understanding of history, and wish not to rely on religious or racist ideology to bolster claims of superiority, read this book."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This is a very good book - a scientific approach to world history. However, there is one thing missing that has not been mentioned in any review I checked so I decided to write mine.Maybe the most important question only partially answered is why it was Western Europe and not Middle East or China that would end up on the top. One geographical factor Dr Diamond largely ignores is the Inner Eurasian Steppe and its inhabitants. Because of environmental factors they were forced to practice nomadic pastoralism that was not very conducive to scientific and cultural advancement. However, it helped them to gain a formidable military ascendancy as expert horse-archers. Therefore, Attila, Chingish Khan, Timur Lenk and a bunch of other Turco-Mongol khagans were able to defeat their sedentary neighbours and create vast but short-lived empires. They attacked China, Persia, India and Middle East quite a many times, and conquered them a few times, causing enormous destruction every time but contributing very little to the advancement of any of the societies affected.On the other hand, Western Europe was protected against them quite effectively by Eastern and Central European forests, Carpathians, Alps and a few other mountain ranges. The most western steppe region is the Hungarian Plain, and it is too small to support a large Steppe army (100 000 mounted warriors, 1/2 - 1 million horses) for any length of time. Therefore, Western Europe was really endangered only twice - by Huns when the Roman Empire collapsed, and by Mongols in the thirteenth century, and both attacks eventually failed."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Taken as a whole, this book is definitely a very interesting read. Although not necesarily a completely original thesis, Diamnod succeedes in clearly and methodically proving the general idea that disparities in the development of different societies are laregly due to geography and environment. I believed I had a thorough understanding of why history unfolded the way it did but Diamond truly amazed me at various points. I also found the book interesting in its stripping down of history to the most general trends.On the other hand, one criticism I have, as others have mentioned, is Diamond's complete disregard for any sort of religious or cultural influences on development. I found this hard to agree with. It seems obvious that the very \\"individual-centered\\" Christian religion of the Europeans which called for man to \\"subdue nature\\" had profound effects on why the Europeans decided to conquer whole continents. On the other had, the religion of most native americans, which revered \\"mother earth\\" and sought to live in harmony with nature rather than dominate it, had equally important an impact on why the indians remained a relatively \\"primitive\\" society.

Let me explain, I have a habit of putting down a book when the author makes egregious errors in thought or reasons and as this happened so early in the book I felt I had better ways to spend my time as it could only portend worse errors to come and a waste of my time.Diamond begins well by explaining why he became interested in the subject after spending time in New Guinea and was asked by a prominent local politician why the Westerners were so technologically advanced while they were not. Diamond goes to great effort to explain that intelligence cannot explain the reason why there was such great disparity among civilizations and the advance of technology. First of all intelligence is very difficult to measure as the IQ test is more of a measure of cultural intelligence and innate intelligence(his words: (whatever that is)) cannot be measured by them. I agree with this.At this point, it goes downhill very fast. He goes on to explain the New Guineans are SMARTER than Westerners. This is just after him saying intelligence is too difficult to accurately measure and he does not explain his criteria for this only we must take his word on it. He has an anecdote of visiting the jungle and feeling like an idiot for not being able to erect a shelter, which would be second nature to them. Well I don't know, I can solve a second order differential equation but can't pitch a tent in the jungle. Which takes more intelligence? The answer is it's a meaningless question as pitching a tent in the jungle is just as useless to me as is solving abstract mathematical equations is to them. Diamond seemed to understand this in the first few pages and then loses sight of it quickly. His explanation for why the New Guineans are smarter than us is selective evolutionary pressures for intelligence over the recent past while any old idiot can reproduce in the West. Oh and we watch too much television. I'm not making this up, this is what he says.It seems that Diamond is trying so hard to be politically correct and sensitive he is falling into the white-guilt mode. I agree with his overall premise at this point that intelligence has nothing to do with these differences, but science suffers greatly when it becomes politicized.

Yes, he does tie together some important ideas about how civilizations develop, but the author is clear from the start that the purpose of the book is to argue that poverty is not the fault of the impoverished, and wealth isn't a reflection on the merits of the wealthy. This is a point that he returns to so often that it becomes tiresome. Any explanation of historical development that actually looks at the qualities of the players involved rather than at their good or bad fortune is dismissed offhandedly. This is a political commitment that requires him to overplay factors in human development like geography. The book is worth reading, but largely to show how academic presuppositions can get in the way of good research."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I really looked forward to reading this book recently, but I've been disappointed by how dry it is.

I was wrong. Rather, it turns out to be a convoluted attempt of intellectual slight of hand to elevate low level factors to primary factors that determine the fate of societies. This biased, one sided piece of work (by someone who doubtlessly knows better) ignores the POSSIBILITY that different races and cultures may progress or fail to progress due to factors inherent in those groups. Yet he demonizes those who think this way. To ignore these factors is scientific dishonesty and does a dis-service to every race and culture who MAY have inherent defects (and perhaps we all do) which, if identified and addressed, could actually remove barriers that inhibit progress.Unfortunately, our society has made such scientific inquiry professional suicide for the sake of political correctness. Many dozens of honest scientists have attempted to address these issues over the last 50 years and found themselves often jobless and always ostracized by the very scientific communities who hypocritically declare they champion integrity of research. Such punitiveness toward the search for truth has effectively closed this avenue of research. Another casualty in the graveyard of political correctness.Buy this book if you want to be taken for a ride and drink the Kool-Aide. Look to other resources to find the truth this book purports to address. To cut to the chase, in my opinion, this author is perhaps the real bigot, in stark contrast to the sincere, truth-seeking academicians and scientists he wags his finger toward or the unsuspecting layman who buys the book seeking knowledge but may come away not knowing he was slickly misled."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This book REALLY needs an editor.

Why some cultures ended up with firearms, books, ships, and deadly germs is very interesting. The counter-arguement that some races are just smarter than others is a silly straw-man.

Suffice to say that the book is extremely powerful and thought provoking. Whether or not one agrees with Diamond's conclusions, they are well-established and inspire critical thought. He has presented some of the simplest answers to questions of monumental historical significance, and the scientific presumption should always be that the simplest answer is most likely correct. While some reviewers slam Diamond as psuedo-Marxist and completely unbalanced, no competing theories of human development are as compelling as his nor as scientifically substantiated to this point."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I am impressed by Diamond's willingness to dive into areas outside his specialialization. To me that is the great strength of this book, it's an ambitious attempt to give a general theory of human &quot;development&quot;. The problem of course, is that specialists will find fault with the details, that is inevitible in such a work. In general I agree with Diamond's view that the &quot;success&quot; of Europeans in conquering the world came down mostly to geograpical luck. Yes, there is the objection that culture also plays a part, but that doesn't deny that geography was the key thing. Overall, a fascinating book, very ambitious, and readable for non-academics.

He makes a point and then backs it up with several detailed examples in history to support his thesis.His writing also makes for fairly easy reading. It is clear and logical, with a natural progression leading from point to point as he traces the development of peoples from cave to modern man....After reading \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\", I think I have a much better understanding of human history. That in itself, is as high a compliment as I can pay any book."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"The author undertakes to explain why Europeans and Asians (especially the former) came to dominate the world instead of Africans, New Guineans or other cultures. Diamond has a scientific backgroud and includes lots of data to support his thesis that geography (not innate abilities or cultures) was the primary factor. But this book doesn't make an open-and-shut, scientific case for Diamond's position -- a fact he acknowledges in his epilogue by urging further scientific research.Nonetheless, Diamond makes a good case that in general, geographic access to the opportunity for food production led to denser populations, which led to the disease-resistance, weapons production and scientific advances that made conquest of other societies possible.Some of Diamond's conclusions are supported better than others. For example, he dismisses in one paragraph research claiming that some races are more intelligent then others, then goes on to claim based entirely on anecdotal evidence and speculation that the average New Guinean is more intelligent than the average American.Diamond also concludes several times that remarkable historical figures could not have changed the inevitable rise of societies blessed with geographic advantages. But later he attributes the Chinese people's failure to reach the western Americas almost entirely to a single political decision to end shipping.Despite these flaws, more obvious in some chapters than others, Diamond has done an excellent job to explain why world history turned out the way it did. He condenses an extensive amount of data into a lucid, readable argument for his position."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Very astute and interesting But : 1 All the mystery of the origin of civilization is reduced to down-to-earth factors such as the possibility to raise cattle in favoured areas 2 Mr Diamond has been very impressed because he has met an intelligent Papuan - That seems to be the key of his vision of History"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"General statements about the decisive weight of &quot;birth&quot; factors in the trayectory of living systems has been probably presented before, but never with such scope and with so a detailed examination of the precise chain of causation as Mr Diamond has done in this work. Mr Diamond takes nothing less than the entire human history and for his understanding he use for good an absolutely original approach that, supported in the findings of several sciences, put the root of all in a distant past of which seldom an historian had given too much attention before. And if that was not enough, he does so with cristal-clear prose that makes you read it with the same rush from beginning to end as if you were reading a top best seller writter, at his best.

Why did Europeans develop mercantilism and colonialism? How come the Aztecs didn't do the same thing? Why didn't Africans discover the Americas?The book argues against genetic explanations and other theories that tend to glorify Europeans as some sort of master race. It doesn't condemn Europeans either. The book focuses on the facts and avoids making wholesale generalizations about cultures.The point of the book is not to explain history by virtue of cultural traits. There are plenty of books and popular beliefs that take culture for granted and base all historical events upon it.Guns, Germs, and Steel goes back even further to explain how cultures themselves developed. After all, everyone knows that proto-Europeans were a particularly violent lot. And while other cultures may have been even more violent, they didn't conquer the globe. What causes a culture to become violent and what causes a culture to become technologically savvy enough to sail around the world?This book is a fascinating read and there are much worse ways to spend $8."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This is a truly original book. It tackles the question of why europeans and their descendants are running most of the show in the world. The answer: ideal initial conditions.Diamond does a good job citing examples from other cultures at other times, to show how different groups have spread across continents, invariably wiping out the inhabitants that were already there.The book does not condone this behavior. If anything, it dispels pseudoscience notions of racial superiority - and instead provides a balanced view of history and race.If we learn anything from Mr. Diamond's book - it is that we all have much more in common than any of us lets on. And the division between the haves and have-nots of history is mostly the result of chance.My only critique: the book runs a little longer than it needs to. The main thesis is easy to grasp, and the book would benefit from being edited down by a chapter or so."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I loved this book! It starts at the beginning presenting a history of human evolution that rings true for me. The book is divided into different subject areas all designed to support the theory that the Eur-Asian continent provided white men with significant advantages over folks on continents that are taller than they are wide. The book includes the progression of man from hunter-gatherers to farming, the qualities that make a good domestic animal (cow), the origins of the written word, etc. He supports his theories with an abundance of research which at times caused me to think &quot;I'm sold. Let's move on.&quot; Overall it was an easy read and the information was valuable on so many levels."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"In Guns, Germs and Steel, Jared Diamond explores the reasons why some societies have prospered and others haven't. Why was it that Europe conquered North America and not vice-versa? Jared shows that the causes date back to the origins of humanity.The reasons Diamond describes are several but primarily focus on geography, botany and zoology, in particular the shape of the major continents and the availability of easily domesticated plants and animals. The areas that had the proper combination had people who shifted from nomadic hunter-gatherers to sedentary farmers.While this book is good, eventually Diamond repeats himself, and he hardly states anything original in the second half of the book. Thus, while the first half is intriguing and education, the second half is redundant and tedious. The five star quality of the first half and two star quality of the second half balances to 3.5, which I have rounded up.Diamond also has something of a bias against civilizations, often referring to them sardonically as kleptocracies; on the other hand, he reveres the simpler societies and seems to lament their inevitable decline. This slant may turn off some readers, but if you can overlook this bias, you'll find that this book is very insightful. And if you only read half of it, that will be enough to get all you need from it."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"The word for this book is awesome. It challenges the mind and the conscience both in detailing the history of human civilization. Not many history books do this. The history in the book is wonderful.

Diamond has pulled off a rare feat--he has written a book that completely transformed the way I view history. It is as if I had been seeing it through a murky, sepia-toned filter that has now been stripped away.I am a student of both history and anthropology, with a particular interest in the meeting of cultures (and the resulting conflicts), and &quot;Guns, Germs, and Steel&quot; has changed the way I approach and analyze those historical events.

Diamond draws upon a wealth of expertise in fields as diverse as botany, zoology, archaeology and anthropology to produce a non-racist, environmental explanation for why European peoples came to dominate the globe. You may have to read it in order to believe it. As the simplicity and obviousness of Diamond's multi-layered argument unfolds, it has the reader repeatedly slapping his hand on his forehead and saying &quot;duh&quot;. You wonder why, for so many years, so many of us have subconsciously entertained simplistic, culturally-based explanations of the &quot;backwardness&quot; of the world's colonized peoples. Now we know the true story, and we owe a big vote of thanks to Jared Diamond for writing it. Even if his detailed explanations are a bit long-winded and repetitive at times, he makes up for this shortcoming with just enough amusing anectodes about the ironies inherent in the &quot;fates of human societies&quot; to make this book an expansive and delicious read."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This book tries to answer a question which I am sure many of you have asked before, why did Europeans develop technology and conquer the world and other people didn't. He answers the question completely leaving no details out. His answer isn't a typical racist one which says the Europeans were genetically or culturally superior but that geography, climate and other natural elements prevented peoples who happened to be in one region from having the same natural advantages that people from Europe and the Fertile Cresent had. He organizes the book in four understandable parts. The first one dealing with an overview of human evolution and how we all started out the same but as we spread out the different regions gave some people disadvantages. The second part is about how people in the Fertile Cresent had an advantage over everyone in domesticatable mammals and grains and the third part is about how this food production lead to technology. The fourth part gives a whole overview of all the regions of the world and how each culture developed or didn't develop technology and the reasons for it. The prose style is this book is easy to read and but the subject matter for some people might get bored because sometimes there were long tangents where the original thesis isn't relavant. These tangents can also be a good thing because he goes on to talk about the histories of the different regions of the world. I recommend this book to anyone who ever asked the question, history happen the way it happened and someone who wants to learn about world cultures. I don't recommend this book someone who can't read informational books with a lot of data. Although there were some interesting stories at the beginning of each chapter most of it is just informational. I would also say that the reading level of this book is high school and above. Although it is easy to read, younger people might think the subject matter is boring and get distracted from all the information that is thrown at them. All in all this was a great book!"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This book did for me exactly what the author hoped it would: took my racist* world-view and gave me a compelling alternative explanation that has now replaced it.Previous reviewers on this site seem to be criticizing the thesis of \\"geography as destiny.\\" Maybe there is room to debate about whether some individuals or cultures have themselves been (or are, or will be) the ultimate agents of some long-term changes in the story of humanity. But you can't deny that facts such as that black Africans had hardly any domesticatable crop species and no domesticable large animal species go a long way towards explaining why they never produced the kind of agricultural surpluses required to start conquering white people, rather than vice-versa. For all I knew before reading Guns, Germs & Steel, black Africans were sitting on as many agricultural resources as white Europeans but simply never developed them to a fuller potential.Other reviewers have criticized bias in the book, citing as examples Diamond's positive statements about some native persons. Nevertheless, Diamond has an avalanche of data to support his arguments. Maybe he has a bias, but, if so, it sure is an educated one with a huge and impressive collection of empirical support.Another critic said that Diamond's book is nothing new. Diamond is the first to say in his book that all human contributions and innovations build on the work of others. To Diamond and his publisher's credit, it is this book that reached my layperson eyes, was written in an accessible and convincing way, and changed my world-view.I recall other detractors saying the book was repetitive. This is true sometimes, but it seems to stem from Diamond approaching his investigation from multiple perspectives in differently themed chapters. The repetition reinforces the main points and also allows people who don't want to read all 400 pages to select a single chapter and nonetheless obtain a good picture of how the topic of that chapter supports Diamond's thesis.For such a marvelous, world-view changing achievement, I cannot believe how many people have lined up to take a swing! In my eyes, their criticisms pale in comparison to the fact that I started the book as a racist and finished it as someone who knows better and can now tell my children and others about it.*I thought the differences in how history has and is turning out for persons of different colors had to do mostly with cultural or genetic differences between the people themselves.

Jared Diamond's goal is to explain why Eurasians conquered Africans, Australians, and Americans instead of the other way around, even though conventional social scientists shy away from such a fundamental question out of fear of what they might find. Since random accidents of personality and culture appear too trivial to account for the clash of continents' lopsided outcomes (e.g., a few hundred Conquistadors demolished the grandest empires of the New World), this leaves only two possible underlying causes: either the winners had better homelands or better bodies and brains. Deeming genetic explanations &quot;racist&quot; and &quot;loathsome,&quot; Diamond sets out to reaffirm the equality of humanity by showing the inequality of the continents. To him, the three most important engines of history are location, location, and location.Few are more broadly qualified to write history in terms of geography and sociobiology. A molecular physiologist at UCLA, Diamond is also an evolutionary biologist in the field. His 33 years birdwatching in the tropics, especially in New Guinea, home to 1000 of Earth's 6000 languages, put him in touch with a remarkable variety of humans. Diamond wrote surprisingly little for popular audiences before his dazzling 1992 book, The Third Chimpanzee: The Evolution and Future of the Human Animal. In contrast to that kaleidoscopic page-turner, Guns, Germs, and Steel hammers away at a single thesis, sometimes repetitiously. Nonetheless, it rewards the effort.Diamond argues that the broadest aspects of the modern world -- e.g., North America's domination by whites -- were largely determined by the continents' dissimilar natural resources of domesticatable plants and animals. Regions offering an abundance of these could support the transition from hunter-gatherer to farmer-herder, allowing higher population densities. And those communities that could free up the most manpower from farming to specialize in technology and war could conquer their neighbors. A few areas, especially the Middle East, were home to many easily domesticated foods: both wild grains like wheat and large mammals like cows and sheep. Other parts of Eurasia such as Europe were close enough to the Fertile Crescent for early diffusion of these crops and livestock.In contrast, much of the Earth, including seemingly congenial landscapes like California, lacks native plants that would be more profitable to cultivate than to gather. What valuable vegetation the New World did possess, like Mexico's corn, was slow to migrate north and south along the Americas' main axis because crops' growing seasons are sensitive to latitude. (Since the vast Eurasian continent's main axis is east-west, however, foods diffused more easily there.)Also, the New World was badly lacking in large domesticatable mammals. Excluding boutique operations, today humans raise just 14 species of mammals of over 100 pounds. Of these, only the llama/alpaca is native to the Americas. Of course, 13,000 years ago the New World teemed with potentially useful beasts like horses and camels. Then the American Indian arrived and, Diamond says, ate them. This rapacity made their Aztec and Inca descendants both militarily impotent and dreadfully susceptible to the Conquistadors' diseases. The Spaniards, in contrast, were heirs to not just Eurasia's foods and technologies (including Chinese inventions like paper, gunpowder, and the compass), but also to immunities to its germs. Since the worst epidemics are descended from farm animals' diseases (e.g., smallpox from cows), native Americans had no diseases of their own (except possibly syphilis) with which to fight back.Diamond's geohistorical approach certainly clarifies continental-scale history. Most of world history, however, is Eurasian history, and he's only sketchy on why the West Eurasians eventually overcame the East and South Eurasians.Diamond is not content, however, to merely write the history of the last 13,000 years. He also claims that his evidence is of great political momentuousness because it shows that no ethnic group is inferior to any other: each exploited its local food resources as fully as possible. For example, after the Australian Outback explorers Burke and Wills exhausted their Eurasian-derived supplies, three times they had to throw themselves on the mercy and expertise of the local Stone Age hunter-gatherers. These Aborigines, the least technically advanced of all peoples, may not have domesticated a single Australian plant in 40,000 years, but in 200 years down under scientific whites have domesticated merely the macadamia nut. Farming only pays in Australia when using imported crops and livestock.But, are indigenous peoples merely not inferior? In truth, on their own turf many ethnic groups appear to be somewhat genetically superior to outsiders. Diamond makes environmental differences seem so compelling that it's hard to believe that humans would not become somewhat adapted to their homelands through natural selection. And in fact, Diamond himself briefly cites several examples of genetic differences impacting history. Despite military superiority, Europeans repeatedly failed to settle equatorial West Africa, in part because they lacked the malaria resistance conferred on many natives by the sickle cell gene. Similarly, biological disadvantages stopped whites from overrunning the Andes. Does this make Diamond a loathsome racist? No, but it does imply that a scientific-minded observer like Diamond should not dogmatically denounce genetic explanations, since he is liable to get tarred with his own brush.The undeniability of human biodiversity does not prove that we also differ somewhat mentally, but it's hard to imagine why the brain would differ radically from the rest of the body. Consider the fable of the grasshopper and the ant. The ant's personality traits -- foresight and caution -- fitted him to survive his region's predictably harsh winters. Yet, the grasshopper's strengths -- improvisation and spontaneity -- might furnish Darwinian superiority in a tropical land where the dangers are unpredictable.Like many, Diamond appears to confuse the concepts of genetic superiorities (plural) and genetic supremacy (singular). The former are circumstance-specific. For example, a slim, heat-shedding Somalian-style body is inferior to a typically stocky, heat-conserving Eskimo physique in Nome, but it's superior in Mogadishu (and in Manhattan, too, if, you want to become a fashion model and marry David Bowie, like Somalian supermodel Iman). In contrast, genetic supremacy is the dangerous fantasy that one group is best at everything. Before the European explosion began in the 15th Century, it seemed apparent that no race could be supreme. Even the arrogant Chinese were periodically overrun by less-cultured barbarians. The recent European supremacy in both the arts of war and of peace was partly an optical illusion masking the usual tradeoffs in talents within Europe (e.g., Italian admirals were as inept as English cooks). Still, the rise and reign of Europe remains the biggest event in world history. Yet, the era when Europeans could plausibly claim supremacy over all other races has been dead for at least the 60 years since Hitler, of all people, allied with Japan.The historian who trumpets the political relevance of his work must consider both the past and the future, which Diamond fails to do. Surprisingly, ethnic biodiversity is becoming more important in numerous ways. Until recently, one's location and social position at birth closely constrained one's fate. But, as equality of opportunity grows, the globalized marketplace increasingly exploits all advantages in talent, including those with genetic roots. Pro sports offer a foretaste of the future: many are resegregating themselves as ethnic groups increasingly specialize"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I quit reading this book about halfway through because I became so frustrated at the author's style. It's obviously appropriate for authors to have biases (we all do), but when writing a factual history based on substantial research those biases should not be so evident.Mr. Diamond (from UCLA) is too apparent. How can he write that some island societies had no organized communities, yet at the same time say they \\"renounced war\\"? How and why would an unorganized community having no contact with other communities \\"renounce war\\"? Also, can we really say that one of the primary reasons that more developed societies defeated the hunter-gatherers is because the developed societies had religious leaders to justify war? It's perfectly acceptable to be a peace activist or to be very skeptical of religious believers (viewpoints that I am very confident are held by Mr. Diamond), but having those perspectives be so evident in what is supposed to be a factual history greatly discounted the validity of this book for me. There are many other examples I could share of Mr. Diamond unnecessarily injecting into history what appeared to me to be his personal left-wing biases.Mr. Diamond's premise that geography, and then 'guns, germs, and steel', overwhelmingly influenced the course of history seems well-founded to me ... but I will take away nothing other than that from this book."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I thought this book was pretty good.

Diamond hits the nail on the head in his porpouse to inform the every day reader in on what really is going on around the globe into the earliest times.I would recomend this book to the knowledge seeking reader who is interested in anything about the world from all kinds of different time periods. The book can be a little confusing considering how it jumps from topic to topic so abruptly, but for the most part its easy to keep up with, even if you have no background knowledge to support your reading.

The thoughts that he introduces in the book are certainly interesting and he presents us with a new way to interpret history which is certainly important. However, there is much overkill in making points about the development of each civilization - crops are the major topic with little discussion on guns, germs (more than the other 2), and steel. Of course the arguement for this focus is that the domestication of crops is how civilizations develop guns, germs and steel. I enjoyed parts of the book considerably, but you would have to have a strong interest in horticulture and botany to truely appreciate the book. I guess I was spoiled by first reading his sequel to GGS, \\"Collapse\\" - a terrific read that should be of interest to everyone -it relates our industrialization to every aspect of the environment and show historically how this has shaped history. It has major rammifications for our situation on this earth right now. -RK"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This is going to be a short and sweet review because many others have commented on this book at length. I want to contribute my two cents as a concise opinion based on its value as a powerful, engaging and thought provoking story.This book packs the punch of great fiction. It covers a broad territory from the ice age to the present with the drama of an epic. You certainly don't need to be a history major, biologist or anthropologist to be moved by the story of civilization as told by the author.Jared Diamond places a very strong emphasis on the role of geography, environment and other factors that relate back to nature in the rise of civilizations. I think the major shortcoming of his work is that he doesn't give enough credit to social factors and their role is history.If you don't know a lot about history or how physical factors in the environment contributed to the rise of agriculture, the need for armies, etc. You will find this fascinating reading. If you have a deep knowledge of these areas, anthropology and sociology, you may find the overly reductionistic stance annoying. However, most likely you will enjoy the well-written story if you can keep in mind that it doesn't provide the full picture.In short, this book magnificently illuminates Jared Diamond's specific areas of interest, while downplaying or neglecting others. It provides a valuable piece of the truth and it does so in a very engaging and thoughtful manner."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Jared Diamond has managed to condense in a few hundred pages several powerful arguments about the differences in development between continents and people. The basic argument is that the ultimate causes which led to the divergent courses of the different peoples in our time had to do with food, geographical factors such as the orientation of the axes on each continent and immunity from disease conferred upon farmers. These in turn led to the development of writing, technology, government and guns, which were the proximate causes of the West's ascendancy in the last 500 years of so.As a Christian, I do not agree with the theory of evolution so I could not agree with Diamond's take on prehistory, but I do agree with his arguments about the advantages that farming gave over the hunter-gatherer lifestyle or the importance of domesticable animals to development on the different continents. It is by this careful building of \`irrefutable' argument upon \`irrefutable' argument that makes his theory quite plausible.One problem with his theory however, is that it leaves humans on the periphery of history. He acknowledges the role that several historical giants have played but considers their impact on history to be minor. Is this so though? Has not Hitler had a major effect on subsequent history, did not Ceasar? and what of the Pharaohs? This and his classification of several peoples into different racial groups than one would expect are two small matters that I took issue with.Apart from the above, I found the book to be worth the time invested in reading it. Diamond brings a fresh perspective on our understanding of the world we live in and his clear style of writing makes this work highly readable. Definitely a must read."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Provocative concerning geography's impact on culture but flawed and inconsistent in its attempt to prove that races are of equal intelligence is how I would discribe Guns, Germs, and Steel. Jared Diamond definitely needs to study more evolutionary biology. I recommend THE BEAK OF THE FINCH as a good place to start in order to understand how quickly evolution can and does occur. Whether survival advantages conferred on the most future oriented or small tribal populations which benefited from a kind of genetic drift roulette wheel the evidence shows that races are not of equal intelligence. Even homogeneous populations within racial groups show remarkable differences in intelligence. On the other hand the impact on culture caused by the ebb and flow of people across Eurasia is quite convincing."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"It's a very good book; and I think that it adds a piece to the puzzle as to why European culture dominated for hundreds of years. Diamond's flaw is that he neglects a few major events that occured which also pushed Europe along this path:-The Islamic world's regression into religious extremism after the Crusades caused it to lose ground technologically.-The Renaissance in Europe (which also was a direct result of the Crusades) helped increase trade in Europe which caused it to gain ground technologically-The fact that China made a conscience decision to withdraw into isolation caused it to lose ground technologicallyI think that Guns, Germs, & Steel is a great book in two regards: It shows that geography played a larger part in shaping history that most of us thought; and I think it does a very good job in demonstrating that all races are equally intelligent.That said, his attempt to broadly explain the entire course of history is a little short-sighted."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"How did the Eurasian societies come to dominate the peoples of North and South America, Africa, and Australia. Diamond places a number of nice theories on how Eurasia came to dominate and colonize those of the other continents. They are all very plausible, and that is why this book offers such a vast vault of information. In fact, there is a lot of info in these pages, so the reader may be placed on overload just trying to understand all this.Some of the theories focus on the geography of the Eurasia compared to the others. Eurasia spreads east and west and in many cases, weather was duplicated from one place to the next. The other continents were spread north and south. The peoples of Eurasia built cities and were more concentrated than other societies and thus were more immune to diseases. When these diseases came into contact with people from other continents, there was no one who was immune. Big tamed animals and plants were more plentiful in Eurasia than elsewhere. There is so much more in this book that is all very valid. That is why Eurasian societies ended up with more of the cargo.This is a great read.

It makes some good sense. It could be considered a racial approach to history."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"The book Guns, Germs and Steel by Jared Diamond says that the earth has four factors to the development of history its self 1. Availability of potential crops and domestic animals 2. The areas of which geographic terms apply to the spread of agriculture, 3) transfer of knowledge between continents and 4.Population size. Jared brings up strong arguments in each of these topics making it really hard to come back at him with ideas that topple his own. I for one am fascinated by the amount of work he put in to his research in to findings. Though when reading the book I saw that he often \\"if\\" or \\"could occur\\" that things were the way he thought. In other words he wasn't always sure of the findings that he found. When he started to talk about domestication early in the book he explained that in about the early 1400s domestication didn't start and wild animals and plants continued to grow. Until the 1800 when Europe and Asia stated to control them and start harvesting them to there use. It started from plants to animals to production. Animals such as ox and horses were used to help harvest and work on the fields to do jobs that would take weeks of doing. As that went on People started to plant the seeds of the plants to harvest them as they became more and more easy to grow, but grain was mostly the thing that was commonly made because in Europe it was mostly hot with cold nights which made a nice home to grains. When that happened everyone started to use that method so that the amount of food that they needed was there.Agriculture has start for quiet some time now but because of the temperatures and each condition that each plant needs not all areas of the earth are able to give enough of the needs that one plant needs making agriculture fail or not succeed in some areas. Though if agriculture did not prosper at the time or place, other activities were made. When Spain had come over to the southern part of Mexico they only knew about power greed and wealth unlike the Aztecs that already lived there. When the time of departure came, the Spaniards had carried with them not only new things to the new land but also disease and killings.With know guns germs and steel being passed around for conquering Jared Diamond switches his topic over to transferring knowledge between countries. Know China ideas of writing were passed on all over the world being more and more diverse as it does. The way of writing originated in China and which is know known as the \\"Writers Country\\" to some people. Japan and Korea are some places that copy the same technique in writing but when it moved more west it turned in to more simple and bold writing (To Westerners).Writing wasn't the only one to be born and changed around the world. Germs have been passed from end of the earth to the other from transportation to contamination. Even though some medicines have been made from herbs and other things the amount of changes that occur in the viruses change rapidly, but people such as the New Guinea. New Guanines have various cures for some things that we have here only at a workable price. Knowledge of history and even great teachings of wise people that are portrayed like that in some countries. Religions is also moving around the globe even today more and more religions are slowly progressing each which there own beliefs or feelings.As food progresses so does the population. If the amount of food rises and is able to fully support its consumers then there is a likely chance for it to expand in population. Also if the population expands more and more resources are used to complete the needs of the villagers.Poplulation can only grow till the carrying capacity of one are is filled and cause emigration to occur. When this happens more immigration would occur leading to different people coming and leaving. Over all this book has taught me a lot about history and how things work from its ancestors."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Jared Diamond explains why cultures differ in prosperity and scientific progress within the same time frame in history.Example: Europe and Africa.This book should be a required text of all college freshmen and a recommended text in all high schools.A real eye opener for our time."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"A great find for any history buff.

This is the first book which actually succeeds. It is not your typical history book as it is based on the sciences of ethnobotany, ethnobiology and genetics. It attempts to address the question of *why* has Euroasian civilization been so successful. The book demolishes all racist arguments, i.e., that European civilization has reached its dominating position as a result of innate abilities of its citizens. Instead, Professor Diamond convincingly argues that it is the prevalence of domesticable plants and animals that are the core factors leading to the development of civilization, and from thence the guns, germs and steel of the title. The only reason I did not give this book five stars is because it bogs down a bit in the later chapters; Diamond tries too hard to support his theses which have already been adequately presented."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"i really enjoyed this book. i thought it made an interesting case for the effect of geography/the environment on the development of civilizations. very well reasoned and readable."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Jared Diamond does an excellent job of setting out some reasons behind how different areas developed.

In addition, it is written in an engaging manner, which I enjoyed.It does not consider the impact of societal structure or culture, and cannot therefore explain why it was Western Europe rather than other Eurasian centres such as the Middle East, India or China that came to dominate the world.

Jared Diamond's writing is easy to read and absolutely addictive after the first few pages.

Even if you don't agree with some of the ideas in this book, they will at least give you an original view and make you challenge your own assumptions.

The author makes a pedestrian case for why White people ended up ruling the world. I say pedestrian because after reading the book, I still don't feel sold with his argument. I definitely agree with him, that the western world (white man) rules the world, but the way he lead up to his final thesis and conclusion did not fully satisfy the question.Despite that, what I loved about the book was how the author walks the reader through the geographical and human history of all races in the world, and how they ended up on the continents they are now known to inhabit. I learned that there were three Black races in Sub-Saharan Africa: Negroids, pygmies, and the third became extinct. But what blew my mind was learning that one of these races was one of the first inhabitants of South Asia and Australia, which led to the Australian Aborigines. This s*** just blew my mind!Tree of Indo-European LanguagesBut where the book stands out, was how it was able to objectively prove and figure these things out via science, and to my surprise, linguistics. If any thing, I learned how crucial human languages can be used to figure out the evolutionary history of peoples inhabiting a particular region.For instance, take a look at England. Comparing the English language to other European languages, linguists deduce that English evolved from Germanic languages. Looking at the linguistic history of Germanic languages, they can tell that they evolved from other Indo-European languages. If you now match this up to actual history, it is SPOT ON! England was inhabited by the Anglo-Saxons, who were descendants of Indo-Europeans. The fact that the evolution of human languages could be so through in telling us human geographical history and evolution, was quite eye opening.This book gets a thumbs up for that alone.To wrap up, if you want to know the question to the answer of why the white man (western world) rules the world, despite being the smallest of the main groups (Asians, Africans, etc.), then this book will not fully satisfy your appetite. It will quench it and explain the issue with guns, germs and steel. However, you will still be left hungry, but that is more a reflection on the magnitude of the question and the history of the world itself, rather than the book.The book is a great read if you want to learn more about human evolutionary and lingual history."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Dr. Diamond certainly posits some tantalizing \\"answers\\" to the colonization era of Western civilization dominance which is a throwback to the genetic dominance arguments that were so prominent a century ago and produced such movements as Nazism. Dr. Diamond is professor of geography, so it should not be a surprise to the reader that geography features prominently in this book. To me, as someone who always viewed geography as a collection of facts not a discipline, this is the only real value in the book as I seriously question his conclusions based on fields outside his expertise.I'll will do my best to review here, but honestly I couldn't finish the book. I just found the discussion more and more ludicrous with each page. A frustration that was reinforced by the fact Dr. Diamond provides no end notes for the curious reader to further investigate.As mentioned, his most prominent theory is that of geography and how the Eurasian landmass is East-West while the African and North American/South American landmasses are North-South. North-South landmass orientations result in little plant and animal diversification due to variable climes while East-West result in large plant and animal diversification due to similar climes. He then goes on to cite the many different grains and animals that were domesticated by Eurasian peoples versus the limited choices available to African and American peoples.But even this theory seems like an oversimplification of a much more complex problem. For example: if one looks at food production today, the top grain is not wheat, but maize, which he denounces as a poor crop due to the need for nixtamalization. However, the Three Sisters of squash, maize, and beans cultivated by native Americans demonstrates remarkable technological advancement. And let's not forget the all important potato and tomato to current food production. In contrast, the only real Eurasian grains of any importance in modern production are rice and wheat in that order. The rest barely make a dent. In fact, the only reason wheat is so successful today is the work of a single man by the name of Norman Borlaug in the 1950s and 60s. Prior to this, historically wheat was a very weak crop with a limited suitable growing area; wheat crops often failed and resulted in subsequent famines in places where there was an over-reliance. Dr. Diamond appears unaware of this.The germs argument is certainly not original, and I think common knowledge to most enlightened individuals. But, while Dr. Diamond asserts that these germs somehow contributed to Western civilization dominance, I think it is more accurate to say: the combination of an over-reliance on a weak agricultural crop (wheat) and deadly communicable diseases resulting from domesticating cows, pigs, etc., actually made Western civilization a quite precarious existence which contributed to the cultural phenomenon of colonization. In other words, colonization was an attempt to diversify away from limited agricultural choices/regions. Seen in this light, Dr. Diamond's arguments are simply hogwash.Many others besides myself have criticized Dr. Diamond's theories. But for me, the biggest criticism is simply the lack of additional reading, footnotes, end notes, references, bibliography, nothing! The reader has no choice but to take Dr. Diamond for his word regarding the many facts and figures he throws at you. The book I suppose is a good read for the casual reader who has occasionally wondered \\"what happened to the Aztecs?\\" But, beyond that level it is a bad read.For that, I only give it 2 stars."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"GUNS, GERMS & STEEL is like a textbook, a tedious read but well worth the information.

Like he says himself, such a task could not be resumed in one book. So I was surprised about his determination in presenting his conclusions so strongly instead of allowing the reader to make his own mind from the facts and ideas presented in his book. His approach is really broad and it's difficult to distinguish in his writing the difference between his interpretation and the real reasons that would explain certain events in humain history. Our history has been shaped by many factors, some of them that we know of, some that we will know one day or others that we will never know. Someone could write a book called: ''Natural disasters, religion and great leaders'', incorporate selected facts and lead the reader to believe that these factors more importantly shaped the world we are living now. It would be wrong again to do so.The book sounds like it answers it all. Still, most of the ideas of this book are really interesting.What I liked:- The facts presented. So much information in a single book and the way it is presented is worth the reading.- The ideas presented by the author on how certain environnemental factors probably shaped the course of history.- The book covers different part of the world and not just the Occident.What I did not like:- I felt the author knew he would be exposed to criticisms and he spent a lot of time establishing his credentials (including his parents occupations). He spent time also answering in advance potential criticisms.- I did not feel his use of Maths were always adequate in his writing. Ex.: He writes in page 61: ''Population size is the product of population density (people per square mile) and area (square miles)''. People know what a population size is. You measure a population size and then you calculate a population density, not the other way around. On page 364 he writes: ''The calculation given in Chapter 1 tell us that even if a mere 100 pionneering Native Americans had crossed the Canadian border into the lower United States and increased at a rate of only 1 percent per year, they would have saturated the Americas with hunter-gatherers within 1,000 years'' Such argument (linear increase of a population until saturation of a geographical area) helps the author to shortcut to conclusions. It seems easy to support historian theories this way but for me, those hypothesis spanning hundred and thousand of years in only a few sentences streches thin the validity of a conclusion based on them.- The author repeats himself a lot.- The author writes a lot about the fact that history is not considered as a science. To me, this book reinforce this fact. I consider someone must use caution in using scientific facts to explain history.Overall:I sometimes felt this book was written to support a title and I had to keep skepticism all the way reading it. Beside, I learned a lot. The author deserved a Pulitzer Prize (General Nonfiction, not History) for this book. I think it is still a must for anyone interested in human history."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I found this book both an easy read that's loaded with interesting information.

Why did some nations flourish, while others faltered? How did the world get to be the way it is today? These questions and more are addressed by UCLA professor Jared Diamond in his book Guns, Germs, and Steel. The book tells the truth behind these things, explaining the reasons for Eurasian dominance. According to the book, Eurasian dominance was due not to heredity, but rather due to geographic location and proximity to resources.Diamond presents a very compelling thesis in his work. He argues that a civilization that became powerful did so essential due to luck. That is, Diamond theorized that natural resources and location were central to development. There was a chain reaction of events that led to success or failure in the world. First was environment, then agriculture, then rises in population. With more people, there was a greater chance for innovation and survival. Also, European civilizations recovered from the plague faster than others, allowing them extra years to grow economically and technologically.Though there are many complex and intricate theses being presented in the book, Diamond still manages to produce a coherent and engaging book. It is well written, with a good structure and compelling arguments. I found the chapter \\"Necessity's Mother\\" particularly engrossing. The argument was well made, and the points were well founded. It was logical and easy to understand.My only criticism of the book would have to be the simplicity of its overall argument. Although it presents a great number of causes and effects that lead to our modern day, I still feel that it did not cover every reason for our modern day situation. Of course, this question is incredibly broad, and I for one believe that there are far too many reasons than can be covered in one book. I think that Diamond's question is too broad. His book is very well written and presented, but it simply tries to answer a question far too expansive to answer.I enjoyed Guns, Germs, and Steel very much. It was very intelligent, and it did a good job at attempting to answer the questions it posed. However, I felt that there was no way to answer the question in one book. Nonetheless, I thoroughly enjoyed the book, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a smart read."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Did agriculture, animal domestication and a region's geographic orientation provide some civilizations with advantages over others, allowing these societies to rise and gain superiority over disadvantaged regions? According to Jared Diamond, author of Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fate of Human Societies (1997) \\"Environment molds history\\" (p. 352). Diamond argues that environmental, not biological or cultural, factors played the most influential role in shaping historical progress and accounts for Europe's rise and dominance over other world regions.Diamond, an evolutionary biologist and biogeographer, tackles the question of why some societies progressed and dominated other regions by systematically taking the reader on a 19-chapter, 13,000 year tour through world history. He supports his thesis by detailing how each phase is explainable predominantly by environmental and geographical differences. Europe or Eurasia, as Diamond refers to this region, profited from these advantages and emerged as dominate leader.Diamond argues that environment and climate helped crop cultivation and animal domestication in Eurasia leading to increased food production. Other regions suffered because of unsuitable climates for agriculture or a shortage of large animals that could be domesticated. Farming and herding resulted in what Diamond refers to as food production. When food supply is plentiful and people do not have to scavenge for food, populations increase. Throughout the book, Diamond reinforces the importance of food production in relation to advantages it provided for civilizations to develop and become more technologically advanced than other world regions. \\"Hence, all other things being equal, technology develops fastest in large, productive regions with large human populations, many potential inventors, and many competing societies\\" (p. 261).Development, according to Diamond, is also affected by a region's geographic location. East-west geographic orientation of Eurasia, as opposed to north-south axis of Africa and America, fostered spread of agriculture and technology across the large continent. The result was not only the development of organized empires and technological advances (transportation, communication, and weapons) but also epidemic diseases. Germs, spread by animals, killed many. Survivors developed immunity affording them protection from these diseases. As these groups moved forward they spread these germs to other civilizations that they sought to conquer. Diamond illustrates this in Chapter 3 by describing how Francisco Pizarro with less than 200 soldiers brought about the collapse of the Inca Empire. Pizarro's men, armed with swords, armor and riding horses for speed and maneuverability, carried infectious diseases that killed many.Diamond's book challenges a widely accepted theory that supports biological superiority. That theory argues that the most intelligent beings are the first to invent, develop technology, conquer, and dominate. In contrast, Diamond devotes the majority of his book explaining why environmental differences determined dominance of one society over another. He clearly explains that Europeans had key advantages over Africans and Native Americans as of result of environmental and geographical differences not biological ones. Throughout the book, Diamond provides historical explanations illustrating why the racial superiority theory fails to fully explain these differences.Given the topic's complexity, Diamond's style is very organized and understandable by the reader. He defines words, provides examples to support and essentially uses simple language. He intersperses personal observations and experiences with history and theory.One could criticize that Diamond presents history following an inevitable path without conceding that culture and individuals play a significant role in world history. Although he fails to do so in the book, his theory could be extended to explain modern occurrences. Diamond's statement in the book's Afterward clearly states his view: \\"My main conclusion was that societies developed differently on different continents because of differences in continental environment, not in human biology\\" (pg. 426). He succeeded in providing a convincing argument while offering the reader much to ponder and debate."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This book affected the way that I looked at the world, from a historical perspective, and in every world-building exercise I've ever undertaken for a novel or short story.It literally change my perspective.A must read for anyone who wants to write speculative fiction or understand why it is that some groups of people, i.e., the West, has so much, and some other groups, i.e., the developing world, has so little.

As he explores the world, he discovers that after the last ice age the European continent had the right mix of flora, fauna, climate, ample food, four distinct seasons, natural resources like steel, germs, and size that when the extremely innovative and intelligent learning animal (humanity) showed up (well we were already there) but humanity was able and forced by climate/geography/population to make use of all of the resources available to him/her there. This allowed Europeans to break out from Europe and bring Cargo to the people of the Pacific Islands: people who did not have resources, pressure, beasts of burden, or geography to develop the civilization that Europeans were able to develop.The work is simply phenomenal. The book is wonderful in many respects because it brings all humans together as members of one big race that at some point in time rose to and adapted to colonize the entire planet and that this diversity and differences in all of us is valuable and that it should be cherished. After all, it was a man from New Guinea who stood up and asked this extremely profound question of Diamond. Clearly the man had time to contemplate this topic and it took someone like Diamond to chase down the answer.Impressive book all the way around."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I have not finished the book but it reads like a novel. If you want to learn about the development of food and arms this book is a winner. Not to be missed."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"There has been much written about this book already in these reviews, so I won't belabor the many points which have already been made. I thought this book was quite good. It certainly changed and influenced many of the ways I view the development of mankind. While I do not agree with all of the authors views, he has certainly delivered a tremendous effort. The book is well worth reading.One point I found quite intriguing, and had not heard before, was that since the European landmass is so separated by mountains and rivers, it led to the formation of many different nations, contributing to the intra-continental competition. As Diamond noted, this benefited individuals such as Christopher Columbus who had multiple monarchs to pitch his new route to the Indies voyage. Though most turned him down, eventually he found a patron.I particularly appreciated Diamond's section at the end of the book on why, from his perspective, history is a science. I happen to agree with that statement. While we do not have to agree with every theory and hypothesis of history, if we treat it as a science we can develop a much greater understanding of why we are, as humanity, where we are today. By the way, this scientific effort need not negate opinions of intelligent design and a Creator (not an opinion Diamond put forward in \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies\\", but one I fee would fit the scientific/historical testing method. Recommended!"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies is a captivating book by an evolutionary biologist, trying to shed light on why certain civilizations fared better than others. The structure of the book has a scientific flavor about it, is explicitly biased towards geographical determinism, but far from providing peremptory arguments on the subject. The examples are thoroughly expanded with a lot of detailed information, inspired by diverse civilizations painted in different times. The reader clearly feels that the book is the result of in depth research."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Numerous reviews discuss the content of the book at length. I'd rather focus on the book itself. I've had the opportunity to read both the paperback and Kindle versions of this book, and this review is specifically for the Kindle version. My issues with Guns, Germs and Steel are two-fold: first, the book is huge. There is a LOT of content to cover, some of which is repetitive, and Mr. Diamond *loves* his case studies. While very thorough, at times I feel a bit like I'm being hammered on with example after example supporting his thesis. A good 20% of this book could have been eliminated and still have been just as substantial.Secondly, and the main reason for a 3-star review instead of 4, is specifically dealing with the Kindle version's layout: while there are repeated references to tables and maps, they do not appear in the Kindle version. They really made a difference in making some of what Mr. Diamond references, clear, in the paperback, but with them gone in the Kindle, it rapidly becomes confusing and uninteresting. Footnotes, especially linked footnotes, would have gone a LONG way in promoting the readability of the book, and made the girth much more bearable."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Great book! I've been wanting to read it for years and I was glad to find it on here for a reasonable price !"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"A fascinating journey through history investigating the factors of geography and biological circumstances which led some human societies to advance technologically while others stagnated. Beginning with the simplest human societies, Diamond explains in great detail what led to the advancements that allowed small tribal communities to develop into larger civilizations with sufficient surplus of resources to allow for the development of technologies which would propel those societies to be among the conquerors as opposed to those being conquered.Diamond provides thorough research and evidence to back his conclusions, and his arguments are well developed and seem to lead the reader from one point to the next while leaving no doubt as to logic used to lead. While there may be some critics who find the assertion that geographic and biologic \\"luck\\" shaped the world as we know it today too simplistic, Diamond's book provides a very well stated \\"unified\\" theory of human societal development. There are certainly other factors which have entered into the complex history of human societies, but Diamond's point seems to be that these other factors, while historically significant, are relatively minor in comparison to the long-term and globally attributable influences of geography and the availability of domesticable plant and animal species in different parts of the world."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"His contention that geography is a major determinant in human societies is quite interesting and relevant, but on the other hand I think he overstates his case. He also repeats his arguments, and repeats them, and repeats them again. So much so that I could not finish it because it had gotten so boring. I think he could've shortened the book to roughly 1/3 its current length (where were the editors??) There are many arguments that could considerably water down Diamond's, many of which are contained in the online reviews. I will add a few more. For instance, his case that most of the easily domesticable grains are contained in the fertile crescent. Is this because the wild versions are truly more edible, or because they have been hybridized with the domestic varieties? He doesn't elaborate enough on the genetics research for one to make a judgement. He also states that there are no large domesticable animals in N. America. What about caribou? A very closely related species, the reindeer, (Wikipedia claims that they are the same) has been domesticated in Europe. It is also quite probable that the bison could also have been domesticated, and they were probably well on their way to being so when the white man showed up.Personally, I think that the white race IS different, and not necessarily in a good way. He doesn't mention anything about what has been lost in the bargain. When I first heard about the Dreaming, I knew exactly what it was and what it meant. I also realize, that as a modern, white Westerner, I no longer have access to this state of mind.

It really is a good reading, specially given the astounding set of facts that the author lists for the benefit of his theory, which basically tries to address the following question: why did the europeans conquer the world and not the other way around? Not being an apologetic text, quite to the contrary, the author wants to demonstrate that what is behind the dominion of West over East is assigned to factors well beyond the control of any given human race, but mainly attributable to the play of factors not the least imputed to any race supremacy. Notwhidstanding all this, he ascertains that the earlier the domestication of animals and some varieties of staples and cereals, the more prone are human beings to be innoculated against the vagraries of some virus or disease."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"While accurate, the theories presented in this book is nothing new.

Professor Diamond offered me a glimpse of a whole landscape of thought which would have remained otherwise hidden from view. His original ideas are made all the more vivid thanks to the clarity of his writing and his discerning choice of examples. He looks at his key concerns from a number of angles, so what might strike some as being repetitious will be seen by those fascinated by his ideas as a welcome thoroughness of approach, like turning a multi-faceted gem to the light.*Perhaps it is best to see his argument as starting from the postulate - if you take human groups of sufficiently large number, then the average intelligence (however you might like to define this) will be approximately equal; given this rough equality of inner potential between groups of humans, how does one explain the diverse fates and developments of human societies throughout the breadth of geography and time? The structure of his explanation is well summarised in reviews elsewhere. The fact that his explanation is cogent and convincing, at least shows that it is not necessary to posit innate racial superiority in order to account for human history's vicissitudes.*Holding the above in mind, with its attendant thought that the book is, in a sense, addressed to an implicit enemy (those who wish to encourage views of racial superiority), helps to understand the structure of the book. It also helps to remember the scale and ambition of the argument, otherwise some deficiencies in certain details might seem more damaging than they really are.*Professor Diamond clearly has a remarkable mind and it seems a privilege to be able to share some of this thoughts."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This book is everything the book-jacket reviewers(a group not selected for their negative impressions)say it is: important and fascinating.

And there was a whole lot more about New Guinea than most of us need or want to know.I have convinced the non-finishers to give it another chance. Read every third paragraph or so if you must, or concentrate on the last two sections, resting assured that Professor Diamond has pretty well proved his assumptions of what are termed &quot;ultimate causes.&quot;I really recommended this book to the lay reader (like me) because of what it has to say, not because it is particularly well-written.

On the positive side, it had an interesting content and approached a difficult topic in a different light that I personally had not seen before. The examples were clear for the points made.Now for the other side of the coin. The 480 pages make for a very long read. Add to this length a tendency by the author make the same point over and over and over and (you get my point) in the delivery of views. It made the book feel like 1480 pages. In my mind, this really took away from the arguments presented as it seemed to be very deliberate and not just some kind of writing style.Read it anyway - I see there is now an abridged version - so get that one instead of the original.Note that 2.5 stars rounds up to 3"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This book is a complete eye opener on why certain civilizations are more advanced than others.

I learned more about the history of man from 500,000BC to 4000 BC in this book than in the rest of my life put together. The overwhelming global perspective this book makes it even more valuable. Truly a fine description of many of the core formative elements of society.The books bends over backward to avoid any taint of racism. However, Mr. Diamond oversteps his bounds when he claims that he has resolved all issues that deal with how racism arises. I wish that these issues were as easily resolved. The older deeper issues that arise before the foundation of human society still exist. And Mr. Diamond's smug self importance taints an otherwise fine book."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Other reviewers have noted that the book is a might repetitive. I share that sentiment.Many of the very unfavorable reviews...criticize Diamond because he \\"assumes away\\" or leaves out non-environmental factors like culture, religion, race, etc. These criticisms are seriously misguided and should not affect a purchase decision. The point of the book is to explain an overarching pattern in history. Many explanations can be marshaled for that purpose (race, culture, geography, etc.). Ultimately, we don't know which explanations are true apart from their ability to account for and organize the evidence.If some important factor has been left out of Diamond's account, that oversight would be reflected in an inability to explain the historical pattern -- but this book does not suffer from that inability.Diamond's point is that one does not *need* tenuous (nevermind controversial) references to race, etc., to explain this historical pattern. You can do just fine by only using fairly uncontroversial evidence on geography, crop and livestock distribution, and other environmental factors Diamond employs.In short, what are the minimal and least controversial assumptions we must make to explain this historical pattern? Diamond has a strong case that they are the ones in this book."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Diamond has written one of the absolute best, most fascinating books to come along in years. It demonstrates conclusively why the cross-pollenization of ideas across different disciplines can offer new insights.

The state of the world and the last 40,000 years of human history have never been clearer."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"A very provocative book for the unintiated. For those with a curiosity for the history of the world but with little more than a host of opinions to work with, this book is a lightning strike. Although repetitive by the end, the book states quite clearly a very compelling thesis for the reasons the world is the way it is today. Short on sociology (why the Spanish conquered South America has to do with more than their ability to do so; why did they feel the need to conquer and destroy as opposed to just discover and co-exist?) but gob-smackingly long and precise on entho-biology and -geography, this book will please and thrill the open-minded.

Being in the early stages of college, I find that Jared's approach to the situation is the most beneficial aspect of the book. Whether the hard facts are true or not, the manner in which he attacks the situation is would certainly make him an attorney of sorts. I admit, I have harbored a few questionable beliefs as to why Europe dominated social development over the centuries but my curiosity genuinely parallels Jared's in my quest to undertand why Watts and Inglewood have always been Watts and Inglewood and also why my upper-class southern California hometown refused to allow 7-11's within its city limits.

I do agree with some of the previous reviews about the author repeating some ideas to many times. Also, would the statement about New Guineans being on the average more intelligent than Europeans qualify as a racist remark? On a more serious note, several other reviewers compare the book with Landes' Wealth &amp; Poverty of Nations \`. I think both books complement each other well. The geographical and ecological factors that Diamond weaves so well to support his ideas began mattering less and less as mankind's technological capabilities grew. Then a paradigm shift took place and the factors discussed in the Landes ( culture, government, policy, etc.) book began determining success. In my view Diamond explains human history from BC 12000 to AD 1300-1400, Landes after this date. This would explain why different European countries of similar backgrounds fared so differently after 1500 AD. Any ideas anyone on what the next paradigm shift will bring?

This, in essence, is the compelling and original question that Jared Diamond asks, and answers, in this absolutely required-reading 1998 Pulitzer Prize winner.On page 87, the chart entitled \\"Factors Underlying the Broadest Pattern of History\\" outlines Diamond's entire case. Due to weather patterns, continental shape, and topographical variation, the band of cultures arranged along the Eastwest axis from Portugal to Vietnam had a superior starting point compared to those cultures stretching Northsouth from Alaska to Chile or from the Sudan to South Africa.As humans evolved from hunter-gatherers to farmers, food surpluses enabled for the first time a segment of society to do something other than scrounge for their next protein hit. Increases in food storage and food production enabled ever greater specialization: \\"stored food can also feed priests, who provide religious justification for wars of conquest; artisans such as metal workers, who develop swords, guns and other technologies and scribes, who preserve far more information than can be remembered accurately.\\" New technologies are produced by this thinking-inventing class; both by trial and error and by sustained experimentation, new methods, inventions, processes, weapons, and philosophies are brought forth into the world.By showing that innovations occur, independently, in every race and culture -- \\"the myriad factors affecting innovativeness make the historian's task paradoxically easier, by converting societal variation in innovativeness into essentially a random variable\\" - Diamond is able to sidestep charges, should one be so inclined (and many ones are inclined so) of racial determinism.So in each of these areas, as societies independently produce innovations in guns, germs or steel, they share or trade them with their neighbors. For the Eastwesters, this is easy because the climate from Portugal to Vietnam is rather similar, broadly speaking. For the Northsoutherners, however, the crops and mammals that thrive in the American plains or the Andes wither in the Guatemalan heat and vice versa. Therefore, trade and the exchange of ideas are hampered.And thus, geography is destiny.The wheel, invented by the Eastwest crew in 3,000 BC diffuses rapidly within a few centuries. Invented independently in prehistoric Mexico, it never makes it to the Andes (Diamond cites the throttling power of the narrow Panama isthmus, though I wonder why does a narrow landmass throttle diffusion and not accelerate it?) In another example, writing zips rapidly across Eurasia while it languishes with the Mayas in the Americas.Similarly, with food: \\"of the world's 148 big wild terrestrial herbivore mammals - the candidates for domestication - only 14 passed the test. Why did the other 134 species fail?\\" Eurasia ends up with 13 of them, the Americas 1, sub-Saharan Africa and Australia - zeroAnd as a result of food - disease. Eurasian crowd diseases evolved out of the diseases of Eurasian herd animals. And a lack of these mammals in the New World led to a paucity of disease (the author includes an interesting sidenote on why llamas are not a source of human disease). Most wars prior to World War II were won by the side spreading nastier germs (a novel and not entirely convincing argument - were the Mongols, with their small core of Mongolians surrounding by an ever-expanding army of conscripts, really able to direct their germs at the enemy and not their own troops?) And European diseases eliminated 95 percent of the pre-Columbian population of the Americas within two centuries of arrival.So geography is destiny and in the area of invention, food, and disease, Eastwest orientation is superior to Northsouth.Even within Eastwest, we find geography has implications:\\"Europe has a highly indented coastline with five large peninsulas that approach islands in their isolation [and thus] Europe is carved up into independent linguistic, ethnic and political units by high mountains\\"While \\"China's coastline is much smoother\\" with no bifurcating ranges separating tribes and generating animosities, dialects, separate ethnic identities, or, importantly, sharable innovation.Call this Diamond's Contiguous China theory: Europe's disunity leads to experimentation (Columbus asks five different regents to support his voyages before one will support him) while the Chinese monolith ends its voyages of discovery in 1421 due to court intrigue.Perhaps Diamond's Contiguous China theory has implications for writing systems as well. Writing always starts as pictographs. In the Mediterranean, these symbols, forced into contact with many different pronunciations, syllables, diphthong and accents lost all but their most basic phonemic essence. \\"Alphabets apparently arose only once\\" in Syria and were then borrowed, copied, co-opted and diffused throughout the Eastwest axis. While Chinese characters, which gradually expanded along with the monolithic linguistic-political area (even though ultimately that monolith sprouts wholly different languages, the process is gradual enough to not rupture the writing system in the interim) had no such stripping away. And thus Chinese has several thousand characters, each idiosyncratically replete with meaning; while the few dozen Western characters are meaningless of themselves and merely phonemic.Perhaps the best evidence of Diamond's deftness of touch is the complete absence of opprobrium for the author since publication of what is after all, an explanation of why Europeans and Asians succeeded and Africans and Native Americans didn't. Even rational, dispassionate treatises on topics tangentially touching race tend to produce a singular level of venom and vitriol from the shouting classes. Diamond so smoothly handles these sensitive issues, head on, that there is simply no race-baiting angle from which to attack him.Indeed, the differences in outcome are attributed not to race, ethnicity, genes, culture or any other factor inherent to these groups at all, but rather surprisingly and benignly, to the geographical orientation of one's neighbors! A more arbitrary, non-threatening explanation for observed differences in national success would be difficult to conceive. And for that, the modern, liberally minded student, the originality, rigor, scope and truth of Diamond's thesis is all the sweeter."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"To the average reader -- not professionally prepared on the subject of human history -- this book is a treasure.Of course, it needs to be read without prejudice or preconceived ideas, be these on race or religious supremacy or history.To me, it answered questions which I had always wanted answered, and gave me a much more realistic perspective on history. Yes, history didn't start in AD 1, nor in 1492. We all know that, although many don't seem to have actually assimilated the idea.History started well before then and the present is inextricably linked with what happened tens of thousands of years ago. This book helps you to think that way.Furthermore the work is a goldmine of scientific information on plants, languages, animal domestication, etc.Here I learned that horses didn't exist in the Americas before 1492, for example. And here I learned that zebras cannot be domesticated.Why not 5 stars then? Because the author is not as good a writer as he is a man of science. Arguments are often repeated and -- although maybe this achieves the result of fixing them more in the readers memory -- the book at times seems longer than it could be.Apart from this minor problem, top marks to Guns Germs and Steel."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Guns, germs and steel takes a different look at why Western Europeans went on to dominate all of the known world. Dr. Diamond's main thesis is the domestication of certain species of plants and animals. Because, Europe is connected to Asia. Eurasia had a larger pool of large animals and plants to domesticate. Also, Europe's moderate climate help Europeans go from a hunter-gatherer society to a sentary society. As a society become more sentary the larger the population grew and evolved into a more complex one. In these complex societies, Dr. Diamond points the advancement of politics, inventors and trade with other countries.Dr. Diamond, also points out in later chapters that Europe surpassed societies such as China and India because Europe was never politically cohesive. Countries such as England, France, Netherlands and Spain competed for the riches of the New World, Africa, and Asia. Therefore these countries invented better steel products, bigger ships and more advanced weapons.Dr. Diamond does make strong agruments and dispels a lot of myths on why certain societies advanced faster than others. However, there is one part of the book were Dr. Diamond believes that natives of New Guinea are more intellectual than today's Americans. I found that extremely absurd. But, I would recommend this book as another alternative on world history."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Jared Diamond provides an original perspective on the fates of human societies. His thesis is that the fates of all human societies has been to a large extent predetermined in remote historic times by the fertility of the soil and the relative abundance or scarcity of cultivatable plants and domesticatable animals. The fundamental intelligence and drive of all peoples are similar. Societies progressed from hunter gathers to farmers and ranchers and developers of political organizations and higher technologies if the geography supported it. If the variety of animals which could be domesticated was sparce or the native flora was of limited nutritional value then the native population remained hunter gathers. Such less developed societies were easy prey for the higher developed societies. Not the least because the less developed societies were highly susceptible to a variety of infectious diseases to which the more highly developed society, living in a higher population density, had become relatively immune. The conquest of the Incas by Pizarro and his band of 198 Spaniards is a prime example cited by Diamond. The Incas did have a degree of agriculture and political organization but lacked many domestic animals and were very susceptible to Old World infectious diseases. The Incas also did not have a written language. Diamond provides numerous other examples of the European conquest of aboriginal peoples.Diamond's discussion on the origins and spread of agriculture are very enlightening. His discussion of the development and spread of written language is also interesting. Unfortunately Diamond gives little weight to religious, political, or philosophical differences between societies in determining their fates. This is a serious shortcoming of his work.

When I talk to people about the subject now, I feel I have an \\"informed\\" view."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"\\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\" is the rare book that puts a period of history into such clear focus that you will never look at it the same way again. The period of history we are talking about, though is the 1 million-year history of humans on planet Earth. Yes. the entire history of our species. In one book. Yes.Diamond's forte is laying out the broad patterns of human history. Starting with the appearance of humans in Africa a million years ago, he follows human expansion in Asia and Europe and the Americas. He describes the waves of extinction of large mammals coincident with (and he claims due to) the spread of humans into new areas. Diamond's view is macroscopic: on great movements of peoples, great developments of political sophistication, great tides of colonizations, great swaths of disease and technological advance. What emerges is an understanding of the patterns of history that is so profound, so commonsensical, that it is just scary. Diamond amazes by broadening his grasp of world-wide trends - focusing not only on Europe's recent history, but the on Middle East, Indonesia, Oceania, Australian and the Americas.The sub-theme of the book, the point that Diamond hammers home again and again is this: people are the same the world over; each group of humans being as smart, resourceful and vicious as any other. The differences of culture and technology and military outcomes are often (and I mean often!) due at their base to accidental geographical factors that provided some groups with enormous head starts (often in the many thousands of years) over other groups.Diamond presents evidence from archeology, genetics, linguistics, paleo-biology, botany and many other sciences -- as well as his personal study of the people of New Guinea -- to make his points. His conclusions are strongly supportive of geographical determinism. Certain geographical configurations - such as the long East-West axis of Eurasia - are conducive to the spread of peoples, culture and technology. Being at similar same latitudes, Eurasians had an advantage when moving to other locales within the continent: similar climates allowed them to transplant crops developed in one location to others. Contract this with the Americas, where a crop, like maize, domesticated in South America's temperate zone could not survive in the Central American jungles, and so could not spread easily to North America.Diamond devotes separate chapters to the rise of domesticate crops and domesticated animals, describes clearly concisely why some crops and animals are easily domesticable while others are not. He shows that practically every domesticable crop on the planet was domesticated in pre-history, demonstrating convincingly that poorer continents were not so by dint of their dim-witted or incurious inhabitants. He then ably demonstrates the rather disturbing fact of the lopsided distribution of domesticable plants and livestock over the planet. Eurasia, by happenstance, was blessed with most of the domesticable plants and animals, far more than the Americas (where early peoples likely wiped out all large mammals) and far, far more than Australia. Africa, with its overabundance of large mammals, is nevertheless impoverished in terms of native *domesticable* animals, a fact that left that continent far behind in its ability to produce food via means other than human muscle power.Diamond's chapters on the development of writing are fascinating, as are his description of the way complex political systems were developed to handle the ever-larger human populations sustainable by ever-increasing food supplies. Diamond's view is that all political systems are to one degree or another kleptocracies, giving back to its members and giving only part of what it takes from them. And forthrightly describes the role that organized religions use to legitimize rulers and their practices.Diamond takes dead aim at the supposed superiority of European culture as the main cause of Europe's success at subjugating the Americas. But this is no bleeding heart apologia on behalf of native Americans. Diamond describes in horrifying detail how European germs (bred in cities which were the perfect breeding ground for successive plagues of such nasty bugs) rendered the conquerors so terrible. Regardless of the intentions of the invaders, Diamond claims, 95% of the 20 million natives of the America would have succumbed to diseases like smallpox, typhus and measles. By the time Hernando De Soto explored the Mississippi in 1540, the vast Indian empires of central North America had been completely depopulated by disease. It was disease and that unknown weapon of war, the horse, that allowed Fransisco Pizzaro to rout 80,000 Inca warriors using only 168 horsemen and soldiers. The Conquest was not, as Pizzaro liked to think, due to the superiority of the Spanish, or of God's will.As a religious person, this last fact is difficult to deal with. One may choose to see God's will in the endless exterminations, plagues and uneven distribution of food and animal stocks that drove much of human movement for the last million years. However, I personally find this view hard to stomach. How can God be considered \\"provident\\" when he provides so differently to people in different parts of his Creation? Diamond's description of religions as legitimizing political kleptocracies was not a welcome message, but one that certainly resonated. It is not only in Islamic countries that religion and politics mingle in unseemly union.Nevertheless, \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\" is an important contribution of the understanding of our collective human history. Imbued with equivalent intelligence and abilities, the lives of all human being are nevertheless determined to a large degree by our environment. *Where* we are born matters more than *to whom* we are born.A note about the cassette edition (which is no longer available for purchase): Doug Ordunio did a terrific job (over the course of 11 cassettes!) of rendering Diamond's tight and straightforward prose into a pleasant and informative listening experience."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"If you have not heard of the theories expounded in this book, it will be a real eye-opener for any reader. Contained within the text is really the mechanism that decided which civilizations were to be successful and which were to remain in the early stages of development. The author does an excellent job explaining in clear easy to understand terms the reasons for Western European civilization's dominance. A dominance to the point of colonizing the remaining lesser developed regions of the Earth.In a nutshell the Author's point is that every primitive culture has already leveraged and maximized any advantage the environment has offered. Western Europe had inherited and developed the gifts bequeathed from Mesopotamian civilizations including, domesticated animals, some optimal grain crops, some fiber crops. With this springboard combined with the discovery of steel making and by happenstance a society exposed and partially immune to the affects of the major diseases affecting urban populations, it became an invincible combination to subjugate and rule major portions of the globe. Areas of the world that did not benefit from having all the right ingredients or stepping stones to capitalize their environment and take them to the next level were subdued. An example would be a culture without a suitable pack animal such as the domesticated horse doomed that culture to manual labor and almost certain losses when their foot soldiers faced mounted cavalry for the first time.

Pat his editor on the back."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"In this book Jared Diamond attempts to answer a question put to him by his New Guinean friend, \\"Why is it that you whit people developed so much cargo and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people has little cargo of our own?\\"In New Guineas \`cargo' is the term used to refer to goods, such as metal, guns, mirrors, axes, matches, clothing etc. The question is basically, \`What factors led to one land having more technology advancement while another did not.IQ tests have been shown to be culturally based. Decades of tests trying to prove an intelligence difference between races have failed.If intelligence is not a factor is there another factor.The answer that Jared Diamond provides is simple and easily observed.It's the environment that encourages the developments that lead to material advancement and with it the development of towns and cities.First explanation he provides answers the question, \` what are the factors needed for one people to conquer another people.Here is an extract from his after word that concludes the main thesis of the book.\\"My main conclusion was that societies developed differently on different continents because of differences in continental environments, not in human biology. Advanced technology, centralized political organization, and other features of complex societies could emerge only in dense sedentary populations capable of accumulating food surpluses - populations that depended for their food on the rise of agriculture that began around 8,500 BC But the domesticable wild plant and animal species essential for that rise of agriculture were evenly distributed very unevenly over the continents. The most valuable domesticable wild species were concentrated in only nine small areas of the globe, which thus became the earliest homelands of agriculture. The original inhabitants of those homelands thereby gained a head start towards developing guns, germs (ex. smallpox) and steel. The Language and genes of those homeland inhabitants, as well as their livestock, crops, technologies and writing systems became dominant in the ancient and modern world.\\"In other words, it is not that one group of people is more \`fitter' for survival than another, it is the environment on which they depend and draw from that lead to their success or loss in conquering their neighbors.The early 19th century Maori are a great example of how a technological and cultural advancement led to a cultural destabilization which in turn led to massive conquering (and death).One tribe, which was closer to the point of contact with the first colonial ships to New Zealand (land of the Maori), was able to acquire muskets before other tribes. Muskets gave them a definitive advantage over other tribes still using bow and arrows. In addition to this they were the first to get potatoes, which provided more nutrition than the sweet potatoes than they grew. Now they could travel long distances because of an advantage in food supply. With the two advantages in food and weapons they began exterminating other tribes around them. Conquering territory. The tribes that delayed acquiring their own muskets and potatoes were completely wiped out. Those that did acquire were able to stay alive till a new balance of power was reached. By that time a quarter of the population had been wiped out.The lucky tribe that happened to be where the colonials first landed saw themselves as divinely chosen to conquer the rest of the island. Primitive people tend to see good luck as divinely provided and bad luck as the result of evil spirit. (ex. the devil).If a land lacks a technological advancement of another then it desperately seeks to gain it for one reason only. Balance of power. So they are not exterminated themselves."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Many reviews claim this book to be biased and bereft of some important additional components that have influenced human evolutionary history. Diamond actually does mention many of these components, but seems to think they're merely subsidiaries of the broader agents behind history's patterns (which he lists as government/religion, germs, writing, and technology).This book isn't perfect, but it's a great start and leaves the door wide open for those interested in pursuing the study of human evolution. It's boldest claim is that geography was the greatest SINGLE determinant of the evolution of human societies (continental axes, climate, biology, geology, etc.). He doesn't claim geography did it all and does indeed discuss important other factors such as cultural receptivity to new technology, progress, and change. But I think it's interesting that he goes so far as to claim that the essence of it all is mere geographical location, and from that simple starting point our many complex differences have spawned."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I was a geography major in college and I cannot understand why this was not a required read.

Many others have described the plot and Diamond's arguments, so I'll just state what I liked/didn't like about the book. First, this book is well-written and mostly well-argued. I appreciate the time Diamond took to fully research his topic. However, he doesn't cite any of his sources. I would have preferred to have the sources available in a references section at the end of the book.It took me several months to finish this book. Although the subject material is interesting, and the writing is good, this book is in no way riveting. I definitely never felt that I couldn't put it down. In fact, at times I had to force myself to go on.The kindle version is well-edited in that there aren't errors or scanning issues. But the tables (the few that are included) are terribly formatted and are painful to look at. I ended up skipping over them, mostly. There are no pictures or any of the other images in the paper book included in the kindle version. I'm not complaining about that, and it certainly doesn't impact my star rating, considering I borrowed the book for free from the KOLL, but it's useful information for you, should you choose to buy it from the kindle store.Overall, good book - I think it was educational and well-argued.

Diamond wrote \\"Guns Germs and Steel\\" in response to \\"Yali,\\" a New Guinean politician who once inquired \\"Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?\\" Historically, colonizing despots, theologians, and scholars, alike, have answered such questions with \\"superior genes, superior deity, and superior culture, naturally.\\" Diamond, meanwhile, painstakingly investigates how incidental factors, such as geography, weather, resource availability, and prior antigen exposure, are the primary determinants of the success and failure of civilizations.For one, latitudinal contiguity allows for a rough climate homogeneity, meaning that chicken, rice, apricots, and peaches from China and millet and cumin from Central Asia were able to rapidly diffuse across the so-called \\"Fertile Crescent\\" and become Roman staples. Hitchhiking along with these adaptable seeds and domesticable creatures were the wheel, metalworking techniques, beer and wine production, and other fundamentals of the good life. And then, Ducatis and Brunellos were born. In contrast, sub-Saharan Africa's latitudinal orientation, with its significant variations in average temperatures and day-length schedules, allowed for little cross-adaptability of temperamental plant and animal species. Nor did the presence of an almost 10 million km of desert, replete with sandstorms and dust devils, help foster neighborly exchange. Similar challenges in the South Pacific and the Americas made it difficult for certain groups to shift from being hunter-gatherer nomadic groups to farmers who are linked to and can invest in their land. And groups required to invest all their time obtaining food are unable to develop stratified societies with labor further divided among people who shipbuild, swordsmith, or songwrite for their supper.Diamond acknowledges that both abundance and necessity can be the parental units of invention. As mentioned above, agricultural wealth allowed for the leisure time and population growth that breed strapping young tinkerers. However, Diamond also cites populations that, despite relative wealth, developed or even reverted to elementary technologies, simply because they had no impetus to maintain sophisticated systems. For example, 10,000 years ago, when flooding at the Bass Strait separated Tasmanians from Mainland Australians, the Tasmanians, unencumbered by the pressures of competing tribes, gradually lost knowledge of pre-existing technologies, which may have included fishing, awls, needles, and perhaps even the boomerang! Thus, writes Diamond, \\"When finally encountered by Europeans in A.D. 1642, the Tasmanians had the simplest material culture of a people in the modern world.\\"Similarly, the arrangement of letters in the QWERTY keyboard is due to a conspiracy concocted by THE MAN in 1873, to ensure that users push keys as slowly as possible, lest the typewriter become jammed. And yet, the lack of urgent Darwinian selective pressure means that this anachronistic design strategy remains the primary keyboard layout used to command the Cray XT5. Ultimately, it is difficult to know why some civilizations flourish and others flounder. However, Jared Diamond reminds us never to ascribe to stupidity that which is adequately explained by dumb luck."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This book blew my mind when I read it. It looks at the development of human culture and survival through the perspective of environmental history. That is, it tries to answer the question why different cultures and societies are more advanced and powerful than others by examining the environments in which these cultures developed.

His arguments are not only interesting but also concrete.

And that if the leadership of any nation, truly loves and desires the best for it's people, it must adopt these more competitive technologies as fast as possible, so that their people can produce and consume \\"cargo\\", rather than be the victims of others who produce more.This book is yet another missed opportunity for a reasoned scholar to use empirical information to illustrate how those culturally backward societies that still dominate our planet can advance the quality of human life, and instead, by the accidentally malicious act of politically sanitizing his work, provides solace to those who would perpetuate the ignorance, mysticism, primitivism and fear of the pre-rational, dark age cultures struggling against a tide of commerce, prosperity and rationalism.While it is true that the present-day members of any culture are not responsible for their current status, they are indeed responsible for actions that intend to maintain that status, their culture, and their beliefs. Diamond rewards us with the detail and accuracy of his analysis, but errs by not drawing the conclusions that would help peoples of the world actually benefit from his work.Hopefully, Mr. Diamond will provide a ten-year anniversary edition that fixes this mistake.For these reasons, the book should indeed receive a lower rating by reviewers.

Overall I enjoyed the book, but I have to say that number one, the author has lost his scientific objectivity. His theories about human social development and its link to early agriculture are persuasive. However, the author is so committed to his theories that he appears to have lost his objectivity. For example, case studies involving isolated populations are used to draw global conclusions. Some of the hypotheis are circular and self-fulfilling. The link of the development of human societies to agriculture is oversimplified and the author completely ignores many other factors that common sense tells us must have shaped human history. But the author seems to feel that every aspect of social development across the globe can be explained by the presence or absence of certain cultivatable plants in various regoions of the world. Second, the book is way too long. The message could have been delivered in a few chapters. The author has a bad habit of simply rehashing the same idea over and over in the various chapters of the book, without really adding anything new.

I know it sounds stupidly simple, but think about it. One person could not dominate Europe for a great period of time, because of Europe's geography.

Specifically, the EuroAsia landmass presented a single, lateral, area with plenty of domesticable plants and animals that allowed the Europeans to evolve in a way that led to the development of technology that was able to overwhelm peoples from less endowed geographic regions.Such a conclusion is only semi-politically correct (he argues that there is no difference in intelligence and skills between the races, only differences of geography, but does imply that white Europeans are more \\"advanced\\" than people from other regions.) As such, the book is bound to anger many. Worse, by combining geography, biology, genetics, linguistics, and other sciences, it is bound to step on many distinguished toes and have detractors from all of the fields. And by keeping the text on an undergrad level, readable to anyone, by necessity it glosses over much detail.This aside, I found the book amazingly informative across a wide range of fields. I probably learned more about linguistics and human genetics from this book than any other, and I found the basic premise fascinating.My only major complaint is that the book is written in almost textbook-like fashion. Though highly readable, it is too structured at times - taking an idea, outlining the points of evidence, describing each of the points, then adding a summary. Since some points are used in multiple parts of the argument, the book is sometimes repetitive and sometimes sounds like the wise uncle lecturing a young child.The other minor complaint is that there are factual inaccuracies. My area of expertise is the Japanese language and the couple times he discusses Japanese, his assertions are clearly confused. However, I have to believe that within the main arguments, Diamond is in his element and his assertions are more factual.But whether that is true or not, the book still combines an amazing amount of knowledge across a wide range of sciences that I highly recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Why did people of European and Asian origin come to dominate the Americas, Australia and parts of the rest of the world, and not vice versa? How were a handful of Spanish adventurers able to overwhelm the well organized and powerful Aztec and Inca empires? For most historians until quite recently, and for most other people even today, the answer seemed quite obvious: the more successful nations owed their success to their superior intelligence and, more generally, their superior genetic inheritance.In this masterly book Jared Diamond argues that this traditional view of world history is completely wrong, that genetic superiority, if it exists at all, has nothing to do with it, and that the real reasons lie in the possession by Europeans and Asians of better technology (derived ultimately from their knowledge of how to make steel, including their possession of weapons able to kill enemies at a distance) and their harbouring of germs capable of annihilating whole populations of people with no natural immunity. In one case at least, the intensive pre-Columbian settlement of the lower Mississippi valley, an entire population was wiped out by European diseases before the Europeans themselves, with their steel and guns, arrived.Diamond's preliminary answer raises as many questions as it answers, however: why did Europeans and Asians have guns and steel before the native Americans? Why did they domesticate several useful species of large animals (cows, pigs, sheep, horses, dogs), and learn to cultivate many useful plants, whereas people elsewhere had few or none at all? Why were European germs lethal to native Americans, but native American germs (with the possible and disputed exception of the bacteria responsible for syphilis) were much less dangerous to Europeans? Again it is tempting to attribute some of these differences to European superiority, but Diamond again shows that this is wrong. If no one had studied it one might easily suppose that Africa had many animals that could be domesticated if one had the intelligence to do it, but it is not so: despite intensive efforts, no one has managed to domesticate zebras (responsible for more injuries each year than tigers in US zoos) and use them as horses are used elsewhere. Likewise with plants: despite the potential value of acorns as a food, and despite attempts, no one has succeeded in breeding oak trees to fulfil human criteria rather than those of squirrels. In summary, the number of species of wild animals and plants in the world that are susceptible to domestication is far smaller than one would naively guessed, and the overwhelming majority are located in Europe and Asia.Again, however, we can ask why this should be, and again Diamond has a sensible answer. Together with various other points, he notes that Eurasia has a major East-West axis, whereas both Africa and the Americas are aligned along North-South axes. The consequence of this is that the geographical zones in Eurasia with more or less homogeneous climates are enormous compared with the corresponding zones in other contents, allowing far larger wild populations of wild species, displaying all sorts of variations, to arise."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Author Jared Diamond's &#34;Guns, Germs, and Steel&#34; lays a foundation for the understanding of &#62;13,000 years of human history throughout the world.Diamond claims that the thought of producing this treatise arose during a conversation with a local politician named &#34;Yali&#34; during a visit to New Guinea in 1972. According to Diamond, Yali's question was (among others): &#34;Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?&#34;Diamond responded to Yali's question in the form of this well thought out text.

I simply like to pick a book that will challenge me in between fiction books. This book did not disappoint.This is a rare work in that it can appeal to academics and pleasure readers. The knowledge and research behind the concepts in the book are complex and detailed, but Diamond does such an excellent job of explaining things, that you can easily sometimes forget the vast amount of information that he had to assimilate in order to put forth this hypothesis.There are also two main points from the book that I took. One is the merely academic and scientific data that you learn from the book. I do not have a science, anthropologic, or linguistic background, so I learned a great deal from this book. But secondly, there is a very clear goal of this book to discount the foundations of racism. This is a lesson that every reader from this book can take with them and actually use in real life. I was struck at how this book can have such a dual purpose, and this makes it truly unique in my opinion.Sure, there are vast generalizations that are made in a work such as this, just as there are in any history book, but this book has excellent points, is well researched, and makes solid arguments. I would definitely read another book by Jared Diamond and will definitely not forget the lessons I learned in this book."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Quack science of the most transparent type. This is a planet of almost infinitely variable environment. It is possible to discern significant environmental differences even between areas of close geographical proximity. Diamond ingeniously exploits this near-constant environmental variety as a means of explaining radical differences in the cultural and technological achievements of the various human ethno-cultural groups.The obvious fraudulence of Diamond's methodology lies in its teleological fluidity. For example, if Diamond were to have explored the Western mountains of Latin America and found only a collection of hill tribes, Diamond would explain that the lack of domesticable mammals, paucity of crops and of ground suitable for agriculture had precluded any kind of advanced civilisation. In fact the Indians who inhabited this region domesticated the lama, terraced the rugged hills and, exploiting only two food staples, corn and potatoes, built a vast empire with sophisticated architecture, a complex bureaucracy and an ingenious means of recording information. All of this despite dwelling outwith Diamond's \\"environmentally favoured planetary zone\\". Of course, this is no problem in Diamond's win-win scenario. Diamond's acolytes simply indulge in a reframing exercise and proclaim that if not for environmental limitations, the Inca would have created an even more sophisticated civilisation.We see the same trick employed in the case of animal domesticability. For Diamond if an animal was domesticated it was domesticable. If an animal wasn't domesticated it was, ipso facto, not domesticable. Africans failed to domesticate the zebra, therefore the zebra is not domesticable. Europeans domesticated the horse, therefore, the horse is domesticable. In support of his argument Diamond quite rightly states that the zebra in its present condition has been found to be untameable. Diamond neglects to acknowledge, however, that the primative Eurasian horse was equally untamable. The horse in Eurasia was first herded as a food supply; it took thousands of years of human selective manipulation to create the modern horse. All sorts of unlikely animals have proven to be, to a greater or lesser degree, domesticable: the lama, the elephant and the reindeer to name a few. These animals are conveniently overlooked. Diamond employs the same one-sided analysis of the exploitability of the flora of the various global biomes. Anyone reading GG&S; would think that Caucasians had stumbled into an eden of fully developed seed crops, cleared farmlands and general year-round abundance. In fact, post ice-age Europe was a land of vast uncleared forests, unfordable rivers, mountain ranges and long, bitter winters. Corn and wheat were painstakingly developed into agricultural staples over many millenia by an ingenious population. Had this population failed to exploit their environment, however, these negatives could easily be invoked in support of Diamond's environmentalist theory, thus scoring another victory for environmental absolutism. Diamond's stipulations for assessing environmental origin resemble the medieval test for witchcraft. Throw the accused into a lake. If she drowns she is innocent. If she survives she is a witch and must be killed. Either way you die.Even if you accept Diamond's theory that Eurasians supposedly favourable environment gave them the stability from which to develop higher cultures, it does not sufficently explain why sub-Saharan Africa failed to develop such fundamentals as the wheel or a system of writing. Why no ox-drawn carts in Africa?Diamond postulates an army of rhino-mounted Africans invading central Europe and then invokes his indomesticablity clause to explain the impossibility of this scenario. How does he explain the actual invasion of Europe by Africans from Carthage mounted on elephants? Of course! Elephants are domesticable! Or at least they are a bit; just domesticable enough, in fact, not to upset Diamond's theory. How convenient!GG&S; is peppered with much peripheral nonsense. Diamond, supposedly a believer in the equality of races, proclaims that the tribespeople of New Guinea are the \\"most intelligent people on Earth\\" because they manage to survive in one of the most hostile environments on Earth. It would be obvious to anyone less blinded by his own dogma that the skills necessary for survival in a jungle environment would be acuity of vision and hearing, fast reactions, stamina and fleetnes of foot. I don't think that any of these attributes would feature on a university entrance exam.So it goes on. It is difficult to see Mr Diamond's opus as anything more than a vast example of post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy, simple elegant and wrong. If human beings are moulded by environment it is equally true that human beings mould their environments. Extreme environmentalist positions are at best unhelpful and at worst deceitful."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This book explore the evolution of major ethnic and various world communities outside of the standard narrative available to most people from schools and historical documentaries.

The author explains the growth of manking and nature through time in great mathematical and scientific language. I was amazed to the detail that the author was able to present in the book. He was able to disect the many regions of the World and explain the diverse growth of mankind in history. I found the chapter on agriculture and how it affected human growth throughout centuries to be the most facinating. The concept of high calorie availability affecting human growth was quite interesting. At the end of it all the author was able to determine that any human would have evolved the same way if they were at the same location as another. Which describes that nature will always take its course. I gave the audio cd a 4 out of 5 as I found the voice of the narator to be boring as it had no inflection which made the audio book feel like a biology class at times.

I believe he is very convincing on this point, and for that reason I give the book five stars. I really enjoyed the chapters on the beginnings and spread of farming and animal domestication.One telling passage from the book: \\". . . I do not assume that industrialized states are 'better' than hunter-gatherer tribes, or that the abandonment of the hunter-gatherer lifestyle for iron-based statehood represents 'progress,' or that it has led to an increase in human happiness. My own impression, from having divided my life between United States cities and New Guinea villages, is that the so-called blessings of civilization are mixed. For example, compared with hunter-gatherers, citizens of modern industrialized states enjoy better medical care, lower risk of death by homicide, and a longer life span, but receive much less social support from friendships and extended families.\\"This passage is emblematic of both the book's strengths and its weaknesses. I tend to agree with Diamond that in the developed world we need to begin thinking carefully about why it is that all our advantages have not brought us a sustainable economy, personal contentedness, or happy family life, and what changes to our governments and other institutions would help change our direction. In my opinion, reform of the economics profession, and of economic statistics to better reflect quality of life, is central to this. For more on this point, I would suggest Brian Czech's book \\"Shoveling Fuel for a Runaway Train\\" or Herman Daly's \\"Beyond Growth.\\"The biggest weakness of \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\" is Diamond's tendency to push his thesis beyond what the evidence will support. Diamond sometimes seems to be arguing at cross-purposes. In one place Diamond says a desert or a sea or a mountain range was a significant barrier keeping cultures isolated, in another place a seemingly similar natural barrier is easily crossed. Local culture has more effect than Diamond seems to give it credit for. Diamond sometimes seems so eager to be politically correct that he's leaning over backward to give excuses for maladaptive societies."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This is a great book! Jared Diamond has a nice writing style, and perhaps he wasn't the first one to think about this hypothesis, but he does a great job presenting his arguments in a clear-yet-non-scientific manner.I think some people take offense with his position, because in the end, one of his main arguments is that there is no genetic reason why the European cultures have arisen to such power while other cultures haven't. In the end, despite culture, skin color, etc., there really isn't that much physically separating a Blackfeet Indian to a white Wall Street banker to a hunter in Africa.Geography obviously plays a significant role in human society. If you are isolated from others (like the Americas and various islands), you are at more a disadvantage when other societies come visit you, bearing knowledge/technologies/bacteria/viruses that have never been encountered by the indigenous peoples. Obviously many societies all over the world have domesticated animals/plants for their own uses. Yet some animals can't be domesticated despite years of human interaction (elephants still kill/harm their trainers and elephants have been used by humans for many centuries) whereas when was the last time you heard a cow killing it's rancher? And remember there are millions of cows vs. thousands of elephants. And cows can do more things reliably than just die for our consumption, pulling plows, carrying heavy goods, etc.Cultures that had easy access to ideas/technologies to improve their own lives, to free up time that would otherwise be spent stalking game, digging roots, or tending/harvesting crops. Would Shakespeare have written (allegedly?) so many plays when he had to repeatedly go out to hunt? And hunting/planting/harvesting crops each have their own dangers, from broken bones, accidental injury from tools/weapons, etc. And back in the old days, even minor injuries by today's standards may result in death back then.But anyway, I highly recommend that y'all not only buy, but also read this book!

His answer to this question, as he unravels it in the book, is that Europeans had guns, germs, and steel in their favor, a result of living in the environment and the area of the world they lived in. He provides numerous examples to support his ideas. What I found very rewarding about this book was his knowledge of world history. He breaks down the book into chapters covering important countries and continents of the world and explains why at certain points in world history they may have held the most advanced civilization and why they remained that way or why they faltered.

Since complaining of racist arguments is generally bogus, claiming to rebut them is suspicious.While the east-west vs. north-south theory is interesting, it doesn't answer much. Going from Britain east to China brings one into every climate but rainforests. There is heavy, wet clayey soil in southern England, and better stuff farther north and we get into howling deserts that spawned steppe raiders, and fat loess soils, and praries, and plains. All of which are little laboratories for technology and agriculture. So, as it happens, is north-south. Coastal British Columbia is more inviting than, say, Nebraska, for farming and stockraising. And what about Australia, large and varied?Special pleading. The one that clinched it for me was the excuse for Africans not domesticating the zebra as others have the horse. The zebra, Diamond tells us, shys away from the lariat and thus can't be caught. This is worth unbundling.First, lariats are generally used FROM horses, and thus presume domestication. Getting the horses in the first place probably took running them into blind alleys, natural or artificial, or the use of large bolas, or just running them down. So the lariat issue is bogus from the start.He also implies, but does not state because that would cause a question if anybody thought of it, that wild horses first domesticated did NOT shy from the lariat and were more easily caught. How does he know? In addition, not all individuals in a species act the same. Perhaps all wild horses shied from the lariat--presuming for the moment it was used without being already mounted--except for a few individuals. Those would be the ones caught. Of their offspring, the ones who remained in captivity, ancestors of domesticated horses, would be descended from those who didn't think to dodge.We have the thesis, made subtly without sufficient assertion as to require actually addressing it, that wild horses who spent millions of years without anything to do with lariats would forget to duck, while zebras, who spent millions of years with nothing to do with lariats, were instinctively wary. Now, as I say, he doesn't state this, but he quite obviously wants the reader to think it. This is profoundly dishonest.Am I misrembering something, or did Pizarro win because the Incas were naifs, not familiar with intrigue and treachery?There are other cases, but it only takes one or two to discredit the book.The next question is, what makes the difference?

When I first saw this book, I could hardly wait to get it. It did not disappoint me.I found this book to be the culmination of Diamond's life-long research, leading into many scientific disciplines. Starting out as a young linguist in New Guinea, a man there posed a question which Diamond could not answer, but never forgot--rephrased as, &quot;Why did wealth and power become distributed as they now are, rather than in some other way?&quot; Thirty years of scientific study and experience later, Diamond answers that question in his book. It is more or less his &quot;Concise History of the World Since the Dawn of Modern Humankind.&quot;This book is extraordinary. I did not actually start reading it at the beginning. I skipped first to the section on the rise of food production, then returned read the earlier and later sections of the book. While the book can be read cover-to-cover, it can also be read as a series of stand-alone articles, according to the reader's interest.Enough of the book's details are covered by other reviewers.

It is not only brilliant scholarship (and it is that -- even the speculation carries such a heavy weight of persuasion as to ring like authority); it is also an authoritative treatment of something of fundamental importance to understanding humankind.But what is the great accomplishment of this ambitious book? Merely to explain, from *first principles*, why it is that Europeans have come to dominate the rest of the world militarily and culturally. And when I say first principles, I mean first principles: the elements of his argument are the geophysical structure of our planet's continents, the distribution of flora and fauna across them, and the initial distribution of the first anatomically modern humans.Briefly, Diamond shows that the roughly east-west orientation of the temperate latitudes of the Eurasian continent (as opposed to the roughly north-south orientation of the temperate zones of all other continents), combined with the wide variety of domesticable animals and crop-plants to be found there when humans first arrived (far exceeding the variety to be found anywhere else in the world) gave Eurasians a massive temporal \\"headstart\\" over humans elsewhere in terms of developing agriculture and in transporting innovations in agriculture to other contiguous areas with similar climactic conditions. This led to the development of centers of dense population in Eurasia before such centers developed elsewhere -- in particular, the development of centers of dense population where humans lived in close association with non-human animals. This led not only to rapid technological advancement but also to resistance to a wide variety of diseases. This combination made Eurasians unbeatable. Given the layout of the continents and the distribution of flora and fauna useful to humans across them, assuming humans wherever found were \\"equal\\" in intelligence, creativity, industriousness and strength, one would predict a priori that the Eurasians would become dominant.Why European dominance over Asians? Here, Diamond shifts mildly into the speculative. He notes that Europe is more broken up by an indented coastline and by mountains than is Asia, and concludes that Europe's geography lent itself to many competing autonomous cultures, whereas Asia's lent itself to a single, broad, monolithic culture. (Surely historical hindsight is polluting his argument with a little a posteriori reasoning here, but let us not quibble, the idea isn't ridiculous.) Technological innovation is more likely to take place, to flourish, and to spread, where there is local competition than where there isn't. Not a perfect explanation, but surely a large component of a complete explanation all the same.It is possible to point to counter-evidence on a smaller scale, but at the broad level at which Diamond's argument is operative, it is unassailable.Like most modern revolutionary scholarship, Diamond's methodology is cross-disciplinary in nature; his own specialty is ornithology -- specifically, of all things, avian physiology. This is not, however, as strange as it sounds, because in part it was his far-flung travels doing ornithology field-work that led him to put all of the pieces of his argument together. In any event, Diamond draws upon history, archaeology, biology, genetics, and ethnology to produce his grand thesis to explain thirteen millennia of the human experience.In sum, I cannot recommend this book enough; it is destined to shape our collective understanding of human history at a profound level."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Guns, Germs, and Steel is a most informative, engaging book!

It is true that the main thesis is that georgraphic factors predict success of a society, but I don't see how that qualifies as &quot;politically correct&quot; - it's just a hypothesis which may, or may not, be accurate. He doesn't suggest that it is wrong to have alternative hypotheses. The idea that it is &quot;anti European&quot; to me could only eminate from a reader who assumes European cultures are innately superior intelectually, because I see nothing anti-anybody in it. The local successes of a wide range of cultures within each continent are explained using the same ideas. There is a pretty large difference between being anti-European and suggesting that the success of European (Eurasian, actually) culture does not stem from innate superiority. Whether you end up agreeing with Diamond's views or not, I think there is much to enjoy in this book, and his thesis is at least worthy of consideration.

In order to accomplish this mission Diamond surveys the vast expanses of human history and traces the development of societies on the different continents with an emphasis on the environmental factors which contributed to their varied levels of development. Undergirding his argument is the logical assumption that men are inherently equal, at least in terms of their capacities for reasoning and development. The necessary outgrowth which flows from this basic assumption is that cultural or societal differentiation must be explained not by differences between groups of people, but by differences in their environments. As all begin with the same capabilities and potentials, the resulting differences must be found in how the various environments within which different groups found themselves, or chose to occupy, shaped their societies. It is the causal chain begun by environmental differentiation which Diamond attempts to explain in Guns, Germs and Steel.While Diamond has been criticized for ignoring the role of nonenvironmental factors such as religion, this is a criticism which has been unfairly leveled against him. Because Diamond is intentionally focusing on ultimate causes, and not on proximate causes (the final links in a chain of causality which may have led directly to a certain result, but which are themselves the result of more significant and distant causes), he does not and does not need to discuss such factors as religion. Religion is simply a proximate cause which can itself be explained by society's response to the set of factors (at their root, environmental) which Diamond is intent on describing.In short, Diamond's work is not perfect, but it provides a thesis which is as coherent and complete as permitted by the nature of his inquiry (you try describing a process that occurs over many millenia without relying on inference to some extent). It does not ignore the &quot;true&quot; (aka final) causes of the West's rise, it simply relegates them to their proper position as simply other symptoms of a more all encompassing chain of causation. This is no oversight and nothing to lament. A study of such causes is a worthy enterprise, but it is one that is entirely separate from Diamond's undertaking in Guns, Germs and Steel."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This work builds such a logical explanation for the author's theories regarding the origins of people and why we evolved differently in different places and at different rates of change. This book is not only a completely enjoyable read, but is a fascinating exploration into the origin and evolution of various cultures throughout the world. It has certainly given me pause to rethink alot of ideas that I held regarding the origins of race and culture. Highly recommended. I think classifying this in the young reader category is inaccurate, though a young person would undoubtably benefit from the ideas in this book, however I feel that this was not the audience that the writer was necessarily addressing."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"How amazing that an evolutionary biologist like Diamond would go so far in examine the environmental differences between Eurasia and sub-Saharan Africa while denying genetic differences between blacks and Whites/Asians. Diamond fails to inform his readers that it is different environments that *cause*, via natural selection, biological differences among populations. All of the Eurasian developments he described created positive feedback loops selecting for increased intelligence and various personality traits (e.g., altruism, rule-following, etc.).Racial differences in brain size and IQ map very closely to the same cultural histories Diamond explains. Although Diamond dismisses such research as \\"loathsome\\", he fails to tell his readers what, if anything, might be scientifically wrong with any of it. According to the religion of Political Correctness - and it does indeed have all the important hallmarks of religion - it is enough to label the voluminous and scientifically rigorous evidence of this type as heresy. No explanation need be made. It is simply \\"loathsome\\" and should never be thought of. The trial of Galileo is brought to mind as one can imagine an identical intellectual honesty present in the case the Church brought against him. One hundred years of research has established that East Asians and Europeans average higher IQs than do Africans. East Asians, measured in North America and in Pacific Rim countries, typically average IQs in the range of 101 to 111. Caucasoid populations in North America, Europe, and Australasia typically average IQs from 85 to 115 with an overall mean of 100. African populations living south of the Sahara, in North America, in the Caribbean, and in Britain typically have mean IQs from 70 to 90.Discoveries using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), which creates a three-dimensional image of the living brain, have shown a strong positive correlation. And there is more. The National Collaborative Perinatal Project on 53,000 children by Sarah Broman and her colleagues, showed that head perimeter at birth significantly predicts head perimeter at 7 years - and head perimeter at seven years predicts IQ. It also shows that Asian children average a larger head perimeter at birth than do White children who average a larger head perimeter than do Black children.In recent years, the equalitarian dogma has been hit hard by some bad karma. In the wake of the success of The Bell Curve and other recent books about race to provide race-realist answers to the question of differential group achievement, there has been an intense effort to get the \`race genie' back in the bottle, to get the previously tabooed toothpaste back in the tube. It is in such times that Diamond provides an answer that, just coincidentally, shores up the walls of the politically correct fortress, when they are being threateningly undermined by true scientific research."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Let me start by saying I have studied anthropology, forensics, anatomy and entomology.

All that he explains does not refute the following: Economic and intellectual power cannot be kept without political and military power. When one has ambition and the will (and dirty underwear) to use it, you can subsume the rest. What I think we have experienced up 'till now is the test (over and over) within humanity about whether individuality is economically superior to non-individuality. Egypt had the longest run so far in history for a politico-socio-economic environment. It had to be conquered from the outside. It maintained this length through military power until it was overtaken. Why did it not 'conquer' the world? Is _that_ a measure of a civilization? What about its length in history - _that_ is not a measure of success? All manner of mathematics, the scientific method, literary form, written form (je' ver notice all the icons on Web pages? - look like hieroglyphics to me ;-) oops there's another one) art were invented / promulgated during Egypt's 3500 years (or Meso-America or Asia, or you get the point). Did it fail as a civilization to raise the standard of living of all humans? Maybe... or maybe America is Egypt's reincarnation-all the intellectual and military power plus individualism (not a Egyptian -- Pharonic trait). In any case, many cultures he presents had intellectual capital; but it will do you no good without the power to keep it, harness it, nurture it, and capitalize on it. Again individualistic capitalization is more economically productive of 'stuff' / 'cargo' than group/ government/ nationalistic capitalization (aka Soviet Union, China, Egypt). But we keep it because of military power. Could all us engineers, scientists, doctor, lawyer, writer, technician, nurse, politician, continue to grow and add value with our military giving us the _freedom and time_ to pursue these value-added interests? The 'positive' result of the 'West' is 'stuff' -- materiel. I don't think we've invented any new art, religion, literary ! forms lately; these forms are ancient (well computer art - isn't art). Is human history over? Are we declaring victory? Really? Let's see if the experiment we're all in right now lasts for 2500 more years (without blowing or burning or starving or racially subjugating ourselves into extinction) and then declare victory of the current politico-socio-economic environment. Lucky for us maybe that none of the other cultures had the atom bomb (aka 'stuff', aka 'cargo') before we were ready. Oops, that's right, we used them already. But do we really wish the technological evolution we have now had happened sooner? Pol Pot with an atom bomb? Hitler with one? Kaddafi with one? Caesar with one? The conquistadors with one? Alexander the Great with one? Everyone of us is still bound by this planet. We can barely get 5 people off of it without blowing ourselves up in the process. If the Sun 'novas' or goes supercritical, we're all gone. We green house ourselves to a nice crisp-we're gone. We get hit with a dinosaur sized meteor we're gone. We got much work to do folks before I'm ready to declare history a success."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This book provides graphic illustration why academics write outside their field of expertise at their own peril. Of course, while one could argue persuasively that Jared Diamond has done so quite well, given the fact the book has become an overwhelming best-seller, some of us old enough to recognize that public success and popular recognition do not necessarily equal objective merit could poke a large number of painful holes in such an argument. There is precious little that is new, startling, or noteworthy about Diamond's thesis; indeed much of it has been argued by a number of historians for generations. The only real contribution I see in all this long-winded narrative is that he has succeeded in catching the elusive kernel of public imagination about the issues of history in general, and that is truly an admirable and noteworthy achievement.Other than that, the book is actually quite pedestrian, predictable, and prosaic. Of course geography is an essential factor in determining any society's potential for survival and/or success in competition with other societies. Having natural and easy access to the sea and all its products, for example, can lessen the otherwise considerable load on the populace for hunting, food gathering, and other requirements for the society's continued subsistence. Likewise, more temperate climates (neither too hot nor too frigid) give a substantial natural advantage to human societies intent on expansion, trade, and war. Yet, while such geographic factors are salient and helpful, they provide critical but insufficient means to explain human history. This is as true of the other factors he argues on behalf.To argue on behalf of demographics as an essential ingredient in the unfolding of human history is a commonplace. To do so is neither profound nor useful. Instead, it is the mark of an idiographic academic so insulated from and evidently ignorant of the established verities and scholarship of another discipline that he is unable to recognize his own logical errors. Here too it is highly reductionistic to suppose that demography plays a central role in the unfolding of history any more than does geography. In anticipation of the next idea, let me hastily add that the same is obviously true for biology. To argue otherwise is make Herr Hitler's fascist argument on behalf of racial eugenics and a super race. Gee, I thought all that nonsense about racial purity and destiny ended in the smoke and ruins of post-war Berlin.In essence, the author's painfully stated \\"logical\\" theories of \`guns, germs and steel' are actually anything but logical, and are more likely merely graphic instances of biological reductionism, which attempt to oversimplify the actual verifiable recorded complexities of history over with the faint pastels of more consistent, coherent, and centrist notions of a theoretical academic. Were he better grounded in world history and less anxious to take us on a quick and global tour, he might find that beneath those clear deep waters he has sailed over so quickly are the murky and muddy truths of actual history, which is nowhere near as consistent or as singularly pointed in a particular progressive direction as he would have us believe. This book is entertaining, well written, and easy to read. If you bother to read it, do it for those reasons, and not for edification. In my opinion it falls far too short in that dimension to be useful or believable."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Find out when you read this book!Diamond lengthy and detailed book is fascinating, suggesting answers for many of the serious questions about why world societies are the way they are.Having completed it, I now realise that it is only the starting point for a much closer examination of all sorts of inequalities prevalent today. As a result, I've been drawn to reading accounts of globalism, politics and sociology which I would never have considered prior to this book.Definitely worth a read although I would caution the casual reader as Diamond's commitment to thoroughness and the sheer scope of his subject does mean that the book can be hard going at times.My only disappointment is that Diamond does not go on to consider lessons we can learn from his review of our history for present and future developments of society."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Despite the fact that Jared Diamond won the Pulitzer Prize for this book, I would beg to differ that this books is all that it is worked up to be. At points, it is down right confusing; at other points, it is so full of elucidation that you tend to get bored.One thing that irked me about this book, is that in the preface, Diamond refutes the fact that his books is rooted in environmental determinism (the belief that all human actions/history are directly dictated by the physical environment) yet a majority of the book is about how the environment shaped which societies created \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel.\\" I am not saying that his view is wrong (his ideas about why the Fertile Crescent were nothing short of great) but I am saying that, despite his belief that this books is not, this book is highly influenced by the E.D. beliefs.I also took note that a few times in the book, Diamond made some conjectures that were totally off base. For example, he brings up the patriotic hymn for America the Beautiful where he paraphrased it by saying \\"'American the Beautiful' invokes our spacious skies, our amber waves of grain, from sea to shining sea.\\" He uses this shortened version to say that American never had amber waves of grain from sea to shining sea, thus, proving that American grain was founded elsewhere. Not only does the song NOT say that America had grain from the Pacific to the Atlantic, but who would have ever thought such a thing?I will not deny that this book was extremely well thought through, and that it had some important things to point out when it comes to the history of the world, but to me it was nothing special. It was more advanced than a textbook, and written in a coherent manner for the most part. I enjoyed some parts, but really, it was a struggle to get through.I give it three stars for 1) pointing out that Zebras are moody and cannot be domesticated, 2) covering 13,000 years in under 500 pages, and 3) for winning the Pulitzer."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This book depressed me for weeks. The probable slaughter of all the large docile mammals by Clovis Man in the Americas about 11,000 years ago, then the slaughter of maybe 95% of the decedents of Clovis Man by European germs in the 16th Century, and all of it just so much bad luck! Millions and millions dead, denied, and unknown. The rape of the earth seems to be what the human animal has been about in the aggregate from the start. Look around, the rape is unabated. Good-bye, Sea of Cortez. Good-bye, East Coast fisheries. Good-by, wolf and grizzly. Been nice to know you, but really we just couldn't help ourselves. History, prehistory, read it and weep. Makes me long for the good old days, say 1924 in the highlands of New Guinea, mamma's suckling a piglet, later on we will kill it, and eat it!Why do I recommend this book? Because the ideas Mr. Diamond so painstakingly presents go from a fundamental and mostly unconscious question, \\"Why does European culture dominate the world,\\" to a breathtaking overview of the history of humans on the planet.

Much of it sounds very convincing, but when I read on page 19 that assumptions of racial superiority (when held by westerners) are loathsome and then the author goes on at some length to explain why he feels New Guineans are more intelligent than westerners, even providing a genetic explaination, I have to wonder if some politically-correct assumptions aren't at work. He winds up this section on page 22 with &quot;Why did New Guineans wind up technologically primitive, despite what I believe to be their superior intelligence?&quot;Though there is undoubtably much truth in this book, the less-than-objective admission and puzzling double standard at the beginning don't lead me to fully trust the author."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"So Diamond tells us that some societies (i.e., European) advanced further than others (i.e., Native American, Asian, African,etc.) because they, the Europeans, became involved in farming sooner and thereby developed cohesive societies sooner. What's more these European societies also defeated other peoples by bringing diseases with them. I think Diamond, a physiologist. is out of his depth. Why did Britain conquer India? Indians were certainly more resistant to diseases in India. And during the Indian Mutiny they had rifles and cannon just like the outnumbered British. The Spanish conquistadors defeated the Aztecs and Incas from the very first contact, long before disease played any role. Agriculture began in Mesopotamia long before it began in Europe. The Mongols conquered China and half of Europe and they were a nomadic, non-agricultural people. African tribal societies had farming and domesticated animals for centuries before the Europeans arrived. I could go on. Diamond's book is full of holes. Whether we should discuss colonial conquest on a moral plane is another matter, but Europeans and by extension the United States achieved dominance through other reasons than just having the right plants and grasses."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"The other reviews thoroughly explain the premises of this book and expand on them quite well. I would just like to mention that they forget the central theme and question jared diamond puts forth in the beginning of his argument.The crux of his argument is this: what are the ultimate causes that have led to the proximate causes of european dominance of the last 500 years? First, a definition and derivation of proximate and ultimate causes: proximate questions ask how does it work and ultimate questions ask why does it work. Ethologists and animal behaviorists ask themselves these same questions in order to explain behavior displayed by animals in the wild. This scientific approach is applicable to humans as well, since this subject at its very core is a question about human behavior.With regards to world history, jared diamond summarises the proximate causes as guns, germs and steel and suggests they are the mechanisms responsible for why europeans were able to conquer numerous peoples around the world with such apparent ease. However, in his book he also sets out to find the ultimate causes as to why europeans were able to attain these mechanisms responsible for their conquests and why other peoples did not. In order to explain these events without using unreliable social theories, he develops his hypothesis using irrefutable scientific evidence gathered from the fields of geography, biogeography, etc. to concisely explain the events of the past 10,000 years leading up to the european conquest and colonization of the world. This approach offers a logical step-by-step explanation to help explain these momentous events in world history. He does not say it is the be-all, end-all of explanations for the current outcome of world history. He even admits the validity of other ideas and theories, including the idea that great people are major determinants of world history. However, in response he says this: there were perhaps other napoleans, julius caesars, charlemagnes, etc in other parts of the world in history, but without domesticatable plants and animals, tempramental climates, and favourable continental axis alignments to support beurocrats, standing armies, religious servants, merchants, tradesmen, artisans, et al. these people were too busy with day-to-day activites, such as procuring food, to conquer other nations. Throughout the book he refutes or includes other arguments into his own and this is just an example of how he does it. I know I'm missing a lot of points in between these ideas, but that's why you'll just have to read the book to decide for yourself."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Jared Diamond claims that Europeans advanced further than Native American, Asian, African, etc. because the Europeans developed plow-driven farming sooner and thereby developed organized societies sooner. Also Europeans developed immunities through frequent contact with various domestic animals and consequently defeated other peoples by bringing diseases with them. Entirely valid thesis, except that Diamond proceeds to pick any evidence supporting it, and ignores anything that contradicts it.Why did Britain conquer India? Indians were certainly more resistant to diseases in India, had BETTER domestic animals (elephants to pull canons, for instance), and had just as sophisticated social structure. And during the Indian Mutiny their weapons were just as good as the British ones. Yet the outnumbered British prevailed. The central point of Diamond's book is Pizarro's capture of Atahualpa (168 Spaniards against 80,000 Incas). Diamond attributes that stunning victory purely to superior weaponry - ignoring the fact that with 500 to 1 advantage completely unarmed people (and Incas WERE armed, if poorly) can easily swarm armored arquebusiers by sheer mass. Incas were paralyzed by their delusional view of reality - in other words, their CULTURE. And culture seems to be either a dirty world, or a non-existent one to Diamond. He does no even consider that cultural differences, such as tradition of rational inquiry, have anything to do with military victories.The book is rife with such omissions. The Mongols conquered China and half of Europe and they were a nomadic, non-agricultural people. Diamond gives them exactly one sentence (\\"Mongol empire stretched 6,000 miles\\"). African tribal societies had farming and domesticated animals for centuries before the Europeans arrived. China had all the advantages Europe had, yet according to Diamond lost out because (get that!) its smooth coastline allowed no refuge to dissenters from the government that suppressed innovation (and why would it do that?). European coastline is convoluted, so such dissenters could hide. No mention of European governments which encouraged innovation (culture again!) and prospered as a result.As for Diamond's claim early in the book that New Guineans are more intelligent that Westerners, that's just pure racism - especially in view of his repeated claims elsewhere in the book that no humans groups innately differ in intelligence. Except these two, apparently. He thinks that the violence of New Guinean society - that any encounter with a stranger could turn deadly, - bred out the stupid ones. Assuming that is true, one wonders why did New Guineans never grow smart enough to END such violence?Even worse is Diamond's mention of his experiences on a Midwestern farm where all white farmhands were hard-drinking scum, and the only decent person was a Native American. That's just gratuitous white-bashing, so common on liberal college campuses. Without that and the \\"New Guineans must be smarter\\" bit, I would have given the book 2 stars (\\"intriguing idea, poorly executed\\"). As is, it deserves the lowest rating possible."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This is a book which certainly brings a reaction out of people, judging by the number of extreme votes for it, good and bad. For one more opinion though:I picked up this book (in German it's called 'Arm und Reich' - Poor and Rich) in a bargain bin for 1 euro, and must confess that I had never heard of it before, so my impression was completely unbiased. Now it has a place on my bookshelf alongside Darwin's Origin of Species and Paine's The Age of Reason, and a couple other classics which have given us a truer picture of our world. I disagree with those who claim Jared Diamond has some agenda he is trying to push. It is a completely objective analysis by someone venturing into a field many shy away from. Many of those voting low seem to betray some sort of prejudice or preconceived notions that they cannot get rid of, forgetting that it is historical fact that their ancestors were ignorant primitives when the greatest civilizations existed in the Middle East. But even those who refuse to believe that it is anything other than genetic advantage that landed the racial groups where they are today economically, socially, etc can take heart from this book. That's because the book also shows that Europe's drive to colonization was not the result of them being particularly evil slave-drivers and that way inclined, but simply naturally followed from their own history and technological stand. Any population group that expands enough to place a pressure on its original boundaries will colonize at some point, and many of history's previous colonizations left no survivors, e.g. the Asiatic colonization of Polynesia.Note that Jared doesn't imply that these are the ONLY causes behind Europe's technological lead in comparison with other racial groups, but the main ones, which I must agree with. There are, however, other factors which probably played a role too, which are not mentioned in the book, such as climate, for example. The book also demonstrates the fallacy of 'racial purity' as leading to any kind of advantage. The purest races today remain pure-blooded Aborigines and Hottentots, who made little technological progress over many millennia, while Europeans, who are so mixed it is ridiculous to even start discussing their racial purity, made a great contribution. Racial mixing is vital to increased insight, creativity and intelligence, and is probably one of the main reasons behind the USA's massive leap forward in the 20th century, compared with other inbred, 'racially pure' countries. I believe that if this book were made required reading in schools, there'd be a lot less racial hatred around than there is today."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Try not to be put off by the title; yes, they do feature prominently in the book, but that is not the basic thrust of Mr. Diamond's excellent book.This is more about how equally intelligent 'tribes' of the same species came to differ so greatly in their development, and ultimately why one faction now pulls the strings of the world.To examine this in the correct perspective, Mr Diamond goes to the dawn of pre-history, asks the questions a child might ask, then attempts to answer them as convincingly as possible by drawing on the vast resources of available data and his own formidable intellect. Strangely, this doesn't result in a dry-as-dust treatise you might find in Nature journal, but in a highly enjoyable, thought-provoking read, illustrated by many little-known factual historical events. Many of the chapters did appear in Nature, as it happens, but the reasoned logic and step-by-step arguments make this as accessible and readable for the lay reader as the academic. The chapters on how and why our food came to be domesticated are particularly llluminating.Naturally, in a book of such scope, there remain many unanswered questions, but surely this will stimulate much more debate and research - at the same time correcting some long-held racist dogma.An excellent read. *****"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Ever wonder why Europeans conquered the New World? Sure the easy explanation is that the Europeans had better technology and organization that the Native Americans could not overcome. But, ever wonder why it wasn't the Inca who sailed over the Atlantic and conquered Europe? Or why Africa was colonized by Europe, even though Africa is the birthplace of Homo sapiens? Guns, Germs and Steel tries to answer this question.Diamond has written a facinating book trying to answer that question. He argues that the early domestication of plants and large mammals (cows, horses, etc.) allowed civilizations in Europe and Asia to develop much faster than civilizations in the Americas, Africa or Austrailia. Contributing to this (relatively) quick development is the fact that Eurasia's main axis is east-west, which allowed an easier spread of basic food production package from the Fertile Crescent to Europe, as well as the Chinese food production to spread throughout Asia as the local hunter-gatherer communities had to either adapt the sedentary way of life or get overrun by the more populous farming societies.I don't want to give much more away, since the author really explains the points of his thesis quite well. Some reviews have criticized him as too repetitive. I found it quite easy to follow his arguement since I didn't have to waste time trying to find the specific page from 10 chapters previous to refresh my memory.Also, as I read some of the previous reviews, I found that many of the negative reviews were based on two objections. One deals with a sentence at the beginning of the book where he states that an average New Guinean is smarter than an average westerner because of our sedentary lifestyle vs. their hunter-gatherer lifestyle. Personally, I don't think there is a way to create a test which would prove or disprove that statement.Others have claimed that the author is too PC, and has made some Marxist statements. I was going to try to refute those arguements, but instead I implore anyone reading this review to get the book and judge for yourself. Is it perfect? No. Are his theories air-tight? No. He admits this himself. I encourage everyone to read this with an open mind. You might be suprised."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"That's the author's tongue-in-cheek claim for his book. The sub title for 'Guns, Germs and Steel' is 'The Fates of Human Societies' and any study, whether history or science that touches upon the nature of differences amongst people, is potentially frought with danger. Diamond recognizes this and is very direct, not at all tongue-in-cheek in stating &quot;in case...you shudder at the thought that you are about to read a racist treatsie, you aren't&quot;. The different stories of human history have nothing whatsoever to do with human racial differences.This book is truly interdisciplinary and that is both it's strength and weakness. Strength in that it draws upon geography, archaeology, anthropology, biology, genetics, epidemology, physiology and of course history. It's a weakness in that no one person can be an expert in all fields and Diamond certainly is not. Strength again in that he recognizes this and confesses his biases - towards physiology and the influence of geography, more broadly - the power of environmental factors.Very early on in the book we are told about the battle of Cajamarca. On November 16 1532 a small Spanish army met up with an Incan army 500 times it's size. There were 168 conquistadores, (only 62 on horseback) and approximately 80,000 Incas led by their king - Atahuallpa. Before nightfall on the day of the battle, the Spaniards had killed over 7,000 Incas without the loss of a single man. How? Certainly the Spaniards of the day claimed a miracle, afterall it was Atahuallpa's snubbing of a Bible that precipitated the attack. Diamond offers a more prosaic yet equally powerful explanation. According to Diamond there were 'proximate causes' and underlying these are 'ultimate causes' This pattern of causation, some of it purely accidental, was true then and has remained true throughout human history and is the basis for his theory of why people are different. Back to Cajamarca for a minute to explain. The proximate causes were guns, germs and steel - &quot;immediate reasons for Pizzaro's success included military technology based on guns, steel weapons, and horses; infectious diseases endemic in Eurasia&quot;. But why did these advantages come to reside with the Europeans rather than in the new world? Answering that is a matter of developing 'chains of causation' and Diamond spends the greater part of his book discussing the consequences of them. Basically it boils down to the following: food production, unequal distribution of resources, differential rates of diffusion of innovations, domestication of crops &amp; animals and developing immunities to their diseases and finally differences in geography and environment affecting population size and strength. I have given these factors short shrift here but Diamond puts his facts and evidence together in a coherent, plausible and thankfully, very easy to read book. Thoroughly enjoyable and educational."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Firstly, the Pulitzer Prize Winning book's title is misleading advertising! It should have been called something like \\"Geographical Germs, Agriculture & Animal Domestication\\"...but his publishers & marketing gurus convinced him that such a title wouldn't have sold much. In fact, there is very little content in the book about guns, metals, or technological advancement. He originally wrote it in 1997, and in 2005 he was convinced to add a silly meandering chapter entitled \\"Guns, Germs and Steel Today\\"...where he vainly tries to solidify his weak excuse for a book title by peppering the reader with references to the somewhat amusing title abbreviation \\"GGS\\".This promising book is unfortunately regularly marred by weak uncompelling writing skills and very poor editing! The affable author begins the epilogue of his often disappointingly repetitious book by making an excuse that he only has 400+ pages to \\"compress\\" 13,000 years of global human history. Half of its overall content focuses on Australia, New Zealand and New Guinea (which is likely refreshing to all those with ancestry in that part of the world). There is hardly any mention of India, Russia, and many other countries...I however still rate Jared Diamond's publication as an entity worth reading, because he manages to present many valuably salient literary facts & theories on human, animal, and agricultural evolution!"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Because I had heard that this book was an extended attempt to reduce the whole of human civilization to geography, I was wary of it being a long and dreary exercise in simple determinism. I could not have been more wrong! Not only is this book an absolutely first rate intellectual adventure, but it is a nuanced interpretation that deserves every effort. Even better, it is a complete delight as a reading experience, full of fascinating, unexpected ideas and facts on every single page, and superlatively written.As I interpreted it, the crux of his ideas are: 1) land must be fertile, large enough for widespread farming, and the climate the right temperature; 2) geographical boundaries - or their lack - must allow dissemination of ideas (and seeds) across similar landscapes via trade (i.e. horizontally, not vertically cutting across latitudes); 3) a wide variety of animals, in particular domesticable large mammals (for food and muscle labor), must be available to complement farming culture. Eur-Asia had the cow, horse, and pig, a unique endowment that other regions lacked. When all of these pre-conditions are met, a people can convert from hunter-gather bands to farming communities in massive numbers. Once they do so, civilization can arise as they 4) begin to accumulate surplus foodstuffs, expanding population growth, 5) freeing workers from hunting and thus becoming sedentary, eventually 6) to develop specialized labor and hierarchies (in tribes, clans and eventually nations), enabling them to create 7) sophisticated administrative apparatuses (to govern populations where everyone cannot know each other as they do in bands and tribes), writing to preserve knowledge, and more complex technologies. Finally, beyond superior technology and organization, 8) the larger groupings in cities and nations confer disease immunities on diverse populations, which devastate simpler, more isolated cultures.That is it in a nutshell for the ideas. That being said, Diamond is by no means arguing any superiority of various civilizations, only that their establishment and growth are scientifically predictable when the three preconditions are met. As such, it is neither genetic endowment nor invention that led to the dominance of the Eurasian peoples, but geographical luck. I know it sounds too pat and deterministic to state it this way, but the true rewards of the book are a breathtaking tour of human pre-history, to the beginnings of civilization as seen through what people ate, how they obtained their food, and what barriers to further productivity they faced.The canvas he paints includes every major continent and civilization, from Eur-Asia to Africa, the Americas and Australia, with a concluding chapter on Japan. Though I have been on a binge of broad-brush histories of human development and civilization, I can say without hesitation that this one is the most fascinating and fun, in addition to being the deepest inquiry into the forces that shaped human destiny. I knew many of the details and concepts, but this book pulled everything together with subtlety and clear logic. It is truly a masterpiece that I will read more than once.I do have some criticisms of the book. First, he appears to regard the destructive collision between hunter-gatherer peoples as inevitable and unstoppable, particularly with the advent of industrial technologies. I am not at all sure that any culture will necessarily annihilate another, particularly when we are slowly developing greater appreciation and respect of other ways of being. Now, we can choose whether or not it will occur. Second, towards the end, he introduces many ideas kind of helter skelter that are far less well thought through than in the first 2/3 of the book, to the point that they lack coherence. Third, he attempts to extend the logic of his approach too far, in particular with prescriptions - e.g. that it is applicable to modern businesses, with the laughable kinds of cross-over arguments that are made in business schools from scientific research in other areas - that I found naive and superficial.Warmly recommended."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This book was all it's cracked up to be... however as others have pointed it out it's very annoying not to have the tables and charts included in the Kindle version.

But I'm not fond of reading books in general."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"The author's assertion that geographic and biological diversity shaped the evolution of civilization seems to me to have merit, but it also seems that he overstates its importance and distracts from it with faulty logic. For example, he claims that mesoamericans (Aztecs, Incas, etc.) failed to develop the wheel because they had no domesticated animals suitable for pulling wheeled carts. Yet, physics apply to humans as well as beasts. In other words, rather than transporting goods on their backs, the mesoamericans could have moved them much more efficiently by pulling wheeled carts. Ultimately, however, New World civilizations failed to develop this basic technology. There are enough examples of this sort to put the author's credibility--professorship aside--in question.And, my goodness, he beats his points to death. And then kicks them for good measure. The book could have been much more sharply written and reduced in size by a third.Moreover, although he makes the case that there were no innate differences among the races to make one superior to another in the context of making civiliations...he curiously makes the point that the primitive New Guinea folk he has come to know so well appear more intelligent and clever than the rest of us.In short, the author takes an interesting concept and injures it with writing that is superfluous, unconvincing and too often faulty."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"We listened to the audio CD version of this book and it was a disappointment. The reader's voice was grating and often distracted from the story. But the story was overlong as well, and there were many times a point could have been made more succinctly.

This book is jam packed with facts and theories that were news to me. I was presented with lots of good information that I consider myself better now to know. Let's just say that the average high school education does not do this subject area justice.The book is well written, very easy to read. While Mr. Diamond does sometimes try to drill a point home through repetition, I absolutely could not put the book down. It was way too interesting.Once I was finished, I did not agree with 100% of Mr. Diamond's conclusions, especially his omission of what I consider a giant factor in European expansion, their culture.

I certainly learned quite a bit about wheat, about the fertile crescent, and about the Australian Aborigine.However, I take issue with the thesis presented in the first chapter about this book dispelling racisim. I can believe Diamond's entire theory about seeds, beasts, east-west axis, and larger populations and still come to the conclusion that Eurasians have greater average intelligence. Why? Because living in densely populated farming communities would exert very different selection pressures than living in small bands of hunter-gatherers. Diamond claims that disease is the major killer among civilized people. I don't know if that is historically true. But even if it is, human sex-selection provides many opportunities for better endowed men to sire and support more children on average than their lesser peers. If those qualities are heritable, they will become more and more prevalent in the population.This selection has been going on for nearly 10,000 years in parts of Europe and Asia, and those populations, with their food production and technology have been the conquerers more often than the conquered. Unfortunately for the lesser endowed of humanity's ancestors, the millenia of history could well be recorded in our very genes."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This is the best history book I have ever read. It tackles a monumental task to explain how some societies became dominant over the entire course of human existance. The theories do begin to break down when they get into the past two centuries, but up until then (most of the book's content) they are very persuasive. Each chapter is written as a fairly coherent whole. You can read the history of writing in one chapter and then decide to backtrack and read about the history of plant domestication in another chapter. Some of the last chapters that told the history of specific geographical regions were a bit repetative of earlier material in the book, but still it was an extremely engaging read."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"When this book was recommended to me, I thought, &quot;How can this guy fit the entire history of civilization into one volume?&quot;. The answer is that he can't...but he certainly does a wonderful job at debunking some academic myths and giving an interesting general overview of how civilization came to be. Since little is ever mentioned of Polyponesian and Micronesian society in American history and sociology classes, I found that aspect of his studies to be very interesting as well. I would recommend this book to anyone with a genuine fervor for history, but it is mainly an entertaining book, not a undisputable historical tome."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Diamond's last book is a windfall of marvellous moments which makes you see history with new, bias-free eyes. Since I was a kid, I had always hoped that my teachers deal with a world history instead of serving us a European-focused view, but nobody ever did. With Jared Diamond's book, my dream has finally materialized in a pleasant, erudite way. In this book each continent is devoted the same importance and you can learn striking facts about a plethora of subjects such as germs and diseases, giant kangaroos or the population of Madagascar. Certainly the best history book I have ever read, because it is made in a scientific manner. Every history addict should buy it now."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Guns, Germs and Steel is the most illuminating book I ever read, and the best you are likely to find this millenium. Diamond shines his light on that dark little corner in all of us where we keep hidden the secret belief that, in spite of everything, and our best intentions, white European people really are smarter and better than everyone else. We hate racism, and being racist even worse, but the evidence is there, before our eyes, obvious and unarguable. White western Europeans had the first big agriculture, then crafts, villages towns and cities and nation states and big armies. Europeans invented everything, did all the best science and discoveries and art, and built the first big industries. And finally got the power and weapons to go forth and conquer and subdue the whole earth. So isn't it obvious? Well no, as a matter of fact it is not, and Jared Diamond is here to explain how it really happened, and why European &quot;superiority&quot; is another one of those obvious, common sense, self evident &quot;truths&quot; that turns out to be as phony as the flat earth or geocentrism. To read this book, and to be free at last from this crippling old myth is exhilerating. After you read it- and you really must- the world will never be the same place it was before. And we can really be one people after all, just the way we always wanted to be."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"The book itself is supreme but..How can a book based on Geography lack all of the figures constantly referenced from the Author...It was a big disapointed from my first kindle version book!!!!"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"In GUNS, GERMS and STEEL, Jared Diamond brings a unique perspective to the long debated question of why certain societies (those in, or derived from Europe and Asia) are dominant in the world today. Unlike our history classes, which state proximate causes (science and technology, writing, political organization, etc) Diamond seeks to define the ultimate causes.Basically, the ultimate causes boil down to the fact that certain continents (particularly Eurasia) were more conducive to food production and animal domestication, as well as the diffusion of food products (due to an east-west axis verses north-south axis with climate and daylight variations) than others. Food production entailed sedentary large populations and food surpluses, so (certain) people in food producing societies could shift their attention from getting food to serving in armies, inventing technology, organizing societies, and so on. Thus, food-producing societies with their large populations, standing armies, and better technology overcame hunter-gatherer societies wither smaller populations with poorer technology.Diamond's theory applied to the real world is as follows: Eurasia historically had an environment packed with domesticable plants and animals as compared with other continents, and thus Eurasians became food producers long before Native Americans, Native Australians and Africans. Thus, Eurasians were able to expand their population and focus on things other than food gathering, such as technology, and political organization for a much longer period of time than members of other continents. Eurasia's east-west axis promoted not only the diffusion of domesticable plants and animals but also of goods and ideas, allowing societies in Eurasia to improve on each other's technologies. Thus, by 1492, Eurasia was greatly advanced technologically and politically as compared with other continents. The 'Clash of Continents' could only have one result: the victory of Eurasians.His theory is simple, but extremely provocative. It does a great deal to explain why the world is as it is today- continents did not start on a level playing field- and differences in environmental 'endowedness' has translated differing levels of societal development/dominance.Note, Diamond uses his theory not only to explain the rise of Eurasia over other continents, but also explains intra-continental shifts as well: ie, why the Bantu became dominant in Sub-Saharan Africa, why Austronesians became dominant in South-East Asia but not New Guinea, and why the Maori people conquered the Moriori people in Polynesia. Its focus is refreshingly non-Western, quite unlike my 'Western Civilization' history class I took in high school.The book also gives a nice introduction to subjects that many of us are not familiar with, such as geology, linguistics, archeology, cultural anthropology and evolutionary biology. (I never thought linguistics would be so fascinating!)However, as provocative as the book is, it is flawed in several respects. One is Diamond's curious decision to make the book about 400 pages. This is too long to describe his basic theory (which, as I mentioned above, is actually rather simple) so there is much repetition of his basic idea. On the other hand, 400 pages is not nearly enough space to provide comprehensive explanations of various other fields of inquiry (ie, linguistics, anthropology, geology, etc) needed to back up his basic claim, along with a thorough review of world history. Thus, his forays into these other subjects as well world history feel incomplete and rushed.More importantly, Diamond makes a critical, but completely unnecessary decision to view human history through the lens of science. Thus, he sees explaining human history as on par with explaining glaciers, nebulas, hurricanes and biological species. Concepts such as human choice (culturally and individually) and free will are relegated as \`idiosyncrasies' and 'wild cards' to be examined only after environmental variables are exhausted. Even these factors are ultimately determined (say by quantum mechanics), if not always predictable.Yet, for all his purported enthusiasm for turning human history into a science, Diamond started the entire project based on a rather unscientific assumption- that people of New Guinea are likely smarter than the average American and European, which led him to ask, why did Europeans rather than New Guineans end up with more 'cargo?' Yet, a truly scientific explanation of historical trajectories of different societies needs to methodically explore possible differences in intelligence among different peoples.Furthermore, Diamond's decision to ally with science prevents him from making explicit value judgments on different societies, historical events or future prognoses. However, throughout the book, one can sense a rather unscientific bias towards simpler societies, simpler times. New Guineans hunter-gatherers are smarter than Euro-American TV watchers. Hunter-gather societies are 'egalitarian' while modern states are all 'kleptocracies.' Hunter-gatherer societies do not have organized religion (which Diamond views, negatively, in a narrow sense) while states depend and thrive on it.Finally, Diamond's deterministic view of human history completely prevents him from suggesting possible corrective measures to the problems arising from world inequality. He alerts us to the crucial fact that the playing field was not, and is not, level. However, the only conclusion he can possibly reach is quite pessimistic: the environmental 'haves' will generally end up dominating and conquering the 'have-nots, although human/cultural 'idiosyncrasies' may alter affect this pattern in some unknown way.But perhaps this is not necessarily the case. Rather, with proper motivation and encouragement (from human individuals and groups who are not satisfied with the passivity brought on by determinism) perhaps environmentally well-endowed societies can assist their less favored counterparts both environmentally and technologically. Rather than being resigned as 'wild cards' of history, perhaps we as members of the human race should help each other level the playing field, and work to create a better world for us all."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"The big question addressed in this book is why certain groups of people have been successful in conquering others. The book's title suggests a partial answer, but the root cause, according to Jared Diamond, is geography. In short, certain geographical conditions favored the development of farming, which in turn fostered the development of stable societies, large populations, better technology, and resistance to killer germs. So the societies that were the first to develop farming conquered everybody else.It's a neat hypothesis, but Diamond has taken a lot of heat for it. As many others have pointed out, some of the critiques have been overtly or implicitly racist, suggesting a genetic basis for the superiority of one group over another. Until someone comes up with some evidence for this ugly position, it's best to ignore it.The other arguments boil down to religion and culture. These aren't necessarily incorrect, but they beg the question. One could just as easily ask why certain societies developed cultures or religions that enabled them to be more successful than others. As Diamond correctly points out, geography has the advantage of being objective and open to scientific investigation.The other problem with culture and religion is that they confuse cause and effect. While it's true that religion inspires people to make certain choices, it's also true that people tend to invent religions that justify whatever they happen to be already doing. Same goes for cultural traditions.Diamond does have a tendency to overstate his case, and to speculate somewhat recklessly. That's probably why people are annoyed with him, but I don't see that as a reason to dismiss the book's main message, which is extremely interesting."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"The sheer scope of the subject, the pathology of contemporary cultural relationships/dominance on a global scale, has proven unwieldy to most authors. Diamond has synthesized a wide variety of scientific disciplines in an effort to capture the 'why' of contemporary global cultural status quo. He nearly pulls it off while limiting his discussion to one volume, which could have used a 40 page liposuction. His explanation for cultural success in a macro-historical context is, in a nut shell, the same as successful real estate investing : location, location, location. It is in explaining the 'why' of geographical criticality that he raises the bar.Criticizing his work is precocious on my part, as I lack anthropology or archeology in my education. While Diamond doesn't answer all of the &quot;why,&quot; he answers enough of it to define a sound point of departure for studies that synthesize his theory and the more difficult interractions of religion and politics (beliefs and behaviors.) I wonder if anybody can answer the &quot;why&quot; questions better, and support their conclusions.Diamond's reliance on New Guinea for many of his examples becomes tiresome. Otherwise, his explanations of geographical influence, and the second and third order effects on plant, animal, hydrographic, mineral, and human interaction, are logical, even if not proved to the deepest level of scientific rigor. He did after all limit his scope to one volume.The author avoids reliance on racial/genetic factors, preferring to rely on environmental stimuli as his fundamental causative factors. Even so, one gets the feeling that he is pandering to the PC audience when he continually portrays the &quot;Eurasian&quot; descendants as avaricious butchers.Whether you agree with the author or not, it is well worth anyone's time to read his arguements and ponder them, and even show where his logic does not stand up.Also worthwhile would be an exploration of how the information age may have rendered some of his causative factors of cultural diffusion obsolete.In any case READ THIS BOOK! It will stimulate your brain."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Fascinating book. I think some of the below criticisms are not quite fair--this is not meant to be a scholarly book. It's much better, it's a scientific book written for the layman, a rare gem today.Is it somewhat PC? Yeah, but really, the book is so good overall that it's easy to overlook that. I personally think the author did an admirable job of looking at the human civilizations all across the globe rather than concentrating only on European civilizations, as lot of other books do. You can't really study human civilization without looking at non-Western cultures, since we must remember that Europe (and I'm not including Greece , Rome, and other meditteranean cultures that are clearly NOT Western European) has been at the periphery of civilization for most of human history.Overall the book is a monumental work, work that will surely change our understanding of human culture and civilizations."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"The question is why the West has so much baggage.Diamond then shows that some societies are more lucky than others. There are only so many types of plants and animals that humans can use. Thus some socieites in Africa, the Americas before the Europeans came had a disadvantage. Then throw in the Germs and you have a very convincing, well presented theory.But cultures rise and decline. What caused Europe to borrow from others and then achieve a new level of technology? Other cultures covered in the book had the same geographical/resource advantages as the Europeans. So why did the Ottoman Empire with all its advantages, not dominate all of Europe?Guess there are some things we can never know for sure. They just happened."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Working from a fantastically diverse array of scholarship, Jared Diamond provides an entirely convincing explanation of How the West Won. Working from essential geographic and biological foundations, he traces the development of a very few essential technologies to explain why Eurasians came to dominate the world. By narrowing the inquiry to these points, he's able to cover remarkable territory at an eminently digestible, lucid 400 pages. (I disagree with those who believe his work overlong -- any less and either you'd miss either important elements of his argument, or evidence of its strength.)Part of what makes his work so valuable is that he avoids most of the self-righteousness endemic in the academy. Yes, he does criticise racist theories for their offensiveness, but in the context of disproving them for their intellectual laziness. Yes, he indeed praises New Guinean intelligence unstintingly, but that's actually pretty sensible: how many American couch potatoes could muster the mental resources to survive constant warfare? In fact, his description of the bloodletting typical in some less-Westernised societies (the Inca and the Aztecs come to mind) refutes any accusations of romanticism. His writing instead conveys the sort of dispassionate engagement so often missing among scholars today."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Like &quot;Third Chimpanzee&quot;, &quot;Guns, Germs, and Steel&quot; covers such a wide range of times, peoples, and topics that even if you don't agree with the author's conclusion (sort of an enhanced geographical determinism- maybe &quot;bio-geographical determinism&quot;?) you'll enjoy the book simply for the incredible breadth of information presented by Diamond to make his case. I happened to agree with his conclusion, so I enjoyed it that much more. Only a couple of very minor criticisms: 1) As a couple of previous reviewers mentioned, the last few chapters get a bit repetitive at times (you'll catch yourself thinking &quot;I GET it already!&quot;) 2) Some examples are much more convincing than others. For instance, his Polynesian, New Guinean, and Australian examples are neat, complete, and utterly persuasive. Some of his New World examples, however, are not as convincing. One example is the failure of the wheel to catch on in the New World. According to the book, the wheel was invented in MesoAmerica, but not in Ancient Peru. But since the only draft animals (llamas) were in Peru, the wheel never really caught on and was used only on ceramic toys in MesoAmerica. Because of the difficult geography of the region- jungles, narrow isthmus, etc.- the wheel never spread to the Incas. My problem with this example is the #'s don't seem to add up. Diamond offers 1 mile/month as a conservative guesstimate of how quickly paleo-Indian hunter-gatherers filled up the Americas, meaning that people could migrate from the Bering strait to the southernmost tip of South American in about 700 years. Now Peru and MesoAmerica are only a fraction of that distance apart, but somehow, over hundreds of years, no one managed to get one of these wheeled toys- or even the idea of a wheeled toy- between the two societies? This is even harder to believe when we consider that these people had sea-going rafts. Diamond refers to one that Pizzaro captured off the coast of Peru, and Cuba and Hispaniola were full of Indians when Colombus arrived... I had similar problems with the explanation for the failure of writing to migrate from MesoAmerica to Peru. Yes, the Incans had their system of knots for record-keeping, but again it's hard to believe that no one would get the idea of visual symbols on a flat surface across that distance over hundreds of years... Diamond's own area of research appears to be primarily New Guinea and Polynesia, so perhaps that's why his examples are stronger there. At any rate, the book is still outstanding- the 400 pages pass too quickly."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Book Review of Jared Diamond&#8217;s Guns, Germs, and Steel by Joylyn StoverAs a second year student at Olivet College in Michigan, I was given the opportunity to incorporate Guns, Germs, and Steel into my Civilization Studies course. I chose this book because I wanted to see history from a new perspective, focusing more on the science aspects. As part of the course requirements, I am posting my critical analysis of his book and how it affected me as a student. Jared Diamond certainly has an interesting take on the history of the early civilizations. Throughout his book, he attempts to explain the rise and fall of civilizations through a non racist look. He explains how agriculture, domesticating animals and natural resources affected the destiny of the early civilizations. His overall thesis states that it was geography that gave civilizations an advantage for survival. This is a convincing claim, yet how true and believable is it?Diamond successfully explains several aspects that lead to the powerful, dominating societies we see today. One of those is the transition from hunter gatherers to that of farmers. Once a society began producing surpluses of food, families grew larger and homes were established. Property lines were distinguished and laws came into play. Occupational positions outside of agriculture were necessary and were sustained through the excess of food produced on the farms. This also led to the advancements in technology. Weaponry and exploration by sea became more important trades with the help of agriculture sustenance. This inevitably led to an explosion of wars and the conquering of less technologically advanced societies.Although many societies lived in areas that did not lend itself to be farmed. Many geographic features hindered societies from this advancement such as the Arctic or desert regions. In such a case as the Aborigines, the land was incapable of sustaining sufficient plant life to support a growing community. In this situation, the Aborigines were forced to continue living in a hunter and gatherer society. The consequences of this outcome is evident when Diamond analyzes the Aborigines' way of life which is similar to that of hunter gatherers a thousand years ago. They continue living without the extra &#8220;cargo&#8221; that many of the developed nations have.Diamond makes an unfortunate statement that &#8220;hunter gatherers met one of two fates: either they were displaced by neighboring food producers, or else they survived only by adopting food production themselves.&#8221; Typically this is what happened to many of the communities. They often were low in population and were inexperienced with weaponry and organized defense and lost their battles with neighboring societies.Throughout the book, he supports his theories with intelligent and reasonable evidence that makes his claims believed wholeheartedly. Unfortunately, he disregards other influences on society growth and advancement such as religion, culture and general human decisions. Does this mean that if the Aborigines had geographic conditions that allowed for the domesticating of plants and animals and an agriculture surplus they would have dominated as a society? Diamond fails to include other influential factors that disagree with his theory of geographic determination.Jared Diamond&#8217;s book is effective in that he looks at history from many diverse angles. He dissects issues of agriculture, animal domestication, disease, language development and most of all geography and the role they played in the success of the early civilizations. His take on history is easily understood and explains to a great extent how and why some civilizations managed to grow and prosper at the rate they did.Unfortunately Diamond&#8217;s one major flaw was his inability to omit the redundant information resulting with several dead chapters. This includes the monotonous chapters about food production and the domestication of plants and animals. In my opinion, these chapters were space fillers for the book. Most of the information could have been edited to a few pages rather than reiterating the same ideas and concepts as if his readers were mindless.... I believe Diamond lost sight of who his audience was and fell to a lower level of writing. Often I struggled to finish the aseptic pages of redundant information. Yet, this complaint only applies to the few chapters I stated above. Generally I was adequately satisfied with his book.I would recommend this book to anyone interested in anthropology or who would like to study history from a non-traditional point of view. I thoroughly enjoyed the chapter discussing the evolution of germs, and recommend you at least read that chapter if you choose not to read the book at all. In my perspective, this was especially intriguing because of my science based interests. I encourage those with patience and an open mind to read this book. I believe there is much truth in Diamond&#8217;s theories."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"There is little question that this is an entertaining and thought provoking book. The author starts out by describing a conversation that he had with a person from New Guinea. The conversation was why New Guinea had by comparison little cargo or wealth compared to other countries. The author has considered this statement and found that it raises an interesting question. He for some reason or other is of the belief that the inhabitants of New Guinea are of a higher intelligence than other people and their poverty is thus unusual. The book is an attempt to find an answer.The main argument of the book is to look at the conquest of the America's by the Spanish. When Cortez and Pizzaro conquered the New World they did so with comically small armies. The reason they succeeded was due to a number of factors. It is worthwhile discussing these factors a little as they form the analytical basis of the book. When the Spanish came to the New World they immediately and unintentionally infected the local populations with a range of diseases. The local population had no resistance to those diseases and the effect on the local population was catastrophic leading to declines of population of 70% to 90%. This made it very difficult for the Aztec and Inca states to resist the invaders, or after the initial conquest to mount rebellions. The Spanish also had superior weapons. In reality the main advantage in these struggles seems not to result from firearms but the use of sharp edged weapons made of steel, swords and spears. The horse was also vital to the military effort. Lastly the Spanish were more Machiavellian than their enemies.If we look at the history of the New World it is clear that the Aztec and Inca civilisations were successful in developing cereal crops which allowed large concentrations of people to live of the land and for cities to be established. The civilisation did not develop metal working and its society was static. Both the Inca and Aztec civilisations were basically stone age. In a later chapter the author looks at New Guinea. One of the key aspects to New Guinea is that it developed the use of a form of subsistence agriculture. Its overall development lingers behind that of what the Americas achieved.If this is compared with Europe it is possible to see why there were forces at work which gave it an advantage over the Americas. These advantages are geographic and are seen to be the key to what the author sees as the development of civilisations.These basically are that Europe arose on a huge land mass which gave all societies certain advantages. If a development occurred in Siberia it could be taken up in Europe. If a development occurred in India it could be taken up in China. The author then goes on to discuss how the production of cereal crops, the domestication of animals occurred and how they spread over the Eurasian land mass. The development of high populations then led to the development of cities and the sort of intellectual progress which leads to technical innovation.The problem with the theory is that it is strongest when it looks at societies which were cut of and in which these forces could interplay. Thus the thesis is excellent when it examines the conquest of the Americas. It becomes weaker when it looks at other areas.If we had looked at the world in 1400 Europe would look to be a backwater. The most powerful and advanced countries at that time would have been China and the Islamic states in the middle east. Over the next three hundred years Europe was to become powerful. One explanation for this is the development of military technology. Around 1700 Europe developed the use of the flintlock musket and armed sailing ships. These gave it an edge which was illustrated in wars between Austria and the Ottoman Empire. These technologies however were picked up by other nations.One reason for the success of Europe was its policy of Imperialism and Conquest. The basis of this policy was for European states to over time use naval technology and the concentration of force to conquer overseas possessions. This led to a gradual increase in their wealth and power. If we examine the history of Holland, Spain, Portugal, France, England and Russia all acquired significant empires. The acquisition and the administration of empire meant that each of these nations had to keep on top of technical developments. One only has to read about the reign of Peter the Great to see how European Nations were continually modernising to ensure military strength. The importance of military development was something which dragged along technology.Despite these minor quibbles the book is a great read entertaining and one of the more thought provoking in some time."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Although much of Jared Diamond's book Guns, Germs, and Steel seems speculative or even flawed, his writing is ground-braking and inspiring. Through the author's experiences, the book receives depth and color. It is a pleasure to read this beautifully flowing text. He tickles the mind in order to find a solution to a giant puzzle of human evolution. It may help in addressing the most pressing issues of modernity, such as poverty, violence, and problems that may be induced by climate change.His case is that modern civilization is essentially branded by the food production capabilities of early civilizations, prompting not only innovation but also the evolution of germs that had enabled them to overtake other people's lands.Firstly, even though the author attempts a holistic approach, the work is too narrow, missing a bigger evolutionary picture. Secondly, by merely drawing analogies to the invasions of European germs into the American continents, Diamond does not make an evolutionary case for the participation of germs to Eurasian supremacy. Also, the idea of microbes as an aid to conquest can only have played a role for isolated civilizations conquered in the last few hundred years, not for the development of Eurasian peoples that acquired enhanced immune systems. Diamond delivers his own counter argument where the Antonine Plague in the second century did not lead to the conquest of Rome by Middle Eastern forces despite millions of victims at home. Thirdly, the argument may be upside down. Instead, localized abundance of food and human crowding, induced by climate change and geographical bottlenecks, may have led to a rapid rise of civilization (see the experiment below). Lastly, the quality of the book drops significantly from the middle onwards, from Chapter 10, when the author leaves his home turf. His ideas of the different continental axis add an unnecessary complexity with no goal in sight. Meanwhile, the author is out of his league and engages in selective informing when it comes to historic analogies. His chapter about writing is lengthy and deviates into unnecessary details. It does not seem to fit into the narrative in any important way. In short, I do not appreciate it when authors start off with a hypothesis only to throw anything in that may support it, regardless of its relevance or accuracy.Four issues are missing or shallow in Diamond's work: Firstly, the contribution of the climatic changes after the last Ice Age may have forced hunter-gatherers into farming. Likewise, the occurrence of an unusual biodiversity in the Fertile Crescent may have been the result of mass migrations of fauna and flora as a consequence of a north-drifting Fertile Belt. Secondly, religion is the single biggest shaping agent for civilizations. It defines cohesive cultures and creates inter-group animosities and exclusions. Religious monuments are probably the main testament for societal complexity, and fertility was the main concern. Diamond tries to get away with a few flawed arguments about faith while all known ancient civilizations already displayed highly developed religious beliefs. Thirdly, Diamond barely touches on the evolutionary function that storing and preserving food may have had. In order to sustain stationary populations with high density, food innovations must have helped bridging the seasonal periods of scarcity (herding of animals is a form of food preservation but needs seasonal feeding). Storage facilities, in turn, may have been attractive targets for loot through the ages, and the seed for organized defense as well as inter-tribal trade and cooperation. Fourthly, an assessment as to the implications for modern development efforts is missing. Can the author's findings be overcome by modern technology and cooperation?Here is a little experiment: Take a world map where the desertification of North Africa, the Arab Peninsula, and Australia can easily be spotted ([...], for example). The desertification is a function of the earth's tilt, creating a 2,000 mile wide desert belt in a wave shape that can be drawn through the middle of the Sahara, Yemen on the south-western tip of the Arab Peninsula, Australia, turning north to the southern United States. This modern deserted area is the Fertile Belt that was perfect for hunter-gatherers, rich in varied resources of flora and fauna, during the last Ice Age from roughly 50,000 until about 15,000 years ago.Lay a ruler across the map such that it crosses North-Africa, and touches Yemen as well as northern Australia at the same time. Imagine for a moment that the onset of the Ice Age must have driven previous populations south into the modern desert belt, regardless of their numbers (which may have gone through a catastrophic evolutionary bottleneck, possibly caused by the decade long volcanic winter following the Toba Catastrophe). During the Ice Age, populations would have slowly recovered from a low of possibly less than 10,000 pairs to a few million. Toward the end of the Ice Age, those millions would have had to wander away from desertification and rising sea levels in search for food resources. To simulate the process, the ruler needs to be pushed north. A few million heads would end up in crowded places: Flora, fauna, and humans were squeezed through a geographic bottleneck at the Sinai Peninsula into the Fertile Crescent.The result of the forced North African migration would have been crowding in Egypt, spilling over into the opening Fertile Crescent.Pushing the ruler further north leads to spreading of the Fertile Belt in the direction of east and west and eventually to crowding in northern China, creating a natural overspill of small groups into North America. There, the ice sheet reached as far down as the northern tip of Oregon, which is where the oldest human settlement of the continent can be found. The same experiment shows that crowding would not have taken place as the ice retreated. Quite in contrary, the arable land mass increased (as would be the case in Eurasia if the ice further retreats in the future).Driving the ruler southwards, it can be demonstrated that crowding must have taken place in Central America and, to a smaller extent, at the point where the West Coast of Africa narrows.These places of crowding were also the places that Diamond identifies as locations of centers for the rise of food production. The experiment reveals that the independent appearance of farming in various places around the same time was not accidental but must have been induced by force of nature. Australians had a somewhat different fate: while they may have been able to island-hop onto the continent, the changes in sea levels left them prisoners, landlocked in a desert.My own research laid out in the book The Great Leap-Fraud, Social Economics of Religious Terrorism shows that the development of humanity can be compared to a large wheel that very slowly drives an interdependent mechanism. Actions lead to symptomatic reactions in rather logical and simple ways. For the ancients, if something was not simple, relative to their level of development, it was not adopted. Diamond must know, as a whole, that the human species is lazy and conservative. If it does not have to change, it will not. If it can overfeed, it will. If it does not need to innovate, it will not. Without external forces, hunter-gatherers simply roam deeper into their territory rather than changing their old ways. Modern Fair Trade experiments speak volumes in this respect. Yet, they were able to identify and improve upon the most suitable crops. As Diamond observed, the hunter-gatherers of New Guinea possess knowledge that dwarfs most, if not all, modern biologists. In other words, 50,000 years ago, the species may have emerged just as intelligent as modern humans, but its intelligence evolved in a different, more specialized way (see Jewelry and cave paintings). On the other hand, the dumbest cow can distinguish delicious clovers from bitter weeds. Hence, the selection process may be less impressive than portrayed by Diamond.Whether Diamond's argument that food production laid the framework for conquests or the above outlined bottleneck theory might have led to geographical disparities in civilizations might be merely philosophical in the modern context. In my work, it seems rather that two factors played a major role in conquests: scarcity induced aggression in ancient times and religious conflicts during the last 2,500 years. The one with an edge was not blessed with food production but with stronger alliances. It is true, of course, that economic advantages re-enforce not only stronger allies but also a more innovative food production (irrigation). After all, it is (human) nature to favor the strong over the weak.The issue of the collective human intellect, on closer examination, becomes of much larger prominence than portrayed by Diamond. Only a few decades (even years) separated the social rejection in Islam from the social awakening in Christian Europe. While Europe had been slumbering for half a millennia, innovative Arabs first represented a continuum of Roman culture that was later exiled (or exiled itself) to Spain. Then they immigrated to Italy and France during the onslaught of Shi'ite fundamentalism into the Iberian Peninsula. That Europeans sailed to America and not Arabs was a mere freak of nature and does not support Diamond's case.However, the major implications of the text remain unanswered: how can the have-nots be converted into haves? The question is not how to bring the remaining hunter-gatherers into the civilized world or how to turn farmers into city dwellers but how to evolve slumified cities around the globe, even in the West, into a world of human dignity without creating an expectation of a free lunch and dependency by transferring wealth to the poor. Hence, I reject the Diamond's notion of moral justification for redistributive state control. Nevertheless, the quality of the book cannot depend on my agreement but merely on its originality and substance. This is where it deserves a hearty five stars.A.J.

Little did I know at the time that Jared Diamond had addressed it in this comprehensive book--not only addressed it, but addressed it thoroughly, and, in fact, bordered on beating the topic to death ... bordered, but not crossed. When I later heard about the premise of Guns, Germs, and Steel, and since the topic of why Europeans had the edge up on other societies was one I had often been fascinated with, I knew that I had to read it. When I finally got the book, it started out being exactly what I was looking for, and I read with increasing interest. Then, at about the half way point, I noticed that I was becoming fatigued with the topic and ready for a slam bang conclusion. Unfortunately, I still had plenty of reading to go. The freshness of Diamond's ideas and approach were gone, and I really didn't feel like I was learning anything ground-breakingly new in the last half of the book. I kept on thinking, \\"Yeah, I believe you. No more examples.\\" Now, that doesn't sound too flattering, but I think I must emphasize that I went into this reading with high expectations, and for the first half of the book, those expectations were met. That meant that Jared Diamond took a highly scientific and immensely broad subject and made it both personal and interesting; something not easily accomplished. Mr. Diamond's careful, if not meticulous view of each and every angle of the world's civilizations acts as both his strength and, for me, his eventual weakness. Though, I don't know if I can rightly adjust the blame of this to Jared Diamond, or whether I should attach it instead to the length of the history of the world. Too many civilizations over too many continents forced Mr. Diamond to address all of them or be faced with an incomplete academic exploration. Looking back on it, however, the perspective Jared Diamond provides is invaluable, and while there were a few instances where I felt that he was stepping into too much speculation, for the most part his logic was well grounded and felt indisputable. Above all, Mr. Diamond's case studies and examples brought the two facets of credibility and interest together, a pair that is not normally attributed to highly academic books. I finished the book with satisfaction, but also with relief. I only hope that our current civilizations don't change too much, if only for keeping this book to its current page limit. But if an extension is needed, I can't imagine anyone more worthy of it that Jared Diamond."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This book is a somewhat linear history of the past 13,000 years across the continents. Diamond seeks to sum up history across various societies on all the continents in a relatively short volume. The impetus for this search starts with a question from a friend of his from New Guinea named Yali. Yali's question was, \\"Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?\\"Reading the book, I think I gulped at this point. This sounds like a classic, loaded question. It sounds disturbingly close to why have we (Europe and its former colonies) succeeded where they have failed. Diamond does not descend into that territory though, but he does not evade criticism for skirting it completely. There are references to a culture's success in industrializing or condensing populations that Diamond brushes off as a mixed blessing, for instance. The advantages of a hunting/gathering culture are not really explored outside of the remarkable sustaining nature of southeast Asia.This history can probably be described (or perhaps is most successful) as based around environmental causation (as opposed to the racial/ethnic/social causation that the lump in my throat had been fearing). Descriptions of climate (note: that the history begins with the cessation of the last great ice age), longitudinal or latitudinal axes, elevation and landmass differences play a strong role in determining the fate of humanity. Still, it is interesting to look specifically at the items gathered in the title.Guns. Europe's refinement of this technology was based on China's innovations with gunpowder. Today's dominant society is a product as much of what it has swallowed and thus incorporated as by what it has innovated. As an interesting counterpoint, Japan had owned more and better guns in c. 1600 CE, than any country in the world. Samurai rulers first limited then outlawed the technology. Japan wouldn't resume manufacture until mid 19th century. Obviously, there is an indisputable importance in the weaponry's influence in shaping the geopolitical world of today.Germs. Epidemics left people from cultures based on cities with who could resist smallpox and those dense populations more easily replaced those who didn't survive. Smaller groups have a distinct disadvantage versus the interdependent and consequently more interchangable larger cities. Epidemics develop out of these civilizations as germs jump over from domesticated animals (and smaller groups may not even have animals to domesticate). Interesting note: the emperors of the Mayan and Incan civilizations both succumb to disease (likely smallpox) rather than guns.Steel. Technological advancement is keyed on innovations brought about by dense populations and the possibility for abstraction of responsibilities. A hunter-gatherer culture lacks the abstraction necessary to divide responsibilities to allow for such developments as literacy and mining, as the energies that would fuel these are directed toward survival areas. Diamond makes an interesting and controversial point that the hunter-gatherer culture may be more attuned to intelligence as an evolutionary necessity over civilized society, where the evolutionary energy may be directed at surviving these epidemic illnesses.There are many aspects of environment that serve as limiting conditions for the development of these things. First, there appears to need to be sustainable farming. Many of the staples of modernity are the crops first domesticated in the fertile crescent region (where today we invade, suck oil, and force the conquered to endure freedom). The western Asian breadbasket provided the means to bank food so that trades could develop. As a complete side note, the Genesis book of the bible can be viewed upon through this filter as it goes into great detail how Joseph set up a system of storing and meting grain in Egypt to greatly increase the population and avoid the calamity of drought and famine brought on by sustenance farming.Another factor in the civilizing of Eurasia is the landmass itself. Compared to Africa and the Americas, Eurasia is mainly west-east axis versus north-south. Movement of successes in cultivation and domestication could more easily occur because climate differences are easier on a latitudinal basis than on longitudinal. Something like corn (maize) which was domesticated in central Americas took a very long time to make it to North America because of geography. Llamas and guinea pigs (which could be useful for pack animals and food) never made it north. Conversely, all those fertile crescent crops and bigger domesticated animals like cattle, horses, pigs were able to spread from one tip of Asia to the opposite tip of Europe.To answer Yali's question, some of the answer is luck. Africa, Australia and the Americas may not have been afforded the botanical or zoological advantages that Eurasia had. Some other is environmental determinism, where you are helps make up who you become. For going forward, Diamond cites transportation, communication and information advances as factors that likely will obliviate these historical forces in the future.After word: Harpers Magazine tackles an issue that was brought up, but not as fully developed here, that of pre-Clovis Native American discoveries (pronouncements), knowingly confronting a loaded racial/ethnocentric question in a folio called \\"Might White of You: Are American Archaeologists White Supremacists?\\" The archaeological records supports people living in the Americas since about 9000-11000 BCE. There are scant scraps of evidence prior to that date, but plenty of theories typically more titillating than substantive. One wonders if the pre-Clovis discovery (especially all the business about \\"caucusoid\\" skulls), isn't so much about archaeology as setting up an imagined genocide to justify a documented genocide."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Diamond's book provides a compeling, scientific theory of how cultures evolve and how isolation and material disadvantage has set some peoples at a disadvantage to the Eurasian peoples. The fact that people benefited from where they originated has been known for generations, however it has been associated with racist theories of genetic superiority of the people themselves.Diamond points out that there were many advantages due to historical circumstances not based on racist theory. Europeans conquered the new world, but the fact that they brought horses, guns, germs and steel made a significant difference in success of their invasion; not their marginal genetic difference from the conquered. None of these technological advantages originated in Europe, but farther east in Eurasia.Eurasia is the largest landmass on Earth and it also has the widest expanse of temperate lands as well. Thus species and technologies suited to these latitudes could spread quickly. Domestication of plants and animals and the interspecies transfer of their deseases to humans in the eurasian land mass led to better food, better bugs, and better immunity. In the America's and Africa the landmasses are oriented across latitudes, preventing the spread of plant and animal species of use to humans. The fact that the US Manifest Destiny spread east to west is compelling evidence that latitude does matter. This natural cultural evolution provided by Eurasia's latitude advantage provided unsurmountable advantages for Eurasian peoples.Like many simple but powerful theories these are threatening ideas. The fact that preconceived notions of superiority can be explained away by simple concepts of material chance is not pleasant to some. In his follow up book Colapse he points to the failure of the Greenland Norse who refused to adopt superior techniques of the Inuit, even as they starved to death.By challenging the orthodoxy of racism Diamond does a service for Humanity and the natural sciences, even if some refuse to open their minds."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Diamond won the Pulitzer Prize for this book, deservedly.

He covers the gradual spread of humans all over the earth--except the migrations of the Jews, for some completely unknown reason. Yet he's a biologist, not an anthropologist or paleontologist or sociologist. Anyway, anything by this author is really, really good, even if you don't agree with him.

The author backs up his claims with strong arguments which are well researched. He lays out the content of the book in a logical form starting with the clash of two civilizations: The Inca Empire and The Spanish conquistadores in Cajamarca, Peru. This historical episode, though placed at the beginning of the book, is shown to be the logical culmination of 11,000 years of evolution of human societies. The different rates of societal evolution form the basis of this work and are examined to reveal a few causal relationships which the author proposes account for the inevitable outcome symbolized by the massacre in Cajamarca.

However, Diamond presented the thesis in a way that is sweeping in scope and coherent in logic. For those unfamiliar with the theme, it should be an interesting read. For those who have been exposed to this kind of research, the book has left something to be desired. I found the writing style of the author to be a little ponderous, making certain passages difficult to grasp, unless the reader concentrate on the long sentences and the author's particular way of putting a sentence together. The book is repetitive on its major points. For example, that the emergence of food production is the single most important factor in human history is belabored at least 20 times in the book.More seriously, I found the book to be a little unbalanced. I am ready to accept that the author's view of environmental determinism is broadly valid. However, explicitly or implicitly, the author consistently denies that racial differences played any role in the vast disparity between civilizations. The most he came to acknowledge the obvious fact is to grant that within a continent (read race), there are groups that are more innovative than others. If this is true, it is hard to see why, with the humanity taken as a whole, some races are not more innovative than others, in a well defined narrow context.I am not implying racial differences are a major factor. I repeat that I agree with Diamond's view that geography and ecology were probably far more important. However, this does not mean some slight difference in racial characteristics (even if shaped by environmental factors) has not played any significant role at any time in history.

Not to be trite, but the gushy liberal propaganda Diamond expounds on in Guns, Germs, and Steel is nothing more than the latest in a long line of assaults on &quot;Euroasian&quot; culture perpetrated by bleeding-heart academic types absurdly trying to apologize for some of humanity's greatest successes -- in this case civilization. What a load. According to Diamond, intelligence, the preponderant factor in most beings' success or failure, does not count for much where humans are concerned. Instead, our &quot;progress&quot; has hinged solely on where we built our campfires. Hard work had nothing to do with it. Who knew? By the way, Diamond's romantic notion (and secondary theme) that native New Guineans are &quot;... on the average more intelligent, more alert, more expressive, and more interested in things and people around them than the average European! or American ...&quot; is obvious foolishness and a plain silly statement to make. Whatever happened to common sense? Who hired Diamond at UCLA? This joker is teaching our children for goodness sake!!! How on earth did this junk ever win the Pulitzer Prize? Diamond is our generation's Margaret Mead. I mean that in a bad way, for those of you who are still being indoctrinated with Mead's discredited-but-politically-correct, feel-good claptrap. Besides the remarkably similar flaws in their work, Diamond also characterizes anyone who diagrees with him as &quot;racist,&quot; much in the same vein Mead &amp; Co. characterized her detractors. For a far better read on the development of our world, check out Thomas Cahill's now-classic How the Irish Saved Civilization, or his most recent work, The Gifts of the Jews.

Of course its ok for authors to bias their books, but to assign an obviously biased book for reading is completely out of the question. It was completely anti-west and anti-globalization, as well as regarding Americans in a negative tone. In one chapter, Diamond rants on about how the primitive new Guineans who still live in huts are in fact smarter than the Europeans who settled North America. He says that since they can live off the land, they are superior to Americans and Europeans, who cannot. His thesis is correct, but it stands alone in the category of correctness. Its bad enough that he uses qualitative analyses (if not completely made up) to base his observations upon, but he goes on and just keeps repeating the same thing over and over again. It gets even worse: he rants on for nearly 500 pages. The only things that kept this horrible book alive were the diagram, because a diagram on a page meant there was no ranting on that page.

Respectfully submitted,Pierre Rinfret"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This book is highly informative and interesting. Nevertheless, Diamond reiterates the secular position on religion. To the so-called secular intellectuals, religion is a secondary, strange, difficult-to-understand phenomenon. Religion evolved to unify the masses and justify the invasion of others. This point of view is extremely reductionist as religion is very fundamental to humans. Despite the secular anticipation that religion will decline steadily, the World nowadays is as religious as in the past if not more. There are several reasons for this:1. Secularism undermines the always taken-for-granted certainties. Darwinism (one of the scientific wings of secularism) is said to have shattered human vanity by revealing that we humans are just the unintentional byproduct of the alleged evolutionary processes. In this sense, our existence, our free will and our consiousness all evolved my chance!!! The majority of people detest being in a state of uncertainty.2. On the other hand religion presents answers to the fundamental questions of our existence. Some religions look very irrational but some of them appeal to the intellect and provide a self-consistent framework for our existence. These religions spread enormously in the World today.3. Secular arrogance tries to present religious people as ignorant, gullible, and marginalized. On the contrary, many religious people are highly educated professionals who pondered hard over the deepest philosophical questions and reached belief through a long process of rationalization.In short, the book depends on evolution theory too much to study history, belittles religion, and turns history into a mere deterministic process."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Mr. Diamonds thesis and knowledge of how different environments benefit certain populations is very intriguing. His book is easily the best radical cultural/environmental determinist book ever written. But this doesn't change the fact, that this book is just plain wrong in all respects. Mr. Diamonds marxist/egalitarian political agenda so obvious, its amazing that most cannot see right through his line of reasoning. His major point is to show that Western societies only dominated (the world) because of luck, the right environment and plants and the Nonwestern world is not advanced because of &quot;bad luck&quot; and the so ever &quot;white racism&quot;. He basically playing the same old tirade that Gould, Montagu and other marxists have been spewing for years. His real intent is to basically dismantle white racialism (the main function of the race-denier crowd), and to take advantage of European's peoples universal morality( why don't race-denier theories show up in China, africa, India, Japan or the Non white world?). His hatred for whites is also abhorrent, its obvious he just wants whites to be more &quot;tolerant&quot;, &quot;accepting&quot;, &quot;altrusitic&quot; and open to the Nonwhite world. The the fact that Mr. Diamond is Jewish is no concidence, I urge all readers here to read &quot;The Culture of Critique&quot; chapter 2 where Kevin Macdonald discusses how and why so many of the leading race-deniers/radical environmentalists have been Jews. Starting with Boas in anthropoloy all the way up to Diamond,Gould and Montagu Jewish social scientists have primarily been concerned with trying to squash white ethnocentrism by supporting movements that support racial egalitarianism and enviromentalist theories (of course not all have been Jewish, likewise many Jews have helped sociobiology, this is just a generalization). BUT science is moving on, sociobiology has been vindicated, and the biological basis for human behavior and racial differences is becoming more and more accepted by specialists everyday. Even though the public may be ignorant of the real research for political reasons, that won't change the fact that sociobiology and Jensenism will be vindicated. I suspect that once these theories of human behavior become more and more accpeted by scientists, the popular media/leftists/radical envrionmentalists will lanuch a full scale attack to supress it. You know the sciencitific zietigiest is poor when a book gets the &quot;pultizer prize&quot; for basically spewing &quot;feel good&quot; scientific theories that have absolutely NO basis in fact or research( Mr. Daimond denies sixty years of research into mental and physical differences between the Races, and amazingly makes no attempt WHATSOEVER to refute anyone of them. The current theories are as vindicated, as the theory that earth goes around the sun) . In the end science, doesn't wait for anybody, for political extremism, bias or dogma when sociobiology and Jensenism get pubilcy vindicated, people and socieites will have to start over and build according to the CORRECT view of human nature.

This denial of good or bad. This gray area that can be no other than the moral philosophy of some murderer or thief. And if you look even deeper, perhaps you will see the horror and degeneration of the modern world in this religion of gray area, heralded by a corrupt academia and their culture of hate, driven by their own special interests and not by those of man.I am not some cultural racist, some white supremacist, these ideas of moral philosophy that I value so highly come not from northern Europe, but from Italy during the renaissance in the works of Michelangelo and Dante and from Israel during the time of Christ, and who knows perhaps from Egypt or Persia before then.

And I care not what race it is when I see evilness and not good - such as when I see savage cannibalism abandoned for ritual cannibalism but a few years later in New Guinea.What geographical boundary is it that prevented knowledge of the written word, which need pass only once?

(Yes, New Guinea--the same country in which cannibalism is believed to still go on in some areas.) Here's the gist of the author's argument: Europe's dominance of the world was almost solely an accident of geography; Europe had more natural resources (both plant and animal) than any other continent, and even people stupider than New Guineans couldn't have screwed it up.While there is no doubt that Europe has been blessed with a favorable climate, good soils and plentiful wildlife, the same can be said for many other regions (such as North America, Australia and even West Africa), and Diamond's attempt to explain the difference between them left me unconvinced. Diamond's theory also completely fails to explain the success of Japan--a country that possesses few natural resources. In short, this is a classic case of a guy using selective data to prove a questionable point. Probably not worth your money."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Why did European civilization become dominant? The author thinks it has to do with animals, plants, trees, dirt, and rocks. It's because of the environment he believes. As if it was only the Europeans who lived in a suitable environment. How does this explain then the ancient civilization of Mohenjo-daro in the Indus River valley, which had underground plumbing and was a highly advanced society more than 4000 years ago? What about the Inca empire? The Incas developed their own highly advanced culture despite their climate. They also created such marvels as Macchu Picchu and Cuzco. Also, what about China? China invented countless number of things (right now I cannot remember which though). Moreover, when the Aztecs were at their prime Europe was in the dark ages-- the church was ruling Europe with an iron hand and burning people at the stake who didn't accept holy doctrines. (Look up the word &quot;Inquisition&quot; for further information). There were plenty of civiliztions who had scientific know-how back then. Why, then, does the author believe that it was only the European CLIMATE which had anything to do with their technology or culture? Well, obviously he's not looking at the whole picture.During the Renaissance, people in Europe continued what the philosophers of Athens started over a thousand years earlier: SCIENCE, PHILOSOPHY and DEMOCRACY! The author believes that since people in Europe had domesticated animals they should be masters of the univerivse! I guess domesticated animals equal Roman Empire or something! During the middle ages though we had domesticated animals, however, they didn't seem to help us any, because we were still toiling in the fields of our feudal lords! Now, are you gonna tell me it was the livestock's idea for the Renaissance? It couldn't have been. Thus, it must've been something else! Could it not have been that people were curious about their world?The Greek physician Hippocrates laid the foundations of scientific medicine by freeing medical study from the constraints of philosophical speculation and superstition. Aristotle, the pupil of Plato, and the tutor of Alexander the Great, and the author of works on logic, metaphysics, ethics, natural sciences, politics, and poetics, profoundly influenced Western thought. In his philosophical system theory follows empirical observation and logic, based on the syllogism, is the essential method of rational inquiry.

This is true.What Jared has missed is natural selection... that 5,000 years of living in a more complex social environment has meant that the Europeans advanced genetically as their environment advanced. The europeans who survived, were the more intelligent, the more social, more politically machaivellian and the more immune ones.It is a chicken-and-egg situation. Jared refuse to aknowledge that other racial groups (such as africans) stopped evolving because their culture and environment stayed the same and didn't drive change.Or, to put it another way, Africans today are just as stupid as europeans were 5,000 years ago. But European society kept changing and this has forced people to advance too.This book is politically correct half-truths and polemic that is tedious to read and fails to follow through to its logical conclusions."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"With a growing body of scientific literature citing possible mental differences between the races, Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel seeks to put the race-genie back in the bottle by offering a positive account for the disparate achievement of races in terms of geography. Thus, Diamond takes an immediate step in the wrong direction. Rather than trying to explain human culture in terms of human biology, he dismisses any such notion as &quot;loathsome&quot;, and proceeds to tell us that geography is the one and only factor for the rise of the West in art, science, literature and the rest of the panoply of modernity. In other words, don't credit Shakespeare for King Lear or Newton for Calculus, credit the barley and oats, the fertile land and bountiful hills they lived in. Despite the implausibility of such a theory, Diamond's book is much more cogent than other egalitarian tracts like the Mismeasure of Man and the History and Geography of Human Genes since it has a definite thesis with clear and useful implications. Unfortunately for Diamond this is also his undoing, since the racialist worldview can account for much more of the empirical world than the geographic thesis can. In the final chapter of his book Diamond states, in no uncertain terms, that if any other group had been similarly situated in Europe they would have gone on to replicate the achievements of the Caucasoid race. It is my contention that this claim is untenable and should be abandoned in favor of the racialist thesis.Refuting Diamond's thesis does not require pointing out any factual inaccuracies in the work, anymore than challenging the Marxian interpretation of history requires denying that the feudal system gave way to an industrial one. The hallmark of a scientific theory lies in its predictive value and to the extent Theory A explains less than Theory B puts Theory A into question. The scientific method follows the logic of Ockham's razor which impels us toward clarity and simplicity. In summing the idea of Ockham's razor Frederick Copleston offers a useful illustration: &quot;That it is by experience that we come to know that one thing is the cause of another is, of course, a common-sense position. So, for the matter of that, is Ockham's idea of the test which should be applied in order to ascertain whether A, B, or C is the cause of D or whether we have to accept a plurality of causes. If we find that when A is present D always follows, even when B and C are absent, and that when B and C are present but A is absent D never follows, we must take it that A is the cause of D.&quot; Good. Now, let's make the example more concrete and assign values to the variables, so let A (genes), B (geography), C (political discrimination, and D (observed race differences). It is now a simple empirical test to see if observed race differences are due to A, B, or C. A few obsevations are in order: 1) Africa is the poorest part of the planet, has high infant mortality rates, loose pair-bonding and no history of intellectual achievement or sustainable civilization. Africans who live in the United States also have high infant mortality rates, loose pair-bonding, high poverty rates, and are virtually absent in jobs requiring technical knowledge. 2) Europeans who live in the United States are wealthy, tend to have stable marriages, commit few crimes, and constitute the bulk of intellectual achievement in the arts, sciences and literature. Since the United States does not have the geography of either Europe or Africa, why do the identical traits characteristic of Europeans and Africans persist? 3) During the late 18th century Haiti was one of the richest parts of the new world. The French had installed roads, bridges, an irrigation system and was one of the the principal trading partners in the Caribbean. After a mulatto led rebellion in 1804 Haiti has been ruled by blacks, and is now the poorest country in the western hemisphere. Haiti is 95% black and has a life-expectancy of 53 years, similar to other African nations like Nigeria. If it is geography that determines the civilization of a people, why did Haiti change so drastically after it came under the management of Africans? Now, which theory has more explanatory power, Diamond's model which predicts that geography largely determines the characer of a people, or the racialist model which claims that biology plays a key role? It is obvious. Consider another realistic scenario: After South Africa continues its policy of bi-racial integration and white flight continues, what will be the result? It is clear what the racialist model predicts (it is happening now), but what does Diamond's model predict? And why? So why should anyone seriously consider Diamond's &quot;scientific&quot; theory when it has no predictive value. And why should anyone reject the racialist model when it retains its explanatory force across continents and time?In accordance with Ockham's razor it is clear that an explanation that appeals to geography or political discrimination is illogical and unscientific. So until racial egalitarianism is observed or until supporting evidence is forthcoming I will continue to adopt the skeptics credo: I will believe it when I see it. The curtain is down, egalitarianism must rank as the greatest hoax of the 20th century.

The nature of African geography led Bantu expansion to the more clement weather of the South. This is one of the fascinating counter-factuals that Diamond uses to illustrate his case for geographic and biologcal determinism in human history. The Fertile Crescent and the Southern Steppes of Russia providentially had most of the plants and animals most easily domisticated - wheat for example is the best cereal and the horse is the most useful for warfare. Strangely, Diamond does not draw attention to the obvious factor of the Mediterranean as a highway for commerce and ideas, but he does show that at the beginning of the modern era, Europe was best positioned to conquer the other continents for demographic, geographic and general biological reasons, not for reasons of racial superiority."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"After reading the first chapter, I had a feeling that this would be a very interesting book, and I was right.

As he shows, there's only a few places in the world that had grains and animals with the potential to be domesticated. Further, that cultures that hadn't domesticated animals became lethally susceptible to animal/human diseases for which they'd developed no resistance.He may have gone a little overboard in hammering home the point that less &quot;advanced&quot; human populations are not that way because they're somehow inherently less intelligent--but then, there WAS an awful lot of attention paid to &quot;The Bell Curve&quot; (demolished as a scientific argument by Gould's second edition of &quot;The Mismeasure of Man&quot;).Anyway, a terrific book and worthy of the Pulitzer it was awarded."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"A great work of how and where and when it all came together.

It is also a very important book, one bound to generate (as it already has) considerable debate and more research. On the one hand, it deftly exposes pseudoscientific and racist arguments about how some people were able to conquer other people; on the other, it offers a cogent account, with plenty of evidence from different fields (linguistics, anthropology, genetics, botany, and zoology, among others), of how the world came to be what it is since the last glaciation (i.e., about 12,000 years ago). As Paul Ehrlich said, it's a 'whirlwind tour' of world history, but one worth taking.In this book, Diamond is primarily interested in ultimate, not proximate, causes. His main argument is simplicity itself: some people were at the right time and the right place to harness whatever nature gave them--and, as a consequence, were able to end up with several advantages over those people they eventually conquered. Evidently, the biogeography of plants and animals was different on every continent and played a crucial role in the development of human history; Eurasia, for example, had more plants and animals that could be domesticated just because its large size guaranteed large numbers to experiment with, whereas, say, Australia, due to its relative isolation and aridity, had almost nothing to offer to those who settled there. Eurasian people, therefore, were able to abandon their nomadic lifestyle early and settle in large groups that would allow them to develop the necessary guns, germs, and steel to conquer other people.Although the main argument of 'Guns, germs, and steel' is convincing, I found that towards the end the book becomes repetitive. The last chapter is particularly disappointing because, instead of elaborating his initial argument of how to treat history in more scientific terms, Diamond ends up saying things he already mentioned throughout the book, and adds nothing to what other people (e.g., Ernst Mayr) have said on the subject. That chapter could have rounded up the book very nicely; instead, it exposes the book to very serious criticism. I also question the many plates with pictures of representatives of different human 'races' because they really don't add anything to what the book is talking about (those plates would have been more appropriate in his previous book, 'The third chimpanzee'). Despite this, however, I highly recommend this otherwise excellent book to anyone interested in human history and to those keen on battling racist views."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"If all men are created equal, then why are some cultures so much more technologically and economically advanced than others?Racists have always made me feel uneasy becuase, while I have never been impressed by their attitudes, I have also felt powerless to change them.This book was my first exposure to an explanation of cultural inequity founded -- ultimately -- on something other than race.If your tribe lives in a land with a mild climate and fertile soil, with plants and animals that can be domesticated, you will do better over time than a tribe that lives in a less favorable place. If your society is geographically isolated, you will be invaded less (and thus have less incentive to invent new technologies to defend yourself), but you will also have fewer opportunities to trade goods and knowledge: your society will progress more slowly than one more exposed to (and connected to) others.I am not a cultural anthropologist nor am I a serious student of social issues, so I cannot comment on the sholarly worthiness of this book.However, as a curious layman, I found this to be an extraordinarily illuminating book, not least as a commentary on the the overwhelming influence of context on outcomes."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Anyone suggesting they could encompass all human history in a mere 400 pages should be met with derisive scorn. Diamond, against all logic, has accomplished this feat, and done it admirably. The question, 'why do white people have so much and black people so little?', is a valid query of increasing importance. In responding, he describes how humans developed agriculture, domesticated animals and attained a sedentary life. This change from a nomadic hunter-gatherer society led to new diseases. Immunity to them was later gained only over the passage of time. Utilization of natural resources lead to utilization of natural resources to create superior weapons, allowing settled peoples to become imperialists, an anachronism considered logically.He anticipates the criticism of 'geographical determinism' certain to be raised, but his case remains based on several grand geophysical concepts. He starts with the idea that the East- West axis of Eurasia gave that region many advantages of temperate climate and easy mobility, as opposed to the Americas' North-South orientation. He continues with an assessment of the native fauna of various regions for the likelihood of domestication. Although little cultural is discussed here, he describes how small bands of humans grew to villages then larger agglomerations leading to 'kleptocracies' [a wonderful term!] in which wealth was no longer evenly distributed. Such a social structure led to the rise of nation-states which could engage in greater imperialist enterprises.While Diamond portrays humanity's movements around the globe, some aspects clearly require further explanation. He stipulates that the Americas could have been populated in less than a millennia. What prompted such a rapid expansion if game foods were readily available? He describes the barriers to cultural exchange throughout Mesoamerica, such as beasts of burden in the Andes never being merged with Mayan wheels and crops raised successfully in one area being unsuitable in another. What drove humans over the isthmus to another continent? Did people really move so rapidly over vastly differing environments while losing communication with their points of origin?In keeping to his broad-brush approach, Diamond avoids cultural issues until the Epilogue. Only then does he raise Christianity and Islam as imperialist societies in contrast with other cultures. It was astonishing to discover that, in the last analysis, Diamond fails to answer the very question that resulted in this book. This is not a failure on his part. He impressively covers the 'how' of social structures and their impact on what seems to be a natural tendency for humans to migrate. Yet, his original question addresses European expansion to other, already occupied, lands. Having already absolved capitalism as the motivation, it is surprising that he ignores the role of Christianity in European imperialism. Diamond may be forgiven for avoiding this issue since his analysis focuses on the environmental benefits Eurasians enjoyed before beginning their global conquest. But European expansion has had such an impact on world cultures that motivation requires a more fervent appeal for resolution than the mild query found at the close of the book. Still, we can't address that question properly without the background Diamond has provided.His call for further study is welcome for many reasons. Anyone involved in international programs will find this book a useful resource. It dispels many commonly-held myths still held even by professionals who deal with 'Third World' countries. A careful reader will see questions posed in a new framework and take note of these to their benefit. His description of the vast ranges of human movement must now be considered in light of the world's current trend to balkanization. Now that we have nowhere to go, in what direction will that heritage of continuous movement take us? Read Diamond to provide the necessary background, then ask yourself these and related questions. It's well worth the time, and reading him is not a strenuous task."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"When I find a book particularly compeling, I prefer to read the reviews that pan the book to see what other people think. I guess I can sum up the 1-star reviews into roughly 3 camps (although of course this summary is biased and not comprehensive):1) &quot;This book is BORING! Can I go out to play now?&quot; or &quot;He doesn't write well. Why does he keep repeating himself?&quot;2) Diamond is a PC liberal left-leaning commie pinko who hates white people. Isn't it obvious we're just smarter?3) Diamond's models can't account for China/Incas/Hitler/Einstein/take your pick of historical event.In my opinion...1) Criticism 1 is a matter of personal taste, which is what reviews are for, so I guess I can't really comment.2) Diamond is PC: I find these types of criticism the most annoying. It is a completely empty criticism that is about as helpful as someone saying that Bill Bennett is a Nazi. But some people seem to take offense that Diamond even raises the question of proximal causes of European preeminence. By raising these questions no one is necessarily denigrating European culture or society. In fact, Diamond goes to great lengths to show how displacement and genocide have happened to groups throughout the world throughout history, committed by groups from all parts of the world. I thought he was emphasizing, for good or ill, our common humanity. If suggesting that Europeans have common humanity with everyone else is too demeaning and PC to some people, I think that reaction speaks for itself.3) Several people have pointed out that Diamond's central thesis, thumbnailed as geography is destiny, is inadequate for a lot of questions. Sure it is. But I'm sure Diamond would admit that no one theory or set of ideas could explain all of history. In some sense, I think he was suggesting at the end of his book that this work is a brave early attempt at trying to use more &quot;hard&quot; scientific parameters (such as zoology, botany, geology, etc.) in the study of broad patterns of human history. Also, Diamond is careful to couch his arguments in very broad, sweeping terms, which is what most of the focus of his argument is about. He discusses &quot;Eurasians&quot; as compared to &quot;Americans&quot; or &quot;Australians&quot;; many of the criticisms expressed by people here are speaking of events and arguments that are far more specific than that. Of course others have worked on this as well, but this book is at least something of a breakthrough because Diamond has managed to articulate very interesting ideas to a lay audience.One doesn't, of course, have to agree with Diamond on everything, but I do think that a lot of the negative feedback here either missed the point of the book or was criticizing it for what it was not intended to be."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"..at least when it comes to history and the human development..If you have ever wondered \\"Why the societies today are the way they are; some highly advanced while others still very basic?\\", \\"Why Africa become black?\\", \\"Why the female nomads only have a child every four year\\" or even \\"Why haven't the zebra been domesticated?\\" then \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" is the book for you.\\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" binds the story of mankind, the most recent 13000 years of human existence together in less than 500 pages. Well done!Diamond is not a historian; he explores human prehistory from a scientific standpoint. His theory is that the development of civilization and technology came essentially as a result to four factors; 1) the availability of animals and plants to be domesticated (tough luck if the seeds you had were adapted to a different altitude or longitude that you were on, or if the only animals around were dangerous or not economically feasible to domesticate such as hippopotamus or the koala bear), 2) the ease with which the domestication can be relocated (again, the adaptability of the animals or seeds, going east to west was obviously easier than to go from north to south due to similar climates/altitudes at the same longitude), 3) isolation (transfer of knowledge between countries and continents), and 4) the size of the population (more people, more brains, higher chance of someone coming up with something smart).Diamond's basic thesis does have some validity, although I was often left with the feeling that we were only presented with the information that proved the authors point. By building his arguments backwards from the outcome, Diamond could easily defend his theory. I feel that Diamond ignores too many important issues that really need to be considered, in order to make his theory complete. For instance, the absence of any form of acknowledgment for that *pure luck* ought to have played a significant role in where we ended up, and second, that the author completely eliminates the human factor. For example China chose to isolate itself, thereby loosing the technological advantage it had acquired. That had absolutely nothing to do with geography. By ignoring factors such as the human variables, I believe Diamond has significantly twisted the history of human progress.Having dashed out a fair bit of criticism, I must admit that I enjoyed very much reading this book. Diamond knows a whole lot about a whole lot of things, and while reading this book I had many \\"Aha! So that's why!!\\" or \\"Really? Interesting!!\\" - moments.. I learned a lot from this book, and I will for sure cite this book in the future!I do recommend it to any reader whom wants to better understand the world we have inherited. Just remember that this book presents us with one side of the coin. A coin has two sides, so has the story of human history and development."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Diamond's work here is of a fundamental nature. He's asking a few simple questions--Why have European peoples dominated the world? What makes them different, and why weren't they dominated instead by other groups? Jared's answer? They were just lucky. They were in the right place at the right time with the right resources to accomplish an eventual empire and dominion over most of the world.An awful lot of reviewers on this site have disavowed this answer as too simplistic--too biased. However, their criticisms miss the point entirely.A common claim among these reviewers is: You can't rule out societal influences--the human, cultural factors of the rise of civilizations. Certainly, Diamond never makes the case in Guns Germs and Steel that cultural factors play no role in the development of civilizations. Instead, he's stating that the culture of industrialized nations had to arise due to the circumstances unique to their area. Diamond is discarding the idea that people are somehow different mentally from one another--that there is some sort of cognitive difference, or an inherent difference in core thinking from one group of people to the next. Culture is not spontaneous. Our mores and thinking are the results of coping with our respective environments. The social aspects of a society are formed in response to environmental limitations. To claim otherwise is to fall into the trap of racial determinism. Diamond makes the case convincingly that race does not determine culture. Even the racial distinctions of humanity are adaptations to local environments!The naysaying reviewers on this subject may be well-read, even educated people, yet, they show a considerable lack of understanding of Diamond's ideas. My guess is that they disliked the book before even reading it and simply scanned through it looking for weaknesses to attack. It's not a surprise really. Daily I meet people who read voraciously and yet never grasp what they have read nor care to understand the world around them that they study so intently. Ideas are not thought provoking to them, only obstacles to their worldview.Diamond asks great questions and provides convincing answers. I can't ask for much more from any author. His Pullitzer is well deserved."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I just want to point out that some of the reviewers on Amazon who gave this book very low reviews don't seem to have actually read it. To use an example, one guy says, \\"he doesn't explain why north america, with its great farmland, didn't develop super crops!\\" What? There's a qhole stinking chapter devoted to that question! Oy. Read the book, people, THEN write the review. If you still don't agree, counter the argument that's actually in the book!The pros of the book far outweigh its cons, especially in terms of the thorough history of writing (which I greatly enjoyed) as well as the chapters on plant and animal domestication.But negatives there are. I feel he is overzealous (he's demolishing a racist view of history that's been out of vogue for decades) and sometimes condescending and repetitive in his writing style. Some parts are a pleasure to read, other parts are tiresome, and there is a distinct 'PC' feel to the book, especially when he offers the questionable thesis in the beginning that New Guineans are smarter, on average, than the people reading his book. In general, it's when he goes off on these random tangents that the book loses its appeal and you end up rolling your eyes."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"As a evolutionary biologist I found Guns, Germs and Steel an excellent read and very thought provoking. As some of the few critics have pointed out, some of his ideas are not new. What is new is that Diamond was able to bring all these ideas together and synthesize them into something quite new and fasinating. The development of human cultures was surely influenced by geography and environment. Diamond has given an incredibly well thought out explanation and theory. The book might seem to some a bit long, perhaps repetitive, but I found it engrossing. It provoked thought (it now makes sense why native Americans were so suseptible to European diseases and not so much the reverse!), overturned my previously held beliefs and meshed human biology and history very well. A must read for biologists, historians, and the general public. And as to the rare reviewer who suggests the book is 'politically correct', from most of their reviews, I have gotten the feeling they hate it because it threatens their closely held world views. All the more reason it deserves the accolades it has received!"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Imagine my surprise when I found out that this book, which I'd been looking forward to reading for so long, isn't a science book at all. It's more of a convoluted political treatise in which the author uses every trick in the book to support his beliefs. He makes completely false statements, omits even the most obvious arguments refuting his position, passes off his poorly formed opinions as fact, and uses some of the most tortured logic I've ever had the misfortune to read.But you're saying the same thing I did when I read the few negative reviews of GG&S;: Who is this guy to criticize Jared Diamond? So let me give you some concrete examples of what I mean.I think my favorite statement in this book, because the author managed to achieve absurdity on so many different levels with it, is that kids today are getting dumber because they watch too much TV.Let's examine that for a moment. First, the fundamental assumption is flat wrong. Average performances on IQ tests (the best measure at this point) have been rising since the test was first administered. If you don't believe me, look it up--it's called the Flynn Effect. Now, normally, a statement this odd would have sent me scrambling to the footnotes, but there are none. Undoubtedly because they would interfere with Diamond's ability to just make stuff up.Second, because we have the historical test numbers and we know the dates for the invention and proliferation of television, we can see that there is no correlation with IQ. And finally (okay, I admit to being a bit snarky here) they made a TV show out of this book. Why do I think Diamond would except that particular program from his hypothesis?We then have his now vaguely infamous and typically unsupported idea that the people of New Guinea are smarter than Europeans because they live in a more violent and dangerous society which selects for intelligence as opposed to European society which tended to select for disease resistance.While I recognize that this kind of reverse racism is the holy grail of the politically correct \\"scientist\\", there's a reason why thinkers much more weighty that Diamond won't touch this subject with a ten foot pole. If we accept Diamond's theory, how long until someone points out that survival in dangerous, violent societies probably selects physically strong, violent people over intelligent ones? Think of it this way: If you had to hire someone to carry your life savings across Somalia on foot, would you choose A: the captain of your high school chess club, or B: a former Navy SEAL in prison for beating a guy to death with a tire iron? So now we're suddenly suggesting that certain races are more prone to violence than others. Oops.Diamond's proof for the fact that some societies domesticated plants and animals while others didn't seems to revolve around the fact that that we still haven't. So, for instance, because we still haven't domesticated the bison, it follows that it's impossible. No consideration is given to the fact that bison range pretty well without domestication and that cattle are so cheap, tasty, and plentiful, there's no real point. He also holds up the fact that recent efforts to domesticate the eland in Africa \\"have not caught on.\\" I spend a lot of time in Africa, and let me tell you that the failure of the Africans to achieve something in no way means it's impossible.Probably the most entertaining of Diamond's arguments on this subject, though, is his contention that a breeding program designed to genetically diversify the endangered California condor has produced no economically useful product. Why he would expect a program charged with creating a better wild animal to produce a domesticated one, I have no idea.The examples go on an on. It was so bad that I began to question even the interesting sections that rang true to me--such as the scientific description of how plants are domesticated. I constantly wondered if he was leaving out certain species and methods that were available to the aboriginals in order to further his deterministic philosophy.If you (completely understandably) find this review unconvincing and are about to press the \`buy' button, I'd suggest that you also purchase Victor Hanson's \\"Carnage and Culture\\" which was written to refute GG&S.; Or at least listen to Diamond's debate with Hanson on NPR, (http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1132838.) You'll be amazed at how every time Diamond throws out one of his theories, Hanson is able to disprove it so simply and convincingly that Diamond doesn't even bother to argue. And this is despite the fact that Hanson is obviously trying to softball his responses in an effort to not make Diamond look like and idiot on national radio.Finally, a word on the Pulitzer. I was so amazed by the fact that GG&S; won, I looked up who votes on these prizes. Turns out it's a basically a bunch of journalists--not scientists or even people knowledgeable in the field. Explains a lot..."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I read this book when it first came out. I'm very interested in pre-history and the relationship with the evolution of man and the environment, and a fan or former Diamond books. I read it and I liked it. It is well done.Why am I reviewing it now? Because more and more as I read magazine articles, histories, discussions of global warming and avian flu, Diamond's book and the theoretical framework he develops is referenced.Diamond's thesis is that the wide trends of human history were heavily influenced (determined is too strong a word) by geographic and environmental factors. He draws on the theory of Island Biogeography (read Song of the Dodo for a great popular account) to say that people on the large Eurasian landmass had intrinsic advantages over those on the other continents, including exposure to germs that strengthened their immune systems, lots of domesticable plants and animals etc.Not everyone agrees with this analysis, but everyone is having to react to it.The obvious criticisms of the theory are that it is applying a backwards pattern on historical expediency and deriving inevitability. It also has been seen by a few as yet another attempt to justify the unique position of Europeans and their descendents in the world...with all the possible related racism thereby \\"excused\\".

First, text-to-speech is DISABLED. Second, significant figures, particular maps, are entirely missing. Finally, several tables are impossible to read. For example, Table 18-1 would be a very interesting comparison of many of the issues discussed in the book and would serve as a convenient way to tie several themes together, but it's presented in two chunks that don't fit together.Bottom line: check it out from your local library.

As such, it opens one's mind in thinking broadly about all humans as a whole rather than having a narrow minded view and a clan based mentality. It makes you more compassionate and more understanding of other civilizations, and it makes a solid foundation for a lifetime of learning in this subject. In summary, it makes the reader a more well rounded and a better person as a whole. That is why I think it should be a required reading in every high school curriculum."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Whenever I read a book that I really like, I always check out the bibliography to see if there are other books on the subject that I might like to read. I pay special attention to books that are specifically mentioned in the text of whatever book I am reading. Lately, one title has come up over and over, \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\". I read it when it was published in 1997. Because so many authors are using it in their research, I decided that it was time to read it again.Rereading this book was a pleasure. Enough time has passed since my first reading, that I experienced those \\"aha\\" moments again. Moments when what the author is saying is so clear and makes so much sense that I find myself wondering why I have never looked at the subject in that light before. His thesis is very simple. The reason that Eurasian peoples conquered and colonized the world was not because they were smarter than the so-called primitive societies that they encountered. Instead, the reason was simply that they had more plants and animals in their environment that were suitable for domestication which led to population increases which led to more people to come up with technological inventions such as the writing and sophisticated weapons.Peoples lacking enough plants and animals in their environment that were suitable for domestication either got a later start at food production and technology or never moved beyond the hunter-gatherer stage. Which is not to say that they were any less intelligent. My favorite anecdote is about two English explorers who perished while attempting to traverse the outback of Australia, an area where the aboriginal tribes had been able to find enough food and water to survive with no problem for thousands of years.And while it is true that many conquered peoples died from the diseases that were introduced by Europeans, those same Europeans died of tropical diseases at the same rates until 20th century medicine was able to overcome them.It's no surprise that this book has become a classic.

My first impression was that Diamond adequately explains differences between the wealth of peoples across the world, applying research from many academic disciplines to reinforce his theories. I felt that Diamond produced a theory that successfully dismisses racist ideas on the differences between people. An accessible and enjoyable read, with conclusions i believe should not be dismissed easily. Perhaps critics of his work have ideological as opposed to scientific disagreements with his work.

His book is both ludicrously ambitious in its goal and thoroughly pragmatic in its approach: to tell the history of the world of the past 15'000 years, with a twist. The twist being his angle on things we thought we'd heard before. Like for instance the way the Spaniards overtook the Inca Empire, which Diamond makes boil down to habitat, climate, square mile per person and geology, rather than culture, religion, races or other sophistications. Civilization, for Diamond, is the consequence of many natural and physical causes he's arduously trying to figure out. Arduously, because he sometimes takes 30 pages to demonstrate something the average reader I am already realized after one paragraph. The academic that Diamond is shines through the thinker he's striving to be. Reading GGS is arguably as thought-provoking as \\"Why I ate my father\\", without the humour though."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Jared Diamond is no genius, but his argument is coherent, convincing, and timely. He brings scientific expertise and outside perspectives from the realms of botany, zoology, geography, and anthropology to the field of history. The theory of environmental determinism which he generally supports is nothing new, and many have elaborated on it before, but his global scope and willingness to reach back into prehistory for evidence is commendable. A very readable and important book, but with a mediocre writing style and a somewhat sloppy and unfocused structure, I don't believe it deserved the Pulitzer prize.

However, it lacks the &quot;a-ha&quot; moment. There is very little in this book that will surprise the reasonably erudite reader. And for those who actually believe that the last 500 years of history are testament to the inherent superiority of Western Europeans, It is unlikely that they will read this or any other book requiring more than a rudimentary education.What especially concerns me is the future of this book in a world of literalist Biblical interpretation, to which we seem to be headed in some parts of this country. Where is the place for descriptions of population movements 100,000 years ago when we are taught the universe is only 10,000 (or 6,000 to some) years old? How can one describe Ice Ages and their hindrance on human movement and not Noah's flood? How can one trace the spread of languages without mentioning the Tower of Babel? None of these questions poses a problem unless one insists on the literal truth of Genesis.

Of course the &quot;nature vs. nurture&quot; argument has to appear in some reviews. I feel Diamond does a good job of controlling for the influence of biology in examples such as the Austronesian expansion in the Pacific. Given the virtually identical genetic stock and the clear correlation between geography and society in the Pacific it is hard to see how people can go on churning out the old arguments on genetic superiority.

That's not to say that geography is not still destiny on an individual level, but this is not discussed in the book. The book, by the way, IS repetitive, as other readers have pointed out.

Diamond is much less convincing when he moves to historic times and tries to explain differential performance within a given continent. The second half of the book describe individual continents and is quite tedious, but there is no need to read this section unless you have special interests in a particular region.The first half or the book is so interesting and thoughtful so it is a must read.Btw, do not buy the DVD with Diamond, it is quite dull. The book is much better."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This is a truly profound book, and quite elegantly written. The central insight is how geography has been a main driving factor in the development of civilizations. Diamond comes at this thesis from several different angles, most importantly after looking at how development has differed between different regions.Diamond builds a very compelling argument, and is helped by his intimate knowledge of many places - knowledge which comes from actually having spent quite a deal of traveling. He is also helped by his diverse background - as a scientist he has also written two brilliant books on biology (The Third Chimpanzee: The Evolution and Future of the Human Animal (P.S.)&Why Is Sex Fun?: The Evolution Of Human Sexuality (Science Masters)).This is popular science at its best, easily understandable, yet deep in insight."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"It took me a while to open this book, as I was absolutely convinced that, with a title like Guns, Germs and Steel, the subject could only be war. Eventually, however, I opened the book, and was absolutely fascinated by it. The premise of the book is Yali's question. Yali, a native of New Guinea, has never been out of his country, is \\"Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?\\"The answer to this question takes about 430 pages of very interesting reading, going back to the rise and spread of food production, from food to guns, germs and steel, around the world in 5 chapters. The writer, Jared Diamond delves into pre-history, how and why the nomadic hunter/gatherers became more stationary, and started to form villages, and what effect that had on their way of life. What is necessary to sustain villages. The advance of specialisation. Why some areas were more susceptible to change than others. The geographic climate that helped or hindered.As I say, this is a very interesting book, and one that will long live with you. However, it is perhaps rather hard reading, insofar as it is written probably for college students. It is not a book that should be read in a hurry, but should be savoured."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Its been a few years since I first read this, and since then a few things started to stick in my craw.Specifically, I'm afraid that Diamond is creating an apologetic treatise on European ethnic cleansing. He says that the Native Americans died because they didn't have resistance to western diseases.That may be true, but a few points need to be addressed to avoid making apologies for genocide.First, when Europeans encountered these diseases for the first time, the mortality rates where no where near what they were for the Native Americans.Second, he never discussed the fact that disease is a function of famine, and that the Native Americans died soon after being driven from the most fertile lands - often on death marches.It seems criminally irresponsible to me not to address these points. What would happen to a German author wrote that the victims of the Nazis died mostly from disease and not primarily due to Nazi policies? In fact, most did die from disease, including Ann Frank and her family who died from TB.Another thing I hate is that he refuses to consider obvious alternatives to his theories of animal domestication. He claims that all animals that could be domesticated are. His circular reasoning states this must be true since non domesticated animals aren't domesticated, and no new animals have been domesticated for a few thousand years.But he forgets the opportunity cost argument found in economics. It could just as easily be true that the effort to domesticate an animal won't be expended because a suitable alternative already exists. I.e. if I domesticate a zebra to be like a horse, it might take many years, a lot of labor and money. If there were no competing products (i.e. horses), such a massive expenditure might have paid off in the end. It's the same reason we don't drive electric cars. The cost and time associated with making them scale economically must compete against the fact that we have already have an economical (though not ecologically) alternative - gas powered cars."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I'd wondered for a long time why certain aspects of history that you learn as facts in school turned out the way they did, e.g. why European diseases basically wiped out Native Americans but not vice-versa. I bought the book because I heard that Jared Diamond answered these types of questions. He does, to an extent. At the very least, he gives convincing arguments for why history turned out the way it did based on the traits of geographic regions. The best part about having read this book is that now I feel like I can open a world map and use it to explain to someone why Eurasia came to dominate the world and not people from somewhere else. The argument is speculation, but it's convincing and sound enough for my satisfaction. In that way, it's exactly what I wanted.The only problem isn't in the content; it's in the fact that Diamond just didn't write a perfect book around that content, so I'll give him four stars instead of five. If it had been about two-thirds the length, it might have been perfect. Instead, I sometimes got the feeling that Diamond was thinking, \\"I've made a really great point here, and it's done, but if I talked about this example for a few more pages this book would look nice and fat wedged into the shelf at the bookstore.\\" Nevertheless, my questions did get answered, and overall I recommend this to anyone who wants a geographic perspective on historic trends."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Jared Diamond is a professor of physiology at the UCLA School of Medicine, he expanded into evolutionary biology and biogeography. This book attempts to explain why certain parts of the world became predominant given the basic equality of humanity (p.16). Diamond questions whether \\"civilization\\" is better (p.18). It brings a longer life span, less murder, better medical care, etc. Are \\"Stone Age\\" peoples more intelligent than industrialized peoples (p.19)? [The former are not misinformed by the corporate media.] There is a difference between densely populated societies and sparsely populated societies (p.21). \\"History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among peoples' environments, not because of biological differences among the peoples themselves\\" (p.23). When Diamond talks about modern events you can see his faults. The Cuban Missile Crisis was in 1962 (p.279). There was no \\"isolationism\\" in the US as per the Briand-Kellogg Pact (p.412). That problem of \\"China's unity\\" is really the faults of any monopoly (p.413). That applies to the transistor as well (p.417).The basis for development is to produce enough food to support craft specialists who develop technologies. This leads to governments, large nations, armies, wars of conquest, navies, and fleets for colonies. Diamond identifies several groups of environmental factors to explain the history of the world for the past 13,000 years (p.31). Can a single book provide all the answers? There was a huge change in human capabilities about fifty to a hundred millenia ago (p.40). [The simplest explanation for the demise of animals is the consumption of their eggs and young by humans (p.43).] Chapter 2 tells about the Maori invasion of the Chatham Islands in December 1835. They exterminated the Moriori people (p.53). This shows how environments affect human societies (p.54). Diamond compares Polynesian societies to show the effects of the environment (p.58). The population had the same ancestral society yet their cultural differences are explained by their varying environment (p.65).Chapter 4 explains why agriculture and livestock are the foundation for human advancement. Both require more labor than in hunting-gathering societies (p.105). Livestock that give milk provide more calories than from a slaughtered animal. Vegetables and animals are adapted to the climate by latitude (p.184). Diseases limited the range of domesticated animals (pp.186-187). Diseases are spread by livestock and pet animals (Chapter 11). Until WW II diseases killed more soldiers than battle (p.197). European cities had a higher death rate than rural villages before the 20th century (p.205). Writing transmits knowledge with accuracy, quantity, and detail (Chapter 12). Is Diamond correct about Iraqi literacy (p.216)? Weren't Europeans more advanced in nuclear science (p.225)?Diamond's comments about inventions are wrong or misleading (p.243). Otto invented his engine to provide power from a waste product from oil refining (p.247). Henry Ford \`invented' the automobile specifically to replace horses (p.243). Steam locomotives were designed to replace horses and their expensive fodder. Diamond is wrong about the supersonic transport (p.249). You could buy a Dvorak keyboard if people wanted them (p.248); just as a country could drive with a steering wheel on the right. Chapter 18 summarizes this book. Chapter 19 tells about the peoples and languages of Africa. Diamond seems very sure in describing events from 5,000 years ago when he wasn't present as an observer. The condensed version of this book made an interesting movie on TV. This book should have fewer pages by eliminating redundant or extraneous material, and be faster paced. I wonder if there are any opposing viewpoints to his opinions?"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"While this book is difficult for many high school students, its ideas and the methods used to create his thesis are concepts your students can get. This would be a great jumping off point for an interdisciplinary unit and as the years go on, history and social studies teachers need to change the way we present history if we want students to be ready for the 21st century. In a time when students can get facts right off of Google faster than we could give it to them, we need to teach history as concepts and not focus on students learning only facts. Diamond interprets the facts to create a a thesis on why certain societies excel and come out on top. You could compare and contrast his thesis to the Human Web or the Kennedy's Rise and Fall of Great Powers. On its own, GGS could be a powerful tool in the classroom and teachers of all disciplines should read this text. All texts are biased and no one should expect perfection so if you want to be convinced of one particular view then you shouldn't read it. But if you are open to learning more and having more questions when you are finished (which is not a bad thing), then you should read this and give select passages to students.For non-teachers, this book really makes learning history easy and interesting which may be different from your own educational experience."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I believe there are few individuals (I'm talking especially about laypeople like myself here) who won't benefit from reading Guns, Germs and Steel. While Diamond's hypothesis may not necessarily represent the *complete* picture, may be biased, and may not be indisputable, it indeed \\"lays a foundation for understanding human history\\" as Bill Gates reviewed it.Diamond provides a convincing, well-worded argument leading the reader to believe geographical differences between continents played a major role in shaping the fates of human societies, at the very least."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Diamond initiates the book with a simple but valid and very interesting question of why the current power distribution in the world is as it is as opposed to some other way. He takes us thru from the point where everything was equal - at least it appeared to be so - to where we are now and attempts to explain the way things progressed as they did and how different parts of the world advanced as opposed to others; not only how this took place but also why it did not take place in other parts of the world too.Going thru the arguments are really enjoyable, un-put-downable and teaching. It can be used as a great teaching material and that was the reason I have ordered a new copy for my son who is 14 for him to learn, question and understand intricacies of these social and technological developments as well as appreciate the value and capability of all societies.Diamond concludes every chapter as well as exploring in detail in the last chapter the importance of consequential circumstances in these events. This makes us more knowledgeable in relation to where we are as societies and allows us to understand that this is not only result of the intelligence of races but also environmental consequences. This is an important message that needs to be expanded all around the world, specially in the west and lately in the far-east that we should look at our successes with more humility and stop acting as if such successes are only attributable to our own race and/or being the chosen one.I endorse this view and therefore I recommend this book to everyone who wants a better understanding of the history of these developments in our world."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Mr. Diamond must be admired for this epic work on humanity. Is it perfect, of course not, but what is perfect. He gives us a different way to view history and how geography has influnced it. I enjoyed the read and have assigned it to my students for reading and reviewing. The majority of them said it was worth the effort and it has given some instances of lively discussion in the classroom. We should tip our hats to a man who at least gives us something to think about."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"\\"By contrast, civilisations in tropical regions had ready access to abundant foodstuffs that could grow easily in such a warm climate. Tribes of native North Americans ranged over land that is now considered the most fertile in the world - and yet, none of these civilisations, despite their favourable geography, progressed as European nations did.\\"-- From one of the current \\"Spotlight Reviewers\\"Wow.So, I've just finished reading Guns, Germs and Steel, which seems to give me a bit of an advantage over the current so-called \\"Spotlight Reviewers\\" because, based on the content of their reviews, they haven't read it.For instance, the above argument seems to ignore the fact that this point is addressed, at length, by Mr. Diamond over the course of his book. In fact, it's one of the central points to Guns, Germs and Steel--explaining why Native Americans had this awesome soil but didn't develop the same agriculture that Europeans did. (His answer? Because while they had the right growing environment, they didn't have the right crops for it 'till they were imported from Europe. It's argued with facts and evidence and such, and argued pretty well.) Either that reviewer didn't read the thing, didn't understand it or is being intentionally deceptive.Or, consider this (from the other \\"Spotlight Reviewer\\"):\\"Diamond states that 'those four sets of factors [above] constitute big environmental differences that can be quantified objectively and that are not subject to dispute.' Fair enough, but what *is* subject to dispute is that there might be some other factors at work. Thomas Sowell in Race and Culture does a good job of developing the thesis that the exchange of information among European cultures, facilitated by Europe's plentiful navigable rivers, was the key to Europe's technological and economic rise. David Landes in the Wealth and Poverty of Nations attributes China's conscious decision in the 1400's to isolate itself form other nations as the key event (decision) that caused it to lose it's technological advantage and fall behind Europe. (Diamond briefly touches on 15th Century China in the final chapter, but manages to boil this as well down to an accident of geography.)\\"Yes--Diamond talks about China's isolationism... and he uses it as a key example of something that was *not* determined by geography. What he says, rather, was that it was geography which allowed China to be unified and that this unification meant that things such as political policy were much more powerful there than in Europe, because European geography conspired to keep people from being unified politically. He makes the point that no single politician in Europe could have made the decision to be \\"isolationist\\" like they did in China, because there were too many competing societies in Europe.Also? Diamond talks about the ease of exchange of infomation/technological diffusion though this reviewer suggests that the topic is ignored in this book. In fact, it's one of Diamond's central points. Only someone who didn't bother to read the whole thing before writing his review could have missed that.I suppose that this is why Pulitzer Prizes aren't generally given to website reviewers.I could go on in addressing these two reviews directly, and I'm sorely tempted to, but you know something...? I'm not sure it's appropriate. Everyone's review of this book seems to be their opinion of the theory presented in the book, and I'm not sure that's fair to the author or to potential readers. After all, large theories like this (concerning all of pre-history and human socieites) can't either be expressed or dismissed in a few paragraphs; that's why Diamond wrote the 400+ pager that he did. Instead, let me talk a bit about some other issues that prospective readers might be interested in:Diamond writes clearly, and the layman will readily understand. His tone is scholarly, but he is never too academic or wordy. He is, perhaps, a bit repetitive as he reiterates the basic ideas behind his thesis several times (though the repetition does help to re-enforce these ideas and some will find that helpful). Fans of early history and sociology might find this book fascinating, but it *is* a history text, so those who didn't like such in school should probably steer clear.I was worried, going in, that Diamond might have a bit too-much of an anti-European/anti-Caucasian bias going in, as his topic does tend to lend itself to such things. I'm especially sensitive to that sort of thing, as I was one of the only conservative students on the campus of UC Santa Cruz, a school that makes UC Berkeley look like a Klan meeting. You know what, though? Other than one or two questionable sentences near the very beginning (like his suspicions that New Guineans are more intelligent, on average, than Europeans), Diamond simply has a clinical, balanced approach to everyone and everything. He comes across as fair-minded and well-researched.I'm an odd duck in that I enjoy ideas and history texts, but I had a lot of fun reading this book. If you like the same things as I do, then I recommend it to you as well. For fans of history, etc., five stars.As to the other stuff, like: is Diamond's thesis--that the fate of societies was dependent on their initial geography--correct? I have to leave that to the reader, because Diamond develops it by writing a book and I think that to be fair to him, people should read it before making up their minds as to whether he's wrong or not. Sadly, the \\"Spotlight Reviewers\\" do not seem to have given him that courtesy. I will say that, to my mind, Diamond's thesis is well-argued, clear and compelling. While it is possible that he has over-stressed the elements that make up his personal thesis and downplayed some others, I tend to believe that this is what people do when they write books attempting to explain phenomena. It's a no-brainer that people need to get information from more than one source and perspective in order to come to grips with such deep topics as world history. But in terms of expressing his point of view (\\"environmental determinism\\") and expressing it well? Guns, Germs and Steel is a classic and well-worth the accolades that folks have given it.Excellent book: read it and decide for yourself."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"There can be no doubt that this best selling, Pulitzer Prize winning book penned by Jared Diamond in 1999 is a brilliant work that gets all the praise it deserves. So, why only 4 stars? Well, if you read my bio I state a 5 star book, \\"is something I consider absolutely brilliant.\\" At the end of this literary journey, I cannot say this was absolutely brilliant. It was well done, no doubt. But the task here is so immense, there is virtually no mortal who could put out a 5 star book covering all the aspects present.This is not to say Diamond doesn't do a decent job, because he does. Ignoring the debate about his accuracy, which I will leave for later in the review, Diamond proffers and defends an array of theories which are intriguing and well-researched. He takes a look at several cultures which may have started on even-footing and dissects exactly why one rose so fast and the other was left in the dust. While these explanations have been debated, there can be no doubt that the explanatory power of much of what Diamond says is, at the very least, well worth considering.The book takes on cultures, and the rise of guns, germs, and steel, but which also encompasses food production, technology, writing, social systems, and geography, among many other things. The book starts out shot from a cannon. The first 100 pages are riveting. Several of my friends read 100 pages and said it was one of the best books they had ever laid eyes on.This soon fades when pages 100-200 grow somewhat tiresome, as the point Diamond tries to drive home starts to lose much of its luster. Of those friends who praised the book after 100 pages, I'm don't believe any of them got through the next 100. It's understandable, as the book bogs down in academic explanations that tend to turn the reader off as opposed to drawing them in. I found these pages difficult and boring, as well as repetitive. It's understandable that many lose focus and dismiss the book at this stage.The second half regains the promise of the first 100 pages. While I'm not sure the last 5 chapters fit the theme of the book, per se, they do a good job keeping the reader interested in the subject matter. Granted, by the end you know what he's going to say before he says it. Still, what he says is not without merit.A quick search on the Internet reveals a whole host of discussions on this book. I found the wikipedia.org site a very good start. But then, I also found I wasn't interested in reading what the academics and pseudo-academics thought to be lacking in the book. So, I will leave the high-level discussion to them and throw in my 2 measly cents.Aside from the initial thoughts on the wide area of focus, Diamond uses a litany of sleight of hand tricks to state what he proffers as obvious conclusions. Before I explain, it should be noted that the prevalence of the word \\"clearly\\" in supporting his own assertions only supports my contention that he was starting to resort to hand-waving to get the job finished. Any well reasoned argument does not need to have the word \\"clearly\\" appended to it. Clearly, it stands on its own. See what I mean?My objection to some of Diamond's claims are based on ignoring certain factors while stressing others, then flip-flopping in the next section. For instance, the north-south axis of geography is repeatedly cited as a reason agriculture spread so slowly in the Americas, but that gets ignored when talking about China. This is a specific example of a trait I dislike with this book. Too often I felt a lack of supporting evidence was given to ignore a previously heavy factor, and vice versa.In all, I enjoyed this book despite its bogging down at times. I read the book slowly, consuming no more than 30 pages a day. I read the Further Reading section with a highlighter, because the topics discussed were sometimes so interesting I immediately wanted to know more about, say the QWERTY keyboard. That alone speaks volumes about how interesting the book reads on occasion.I think this appeals to a wide audience, but those tempted to pick it up because it is a best seller are biting off more than they can chew. Good money says the vast majority of those who bought it never finished it. It's a thick book, and if you're not prepared to think, don't bother. Assuredly academics in the field shouldn't waste their time. But laymen like myself who fancy themselves somewhat academic can find a lot of value. Those interested in an attempt at world history in a mere 400 pages can certainly do a lot worse.Highly recommended, but with caveats."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This is one of the few books to actually transcend its nominal domain (comparative anthropology?) to truly extend the broad scope of human understanding. If everyone would read and assimilate the wisdom in this book, human consciousness would take a quantuum leap. Why do I maintain this?Because Prof. Diamond convincingly shows how technological innovation and the dominance of some cultures over others is not rooted in the inherent superiority of any nation, culture, race or people, but rather is the perhaps inevitable result of the orientation of our planet's land masses, the parallel evolution of microbes and man, and the very nature of cultural change. This is big stuff, and nowhere have the tired old (but still distressingly overused!) canards of social darwinism, racism, ethnocentrism and a host of other intellectual diseases been more thoroughly--(conclusively)--refuted than in this truly monumental book.

Distinguished ecologist and physiologist Jared Diamond presents a novel synthesis of ecology with history; one which should be required reading for all historians. Without a doubt, &quot;Guns, Germs and Steel&quot; offers a unique perspective on the rise of Western civilization. Diamond urges historians to pay more attention as to how humanity's interactions with its local ecologies have shaped the course of history, offering persuasive evidence that Western Civilization's success is an accident due to its origins in the Near East's Fertile Crescent, which had a rich assemblage of animals and plants that were easy to domesticate. Other regions in the Americas and Asia were considerably poorer with regards to potentially domesticated animals and plants than the Fertile Crescent. He notes how the spread of the Fertile Crescent's domesticated animals across the globe, along with their associated diseases, made Western civilization's economic and political success almost inevitable. Much to his credit, Diamond concludes by offering suggestions as to how his elegant hypothesis can be tested by historians as well as scientists. He makes his compelling case with vivid, often eloquent, prose. This is one magnificent tome truly worthy of all the honors and awards it has earned so far."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"\\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" provides a very interesting perspective on history and helps explain why the West has come to dominate the world. However, in the process he strains to avoid including the impact of anything possibly \\"racist\\" - eg. differences in culture or physiology.Diamond's main point is that ability to cultivate crops and tend herds (determined by geography and available native species) allows setting aside resources for innovation and war. Germs acquired from domestic animals then played decisive roles in the European conquests of Native Americans, australians, South Africans, and Pacific Islanders. Animal-based means of transporting food surpluses were also a pre-requisite for development of technologically innovative societies.Factors Encouraging Farming: Declining availability of wild foods, development of methods to harvest (eg. flint blades attached to handles, for harvesting; baskets; mortars and pestles to remove husks). Cereals were a first crop. The best area for this at the time was the Fertile Crescent.Factors in Domesticating Animals: Carnivores are too inefficient, want a fast growth rate (rules out monkeys, apes, elephants), easy breeding (rules out vicunas), good disposition (rules out African buffalo, hippos, zebras), limited panic tendency (rules out gazelles), herdable (rules out antelope - males fight when confined).Another key Diamond point is that domesticated plants spread faster across Europe-Asia because of the long distances at similar latitudes. Conversely, Africa and the America's longest distances are primarily north-south, posing greater difficulty because of the great climate differences. In addition, the dry Texas area acted as a barrier between the SE and SW U.S. for transmitting crop-growing lessons.Diamond then concludes that the long East-West axis across Europe-Asia helped spread the development of the wheel for transporting crops, and writing (helped in trade). Meanwhile, the prehistoric Mexico's wheel and early writing systems never made it to the Andes.Some areas (eg. Australia, and the Western U.S.) did not have readily domesticatable crops.Major killers of humanity throughout recent history - smallpox, flu, TB, malaria, plague, measles, and cholera - are infectious diseases evolved from diseases of animals, according to Diamond. Until WWII, more victims of war died of war-borne microbes than battle wounds. Diamond goes on to assert that agriculture led to greater disease because of higher population densities, use of feces as fertilizer, disease transmitting rodents attracted by stored food, and transmission along resulting trade routes.Smallpox gave the Spaniards in America a decisive advantage - from 1520 to 1618 Mexico's population fell from about 20 million to about 1.6 million. For the New World as a whole, the Indian population decline in the two centuries post-Columbus was about 95%. Indians did not have diseases to transmit back to Europe because they had much fewer animals, did not drink their milk, and did not keep them indoors. (Eurasia had 13 species of big domestic mammals - some also useful for cultivation, and the Americas just one very local species - the llama, confined to a small area in South America.) However, tropical Asia, Africa, Indonesia, and New Guinea had cholera and yellow fever - making those areas much more difficult to colonize.Acceptance of change is another important factor - Islam, until about 1350 led Europe, until its religion began holding it back. (Diamond also mentions later that inhabitants of the Fertile Crescent undid their agricultural advantage by cutting down trees, allowing the sandy soil to become a major enemy.) Similarly, China formerly led the world in technology and ship-building, but then regressed under subsequent inward-focused leadership.Food production increases population size and also acts to make societies more complex. For example, Diamond believes that a large society that leaves conflict resolution to members is guaranteed to blow up. A second reason involves economic and welfare considerations - goods in excess of an individual's needs must be transferred to a centralized authority, which then redistributes these to individuals with deficits.Overall, Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" provides interesting insights into early world history; however, I strongly suspect Diamond's efforts to be politically correct limited his insights."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"......make it this one. Some pop-science books are deathly dull, others make you scratch your head in puzzlement, good ones educate - teaching you things you never knew. Occasionally, as in this instance, you read a book and you feel like an instant genius.Taking a step back from the trees of history - such as wars, dates, conquerors, laws, treaties etc etc, Diamond goes for the big picture and captures the wood. What is it about human development in the last thirteen thousand years that has put us here today ? In a nutshell, argues Diamond, geography.Taking the reader from an Africa with little prospect of development due to inhibiting factors such as tropical disease belts, lack of rivers and animals that have evolved alonside humans and are wary of them and thus not domesticable, into the middle-east where animals that have never met humans were tamable and there were wild plants suitable for the development of sophisticated agriculture and from there with this &quot;package&quot; of benefits how man colonised everywhere else. Here, running into a geographical dead-end, there finding room to thrive flourish and develop complex technological societies.Diamond has less sat down and hammered out a new knowledge of history, rather by adopting a new viewpoint he has more thrown hidden patterns into sharp relief. This book is a literal revelation and is sure to fire enthusiasm for further research into this area. Like I say at the top, if you read pop science make this your one must read this year and if you don't then, heck, you should as you don't know what you're missing."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Diamond has set out to explain why certain cultures ended up with all the heavy weaponry (thus, the power) and why others continued to subsist on stuff like sago pulp. I find his arguments quite compelling. I don't see him sidestepping any of the tough questions the issue raises; he meets them in a refreshingly direct manner. I'd consider it required reading for a good education in ancient history in any geographic area, because its theses are applicable to all.With so many people screaming either 'yay, a non-racist explanation!' or 'this is *so* PC', let me attempt to cut through that thicket for the potential reader. Yes, it is quite apparent that Diamond set out to come up with a non-racist explanation (as opposed to setting out to answer the question, prepared to accept the truth whether it bothered people or not). It does raise the question: had a racial explanation resulted, would he have put it forth? I think not. The effect of this is to make Diamond have to work harder to convince people of his conclusions, because he was certainly predisposed to a given tenet. This is too bad, because his conclusions are quite compelling. It would be shortsighted to dismiss his excellent work without hearing him out, though, even if one cannot quite shake the suspicion that he mainly wanted to prove that his hunter-gatherer friends in New Guinea were smarter than most people give them credit for.The other issue with the predisposition away from a racial explanation is that said predisposition is, itself, often racist, and Diamond does fall prey to this: just because Europeans ultimately developed napalm bombs, nuclear weapons and nerve gases, is that necessarily a positive? One could argue that it speaks well for the residents of ancient Africa, for example, that they never put any effort into learning how to incinerate an entire city or pollute the atmosphere with dioxins.One area of wasted effort was the photo section. He's got pictures in there of peoples from all over the world. Ok, fine, but what do the pictures illustrate? I guess if one has never seen a Spaniard or a Yanomano before, this'll help, but there is no use of the photos to support his perspective. Too bad--if the effort had been spent on diagrams and maps, Diamond could have used these pages to help make his point.Strongly recommended because the strength of the reasoning outweighs all else: no matter how he did it, Diamond's given us very good information."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This book should be on everyone's &quot;Must-Read List.&quot; Diamond explores the relationships between the development of human technologies and their regional geographic environments. He shows how environment either limits or permits the exchange of new ideas and technologies, and he shows that many cultural developments which we have tended to view as accidents of history are, in fact, the logical results of the geographical/geological orientations of continents. Diamond's analysis of human cultural development is pertinent not just to development on our own planet, but on any planet with similar geological characteristics (oceans, continents, plate tectonics). No science fiction writer should ever again attempt to invent an alien society on a distant planet without first reading this book. There is an inherent logic to all evolutionary processes, and this book illuminates that logic in a manner that everyone with a high school education can understand.In addition, this book is a fascinating source of ideas for geographical, anthropological, and historical research. It must be considered the first volume in a new field of research: the history of human cultural and technological evolution. How does this differ from, for example, the history of science or the history of technology or the history of culture? Well, it combines all of these areas and includes the principles of environmental geography. Traditionally, the study of history has ignored most geographical factors and concentrated instead on the lives of rulers and the works of &quot;great men.&quot; Diamond shows the foundational necessities which make it possible for those &quot;great men&quot; of history to exist and produce. Historical events don't just happen -- they happen as a result of a long series of causes-and-effects which go back to the movement of tectonic plates over millions of years -- on geological time scales.For example, we often point to Leonardo da Vinci as a foundational thinker in the history of technological development. However, da Vinci did not spring up from nothing. Before da Vinci, there were Erasmus and Copernicus, and both of them would never have been exposed to Arab mathematics without the crusades, and Arabs would not have been able to develop a rich mathematical and scientific body of work without contacts with the ancient Greek and ancient Indo-Persian manuscripts assembled in Baghdad after the Islamic Conquest. There would have been no Islam without the long history of trade amongst and by various Semitic tribes around the Red Sea, there would have been no Red Sea without the collision between Africa and Eurasia and the subsequent rifting in the Afar triangle.One can, in fact, start with the waterways and trade routes between the Mediterranean region and India and shoe how cultural evolution was entirely dependent upon them. No one should write history any more without considering these influences.In summary, Diamond's book is profoundly important for many reasons and should significantly influence the way we study history, anthropology, and evolution from now on.For a longer, more in-depth review, please visit my website at www.geocities.com/Vienna/Studio/5484"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"In 1532, in the Peruvian highland town of Cajamarca, a decisive moment took place during the greatest collision in modern history. A ragtag group of 168 Spanish soldiers, led by the conquistador Francisco Pizarro, captured the Inca emperor Atahuallpa who was surrounded by his army of 80,000 soldiers in the heart of the Inca Empire. In \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\", Jared Diamond, uses this dramatic episode of human history to trace a chain of causation starting with a set of proximate factors and leading to ultimate causes explaining this outcome and that of many similar collisions between colonizers and native peoples. Steel swords and armor, guns, horses, maritime technology, and writing systems used by the Spaniards, as well as diseases that arrived with the Europeans, and resulted in a power struggle dividing the Inca Empire, are the proximate factors that Diamond lumps in the term \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\". He then goes into pursuit of the ultimate causes in the chain. He seeks the broad patterns of history that explain why the rise of complex human societies unfolded differently on different continents over the last 13,000 years, since the end of the last ice age known as the Pleistocene. After extensive research and analysis on world history, geography, botany, zoology, archeology, linguistics, anthropology, and other fields, he concludes that differences in continental environments, not in human biology, led to the rise of complex human societies.The ultimate factor according to Diamond concerns the rise of food production. This is influenced by several environmental factors such as the availability of domestic-able plants and animals. It is not sufficient to have Mediterranean-like climates which are the most suitable for growing crops. Such climates exist in California, Southeastern Australia, and Southern Africa. A large selection of plants and animals that are suitable for domestication is essential. The author conducts a detailed study based on the literature. A case that stands out is that of wheat vs. corn. Wheat's nutritional and cultivation characteristics provided an advantage to Fertile Crescent societies in their transition to food producing from hunting-gathering status. The Americas on the other hand had to make do with corn which had a longer evolutionary path from its original wild variety to the one eventually used as food by humans. Moreover, it is less nutritious than wheat, and is lower yielding as a crop. The Americas, Australia, and sub-Saharan Africa also suffered from a deficiency of animals that are good candidates for domestication. The Americas' lama is not as useful as a pack animal as is the horse of Eurasia. Africa's large mammals such as the zebra and the elephant had characteristics the author deals with in detail that prevented domestication by humans. Similarly, Australia lacked suitable plant and animal varieties to domesticate.In addition to the availability of good starting plant and animal material, Diamond describes three other sets of environmental factors that affected the rise of food production throughout the world. A second set controlled the rate of diffusion within the continents and was mainly influenced by the orientation of the continent's axis. An East-West axis, such as in Eurasia, fostered easy movement and migration of plants and animals, as well as ideas and technology. A North-South axis as in the Americas and Africa provided obstacles to such diffusion due to the varying climates along longitudinal lines. The third set of factors affected the rate of diffusion between continents and was mainly caused by geographic isolation such as the case of Australia and the separation between the hemispheres. The fourth set of factors was the differences in area and population. Larger landmass and population density increases the number of potential innovators, the number of societies, and competition among them. Eurasia had the largest landmass and population. The Americas covered a large area but were fragmented by geography and ecology.The four major sets of environmental differences among the continents thus resulted in significant variation in when societies transitioned from hunter-gatherers to farmers, and in whether that transition occurred at all. The onset of food production then starts a chain reaction, giving humans surplus food to increase their numbers and support specialists: soldiers, chiefs, scribes, and artisans. This in turn leads to developing technology including weapons and writing. Farming societies thus enjoy advantages in numbers, technology, and organization over hunter-gathering societies and are more likely to overcome them. Another by-product of farming societies are the germs caused by livestock that people in these societies develop immunity against.Diamond subsequently goes around the world in five chapters for a tour of all the continents analyzing how environmental factors affected societal developments in them. He applies his reasoning and enforces it using evidence from the historic record, archeology, linguistics, and genetics. A striking example is that of Australia, New Guinea to its northeast, and Indonesia, an island group northwest of Australia. Diamond explains how geography, climate, availability of domestic-able plants and animals, degree of isolation from surrounding lands, among other factors contributed to the state of societal development in those three regions. The result was stone-age hunter gatherers in Australia, stone-age farmers in New Guinea, and iron-age farmers in Indonesia. In the chapter How Africa Became Black he describes the expansion of the black Bantu farmers from subequatorial West Africa into East and South Africa, engulfing the hunting gathering Pygmy and Khoisan peoples in the process. The case of Polynesia is a very telling natural experiment. The same people traveled by canoes starting from Asia and spread out widely into the south Pacific islands. Within a millennium, the Polynesian descendants reached highly varying states of development from a proto-state with intensive food production in Hawaii to hunting-gathering on the Chatham's. In the other continental chapters, Diamond delves into How China Became Chinese about the history of East Asia, and Hemispheres Colliding about the histories of Eurasia and the Americas.Diamond asserts that the four major sets of environmental factors affecting the trajectories of human societies are undisputable quantifiable facts. For example, New Guinea is much smaller, has far fewer big animal species, and is more isolated than Eurasia. It seems obvious to conclude that the environment of those two places caused their differing levels of societal complexity. Yet such arguments invite strong criticisms of \\"geographic determinism\\" by historians. What troubles the critics is that human creativity is ostensibly discounted. Diamond points out that it is not. Human inventiveness still matters but it is dependent on the presence of favorable starting material and conditions to utilize its inventions.In the Epilogue, Diamond further deals with other variables that tend to complicate the study of human history. For example, the factors involved in shorter time scales and smaller geographic scales that would help explain why it was people from Europe, not the Fertile Crescent or China, who colonized the new world. He also considers the case of cultural factors and individual influences that may act as wild cards making history unpredictable. But despite these variables he contends that it is the environmental factors that determine the broad pattern of history. As a case in point against the Great Man theory of the exceptional individual he reasons that although Alexander the Great probably changed the course of Western Eurasian states, he did not make Eurasia a place of literate, food-producing states with iron tools at a time Australia had only illiterate, hunter-gatherer tribes with non-metal tools. However to aid in the analysis of such problems with a large number of individual variables he suggests the study of human history as a science using scientific methodologies.The question about the fates of human societies represents a very complex problem due to the number of individual variables involved but there is little doubt in this reader's mind that the environmental factors examined by Diamond are at the base of the broad historic pattern that set societies on different trajectories as he concludes. Diamond's thoughtful and thoroughly researched study of world history in the last 13,000 years leading to the modern world offers a convincing explanation full of examples and detailed research with extensive references. This is true even though at times some of his explanations do seem convenient or wishful thinking. However, acknowledging the causal effect of environment on human societies, the reader cannot help wondering about the second part of the author's thesis, that human biology is not a causal factor. This is potentially a minefield but wouldn't 13,000 years in separate and isolated environments result in biological differences due to evolving genetics? The resulting genetic differences would then become a causal factor though not the ultimate one. The author himself opines that New Guineans are on average smarter than Eurasians due to the need to survive in a harsh environment. In any case, the main gripe detractors have with the overall thesis is that it undermines the importance of human inventiveness. That seems to this reader as just another case of human arrogance, the belief that we are exceptional and have full control over our fates. Yes, it is part of the equation, but why would a human without a horse invent stirrups, or a plow with no large animal to pull it?No matter what position one takes on its thesis, the book is worth reading for its wealth of information about the environmental condition of the continents. It is an enlightening, captivating, and highly readable book. This is definitely a must read for anyone interested in human history or seeking to understand the state of the modern world."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This book examines why history unfolds differently in different continents, specifically, why did human development proceed at such different rates in different continents. In Jared's analysis of the world's development, he narrows down to be primarily the initiation of food production with the availability of plants and animals or livestock for domestication, which in chain and cyclic reaction, changes the human lifestyle from nomadic to sedentary, thereby causing an increase in human population, which in turn promotes invention, innovation and technology, the development of writing, and likewise also leads to the evolution of germs and viruses, as a result of humans coming in closer contact with the domesticated livestock.A factor that aids in food production is the orientation of the geographical axis. Having an E-W axis orientation is an advantage, as compared to that of a N-S axis orientation. An E-W axis means having the same latitude, implying same or similar day length and seasonal variations. Therefore plants or livestock can easily adapt when transported from one E-W zone to another E-W zone.To start with, all continents are not equal in terms of availability of plants and livestock for domestication. Five centers of origin of food production are identified; the Fertile Crescent, China, Mesoamerica, Andes and Eastern US. Among the five centers, the Fertile Crescent leads in terms of a number of factors. First, it possesses the world's largest Mediterranean climate, which implies a high diversity of wild plants and animal species. Second, it experiences the greatest climatic variations from season to season and year to year, which implies that this variation favors the evolution of an especially high percentage of annual plants. Third, it has a wide range of altitudes and topographies within a short distance. This implies a corresponding variety of environments, a high diversity of wild plants and a staggered harvest season. Fourth, it possesses wealth in quantity of domesticable plants/crops and livestock/mammals. Therefore it correspondingly faces less competition from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle and promotes a sedentary lifestyle instead.There are six factors for considering the domestication of animals. First, we have to evaluate in terms of the animals' diet, that is to quantify the efficiency of the conversion of food biomass into consumer's biomass. Second, we have to consider the animal's growth rate. For example, an elephant has to wait for 15 years to reach adult size, which explains why elephants tend to be held captive in the wild only after they have reached close to adult size. Third, there is the problem of captivity breeding. Fourth, some animals tend to have a nasty disposition such as the capability of killing humans. Fifth, some animals tend to show a greater tendency to panic. Therefore nervous species are difficulty to keep in captivity. Finally, different animal species possess a different social structure. Those that function as a herd and maintain a well-developed dominance hierarchy are easier for domestication. From this, we can see why even though Africa has a large selection of mammals, these animals such as zebras, rhinoceros, tigers, leopards, etc are difficult to tame and domesticate. But rather animals such as horses, cows, etc are easier to tame and domesticate.With the advent of food production, diseases or germs tend to evolve from human populations' close and long intimacy with domestic animals. The characteristics of epidemics are they spread quickly and efficiently from infected person to nearby persons. They tend to be restricted to humans and the survivors will develop antibodies. For diseases to sustain themselves, they need a human population that is sufficiently numerous and densely packed. As an example, with Native Americans, they remain as hunter-gatherers due to limitation of domesticable plants and animals. Since they did not practice food production, they have minimum contact with animals and therefore less occurrences of diseases. On the other hand, Eurasians, from the start of food production, have close contact with their domesticated animals, resulting in evolution of diseases and development of antibodies. As an example, when the Spanish began to intrude into Mexico, they brought their diseases with them. The natives upon encountering these diseases, were slowly wept out since they lacked the immunity or resistance to combat these diseases or germs.With a larger human population, humans can take on different tasks such as potters, farmers, iron-smiths, etc. This also leads to invention, innovation and technology, of which among them are metallurgy. They start having tools (axe, grinders, etc) and weapons (swords, guns, rifles, cannons, etc) made from steel, iron, etc, as compared to the past where the tools are normally made from wood or stone. Therefore regions with a head start on food production, is able to gain a head start towards development of guns and steel. The increase in human population also brings the onset of writing. Knowledge and writing brings power, as it is possible to transmit knowledge with far greater accuracy and in far greater quantity and detail from more distant lands and more remote times.As a conclusion, the striking differences between long term histories of people of different continents have been due not to innate differences in the people themselves, but to differences in their environments.This book further elaborates on the present time frame, whereby Fertile Crescent, even though it has a good head start with locally available concentration of domesticable wild plants and animals, it committed an ecological suicide by destroying its own resource base, What was previously fertile woodlands, it has been unfortunately transformed into an eroded scrub and desert region, gradually over time eliminating itself as a major center of power of innovation.On the other hand, Europe received crops, livestock, technology and the writing system from the Fertile Crescent and has over time made significant progress ahead of the Fertile Crescent.To further analyze the present time frame as to why a few nations still remain relatively backwards, even though global information and technology are more easily available and accessible, as compared to the past. I believe the following few factors play a significant role. First, the influence of religion has to be considered. There are some religions that are based on a centralized body of authority. They dictate what is the social norm, the correct and wrong expectations and the education standards, that is, they teach whatever they want the general public to know only. Therefore the general population remains ignorant of the global world's progress. Second, the type of government equally plays an important role. It is obvious a communist country tends to restrict access of information to their general population. On the other hand, a democratic country tends to promote accessibility of information. Third, each general race has their own motivations. For example, we know in a particular trade such as finance, etc, quite a significant number of its work force tends to consist of a particular race. There are some races that just tend to be laid back in their daily lifestyle, unless given incentives to make progress.Overall, I feel this book is a good read and provides some reasonable basis, from which you can further add your own thoughts."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Most readers of those two books read \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\" before \\"Collapse\\" in the order in which they were published. I, however, read them in reverse order of publication. Many were critical of \\"Collapse\\" because it was too close to \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\" in theme and topics covered. I suppose that I am a bit disappointed as well, but not too much.Yes, they cover some of the same material, but really they are the twin sides of the same coin - the rise of societies and the fall of societies. With a little bit of editing, Jared Diamond could have merged these two books into one and created one monster-sized tome (800 plus pages)on the rise and fall of societies around the world.Diamond's theses are cogent, coherent and clear. Really, it is a wonderful volume for the student of world history who wishes to take some steps into the deeper end of the scholarship pool. Despite the easy writing style (Personally, I've never had much respect for some serious scholars who seem to delight in making their texts as dense and difficult as possible), these are lofty thoughts that are often painstakingly laid out.On occasion, Mr. Diamond's descriptions were a little too detailed (especially concerning the domestication of grains) and I found myself skimming several pages. But, those moments were rare and normally I found it to be interesting in the least and from time to time I had an Aha! moment while reading.If you enjoy this one, be sure to read \\"Collapse\\".I give this one an A-."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"From the \\"Afterword,\\"I learn that Diamond's book has been used in business management settings and that certain corporations have used it for management training purposes, applying some of his research and conclusions to organizational environments. While I can appreciate the occasional congruencies of Diamond's \\"macro\\" observations and the \\"micro\\" organization of businesses, my rating of the book is that of a general reader seeking to broaden his understanding of human societies and expecting a little interesting entertainment along the way. I do not presume to be making any recommendations as to the book's fitness for managerial training applications.Diamond's essential theme is that human societies differ in their degrees of dominance and technological attainment not because of any biological differences among their members but because of environmental factors stretching back for 10,000 years or so. He postulates that the development of a society beyond that of others can be traced to the basic activity of food production. This, in turn, is determined by such things as the availability of suitable native plants and animals for domestication and by the ease with which domesticated plants and animals diffuse across a continent and between continents. Areas of the world fortunate enough to have numerous plant and animal species available for domestication can support denser populations, and those can then support inventors, bureaucrats, priests and other non-food-producing members of society. What determines those areas where plant and animal domestication for food production will thrive the best? Very simply, the lay of the land. Those continents whose long axis lies east and west, i.e., lie near the same latitude, saw a rapid pre-historical diffusion of food production and the resultant societal developments it enabled, unlike those whose long axis lies in a north-south direction.Diamond details numerous examples and arguments in support of his position, which is indeed well argued. The concept of continental orientation as a determining factor in the development of societies was certainly new to my thinking, and I came away from the book quite willing to accept Diamond's premises until more persuasive explanations come along.I was rather surprised that Diamond devotes a fair amount of text denouncing such outmoded concepts as racially-determined intelligence, inventiveness, modernity, etc. I would have hoped that such bigotry was a thing of the past and no longer required any attention whatsoever. Unfortunately, I realize that my hope is more of a dream and that such racial prejudice is still alive and well in the 21st century. More unfortunate still is the fact that those who hold such ill-founded and discredited beliefs are not very likely to read Diamond's book in the first place.For a reader wanting to develop as clear an understanding as possible of just exactly where we all came from and how we got to be where we are today, I recommend two books: First, read THE ANCESTOR'S TALE: A PILGRIMAGE TO THE DAWN OF EVOLUTION by Richard Dawkins. That one will provide a marvelous explanation of how biological evolution really works and how we became what we are. Follow Dawkins' book with Diamond's GUNS, GERMS, AND STEEL for an evolutionary look at the causes and effects that produced the human societies in and among which we live. Taken together, these become the most informative and provocative history of humankind that I have ever encountered.If I am so pleased with Diamond's book, why have I not given it five stars? Please recall that I'm commenting on my reaction as a general reader, not as an academician or social historian, and I must admit that there are stretches here and there in the book that I found somewhat tedious and slow going. I found the book as a whole to be fascinating, but there are just enough passages that are, shall we say, less than scintillating in their verbiage that I believe a four-star rating is more accurate. Occasional repetitive explanations of concepts also occur, but perhaps those merely enhance the reader's retention, and I give that aspect of the book only the lightest of criticism. I certainly found the book to be instructive and many of the author's concepts and analyses to be fresh and very thought-provoking. One could certainly do worse than to spend some time with GUNS, GERMS, AND STEEL."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Guns, Germs, and Steel is a monumental work that manages to encapsulate an explanation for why human history is the way it is within 500 pages. If you are interested in why the world's societies are they way they are today or want to understand the chain of events that led to where we are today, then you owe it to yourself to read Guns, Germs and Steel.Many centers of learning are currently engrossed in teaching new generations self-loathing based on some of the genoicidal atrocities committed by past generations. While I think it is important to learn from the past, there are positive as well as negative lessons buried there. This book deals with many of the cataclysmic events in human history where societies exterminated one another through various means. It certainly makes clear that history has been peppered with ruthless people willing to wipe out entire cultures in order to dominate. But Guns, Germs and Steel looks much deeper than that. Reading this book will make it clear that the firecely competitive cultures which embraced new technologies are the ones that now dominate and flourish.Guns, Germs and Steel is not going to be palatable to everyone, as it contains wordy explanations of why farmers triumphed over hunter gatherers. It often bored me somewhat with lists of various grains, food types, domesticated livestock and so on. However, the serious student of human history will read carefully because the content offered, including the lists, is the most coherent explanation of the who, what, where, when and why in relation to the modern world that I have read.Most interesting to me were the strongly presented comments by author Jared Diamond that related to systems of governance:\\"In fact, precisely because Europe was fragmented, Columbus succeeded on his fifth try in persauding one of Europe's hundreds of princes to sponsor him. Once Spain had thus launched the European colonization of America, other European states saw the wealth flowing into Spain, and six more joined in colonizing America. The story was the same with Europe's cannon, electric lightning, printing, small firearms, and innumerable other innovations: each was at first neglected or opposed in some parts of Europe for idiosyncratic reasons, but once adopted in one area, it eventually spread to the rest of Europe.These consequences of Europe's disunity stand in sharp contrast to those of China's unity. From time to time the Chinese court decided to halt other activities besides overseas navigation: it abandoned development of an elaborate water-driven spinning machine, stepped back from the verge of an industrial revolution in the 14th century, demolished or virtually abolished mechanical clocks after leading the world in clock construction, and retreated from mechanical devices and technology in general after the late 15th century. Those potentially harmful effects of unity have flared up again in modern China, notably during the madness of the Cultural Revolution in the 1960s and 1970s, when a decision by one or a few leaders closed the whole country's school system for five years.\\"Humans have an innate need to manage one another, but Guns, Germs and Steel touches on which types of management lead to societies which prosper.\\"It remains a challenge for historians to reconcile these different approches by answering the question: \\"Why Europe and not China?\\" The answer may have important consequences for how best to govern China and Europe today. For example, from Lang's and my perspective, the disaster of China's Cultural Revolution of the 1960s and 1970s, when a few misguided leaders were able to close the school system for five years, may not be a unique one-time-only aberration, but may presage more such disasters in the future unless China can introduce far more decentralization into its political system. Conversely, Europe, in its rush toward political and economic unity today, will have to devote much thought to how to avoid dismantling the underlying reason behind its successes of the last five centuries.\\"Are you listening America? Keyphrase: decentralization of political power leads to successful, vibrant and dominant societies with the best technology and superior militaries. And there's more:\\"All of this suggests that we may be able to extract a general principle about group organization. If your goal is innovation and competitive ability, you don't want either excessive unity or excessive fragmentation. Instead, you want your country, industry, industrial belt, or company to be broken up into groups that compete with one another while maintaining relatively free communication-like the U.S. federal government system, with its built-in competition between our 50 states.\\"Reading Guns, Germs and Steel reinforced my own preconceived notion that our federal government's growth since the Civil War hashad a largely negative impact, slowing growth and innovation as the individual states themselves become less and less autonomous. As Congress has perverted the Constitution and robbed powers they are expressly forbidden from the sovereign states, the country appears more and more homogenous.Jared Diamond concludes that finding the right balance between indepedence and unity, couple with totally open communication is what gaurantees successful societies. If his conclusions are correct then I think we're probably slipping away from the right balance for a successful society in the United States, here in 2006.But go read the book for yourself. You may draw different conclusions than I did. You will certainly learn some things you didn't know and see others from a new vantage point."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"The book had a good synthesis of the physical factors that shaped early history of mankind. It is incomplete because it doesn't factor in the effects of culture. It also has a blind spot that totally dismisses the effects of IQ - an approach that is politically correct but not correct in reality."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Jared Diamond addresses issues of evolution and racism in his Pulitzer Prize winning book Guns, Germs, and Steel. His background in medicine and biology and his Ph. D. in physiology, combined with his abilities as a linguist, allow him to approach the reasons behind humans varying rates of advancement from many different angles. Diamond uses a conversational tone to explain the logical reasons for the facts he presents. He explains that the reason people of Eurasia, as opposed to people in North America or Australia, domesticated the most animals was because they had the most candidates capable of domestication. He follows the path of several societies at once comparing the haves and have nots of each. He uses leading questions such as \\"why did food production develop first in these seemingly marginal lands, and only later in today's most fertile farmlands and pastures?\\" Questions like this usually take several chapters to answer as he continues to ask more making it seem like a constant introduction for the first third of the book.His final conclusion is essentially a matter of being in the right place at the right time. Native Americans and Aboriginees lacked the domesticable plants and animals they needed to settle down and develop guns, germs, and steel. History shows that if left on their own these societies would probably have settled down and when modern day primitive people were presented with agriculture and technology they usually take full advantage of it."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This 400 page summation of 13,000 years of history is hard to put down when it begins and hard to finish when you reach its final quarter. Diamond's friendly style draws the reader in immediately, making the book feel not only lively but vitally important as well. What could be more important or interesting than the reasons why the world has turned out the way that it has?Without a doubt, this is an important book, and not because it won a Pulitzer. Diamond makes a convincing case as he argues against notions that were quite popular when he wrote this at the close of the 90s. He refutes the notions of The Bell Curve, which used pretend science to claim that blacks were destined by genetics to be less intelligent than whites and Asians. Instead, he shows that the reasons why Europeans ended up dominating most of the world instead of Africans or native Australians or Americans are myriad, but boil down to a reasonable set, including: Eurasia's size advantage; the fortunate combination of ancient plants and large animals available for domestication; its east-west axis, making the spread of plant and animal domesticates easier by keeping them in the same climate; and its relatively mild barriers, like the Urals, which posed less a division than rain forests, high mountains, and deserts in the Americas and Africa.The thrilling opening and friendly style are eventually tempered by a repetition of these primary causes; Diamond explores numerous situations around the world, from New Guinea to the New World, and makes essentially the same arguments about each region, adding only nuances for the particulars of each place. It's the beginning of the book that's got the goods-the fourth part, especially, is a litany of details that are less captivating because the reader has learned enough to predict many of them.Still, this is a very useful book for understanding the world, and it will arm you with facts to use against anyone who claims that a person's intellect can be predicted by his or her race. Diamond also shows how present conflicts on the world stage are very similar to ones that have been going on for 40,000 years, casting modernity in the same light as prehistory. And, while the fourth part is slower than the rest, the epilogue explains why Europe leapt ahead of Asia in the last millennium, an explanation that is both fascinating and worth learning from.Why did Europe colonize America and not the other way around? If you'd like to know, read this book. It's weighty stuff, but it will reward you richly."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This is a book which provides a well thought out and well argued case for his thesis of the development of historical development.It is not simply broad brush strokes, though his thesis is relatively easy to summarize: 1. basic east west layout of Eurasia (diversty of animals and plants thus allowed to spread), 2. rise of complex concentrated societies (thus development of competing ideas and greater immunity to diseases). Yet it is not too bound to specific historical or cultural detail, though each concept is first analized in specific examples (sort of test cases) before being applied more generally.I think this forces the reader to be more critical and puts any discussion on a more serious footing, since we are forced to discuss not just opinions, but facts and very often deductions based on those facts. This book cannot be easily dismissed and I hope will provide for deeper discusson into our past and our future.One little note. I was surprised when he wrote of kleptocrats gaining support through ideology or religion that he did not mention the etymology of the word &quot;religion&quot;, which literally comes from &quot;rex&quot; and &quot;ligio&quot;: bound to one's king.

Jared Diamond is a good storyteller, and in this case the story he is trying to tell is an important one indeed: Why are some nations or regions of the world so rich and others so poor? It isn't, he assures us, because of intelligence, since people in poorer regions are just as intelligent as people in richer regions. Nor is it because of cultural differences, contrary to the thesis of David Landes in The Wealth and Poverty of Nations: Why Some Are So Rich and Some So Poor. Rather, the key is geography, and Diamond takes us on a fascinating anthropological romp through history to support this thesis.Harry Potter, step aside - This book is hard to put down. When I finally did put the book down, however, and reflected more on the argument, I was not completely convinced. Surely geography plays a role, but does it play the dominant role in human history? Not likely. In any case, in addition to Landes's book cited above, readers interested in the question of why some nations are so rich and others so poor should also look at the new book by Glenn Firebaugh, The New Geography of Global Income Inequality, for a more balanced perspective on the multiple causes of global income inequality."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"The introduction of this book starts in a questionable manner (the author - subjectively - claims the new-guineans are smarter than westerners!).The rest of the book more than makes up for it. Diamond has done an enormous amount of data gathering and analysis. In my opinion, he's done a great service to mankind (and people like me). The stuff you will find in this book is of universal interest (in my opinion), but very hard to classify and hence tough to find in one place. Could be compared to Godel Escher Bach (but maybe not in the same class as an intellectual effort). Kudos to him.Just btw: it won a Pulitzer too."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Having just finished this book, I have mixed feelings about the conclusions. First, let me make one thing perfectly clear: Reading this book is not a waste of time by any stretch of the imagination, so the one star reviews posted here are simply ridiculous. Having said that, I don't believe for a second that Mr. Diamond can be considered even remotely objective; political correctness and an unfair judgment of Europeans is a large part of this book, which is unfortunate.The positive aspects of this book are numerous. A carefully organized voyage through human history, describing the origins of farming, animal domestication, population expansion, language and writing development, new technologies, colonization of new continents, and more. All this information, and presented in a nice writing style with a logical progression. You can't help but feel more knowledgeable and informed on many aspects of human civilization after reading this book.The drawbacks to this book are simple: unfairness. Mr. Diamond rarely discusses European civilization and its benefits, instead describing colonization by Europeans as \\"catastrophic\\" under all circumstances. Some of his assertions as to why other peoples/continents lagged behind Europe in advancement and technology are quite reasonable, and probably correct. Others are glossed over quickly in hopes that the reader doesn't start to think about it too much. In regards to all the great geniuses that Europe has produced, he explains that they're \\"wild cards\\", and nobody knows how they figure into the grand scheme of human history. His view that New Guineans are smarter than Europeans (and white North Americans) is absolutely ludicrous. His basis for this judgment is that New Guineans are good at remembering jungle paths and plantlife, while white people watch too much TV. What!!? Hmmm...or could it be that if you had arrived at the conclusion that Europeans were smarter this book would never have been published, and you would have been dismissed as a racist! It's interesting to see that people are still against bigotry, unless it's aimed at white people.Those are some of the thoughts I had while reading \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\". It is definitely a worthwhile read for someone interested in human history and the dawn of civilization. Just be warned that this book is written from an extremely one-sided viewpoint, with Europeans and people of European descent not getting the credit they deserve."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Diamond's book is a gem (no pun intended). It's clear, well-written and geared to the general reader. This is the first science book that I found to be a &quot;page turner.&quot; This book rests on good science and a wonderful pulling together of different disciplines. Don't miss this book. It should be REQUIRED reading for every high school student and for all teachers."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Mr. Diamond's cientific and field knowledge gives him the background needed to write a good book on a tough subject. The points he makes are reasonable and even if you do not agree with him, reading through his reasoning will improve your knowledge about evolution and how our world was shaped.Be preprared to get tired tough. The book is too long and topics are repeated many times. Mr. Diamond's book could be more enjoiable if he used 100 pages less in the book."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Diamond's exhaustive but riveting work explains the core question of human history: Why did the Europeans end up running the world show while darker folks on other land masses seem to have been much less successful? According to Diamond's theories--solidly researched and fully plausible--the confluence of random factors of botany, zoology, and geography made the difference. Absolutely fascinating."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Jared Diamond beautifully explains the fundamentals of geography, geology and ecology that underlie historic inequality among the continents (and hence among the world's populations) by creating unequal opportunities and constraints. Why did Pizzaro conquer the Incas and Cortes the Aztecs -- but not the other way around? Why didn't Africa, humanity's cradle, make good on its apparent head start and become the dominant power in world affairs? As Diamond spells out, it all has to do with guns, germs and steel (and the dissemination of ideas, the distribution of large domesticable mammals, the prospects for food production, and many other forces). Anyone wanting insight into the world's fundamental inequalities need look no further than this marvelous volume."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"The basic thesis of Diamonds book is quite interesting, but seemingly for the sake of scientific accurateness, he feels compelled to make the same points over and over again. This makes the book much too lengthy - he could have done with a better editor."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"The first 2/3 is interesting and provocative. Based on the information given, this theory seems pretty sound.I feel the last section, which gives examples to back up his theory, is a bit redundant. Many of the examples were mentioned in the explanation of the theory, and it seemed as if every chapter started out &quot;Why did X conquer Y, instead of Y conquering X?&quot;The excellence and style of the first 2/3 make up for the lag at the end, though."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This book grabbed me for a good couple months - I couldn't have a conversation with anyone without bringing it up! It's a fascinating and convincing argument for basic geographic factors determining distribution of wealth in the world. I also liked the pictures he includes showing how people from different parts of the world look different, although I'm not sure how important it is to his arguments! One more note: it was a little depressing to hear how barbaric civilizations have been across the board for thousands of years."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"&quot;Guns,Germs and Steel&quot;, is one of those books you just can not stop reading page by page. Those needing to know how some nations have advanced, have withdrawn to the tail and why some have always struggle simply to survive will find this book as a most. One thing I would have added to the title is: Guns, Germs, Steel &quot;and Horses&quot;. The impact of this animal in the development of nations has not been properly recognized. The war machinery of conquests that moved culture from one side of earth to another could not have been possible without horses. Above all it is a book of the indomitable spirit of men to keep searching without pause. I would recommend also reading: &quot;History of Knowledge&quot;, to reinforce concepts that will help to enjoy, &quot;Guns, Germs and Steel&quot; even more. For us living in the third world, &quot;Guns, Germs and Steel&quot;, is a book to read and to reflec upon. No question it is a book of reference. The research done by the author is extraordinary. I recommend it."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Very readable and logically presented. An interesting cross disciplinary approach to answering the question of why Eurasia's civilizations advanced faster those of other regions, technologically and otherwise. The answer he proposes is geography. While this oversimplifies his case somewhat the basic reasoning is as follows: 1) The different regions of the world began with 'endowments' of domesticatable plants and large mammals (large mammals being especially important to the advancement of civilization as they provide labor, clothing, fertilizer, and above all, food) 2) It is significantly easier for plants and animals to spread along areas of similar climate so Eurasia's East-West orientation facilitated the spread of domesticatible plants and large mammals from one area to others whereas, other regions' (e.g., Africa, the Americas) North South orientation hindered this sharing of 'endowments' 3) To a lessor extent, the sharing of information / technological advances (e.g., the wheel, writen language) was also facilitated by Eurasia's East-West orientationThere are some weaknesses to the author's thesis to which he (refreshingly enough) openly admits. For instance, he is somewhat at a loss to explain why Eurasia's large mammals are so much more amenable to domestication than are Africa's.Stylistically, everything 'works' except for the last chapter where the author essentially bemoans the fact that his field is not more quantitative and lays out potential areas for futher research. The reader can easily skip the chapter and lose little. But after the pleasure of reading the rest of this book, you're likely to be willing to indulge him by reading the last chapter."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"The subtitle 'A short history of everybody for the last 13,000 years' gives an idea of both the scope and power of this work and also its shortcomings. Any attempt to encompass this huge field must necessarily be limited. However Diamond does a great job of outlining the [in his opinion] critical issues and historical determinants. At worst his book is an excellent springboard for more reasearch by the reader, it has certainly inspired me. I think it is one of those things that very few would be sufficiently 'aware' to critique Diamond on any other than a few areas of his analysis. I guess it is like looking up your own country in an encyclopedia to get an idea of how accurate the rest of the material is. In this regard I think Diamond should have [in my opinion] been more open about the assumptions he makes in regard to his analysis of government and religion, he seems to reify current analyses with a very functional analysis of society ie kleptocracy is necessary in order too...and so on. But overall one of those books that should be read by more, and ought to be read by those who won't."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I agree with the positive reviews of this incredible book. &quot;Guns, Germs, and Steel&quot; is an education unto itself. Every college student should be required to read it. I think those readers whose previous reviews charge that this book is too PC read this book from the perspective of a personal agenda. I even suspect that they are academic rivals of Jared Diamond. I hope others answer Jared's challenge at the end of the book to expand upon the theories and data brought forth in this seminal text. It manages to answer at least half of those questions you've had in your mind that begin, &quot;I wonder why...&quot;"},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Good analysis gets beyond proximate causes and into the actual causes for general technological development. It's presentation is balanced and reasonable not fanatical or political. Centered on the attempt to answer the question about the conquest of the New World by the Old, as opposed to the other way around. Primarily focussed on the presense of raw animal and plant materials for the development of domestication. But overall provides a fairly lucid presentation of human history before writing, which is typically inadequately dealt with in history books. For me, the only thing I didn't like was the title. The best pre-historical history book I have read. One apparent lacunae to me was neglecting the effect of the Mediterranean on the development of Southern Europe and North Africa. The Third Chimpanzee is also as good, but focusses instead on human development. Both are enjoyable."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Easy way to read &quot;Guns, Germs, and Steel&quot;: Flip to chapter 18, 'Hemispheres Colliding'. Read 20 pages instead of 500, and you have the gist of the book. Not only this, but Diamond repeats his thesis ad nauseam--that the only reason Western culture is the dominant one in the world today is an accident of geography. While his theories *do* have some merit, in my opinion, he discounts completely (no, I forget...he mentions it in the EPILOGUE)the human contribution to history. I realize that 'Great Man' historians are on the wane in the face of the spread of humanistic psychology and the PC craze--but are we then to conclude that we are all nothing more than a product of geography, without the chance to change history ourselves? As an historian, I say no. But then, I'm rather biased. As is Diamond, an evolutionary biologist--this bias shows. Take it for what it's worth, and remember my tip..."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"This is a wonderful, and transformative, book. It steps outside conventional histories and tells the story of the world's societies from the standpoint of geography, demography and agriculture. These elements are shown to be deteminative, in ways humans don't perceive as the events occur, much as Darwinian natural selection posits an analysis of enormous and inexorable forces at work to which the affected beings are oblivious. Wonderfully written, wonderfully researched and analyzed, it is a tour de force of popular scholarship and an unforgettably fresh perspective on, well, everything that ever happened in history."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Excellent prose. Well developed and thoughtful. Enjoyed the manner in which the story was told. Highly recommended for the inquisitive reader."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Jared Diamond explores the rise of ancient civilizations, and looks deep beyond just the proximate factors that so many are accustomed to. Why did ancient civilizations arise when they did? Why were some areas more agriculturally prosperous than others? Why was it the Europeans that colonized the other continents and not the other way around?Such questions are explored, delved into in a comprehensive, thorough manner (despite the fact Diamond is cramming thousands of years of ancient history/geography into a 400-page book) and, ultimately, answered.Jared Diamond's research, especially of New Guinea and the New Guineans, is interesting. It is clear he has spent a lot of time learning about New Guinea (how it used to be part of Greater Australia) and how New Guineans live now (and in ancient times). It seems Diamond has been devoted to this cause for years and this is one reason why Guns, Germs, and Steel is so effective.I also like how Diamond explains the concepts in his books in an accessible manner, ensuring that other people (who do not necessarily share his academic background) can understand his book. Nevertheless, Jared Diamond substantiates his facts with well-researched, plausible, and valid evidence.One is guaranteed to learn much about history, different cultures and how they arose, geography, and much more. It is all packed into this 400-something-paged book, a Pulitzer Prize winner titled Guns, Germs, and Steel.I am not a heavy non-fiction reader, and Guns, Germs, and Steel is one of the few non-fiction pieces I've picked up for awhile. Even for a heavy fiction reader who wouldn't normally read non-fiction, this book is compellingly fascinating in its attempt to explain the trajectory of ancient societies and how those courses affect the modern world today.I highly recommend this book to people interested in such topics, or even if you have no real interest and just want to read an interesting, engaging non-fiction book. This book will edify your knowledge on things that matter and topics worth thinking about."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Diamond is a researcher. He spent the first part of his career studying birds in New Guinea. This led him to consider why he is visiting New Guinea, rather than New Guineans visiting him. He does the best job I've ever heard of, of comparing the course of nations, but the work could have been done better. He presents his thesis twice (I'm guessing, because presenting it once would've left the book too short). The detailed examination of grain sizes and nutrition, the suitability of indigenous animals, all he covers, could be better coverd by a cultural anthropologist, but no such person had ever tried before, and none has since. These other reviewers eloquently note the shortcomings of Mr Diamond's efforts. Apparently no one has any sense that they can do better, and that, to me, is quite a puzzle."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"In GUNS, GERMS AND STEEL, Jared Diamond does a masterful job of coming up with a theory of the differences in environmental conditions that ultimately led to the domination of Eurasians in the world. The foundation of the theory is extremely well built, making it for a coherent and well thought out book. The main parts include:1) Agriculture - the author explains how agriculture evolved first in the Fertile Crescent (today's Middle East) and expanded to the rest of the world. He makes a good case for why it developed only much later in the Americas and Africa, and never in Australia.2) Herding - another interesting point, as the author demonstrates why animal herding grew in Eurasia but not in the Americas or Africa.3) Connection to political structure - the author proceeds to make the connection between agriculture and political structure, with plenty of empirical evidence. It is pretty amazing to see how archeologists take the smallest clues to come up with interesting theories.4) Political structure to germs and technology - that connection is, in my opinion, the most interesting one. The author is not the one to come up with this theory, but he is the one who put it all together for the layman. He shows how smallpox evolved from animals to men, and why it happened in Eurasia rather than anywhere else.5) Germs and technology to domination - finally, he connects the dots that lead from having germs and technology to dominating other peoples.I am truly impressed by the rationality of the argument. The only flaw I noticed is that the author is clearly biased in thinking that the environment was the sole major cause of everything. Though politically correct to blame the environment, there may be other causes, such as culture, that play a significant role in the fates of societies. For example, Larry Harrison makes this case in \\"Culture Matters\\".Overall, very impressive work of scholarship, deserves all the prizes it has gotten, and I will definitely incorporate these theories into my way of thinking. This book is a 10."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"Very informative and well written. However, the author's own experiences in his contacts with New Guinean hunter-gatherers may have led him to abandon his otherwise objective and critical views. We are all equal, but hunter-gatherers are more equal than others. Also, his account of the capture of the Aztec monarch by the Spanish draws upon data (for example, one the numerical odds and the relative importance of technological, epidemiological and cultural/political factors) which are by no means undisputed (see for example: George Raudzens, &quot;Main Reasons for Early Colonial Conquests, 1493-1788&quot;, in: G. Raudzens (ed.), Technology, Disease and Colonial Conquests, Sixteenth to Eighteenth Centuries: Essays Reappraising the Guns and Germs Theories. Leiden [etc.]: Brill, 2001, pp 31-57, which also refers to Diamond's book). Nevertheless, 'Guns, Germs, and Steel' presents a gripping narrative, especially the &quot;Speedboat to Polynesia&quot; chapter. It synthesizes information from vastly different fields that the average person wouldn't think of, and may prove an eye-opener to many."},{"Title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","review":"I find the book very comprehensive and easy to read. Mr Diamond does not try to hide under so called Christian Superiority, but lays bare all the scientific facts. His approach is way different from others on this topic. As other reviewers have pointed out that his conclusion is not new. But his way of taking you through all the clues of history is un-paralled. He wrote about touchy subjects like race without raising any dispute. Some has said that he has omitted religion and european zest for discovery in this book. Well, this is scientific book and not a Arabian Nights' Tales. In all, a superb book and must read for any student of history."},{"Title":"Sweet Release","review":"Normally I am not thrilled with debut novels but this one is an exception. Not only is the time period one of my favorites (American Colony 1730's) the chemisty between Alec/Cole and Cassie is wonderful!This book is full of the historical details that seperate historical romances from the contemporary romances. This book is lush in detail and Ms. Clare is true to the historical content and the use of slaves/bondsmen without going into to much detail that may be uncomfortable for some readers.Alec is an English Gentleman who has been abducted and forced onto a slaver. This ship is headed for the American colonies. When he arrives he is extremly ill and has no memory of what transpired to bring him to the shores of America. Cassie purchases his bond and nurses him back to health. When Alec comes to his scense he tries to tell everyone that there has been a big mistake and he is not Cole Braden defiler of women. Cassie does not believe him at first but allows him to send a letter to England to verify the fact that he is not telling the truth. While they wait for an answer he promises not to run away and that he will work for her.Cassie is automatically drawn to the dark handsome stranger who claims to be more then just a bondsman. While waiting for a response to his letter they get to know each other and admire the different traits that make them both so different. Soon they are in love but love between a free woman and a bond servant is against the law. Still these two find themselves together. Does Alec finally prove that he is innocent, and can he show Cassie that marriage is not a death sentence? The answer is yes but there are many hurdles these two must overcome before their happily ever after.Again this book was wonderful and I was sorry to see it come to an end. I look forward to more entertaining reading from this new author. Thanks Ms. Clare for bringing history back to the historical romance genre!!!"},{"Title":"Sweet Release","review":"I have seen in many reviews of historical romances (and have felt it myself) there is a dearth of historical in historical romances. The only difference between the historical romance and a contemporary is they ride horses instead of drive cars. Often it's REALLY hard to tell WHAT period you are in because so much of the historical has been cut away. The editors and publishers push for the leads to be on 'centre stage' and unless the history is driving importance, then they cut it. Which is a shame. There are a bunch of wonderful writers that can give you history AND ROMANCE. The trend came about because of competing with the net, they wanted a faster, leaner reads. Which is fine for a spell, but people are tired of this. Books are expensive and they want MORE for the money. They wants the sweeping panorama of history in all it's glory.I am GLAD to say Pamela Clare gives you a TRUE historical romance. It has romance, passion AND history. I almost felt like I had picked up a pre-net Historical romance - so a BIG round of applause for Clare writing this wonderful book and to DORCHESTER Publishing for ONCE AGAIN giving their writers the room to do books THEIR WAY!!! So if you wish for a historical romance that is MORE....please give this first time author a chance. You will not regret it!!I applaud Clare for dealing with the period, dealing with bondsman and slaves in a tender, yet not flinching fashion. I think many writers stay away from the period of 1700-1870s US because of the slavery issue. If you are accurate you turn people away, if you a kinder gentler version of GWTW people dismiss you. Clare chose this period and gives excellent treatment. And kudos to both her and her publisher!!Alex Kenleigh is a rich English shipbuilding. He warns his dissolute younger brother that he will no longer support his wicked lifestyle, that he is on a pocket money allowance, disgusted with his brother getting a teenage girl pregnant andthen turning his back on her while she dies trying to rid herself of the unwanted pregnancy. On the heels of this, someone mysterious catches Alex leaving his mistress' home and nearly beats him to dead. Worse, they have arranged to have a body left to be identified at Alex, while Alex is sent to the Americas as a criminal called Cole Braden. He is to serve 14 years as an indentured servant in Virginia, reported to be a defiler of women.Cassie Blakewell is running her father's plantation because her younger brother is just a child and her father is suffering from madness. A young woman in this period running a going concern would have been prey for either men pushing her into marriage hoping to gain control of the vast plantation or from do gooders demanding to do what is right and put a man in charge. Especially since her father has left her with a mountain of debts that it will take years to pay. The Creditors are willing to wait as long as they believe the story she is putting about that her father was in England. If she cannot keep this story going, the plantation will be seized for debts and sold.When the ship comes in with slaves and bondsmen for sale, Cassie buys the release of Cole Braden and the slave that hadprotected him and kept him alive for the long voyage. She buys him in a charitable act thinking he will die. But he does not, in fact in a short time he regains his strength. Only Alex is now furious to learn that is thought to be Cole, a criminal, and has been sold to Cassie for 14 years. He tried to prove he is Alex, but with communications as such during this period it will take months.Cassie and Alex has a slow burn attraction to each other, with Cassie not knowing whether to believe Alex or not. Yet, it does not stop the attraction. Still they have to keep distance for it could mean Alex's death if caught with her.Add into the mix, a foppish neighbour who is obsessively planning on marrying Cassie, pushed by a father who wants her lands. With strong supporting characters, this is a wonderful romance in the old fashion style of REAL Historical romances, with a good eye to details of the period.So APPLAUSE to Clare for writing it and sticking to her guns, and to Dorchester and the consistent policy of letting their writer WRITE.Hopefully, this is a new trend in old style historical romance!"},{"Title":"Sweet Release","review":"I won't detail the plot as others have done.

I can't remember the last book I read that absorbed me so in the characters, wrapped the story around my heart and held on until the last page was turned.

Meanwhile, an unwanted suitor pushes his case to marry Cassie adding pressure on Alec who needs his freedom to marry the woman who believes he is telling the truth.SWEET RELEASE is an exciting Colonial romance that grips the reader with action and plenty of romance while also insuring the cast seems genuine. The story line is fast-paced as Alec struggles to regain what he lost and much more. Cassie is a strong woman whose trust in her beloved is the extra impetus he needs to clear his name. If this novel is any indication of Pamela Clare's talent, fans of historical romance have plenty of reasons to rejoice.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Sweet Release","review":"YES to romance and YES to love but an even BIGGER YES to the passion in this the book. I have just started reading this style of storyline. I hope Ms. Clare has another coming out soon bcse other romance novels cannot compare!"},{"Title":"Sweet Release","review":"For years, I have waded through the same old dull Regency England drabble and tried to find something that was really innovative and fresh. I picked this book up purely by accident and wow, am I ever glad I discovered this author! I'm now working my way through all of her books and finding that romantic fiction has a bright, new star like we've not seen in a while.This first book by Claire is just a fabulous, believable journey through a period of American History so few have dared write about. But like some of the genre's greats (Sandra Brown comes to mind), it is the magnificent characters that steal the show. By the time you finish Sweet Release, you actually believe you have witnessed a short period in the life of the delightful Cassie and the sinfully delicious Alec. I found myself rooting for them out loud at various points. Anytime you 'talk' to a book, you know it's wonderful! The imagery, setting and storyline are all so well thought through as well. Trust me-order this novel and then get yourself a big, tall glass of iced tea, grab a fan, head for the back porch and find yourself on an early 1700s era Virginia plantation with a deliciously sexy couple. You'll never have a better time with a book."},{"Title":"Sweet Release","review":"I was completely captivated by the hero and heroine in this story. They are realistic, passionate and utterly mesmerizing! I have purchased several copies of this book for friends (male and female) and would recommend it to anyone. Pamela's writing is tactile and delicious and I absolutely could not put the story down. Happy reading, and here's to more books by Pamela Clare!"},{"Title":"Sweet Release","review":"Loved this book! Wow! What a love story! I usually never read historical romances, but I LOVE Pamela Clare's I-Team novels and thought I would give this a try. I am soooo glad that I did! She knows how to write the complete romantic love story!"},{"Title":"Sweet Release","review":"I am blown away that this was Pamela Clare's first book. Wonderful! She not only captured the era but the way she wrote these two characters... devine! I love seeing books where the main female character is strong willed, follows her own beliefs, and more importantly her heart! Alec ( Cole) and Cassie have you cheering from them in all aspects of the story. Move over Bella and Edward, Romeo and Juliet... here comes Alec and Cassie! A true love story!"},{"Title":"Sweet Release","review":"I would've given this book a 5 star rating had the author not drug the ending out. Poor Alec! I almost didn't finish that last 70 pages because of all the dramatic and terrible things that kept happening to Alec. Ms. Clare could've had Alec's brother-in-law come to the rescue much sooner and the book would have been better."},{"Title":"Sweet Release","review":"I won't detail the plot here because others have done that. Just let me say: buy this book! Sweet Release will remind you why you started reading romance in the first place.Great job Pamela!"},{"Title":"Sweet Release","review":"I read all of Pamela Clare's \\"I Team\\" series, as well as her \\"McKinnon's Rangers\\" series and loved them, so I thought I would try her other historical romances. I tried, and tried, and tried. There seemed to be way too much historical info and not enough romance. I'm not against historical books at all--I have read the \\"Outlander\\" series at least 4 times and enjoy them each time! This book, and it's two following stories, just dragged for me. I couldn't feel anything for either the heroine or the hero, which was just too disappointing for me since I really love all of the authors other books!"},{"Title":"Sweet Release","review":"I purchased this book on the advice of all the reviews on Amazon--was I dissapointed! This was so full of PURPLE PROSE I didn't want to finish. It was predictable and so sappy it was hard to take. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Sweet Release","review":"There was a chunk of the book in the middle that the story picked up and held my interest and I felt my fortunes were turning and the story would pick up. The detail and the development of the relationship had some merits and tried to show the hero and heroine developing over a period of time, but the darn story would not end. How many times could the hero get caught and get away, only to come back and get caught again. and again. and again. and... well you get my meaning.Also, while it was noble to try to portray slavery and indentured servitude in such a rosy light the historical facts support that slavery was a horrible part of america's history and indentured servants fared little better. Rape, abuse, terrorism, fractured families, disfigurement, illness and sure as heck not even minimum wage were prevalent. While it would be nice to wonder why we all just can't get along. I just could not suspend my belief as the author intended.I am officially worried about all the 5 star reviews as well since I purchased most of the books on the strength of them. I will be much more cautious in the future."},{"Title":"Sweet Release","review":"I didn't realize this was part of a trilogy - I found out after I read the 3rd book first! But it really doesn't matter, as both of those I read can truly stand alone. This was Clare's first novel, and it was a doozy! I found the story to be compelling and heartwrenching. A number of tears were shed by me - that's a sign of a good book to me! The romance was at times sweet, and then sizzling. They were great leads; but the secondary characters helped bring the book to life. You don't see many romances that deal with slavery in a serious manner; it was deftly handled here. Great story all around."},{"Title":"Sweet Release","review":"I decided to start Pamela Clare's romance with this book. I heard about her quite often. Some reviewer said she is a PERFECT PAMELA. Not many book she create, but I have some of her historical and contemporary.After read this book, I could only express it with words like \\"Awesome\\", \\"Perfect\\", \\"Remarkable\\" and etc. Even she said it by herself that this novel took her seven years to complete. She wrote it during some of the most difficult years of her life.Among the other novel she made, this is suppose her 'unfamous' one. But this book is already beyond my expectation, so I can imagine how romantic her other novels will be.'Sweet Release' have a likeable Heroine, great Hero, good romance, great drama, and one of the best love-scene I've ever read. There is one love-scene which I consider not like the usual Historicals I've read, but more to be a sweet erotic. Its kind a new thing to me. So, I agree with one of the reviewer who mentioned this one is a mixture between classic drama of 'old' debut of Kathleen E. Woodiwiss mix with Erotic Virginia Henley's.I can only say that if you like to read romance with great drama, then maybe you should try this book. Even its a bit long, but really worth it. 10* for me.Some book I had from her : Surrender, Untamed, Ride the Fire, Unlawful Contact. I am impatient to read them all! But I save the best for last."},{"Title":"Sweet Release","review":"What a great book!! I was amazed to realise this was Pamela Clare's debut book. Quite simply one of the best historical romances I have read lately!! Action, adventure, perfect setting, excellent plot, one of the best love stories!! LOVED IT!!"},{"Title":"Sweet Release","review":"This is a beautiful, well written historical romance set in the early 1700's with a long cast of characters in a fascinating story that leaves you completely satisfied. There's love, betrayal, obsession, suspense and just about every other emotion that I'm completely impressed it took place in under 400 pages.Alex Kenleigh is a strong, responsible and wealthy englishman who manages his family's shipping empire. On his way home, his coach is taken over by two hired thugs who are supposed to kill him. Instead, they badly beat him and double their profits by replacing him with a completely mutilated and unidentifiable dead body of a convict, putting an unconscious and dying Alex on a ship to America to be sold as slave labor.Cassie Blakewell has the weight of the world on her shoulders. Her father's mind is failing and she has a very young brother, heir to their estate, to look after until he's old enough. She knows if anyone finds out about her father's condition, she'll be forced into marriage by an appointed guardian, losing her family and her freedom. So instead, Cassie takes over the family plantation and tells everyone that her father is abroad traveling on business. With much work to be done, Cassie heads to the docks to purchase additional servants when she sees Alex barely alive being beaten some more. She's told his name is Cole Braden and he's a defiler of woman, but her heart won't let her see him suffer. She offers to purchase him knowing he'll likely die. In addition to Alex, she also purchases the one slave who showed compassion enough to help Alex.Of course Alex doesn't die and recovers rather quickly. He insists that he is not Cole Braden, but Alex Kenleigh, but no one believes him, except perhaps Cassie. She makes a deal with him and promises to pursue his claims if he'll stay, work hard and cause no trouble. As Cassie struggles to keep her family out of debt, she can't help but be drawn to Cole. Desperate and lonely, not wanting to believe he's a convict, she fantasizes that perhaps he is who he says he is and eventually falls completely in love with him. As their relationship develops, Alex becomes more desperate to prove who he is and is basically blocked at every turn, likely by the same people behind his initial attack. If anyone were to discover Cassie's affair with him, it would be the end of her reputation and likely their livelihood since no one will do business with an unmarried woman sleeping with a convict.Like most of her novels, Pamela Clare does not hide who the bad guys are, but she does try to throw you off track in various situations. I loved this book, and would have given it a five if it weren't for all the side stories and romances taking place. I loved Cassie and Alex so much that I wanted it to be all about them, but with a younger brother, some aspiring servants, friends, a spooky healer, and a very typical bad neighbor who wants Cassie for himself, the story sometimes veered in a direction that I didn't care enough about. Regardless, it's a keeper."},{"Title":"Sweet Release","review":"I don't agree with the reviews that this book dragged on- I finished it in several hours and loved every moment!This was a well-written and refreshing romantic tale- the character's relationship takes nearly 200 pages to grow before intimacy and their investment in each other seemed very authentic. It was fun to watch Alec, a wealthy gentleman, handle himself in the role of indentured servant, after being cruelly abducted, beaten, sold and waking to find himself very far from home. He handles the situation with amusement and strength, and falls in love with the unlikely object of his infatuation- the headstrong mistress of the plantation he finds himself at! The novel rounds out with an exciting and adventurous ending with a trial, escapes and hidden agendas... very fun!With a cast of delightful characters to boot and plenty of side stories to enjoy, this is definitely an engrossing and enjoyable read. I also really enjoyed the beautiful descriptions of colonial America and the fascinating process of farming tobacco... Ms. Clare did an amazing job with her storytelling. I found myself wanting to go to Virginia!!"},{"Title":"Sweet Release","review":"Trust me: Rush out and buy any book with Pamela Clare's name on it! I picked up Sweet Release and three other Pamela Clare books at a local used book store simply because I have quite possibly read every other historical romance out there, and these were new to me. I was floored. Truly, I read almost constantly, and have become somewhat \\"jaded\\" in that so many authors have become predictable and stale for me. Not so the case with Clare. Her characters seemed REAL and her plots were intricately developed so as to be believable. As a result, I felt really tied to this story. I laughed with it, I cried with it, I completely and thoroughly enjoyed it! I'd give this one \\"Sweet Release\\" 4 Stars because of some minor points where I became frustrated with the hero, but it was nonetheless a great book. The other three: CARNAL GIFT, RIDE THE FIRE, and SURRENDER were all 5+ Stars for me. Awesome, awesome, awesome work! I'm a devoted Pamela Clare fan now."},{"Title":"Sweet Release","review":"I fell in love with Sweet Release and it now holds a spot as one of my very favorite books. First off, the cover art is fantastic. It fits the story and is exaclty how I picture Alec in my mind.The story itself is heart warming, heart breaking and sincere. There are very few stories that can touch me enough to bring a tear to my eye, but this one got me right in the heart.I highly recommend this book as well as other titles by Pamela Clare."},{"Title":"Sweet Release","review":"I am not a fan of the ante-bellum South, but it was a good story. Historically accurate. Good book. I recommend it."},{"Title":"Sweet Release","review":"I love the Early American Colonial period for its raw frontier adventure feel so I picked up this book and settled in for a good read. I was not disappointed though this would not be a book that a person who leans more toward the historical than the romance in their fiction should probably enjoy as much. Not that it was inaccurate! It was just more character and plot driven in its focus.The story begins in London where we are introduced to Alec Kenleigh, the owner of a prosperous shipbuilding firm. Alec works with his brother in law and tries to keep his younger, wastrel of a brother in line. He gives his younger brother, Phillip is given an ultimatum after the last mess up. Soon after this, Alec is attacked and switched with a indentured convict, Cole Braden, to be shipped out to the Americas to work on a plantation for 14 years.The scene then shifts to the Virginia tobacco plantation owned by the Blackwell family. Cassie Blackwell, due to the need for secrecy regarding her father's condition, is now running her father's plantation alone and looking after her young brother, Jamie. She is in need of more workers because she has big plans to get the plantation out of debt and buys two men from the 'soul driver'. She purchases the white convict looking more dead than alive, Cole because she saw that he would die without care.Alec wakes up and finds himself in a nightmare. He is mistaken for a convict who ravished women, he has barely survived a sea voyage, and now he is someone's property for the next 14 years far from all that he has known. In the place of his absent owner, he finds that his mistress is a pretty woman who both attracts and repels him at the same time.While Alec and Cassie adjust to each other and work with the others to keep the plantation going as Alec waits for word from England, Geoffrey Crichton a young man from a neighboring plantation gets jealous of Alec because he wants Cassie for himself. Geoffrey stirs up all kinds of trouble not the least of which is setting a killer onto Cole and plotting to get Cassie by any means he can even if she is unwilling.The last half of the book is very thrilling between Geoffrey's wicked plotting and the building romance between Alec and Cassie. It kept crescendoing to a big ending and just when I thought it was over- nope, there was more excitement. I won't go into detail so it is not spoilt for anyone.As I said, the plot was strong and stayed that way. The book was written to switch points of view so multiple voices were heard. It was interesting knowing what many were thinking and it was not hard to follow the switches. Knowing Alec and Cassie's thoughts was helpful because they definitely were misunderstanding one another for a while. Alec and Cassie's relationship was handled well. Yes, they felt the spark of interest which they both explore a bit, but the complication of their circumstances was not forgotten and I was glad to see this as it made it more realistic. Eventually, their passion does overpower them, but even then there is still no easy 'I love you and all the barriers will go away now'. Their love is really tested in a few different ways before all is said and done.There are also side story lines like the little romance between Zach and Elly and that between Luke and Nettie. There was also Geoffrey's inner thoughts to show why he did what he did. I wanted to hate him and I did, but there was a little part of me that pitied him too because of knowing his thoughts.The characters were well written. I enjoyed how each character whether minor or major had a persona when they were introduced. The people on the plantation and in the overall community were not just props and foils for the main characters. I cracked up over Nan, the cook. Now there was a gal one didn't mess with and she had a no-nonsense way of talking.I noticed after I read this that this was Pamela Clare's debut effort. Truthfully, I found that hard to believe as this rivals some of the best writers of the historical romance craft. I will definitely be seeking out more of her books."},{"Title":"Faith healer: A drama","review":"If, like me, you had Brian Friel down as some sort of bog-trotting hickster, an intellectually acceptable John B. Keane if you like, prepare to be astonished. 4 monologues, 3 characters, 2 ghosts, 2 crucial incidents. Faith healer, wife/mistress, Cockney manager. Visit minor villages of Celtic Britain doing their act - miscarriage; fatal confrontation with Donegal yokels. Crosscurrents of memory, self-interest, self-mythologising, and evasion litter witness-accounts, contradicting, negating, enriching.You can read this remarkable text in a number of ways (it helps to remember the lovely James Mason played Frank in the first performance): as a Nabokov/Banville-like narrative of an amoral, charismatic monster with a beguiling way with words, whose very artistry facilitates some kind of transcendence; as an analysis of the artist, the necessary mixture of fraudulence and healing power; as a story of brutal men and the pain they wreak on their women. So much more. The play is full of words, rich, incantatory words that seem to spin a fragrant web of matchless b.s., and yet, at the end, dissolve phantasmogorically, transforming provincial crime into an enchanted, disembodied, visionary realm."},{"Title":"Faith healer: A drama","review":"Brian Friel, one of Ireland's leading contemporary dramatists, creates an unusual and absorbing drama about \\"The Fantastic Francis Hardy,\\" a faith healer originally from Ireland, who has been traveling the small towns of England, Wales, and Scotland with his wife Grace and his manager Teddy. On some nights several people in a small audience may be healed, but, nine times out of ten, no one is. \\"Am I endowed with a unique and awesome gift?\\" Frank wonders. \\"Am I a conman?\\" He believes he falls somewhere \\"between those absurd exaggerations.\\"The play has no interactive scenes. In separate monologues each character stands alone on an almost-bare stage, and all attention is riveted on him/her. In glorious language, each person reveals the problems which torment him/her. Talking about his days on the road with Grace and Teddy, Frank discusses his recent return to Ireland, where, in a local pub, he made two attempts at healing, but he refuses to say much more.The suspense builds in the next act, as the distraught speaker is Grace, a former lawyer who gave up everything to follow the charismatic Frank. As she tells of her love for Frank, his treatment of her, and the terrible conditions of life on the road, the audience is unsure why they have been living apart. The third speaker, the devoted Teddy, fills in some gaps between the monologues of Frank and of Grace, though we still do not know what has happened--until Frank's final monologue.In the hands of outstanding actors, these monologues are powerful theater. (James Mason was Frank in the 1979 New York run of the play.) In a repeating incantation, Frank and Grace \\"sing\\" the names of the small towns in Scotland and Wales to which they have journeyed, connecting their monologues through this repetition and different memories of the same events. Surprisingly, the lyrics of Jerome Kern's \\"The Way You Look Tonight,\\" which Teddy uses as background music during Frank's healings, echo through Teddy's monologue, which achieves great irony when he sings, \\"I will feel a glow just thinking of you...\\"As the audience develops interest in and empathy for the speakers, the tension rises. Gradually one becomes aware that time has passed between these monologues, and Frank's concluding monologue is stunning. Friel manages, somehow, to create an involving and powerful drama, despite the fact there is no on-stage interaction and the characters flout the \\"rules\\" of theater by \\"telling about\\" events instead of reenacting them. Memorable and haunting, both as an overall play and as close-ups of three individual characters, this is Friel in one of his most compelling and unusual plays.

I have continued to read and re-read this over the last few years. In the best possible sense, it is a Saturnian treatment of the transits of Saturn. There is also a great deal of other high quality non-Saturn astrology here.In addition to her obvious extensive experience as a practising astrologer, Erin Sullivan draws extensively on depth psychology and classical mythology to portray Saturn's developmental influence on our lives. The fourth section of the book, \\"The Personal Heroic Journey\\" stands out for me. Here the journey of Saturn around the birth chart is illuminated profoundly and accessibly. Sullivan begins the cycle at the midheaven and tenth house stage, \\"The Call To Adventure\\" as she terms it, in contrast to the more conventional viewpoint that places the ascendant and first house at the beginning of the cycle. From there on she comments on Saturn's movement round the chart and the various inner and outer lessons it has to teach us.Countless practical examples are referred to throughout, with two contrasting case histories at the end showing how different but essentially similar each individual's \\"heroic quest for meaning\\" can be.

I've studied astrology off and on for a few years and knew there had to be a reason for the drastic changes, but until I read this book, I didn't connect what or how to deal with it..So now I am prepared for 2006!

I had several \\"Aha\\" moments that released and healed me concerning particular phases of my life that I was not proud of, nor particularly understood. I now understand! Each and every phase was an essential part of my destiny. Sullivan has helped me to look back on my own life with the eyes of compassion and the understanding and wisdom of an astrologer. Not only is this book insightful and healing, but it is brillantly and beautifully written, revealing an exceptional mind which I deeply admire. I love the scholarly feel of how Sullivan writes.

And, I was disappointed that the \`Survey' didn't include Wright's outline of Romans, which I think is one of the most valuable parts of Wright's Interpretation.Needless to say, the full 'New Interpreter's Bible' is a superb resource so a part of that set will also be valuable, but the \`marginal' value of this \`Survey' is rather small if you have access to the full twelve (12) volumes."},{"Title":"New Interpreter's Bible New Testament Survey","review":"This is an excellent resource for bible study, both historically as well as practical application.

Venerable Master Hsing Yun of the Fo Guang Shan (Buddha's Light Mountain) Buddhist Order, Taiwan, has been a Buddhist scholar and writer for more than 55 years. This biography documents his early struggles to survive in China during the Japanese invasion of the late 1930s, through his equally difficult times after coming to Taiwan in 1949, to the development of one of the largest and most influential Chinese Buddhist Orders in today's world.Venerable Master Hsing Yun is seen as a reformer (if not revolutionary) of Buddhism which in China had for many centuries retreated to the &quot;Mountains and Forests.&quot; Through his remarkable resolve and diligent practice, he has brought a renaissance of the essence of original Buddhism to the every day lives of today's laity. Through a system of over 200 temples world-wide and a lay-Buddhist organization (Buddha's Light International Association), millions of people in many countries have been introduced to the teachings of the Buddha. Through his innovative methods as well as compassion, he has popularized the Buddha's teachings in a realistic and practical way for both personal and social transformation. Master Hsing Yun has inspired so many people though his work to &quot;localize&quot; Buddhism for the benefit of all sentient beings. As a caring and pragmatic educator, he continues into his 75th year to be a catalyst to so many people for both personal development and service to this world. The reader will not only clearly understand the causes and conditions out of which Venerable Master Hsing Yun arose, but also the benefits he continues to offer."},{"Title":"Two of a Kind: The Hillside Stranglers","review":"I loved this book. I inherited among others from a deceased family member (among other books).The \\"Hillside Strangler\\" became an everyday headline that frightened Los Angeles for a year or so in the late 1970's. During that year, bodies of young women started showing up on the hillsides around the city. But the horror waned beside the revelations that came to light in what became the longest criminal trial in American history--BEFORE O. J. Simpson's 1994 trial--and one of the most controversialThe Hillside Strangler was thought to be one person with a real fast pace in killing. With TWO OF A KIND, Darcy O'Brien gives the inside story and is the first book to make the shocking disclosure that \\"the Hillside Strangler\\" was not one man, but two, and not only that -- they were were cousins!In Mr. O'Brien's riveting story examines the relationship between the murderers and the drive behind their hideously evil crimes. It tells the entire story of the Hillside Stranglers as it has never been told before. He begins with the stranglers themselves who just decided one night out of bordom that they hated women and wanted to kill them (even as one strangler was living with a pregnant girlfriend and hiding the truth of his killing spree from her).It reveals the torture, the prostitution ring, the killings. But it also shows the other side of the drama--the law. The police were so baffled by the disappearing women and then the subsequent finding them on a hillside dead, that they took drastic measures to ensure justice would prevail in this case.TWO OF A KIND is a true story of crime and punishment here and now. But even more disturbing, it is a tale of primal evil rising from the darkest human depths and our age-old struggle to defend ourselves from it."},{"Title":"Two of a Kind: The Hillside Stranglers","review":"Readers of True Crime will find this out-of-print book worth the search. The author not only compellingly writes about the rape, torture and murder of 10 young women in Los Angeles in the late 1970's but also provides insight into the strange relationship between the two cousins who commit these unthinkable crimes.A young, charismatic man, under an almost hypnotic spell of a truly evil older uncle takes center stage in the longest criminal trial in this country. The defense of &quot;multiple personalities&quot; was as much on trial as the guilt or innocence of the defendants.I liked this book very much because the characters--victims, murders, investigators, lawyers and judge--became real people as I read. The trial was especially intriguing as the prosecutor, defense attorney and judge laid the groundwork for a strange and new defense. This book would certainly not be a disappointment.From"},{"Title":"Two of a Kind: The Hillside Stranglers","review":"This is the definitive work about the Hillside Stranglers case.

The fact that is out of print made it somewhat difficult to acquire a copy. As a whole, it was worth the wait. The book is well scripted and informative on the subject of two of America's most noted killers and perhaps most famous killing duo.Angelo Buono had his way with women, but his anger toward his mother and failed relationships caused something to crack inside him. While he was violent and neglectful of women, it was not until he formed an unholy alliance with his cousin Kenneth Bianchi that he began to kill women. The duo killed ten women who were mostly prostitutes through the means suggested in the book's title. However, the murder of two school girls certainly raised my ire toward them. Although the duo was under suspicion, it was not until the pair \\"broke up\\" that the heat rose. Bianchi killed two women on his own to satiate his lust, but was not nearly as efficient without his cousin.The one aspect of the book I disliked was that there seemed to be more focus on the detectives than the criminals. This was a small flaw in the grand scale. The book was well written and tough to put down. Even knowing the results of the trial, the writing managed to keep me on the edge of my seat wondering what might happen next. I even doubted the possibility of conviction for a moment. Although it is often verbose and quite lengthy at times, I would recommend this work of true crime."},{"Title":"Two of a Kind: The Hillside Stranglers","review":"I reread this book every couple of years.

A good supplement is Taiwanese writer Bo Yang's *The Ugly Chinaman and the Crisis in Chinese Culture,* which traces, frankly and informatively, the long, sad history of cultural stagnation and repression which is the other half of China's story in addition to Confucius and the poetry of Li Po, and has an impact on encounters between Westerners and Easterners today. Most important is Bo Yang's comments on the concept of &quot;Face&quot; - that is, the importance of not losing face to a Chinese - this is more important to a Chinese than anything else, and can affect the subject under discussion in a business meeting. The more aware the Western business person (or again, traveller) is of Chinese society, the more successfull his trip will be (and the more positive his appreciation of China, ultimately, will be). The style of *The Ugly Chinaman* will give you additional insight into how Chinese culture differs from ours.Another book I recommend is Paul Theroux's account of travelling across China, *Riding The Iron Rooster*. Many aspects of this far-flung trip mirrored my own practical experiences business-travelling in a much smaller part of China (and Hong Kong). I found it enlightening and helpful as a general, prepatory work (it is also highly readable).For Hong Kong, in addition to Bo Yang's book, I recommend Jan Morris's book *Hong Kong* which has a wealth of detail on the unhappy history of the millions of refugee Chinese who fled to British Hong Kong in the last four or five decades and who are (understandably) very touchy about this subject (it involves, again, loss of &quot;face&quot;). In Hong Kong today there is a reluctance to admit this sad history but a knowledge of it is essential to understanding how Hong Kong ticks, and a business traveller who absorbs this knowledge will be in a better position to understand Hong Kong. The book also contains a wealth of absorbing, easy to read history about British days.Paul Theroux's book, *Kowloon Tong* though a novel, captures the mood of Handover-era Hong Kong and has illuminating portraits of different types of Western and Chinese characters of a kind you will meet and interact with if your stay in Hong Kong is extended or you are domiciled there."},{"Title":"Business China (International Business Culture)","review":"This informative little 55 page paperback book gives summary comparisons of business practices in China versus the United States.

I bought a beat-up, very old and soiled copy of Parnassus on Wheels from the outside bin of a used book store. I was attracted by the title alone. It's the story of how the retiring owner of a turn-of-the-century horse-drawn bookmobile persuades a dutiful author's sister to step away from her housekeeping life to be a countryside book peddler. Adventure and romance ensues. I read it in one afternoon. It is not Henry Esmond, Middlemarch or any of my other epic favorites, but I can't seem to forget it, and recommend it to friends whenever I get a chance. It was just a pleasure to read. It's a splendid little gift to yourself!"},{"Title":"Parnassus on wheels;","review":"Christopher Morley on Christopher Morley: \\"His early writing, which was (though not intentionally) imitative and immature, was received with absurd overpraise.\\" Morley's self evaluation was overly critical. Now, nearly 90 years later, Morley's early works, especially Parnassus on Wheels (1917) and its sequel, The Haunted Bookshop (1919), are still widely praised.Roger Mifflin, the exuberant, irrepressible, itinerant book seller, is one of the most beloved characters of twentieth century fiction. But the central character in Parnassus on Wheels is really Helen McGill, the pragmatic and hardworking sister of the much admired writer, Andrew McGill. Having baked some 6,000 loaves of bread for her brother in the last fifteen years, Helen was primed for change. When Roger Mifflin placed his horse-drawn library, Parnassus, for sale at $400, Helen, age 39, withdrew her savings and began the adventure of her life. As a neighbor exclaimed, \\"Think of Parnassus turned suffrage!\\"Parnassus on Wheels, like its marvelous sequel, The Haunted Bookshop, is a delightful mix of engaging characters, lively plot, and thought provoking, common sense philosophy. Christopher Morley, later founder and editor of the Saturday Review, cleverly employed his remarkable traveling bookseller to expound on Morley's own deep commitment to good literature. Here is one of Roger Mifflin's most quoted statements: \\"Lord!\\" he said, \\"when you sell a man a book you don't sell him just twelve ounces of paper and ink and glue - you sell him a whole new life.\\"Whatever you do, don't stop with Parnassus on Wheels. Immediately find a copy of its splendid sequel, The Haunted Bookshop.

Clever and witty."},{"Title":"Parnassus on wheels;","review":"This is the first book published by American author, poet, and journalist Christopher Morely (1890-1957). Morely delivers lots of intriguing characterizations and action, swirling around a bookstore on wheels and those who owned it. There are plenty of references to outstanding books of the past and of Morley's present (1917), and I tend to think that Morely put quite a bit of himself into making the work \\"come alive.\\" This is not deep literature but a foray into the backroads of rural East Coast living. Undoubtedly my grandparents would have given the work a double nod for its realism and folksy flavor."},{"Title":"Parnassus on wheels;","review":"I loved this book from the first page to the last.

Highly recommend this one."},{"Title":"Parnassus on wheels;","review":"This is a delightful book written in the early 1900's. The story is light-hearted and sentimental by today's standards, but it is a joy to read. It accurately captures an earlier time of this century when much of the population was isolated, and travel by wagon was the norm. It is enjoyable also for the small details of daily life, such as the references to gas lamps and the types of food eaten then. Some of the references are dated, but the thoughts on books and bookselling are as timely as ever. In fact, the last order I received from Amazon contained a bookmark that had a quote from this very book! The book is apparently hard to obtain; I was lucky enough to find it in our city library. And the best news is that the sequel, The Haunted Bookshop, is much better than this volume.

It brought tears to my eyes and made me laugh, and that doesn't happen often when I'm reading a book.

It is a charming portrait of a bygone era, and yet it captures those things which are eternal -- the love of learning, the power of human feeling, and the irresistible bond of kindred spirits."},{"Title":"Parnassus on wheels;","review":"Gutenberg made the printed word available to the masses, but that doesn't mean that everybody bothered. That problem fuels \\"Parnassus on Wheels,\\" a sweet little story about books and an unlikely romance, between a quirky bookseller and a stodgy spinster.Andrew McGill became an unexpected literary hit when he wrote a book called \\"Paradise Regained\\" about a farmer's rural life. For his second book, he went trudging around the countryside for more material, leaving his middle-aged sister Helen to stay home and keep house for him. But one day a strange little man arrives at Helen's home, in a bookshop on wheels. The odd Roger Mifflin wants to sell Andrew his Parnassus -- his portable bookshop -- and intends to wait until Andrew returns.Desperate to keep her brother from vanishing into the sunset, Helen takes her savings and buys the Parnassus herself. Then, out of regret for the life she has never gotten to experience off the farm, Helen decides to spend some time driving the Parnassus around the countryside. And as Roger teaches her about books and their importance, she begins to see just how a book -- any book -- can change a person's life.\\"Parnassus on Wheels\\" is not a really outstanding book, but it is charming and sometimes very funny. Christopher Morley gives a glimpse into an earlier era, when rural areas didn't have libraries, there was no Internet to show people what was for sale, and a lot of people read nothing but the Bible.There really isn't much of a plot, since most of it consists of Roger and Helen puttering around the countryside in the Parnassus. If there is a plot at all, it's the sort-of-romance between the two of them. It's cute and slightly sentimental, but peppered with humor such as Andrew and Roger getting into a very undignified fistfight in the road.Helen starts out as a rather annoying character -- she's prejudiced against people who read, and seems to think that people should simply stay on the farm. That makes it all the more enjoyable when she starts appreciating the written word, and decides that she's not going to be an unappreciated bread-making automaton anymore. Roger Mifflin is actually not as odd as he seems to Helen's eyes, although he does have some charming quirks.\\"Parnassus on Wheels\\" isn't deep or detailed enough to really be a classic, but it is a charming little early-1900s novel. Not to mention a must-read for bibliophiles."},{"Title":"Parnassus on wheels;","review":"Christopher Morley's 'Parnassus on Wheels' attracted my attention alongside its sequel, The Haunted Bookshop, in a used book store in upstate New York on a book-buying vacation I took last year. The title 'Haunted Bookshop' is sure to attract most bibliophiles, and to read the dustflap and see that it was a sequel to Parnassus, with Parnassus sitting right there next to it, was too much a temptation to pass up, at least for me.When the traveling bookshop 'Parnassus' rolls up to Sabine Farm, spinster Helen McGill finds herself attracted not only to the books inside, but to the life of Parsassus's proprietor, Roger Mifflin, as he recounts his travels to and fro, here and there, bringing great literature and joy into the lives of his customers. At once charmed and intrigued by the man and his profession, Helen resolves to purchase the Parnassus, upon offer of sale, from Roger Mifflin, who in reality came to discuss the possibility of sale to Helen's brother Andrew, a locally famous chronicler of the virutes of a simple, farming life.Once the sale is complete, Helen and Mifflin depart Sabine Farm to begin Helen's life on the road selling books, with a furious Andrew not far behind, determined to bring to justice this man who has swindled his sister.Though a very quick read at a mere 160 pages, this delightful novella has all the charm, wit, and literary name dropping that a reader could want. This book took me, literally, an hour and a half to read, but will remain with me for some time, and is one I will definitely recommend to other lovers of such stories.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Parnassus on wheels;","review":"I orginally found this book in my grandfather's bookcase in the mid 1950s.

My life has been made much richer by this public domain Kindle download. Written in 1917 by 27-year-old Christopher Morley, it looks at the world through a woman's eyes at a time when women were generally not given much consideration. I was surprised to see a book so sympathetic to women at that time. Some of the language was unfamiliar, but on my Kindle, an instant dictionary was at hand. I did have to go to Wikipedia.com to learn about \\"Parnassus,\\" or what we today call a bookmobile, named for Mt. Parnassus of Greek mythology, the center of poetry, music, and learning. We see laughter, fright, learning, and love through the adventures of 39 year-old Helen McGill as she breaks away from the drudgery of keeping a farm going and taking care of her brother. She realizes she has baked 6,000 loaves of bread in the last 15 years and it's time to get a life of her own. So, she becomes a bookseller in the Parnassus on wheels and very quickly turns her life around. Don't miss the sequel, The Haunted Bookshop.

I jokingly told her that as penance for her biblioblasphemy, she had to read Morley's Parnassus on Wheels. This in turn led me to reread the book, and I was just as delighted by it as I was when I read it as a teenager over 40 years ago.Anyone who loves books and the countryside will love Parnassus on Wheels. It's an Adam of the Road sort of story: Roger Mifflin, a traveling bookseller, roams the farmlands and backwoods of the nation spreading the gospel of books. His faith in the power of the word is boundless. People need books, he insists, even if they don't know they need them, and his mission is to deepen the spirit and broaden the imagination of the folks he encounters by matching them up with just the book they need. Along the way he meets Helen McGill, a good-hearted spinster, and they share adventures while falling in love with one another.The plot sounds simple, and it is. But the story is written with easy grace and the characters are attractive. But what makes the story so appealing for the bibliophiles for whom Morley wrote it is the intense love of books and reading that permeates every chapter. Reading Roger Mifflin wax lyrical about specific books makes us hunger to read those books ourselves. I remember that when I first read Parnassus as a youngster, I jotted down a reading list culled from the book. Roger gave me good advice. Some of the authors he mentioned have sustained me ever since.But is Roger's love of books as antiquated--and perhaps quaint--as the horse-drawn wagon from which he sells his treasures? Has the media age's focus on images and the publishing conglomerates concern for profits over quality made book-loving a relic of the past? I don't know. But if so, I'm happy to be a dinosaur."},{"Title":"Parnassus on wheels;","review":"Are you wishing to take a break from heavy reading?

This may be exactly what most aspiring home-businesspeople need; still, I would imagine that readers seeking practical specifics may be disappointed.As a self-help success guide, however, this is a fantastic book; one of the best I've ever read.

I have read &quot;Hyperion&quot; several times and it has become my personal bible. Poetry and elation for changing the world. The drama of it.This version is in the original German. If you are an English reader just look for an english translation. In any case you will be delighted or maybe your life will change as that of mine when I read it for the first time.

Reagan was determined to rebuild US relations with these key allies that were the bulwark of the strategy of containment of the USSR, and the author shows how the Kissingerite faction sought to undercut Reagan's efforts to this effect. Regarding US relations with Britain, Thornton covers some of the ground he already examined in a previous work, The Falklands Sting.Thornton argues that Reagan's policy towards Britain sought to kill two birds with one stone. By precipitating war in the South Atlantic, and ensuring that Britain won it, Reagan would strengthen Thatcher's tottering leadership, thus ensuring that Britain remained the essential US bridge to western Europe, and would also eliminate the Argentine military dictatorship that was pursuing nuclear weapons. Thornton shows that Thatcher spooked Argentina into invading prematurely, so that the British could respond before the onset of South Atlantic winter, and Reagan encouraged the Argentine move by leading them to assume the US would support them and not Britain in the ensuing crisis. Thornton shows how Reagan and Thatcher countered Haig and Pym, both of whom wished to see Thatcher fall for the precise reason that she desired a strong relationship with the US in order to counter the Soviet Union. The defeat of Haig and Pym \\"strengthened the US-British strategic partnership, secured the Atlantic bridge to continental western Europe, and strengthened the Western Alliance.\\" Also, Haig's defeat over the Falklands set the stage for his subsequent removal.The author considers that Helmut Schmidt wished to parlay West Germany's rise to economic superpower status into hegemony over Europe, using the elimination of superpower political influence through nuclear arms control agreements as a vehicle. The US deployment of missiles to Europe was a major obstacle to this, and Schmidt thus tried to create conditions that made deployment impossible. Specifically, he sought to get Holland, Belgium, and Italy to reject deployment, which would allow Germany to reject deployment as well. Schmidt also insisted on early US arms control talks with the Soviets. Thornton shows that Reagan countered by gambling, correctly, that the Soviets would reject the \\"zero option\\" at arms control talks, and devised a set of economic sanctions against the USSR that were designed to curtail West Germany's \\"move to the middle\\" between the US and USSR. Reagan's success brought about a major conservative realignment throughout Europe and reintegrated the NATO alliance.Japan, like West Germany, had sought its own version of detente with the USSR in the 1970s, and tried to \\"move to the middle\\" by weakening its ties to the US while improving relations with the USSR. Japan declined to maintain anything but the most modest military capability, removing even the slightest threat to the Soviets in the Far East. Meanwhile, the Soviets built a massive Pacific Fleet and deployed significant forces to the Kurile Islands. Reagan offered Japan a bargain -- if Japan increased defense spending, thus relieving some pressure on overstretched US forces, the US would open its markets wider to Japanese exports. If Japan refused, Reagan threatened to curtail Japanese access to US markets. Prime Minister Suzuki dragged his feet on cooperating, but ultimately the threat that Japan would be exposed to Soviet military coercion without any US protection, plus the prospect that the US would close its markets to Japanese goods and strengthen relations with China at Japan's expense, precipitated Suzuki's resignation. Nakasone then restored close US-Japanese relations, which marked the final success in Reagan's effort to rebuild the alliance with Britain, Germany, and Japan.This excellent book should be read in conjunction with the other books in the currently ongoing series."},{"Title":"Maimouna d'Abdoulaye Sadji: Etude (Approche de l'oeuvre complete) (French Edition)","review":"Il s'agit, dans Mamouna, d'une petite fille africaine qui m&egrave;ne une vie innocente &agrave; Louga.

And that's the point.In this book, he tosses out his ideas, making up for accuracy with volume. Pabulum-puking liberals were the enemies, even if Mort was a card-carrying liberal back in the day.

Since color illustrations were costly and time consuming, these armorial bearings were most often described in written form using the unique language of heraldry, a mixture of English and French from a time long past which is largely unintelligible to the reader of today. This little book provides a very good key to deciphering that language, and offers a wealth of useful information on the history and design of coats of arms and other works of heraldic art.Its small size, thin width, and simplistic illustrations might lead one to believe that this is a children's book. However, the text is definitely written for an educated person, and a basic knowledge of European history and geography is assumed. You're expected to know, for example, who the Tudors and Plantagenets were, along with many other royal personages of Europe. The bulk of the book is essentially a glossary of heraldic terminology, though written in paragraph form and organized thematically rather than alphabetically. An alphabetical index resides in the back. The terms are accompanied by simple line drawings illustrating the basic elements of heraldic design. The book does not confine itself merely to the design of the coat-of-arms shield, but also encompasses the broader picture of crests, seals, badges, supporters, and orders of knighthood that accompany the shield in a complete heraldic achievement. There is also some discussion of the practical workings of heraldry, such as the methods used to distinguish the arms of multiple heirs in a family or the combination of arms through marriage. The primary focus of the book is the heraldry of Great Britain, with a chapter on international heraldry that touches on the other nations of Europe and their colonies elsewhere in the world.For those wishing to try their own hand at creating heraldic art, this little book gives you everything you need to know to design your own coat of arms. Your task will be made difficult, however, by the multitude of options it makes available to you. In short, the scant 92 pages of this little guide are packed with valuable material. It provides a comprehensive introduction to heraldry that is fascinating, informative, and fun."},{"Title":"The Mind of the Market: Spiritual Lessons for the Active Investor","review":"Well worth the money!

In fact most of the text is changes in corporate finance over the years, boom/bust periods as in &quot;madness of crowds&quot;. Lots of market history. There is no investing method per se, as stated in one review. It can be summed up as: trade with the trend, cut you losses, don't bet too much on one stock, and money goes where it is treated best. The market psychology is the same thing in other books.Because of the high praise this book recieved I was expecting some new insights or a different perspective on market psychology. Here it failed miserably.

Anne Ree Colton has broken this down into &quot;7 year&quot; segments from birth to death which she describes as &quot;Etheric Cycles&quot;, in which each segment or cycle dictates the evolvement of the person on the Physical plane, while highlighting the &quot;impress of the Soul and Past life&quot; that occurs during each cycle( such as 0-7 years, 7-14 years, 14-21 years, etc.)As a mother of young children, it is nice to &quot;see&quot; the stages that my children are &quot;spiritually&quot; going through, so as to guide them smoothly. Also a good way to &quot;see&quot; where you and others are at on a &quot;Soul Level&quot; - just by knowing the age !Included were many wonderful and powerful Mantrams (affirmations) for all ages and situations with instructions and times for performing.Though the book's description focuses on &quot;past lives&quot; - I felt this description did not do justice to the content - as this was more geared to understanding your Soul in this Life and the accompanying personal lifestyle and personality - so as to &quot;prepare&quot; you for successful and fulfilling future lives. Many fine and easy to understand passages are made in regards to this.I highly recommend this book and many of Anne Ree's other books - she is/was a wonderful Medium and Oracle for The Divine and has brought us Gifts of Knowledge and Wisdom through her books; even though she has long passed on. For the &quot;serious beginner&quot; or long-time Seeker of Spirituality - you will not be disappointed.Peace and Blessings to you !"},{"Title":"Mothman and Other Curious Encounters","review":"This book was a nice try at capturing the Mothman events in our home town of Point Pleasant, WV. The author missed (or just hurried past) several inaccuracies in what little is written about the Mothman in this volume. Most of the book is about other creatures, the Mothman has a small place just big enough to draw moviegoers to buy the book. There is no Route 66 in Point Pleasant, WV like is stated in this book. The route is 62. There are too many other mistakes to take up space in this review. [In my opinion, the book was] printed to take advantage of the Sony Pictures movie release, because the content is scarce and vastly inaccurate. (whatever you do, don't trust this book as a reference guide) [I don't feel] this author studied this subject very well before spitting out this attempt at the Mothman story. It had some decent info, but nothing that hasn't been printed by John Keel.

They defy being trapped like butterflies under a glass jar by &quot;experts.&quot; Classification eludes us. No one has yet managed to codify a taxonomy of these bizarre, reality-bending bandits.Loren Coleman is reminiscent of the best Fortean writers that precede him. He recognizes that definitions and explanations are impotent in the face of the inherently undefinable and inexplicable.Coleman's freedom from dogma allows him to offer multiple, simultaneous perspectives without falling into wide-eyed credulity.A jewel of the genre and worth every dollar of the price tag."},{"Title":"Mothman and Other Curious Encounters","review":"This book owes nothing to other books and it was written before the movie came out.

It says Route 62 in the \\"Third Edition\\" now and its chuck full of new stories, references, quotes, insights, and other things that are not in John Keel's great book which was more of a time-piece, since it came out in 1975. This book is a reflective work, up-to-date with things that happened in 2001 and 2002. Heck, there's only three books in the world on Mothman.

Great Work Lornen!!!!"},{"Title":"Mothman and Other Curious Encounters","review":"This book, a follow-up to Mysterious America by cryptozoologist Loren Coleman, is basically a compendium of reports, anecdotes and myths dealing with strange creatures.Apparently published to capitalize on the film \`The Mothman Prophecies' (the back of the book displays a prominent ad for the film), this book is a fun read, great for a rainy evening. And, for those unfamiliar with such Fortean phenomena as Mothman, The Flatwoods Monster, thunderbirds and other such critters, this is a good overview. However, for those who have read John Keel's Mothman Prophecies, Our Haunted Planet or Strange Creatures from Time and Space, or who are familiar with the books of the late Charles Fort (namesake of the word Fortean), there is little new to be found here.Within the book's 200 pages are nine chapters, two appendices and a section on \`Mothman bibliography and other resources' (did you know you could order an \\"action Mothman figure\\"?). The chapters aggregate \`types' of creatures, such as \`Winged Weirdies', \`Mothman' and \`Lizardmen'. And, given the influence of John Keel's work on Coleman, one chapter is even called \`Keel's Children'. In fact, this book arguably should have been sub-subtitled \`An Homage to John Keel'. One whole appendix is a direct re-print of reported Mothman sightings lifted from Keel's Strange Creatures from Time and Space. Without Keel's contributions, this would likely have been a pretty slim volume indeed.As mentioned, this is an entertaining way to spend a few hours, not requiring much in the way of deep thinking. The style of the book is breezy and engaging, although it could have benefited from better proofreading (the late ufologist Gray Barker was sometimes referred to as Gray, other times as \`Gary'). For those who are interested in a solid introduction to the arcane field of \`cryptozoology', this is a great place to start, and for those who are generally familiar with the material, this is a good refresher. It's certainly worth the modest price."},{"Title":"Mothman and Other Curious Encounters","review":"That's two and a half stars. Maybe I'm just jaded from reading too many open-mouthed catalogs of strange facts over too many years. Coleman is one of today's most popular practitioners of the genre, and he certainly is better than the average. His attitude is more like Charles Fort's than like Erik von Daniken's. You may disagree with his conclusions, or find his recital of testimonies credulous, but you feel he is being straight with you, and that he is aware of the value of sometimes just letting mystery be. If you own a bunch of books of this kind, and are hungry for more, you should bump the rating up another star.I found myself suspecting this particular volume was slapped together under this title to generate extra sales in the wake of the Mothman movie. The Mothman himself takes up less than a third of the book. No significant info is added to what John Keel wrote in his 1975 book (and a good deal of that left out, as not relevant to Coleman's real theme.) We do get some neat new Keel quotes and anecdotes that spotlight his startling personality. And that's fun, but the same personality was fully on display in Keel's book, too.So if it's not &quot;about&quot; Mothman, what is it about? It is a brief Fortean treatise on cryptozoology - the study of animals, especially large animals, unknown to science. It touches on well known stars like Sasquatch and Nessie, but concentrates on flaps in which cryptozoology bumps up against &quot;high weirdness,&quot; and seems to call for investigations as much by unnatural historians as by natural ones. Thunderbirds, Cupachabras, giant black dogs with fiery eyes, and lizard men predominate.There are no footnotes, but there's a good bibliography. There's also an odd 18-page index of &quot;places of high strangeness&quot; in the U.S. and Canada. It's odd in that it's just a list of names, by state and province, with no indication of what's weird about any one of them. There are bound to be several within driving distance of your home... I guess you just drive there, stake your tent, and try to be ready for anything."},{"Title":"Mothman and Other Curious Encounters","review":"The Fortean world is a difficult one. A Fortean knows that the most unusual elements can somehow be connected in surprising ways. It is difficult to take things in isolation - and Loren Coleman, as a good Fortean, knows this. And so his latest book on Mothman covers so much more than the Mothman sightings we all know and love from Point Pleasant. A particular favourite of Coleman's is the name game and along with cryptozoology it's well represented in this latest book. Many other cryptozoological entities are covered in this tome - owlman, lizardmen etc. In one sense it's a book that looks at the poor relatives of cryptozoology - hundreds of books on Bigfoot but information on these - just as fascinating - creatures is harder to come by.Excellent appendices give subsequent researchers a chance to follow in the footsteps - a list of Mothman sightings, a list of sites of American high wierdness and a comprehensive bibliography. If there's one thing missing it's pictures - but that said what could be shown in a work of this nature? There are no pictures of these entities and I don't want to look at endless pictures of bridges and towns, so that's not a complaint merely a comment - mind it does have a seriously cool cover.Apparently there were some typos that crept into the first edition but these have all been corrected in subsequent print runs.All told this is an excellent book which I can wholeheartedly recommend to the Forteans, cryptozoologists and lovers of the weird out there.If only the movie had been this good..."},{"Title":"Mothman and Other Curious Encounters","review":"Ever since childhood, I've been fascinated by books that detail eyewitness accounts of bizarre phenomena, such as Mothman, the Dover Demon, Thunderbirds, Lizardmen, etc. And Loren Coleman certainly provides the reader with an abundance of such accounts and encounters.But there are problems. For one thing, this book was rushed into publication to take advantage of the recently released Richard Gere film (which has since disappeared). This is evidenced by the weak writing and very poor editing, as well as by the shameless plugging. In addition, the book has no real structure; it's a hodgepodge. At one point, for example, Coleman engages in a defense against the criticisms of Darren Naish. Ho-hum. And the reader is subject to way too much pretentious and often incoherent theorizing. This is especially true when Coleman rhapsodizes about his silly little \\"name game\\" concept -- e.g., [page 166] \\"In acknowledging the possible links between these named locations and Fortean events, the objective is not linear, that is to say, is not solely bound to the immediate and obvious events recorded, but may in fact be a part of a larger, symbolic ritual magnified by the power of the electronic media, for the purpose of processing in the subconscious.\\" No doubt. Also, Coleman contends that certain geographical locations are \\"windows\\" -- i.e., loci for unusual phenomena. He mentions, for example, West 57th Street in Manhattan. To say that that's vague is an understatement akin to saying that Jayne Mansfield was well endowed. I mean, come on! WHERE on West 57th is this \\"window\\" located? ..."},{"Title":"Mothman and Other Curious Encounters","review":"Being a fan of Loren Coleman's style of writing, I awaited his newest book with a sense of wonder and expectations. The wonder was how he was going to document the phenomenon of Mothman beyond what John Keel had already dealt with in his book The Mothman Prophecies. The expectations were simply that more than just Mothman would be dealt with, but that other unusual creatures that defy easy classification, such as Momo, Thunderbirds and Lizardmen would be evaluation. With the arrival of Coleman's book the wonder and expectations were answered, and more than fulfilled.Coleman deals naturally with Mothman, its history and legacy. But, beyond the limiting scope of Mothman, the reader is shown the other phenomenons that run the border between Cryptozoology, Fortean Studies and the moniker of UFOology and the Paranormal. One is taken to the winged mysteries of the Thunderbird in North America, the odd and culturally rich history of the Chupacabra and the legacy of phantom trains, to name but a few of the topics covered.Perhaps the real gem in the book though is the dealing with the Mothman and its legacy over the years, which in 2002 will be brought forth even more with the release of the movie The Mothman Prophecies. The reader is shown what John Keel did in the 1960's in Point Pleasant, West Virginia by looking at the phenomenon of Mothman culturally and anthropologically. The circumstances and related occurrences of the time put the entire situation into a cultural and evidentiary guide.That is the hidden subtext to the book, that although these creatures do not necessarily fit into any one neat category, they all have basis in the history of the areas. They fall into mixed arenas and hence are often waylaid and overlooked by mystery historians or classified according to a particular theory. Even within the text of the book the creatures, entities, beings, or whatever you choose to call them, are not necessarily categorized, rather they are looked at for what they are and chronicled in true Fortean style.One can choose to nit-pick certain areas of the book, and some are easier than others to do this too. But, remembering the above commentary about chronicling versus categorizing, these criticisms are really without merit. This reviewer has in the past been critical of the placement of Merbeings in the context of unknown primates, for example. Yet, even though they are dealt with in the book, they are dealt with as a manner of chronicling. Even the mention of UFO's and stereotypical paranormal events may toss a cold hand to some readers that are looking for a true Cryptozoological evaluation of the subject, yet that is not what this tome is about, and one should not progress in reading the work believing it is strictly a Cryptozoological book, or any other type of book. The one criticism that this reviewer will make though is that the book bogs down a little when concepts of date coincidences are looked at, these areas are dry and may cause the reader to loose interest even though they are a fascinating piece of Fortean information.The best example of classification of Coleman's book is that it is an extension of the style and content produced in his 2001 book Mysterious America: the Revised Edition (also by Paraview Press). Reader's familiar with Jerome Clark's Unexplained! (2nd Edition, Visible Ink Press, Farmington Hills, 1999) will find Coleman's book of interest as it goes beyond strictly and encyclopedic look at the subject, but contains similar content as Clark's work. Perhaps the best analogy to another work though would be the more obscure work by D. Scott Rogo and Jerome Clark, Earth's Secret Inhabitants (Tempo Books, New York, 1979). The style's are different between Rogo/Clark's and Coleman's book, and the content is different, but both look at the unusual accounts of many creatures that defy classification.The reader of Mothman and Other Curious Encounters is bound to be left with a feeling that more is out there then they may be aware of. More exists in a Fortean world than we would think, and perhaps the reader will take a look for themselves and play some \\"name games\\" and date comparisons of events. The reader is taken to the world of the unusual, and brought safely back to the comfort of home, but the essence of the unusual will linger, the wonder will not be abated.Coleman, himself, sums up the work as:\\"Indeed, I find myself still considering possible cryptozoological answers for Mothman, while at the same time appreciating what Keel did. Some of my friends who read this book will think I have gone to the \\"dark side\\" by merely allowing myself to think about Mothman, let alone researching Keel and his radical ideas. You see, I am a Fortean, and in a very strange way, Point Pleasant all makes sense to me. Mothman's time has come. Mothman lives. The events wrapped in the riddle called Mothman has focused so many mysteries in one place. We are not able to ignore it, any longer, even if we don't have all the answers yet.\\"So come along and experience Mothman, Bigfoot, Batsquatch, Owlman, Lizardmen, Momo, the Honey Island Swamp Monster, Thunderbirds, Hell Hounds, Banshees and the other kin of Mothman, essential \\"Loren's Paradigm.\\" The journey is worth the cost, you won't soon forget it."},{"Title":"Mothman and Other Curious Encounters","review":"The premise of the Mothman movie--that sightings of a winged creature in Point Pleasant, Virginia in the 60s led to a series of weird events there, reaching a crescendo with a fatal bridge collapse in the area--is but one entry in this broader examination of the Mothman phenomenon. It includes a chart of 26 &quot;most responsible&quot; other Mothman sightings supplied by Mothman Prophecies author John Keel, as well as Loren Coleman's look at similar critters in history, like the Flatwoods Monster of 1952 and various thunderbirds and lizard men. A consummate Fortean, Coleman notes &quot;Today, to scrutinize the world the way Fort did is rather common, as questioning authority, critically looking at experts and governments, is in vogue.&quot; Mothman and Other Curious Encounters is not just a catalog of weird creature sightings, like The Mothman Prophecies itself, it helps readers orient themselves to a more critical way of regarding the world."},{"Title":"Mothman and Other Curious Encounters","review":"If your interest lies in winged creatures and the weird and unexplainable (or maybe this book can explain them) then this is the book for you...this book provides loads of information not only about the mothman legacy but on scores of other flying creatures of interest. Mothman and other curious encounters is an in depth book that raises all sorts of theories and explanations on many of the flying favorites we have all heard about but never could really find the explanation for......until now."},{"Title":"Mothman and Other Curious Encounters","review":"I always assumed that Loren Coleman belonged to the moderate, flesh-and-blood, Bigfoot-is-an-ape school of cryptozoology. Maybe he did once? In this book, by contrast, the author goes out on a limb, paying homage more than once to John Keel, the bete noire (pun unintended) of both cryptozoology and ufology.Despite the Keelian angle, only one chapter of \\"Mothman and other curious encounters\\" deals with the bizarre events that supposedly took place in Point Pleasant in 1966-67. The rest of the book deals with lizard monsters, mad gassers, chupacabras, werewolves, orange demons with spindly fingers, black dogs, the Flatwoods Monster, Batsquatch...well, should I continue? Coleman even takes the Men in Black seriously! The only \\"classical\\" cryptids mentioned in the book are the Thunderbirds.Coleman doesn't know what to make of all this (as behoves a good Fortean, I suppose), but he does seem open to the \\"ultraterrestrial\\" hypothesis of Keel, according to which all these creatures are fundamentally similar and hail from a supernatural reality (\\"the superspectrum\\") beyond our own. But what is their purpose?Several chapters are devoted to decoding the \\"message\\" of the daimonic creatures. Thus, Coleman claims that monsters usually show themselves on Wednesdays and Saturdays, and that they have a special affinity for June 24, St. John's Day or Midsummer. He mentions the phenomenon of flaps, and the idea that certain areas (\\"windows\\") are more susceptible to paranormal activity than others. One such place is Skookum, a valley in Oregon notorious for its Bigfoot activity.Keel believed that the ultraterrestrials lived in a kind of symbiotic relationship with humans. They feed on our energy and are therefore dependent on us. In one sense, they are demons: \\"ufology is really demonology\\" is a classical Keel quip. The creatures often predict disasters, some of which seem to happen. On the other hand, they also play a role in humanity's spiritual development, forcing us over the threshold to the superspectrum kicking and screaming. If we listen to them, they will become divine messengers and harbingers of a positive transformation. Coleman summarizes Keel's views in a remarkably objective manner.If Coleman wants to pursue this subject further, perhaps he should rise above Keel and read, say, Patrick Harpur?I can't say \\"Mothman and other curious encounters\\" thrilled me. Perhaps I already read too many books on this subject. Perhaps it's just badly edited, with Coleman jumping back and forth between descriptions of sightings, tributes to his old friend Keel, and attempts to analyze the ghost stories he has collected. The analysis isn't very deep. At one point, the author jokingly says that many of his readers will accuse him of joining \\"the dark side\\" - I suppose belief in Mothman and MIBs are no-noes in more respectable cryptozoological circles.However, Coleman is clearly not fully indoctrinated in the mysteries of the eternal twilight...yet! When he joins us, I'll let you know through the usual channels...Be afraid, kids, be very afraid! :-0"},{"Title":"Mothman and Other Curious Encounters","review":"As usual, Loren Coleman has produced another fascinating book about strange unknown creatures encountered by everyday people.

Caught between are Domaris and Deoris, daughters of the Arch-priest Talannon, trapped in a web of deadly sorcery-the same forbidden sorcery that could bring about the fall of Atlantis."},{"Title":"The Fall of Atlantis","review":"This book wove fascinating interrelations between the characters, but--oh no--not the whole lame quest for power/devil worship plot again."},{"Title":"The Fall of Atlantis","review":"Having read countless Fantasy books, I thought this one was by far the best and if I had to decide I would probably call it my favorite book ever. Micon is the most complex and interesting character I have ever read about, and he came to life in the book as well as in my dreams. The entire atmosphere is alive and makes you feel frightened even as you read. The story is deep and complex, yet never too long or lacking action. Read this book as soon as you can!"},{"Title":"The Fall of Atlantis","review":"I, for one, truly enjoyed THE FALL OF ATLANTIS. As a long-time fan of Marion Zimmer Bradley, I was anxious to read this book yet continually vexed that it was long out of print and hard to find. This was especially frustrating in light of the recent death of MZB and the end of an era of beautiful literature. When I finally got my hands on a copy of a recent reprint of this book just last year, I was not disappointed.What THE FALL OF ATLANTIS gives to those of us who have truly appreciated the inspired genius of MZB's other works, like THE MISTS OF AVALON, THE FIREBRAND, the entire WITCHLIGHT series and others, is a framework, perhaps, for all of her more esoteric novels. The tragic story of Deoris and Domaris, the destruction of paradise and the perpetual battle between the Path of Light and the Path of Darkness goes a long way toward explaining some of the major themes that ran through MZB's subsequent -- and more popular -- works. This novel lays the ground work for all of her other novels and, without it, I don't think the others can truly be appreciated in the spirit in which they were written."},{"Title":"The Fall of Atlantis","review":"The Fall of Atlantis is a extremely intricate and envolving book which is essential to the rest of Bradleys book to get a deeper meaning from them. Of all of her books the Fall of Atlantis leaves you thinking about it long after you put it down...wondering if the deeply rooted religion of Atlantis and later Britannia is still living in some small fraction of the world."},{"Title":"The Fall of Atlantis","review":"A love story in an age before time. Micon, a prince of Atlantis, suffers a tradgedy that emits good as well as evil karma for generations to come. Domaris, an acolyte of light, finds the course of her life irrevocably and forever changed by her love for the prince. Torn by resentment and fear of the pain that love can bring, her sister, Deoris, vowing never to become a slave of love, unwittingly begins a dark journey that will bind them all in a web of darkness"},{"Title":"The Fall of Atlantis","review":"This is where the Avalon series books start! I've read the series almost completely backward over the years for lack of a good defined starting place. When I read The Fall of Atlantis all the pieces from MZB's other Avalon books click. Though I would have better titled this book, \\"Sisters\\" or a \\"Dream of Avalon,\\" or some such... there isn't as much \\"Atlantis\\" description as I would have hoped. Had MZB written it today it may have taken on more detail. As it stands, it is the essential foundation for the Avalon books in the series.... The fall of Atlantis, Ancestors of Avalon, The Ravens of Avalon, The Forest House, The Priestess of Avalon, The Lady of Avalon, The Mysts of Avalon.... etc. Absolutely wonderful books to awaken the senses!"},{"Title":"The Fall of Atlantis","review":"This book enchanted me and kept me reading all the time. Bradely's deatil is amazing and she made her characters real. I truly cried and smiled the whole time. Oh how wonderful this book was!"},{"Title":"The Fall of Atlantis","review":"THE FALL OF ATLANTIS, was a fairly good book. I have read mostly all of MZB's novels, including the Forest House, Lady of Avalon, Mists of Avalon, The Firebrand, Exile's Song, and many others. But the one thing that I think others need to understand that might not of liked this book and preferred the Mists of Avalon better (as do I) is that MZB has such a great way of writing, and if you look at the differences between the Mists of Avalon and Exile's Song, there is a BIG difference, just because of the certain way she changed her writing for those novels. THE FALL OF ATLANTIS will compel you to sit and relax on a hot summer day to cool down in the shade under a tree, but it won't leave you wanting more."},{"Title":"The Fall of Atlantis","review":"When I first read this book last year, I thought it was one of the most boring books I had ever read. Too many characters to keep track of and many of them having names that sound alike and just seemed to have random events slapdashed together.I just got done rereading the book for a second time and I must say my opinion has changed. While my views on the characters remain the same, I enjoyed the book as I have with MZB's Avalon series (and given this is a prequel to that series, it's no wonder). There are still places where I've read that I had to go back and reread because I couldn't figure out how it worked in with something I had read in the previous page/paragraph/sentence, but the story overall is still a lot better the second time around."},{"Title":"The Fall of Atlantis","review":"Domaris and Deoris have grown up in the Temple, daughters of one of its priests. Domaris, the elder sister, has cared for Deoris since the day the younger girl was born and their mother died - since Domaris was eight years old. As their story opens, an Atlantean prince named Micon comes to the Temple seeking refuge after being kidnapped and tortured by Black-Robes. His arrival changes the lives of Domaris and Deoris forever.Romantic historical novel? Fantasy? Like the books that followed it, Marion Zimmer Bradley's far more famous \\"Mists of Avalon\\" and its sequels, \\"The Fall of Atlantis\\" combines those two genres without fully conforming to either. Technicially it is not quite as polished as the later books, but it's far better written than many lesser authors' best work. It lays the foundation for what comes after, and is well worth reading even if (as I did) you've read one or more \\"Avalon\\" books first."},{"Title":"The Fall of Atlantis","review":"but not altogether unpleasent! MZB had me somwhat confused by her choice to enter phrases such as 'hell' and 'the devil' into a book that I had assumed was set in a pre-Christian time. Her choice of names for the characters also was a bit of a jumble. In each family parents would name their children some combination of the names of their father and mother. Until I was familiarized with the characters I had a bit of a hard time keeping track. The Fall of Atlantis was a fast read and I found it easy to sit down and read 150 pages without tiring of the book. If you want a story of Atlantis, this is not for you, Atlantis isn't a setting until the last 50 pages or so. However, if you're looking for a quick book with a unique community setting and somewhat unusual characters, give Atlantis a try."},{"Title":"The Fall of Atlantis","review":"This book is one of marion's best because she always knows how to keep us on our toes and wanting more. shee tells this story, and all the other stories I have read, on the side of the female character and not the male. I just hope that other women can learn from her and start writing as good a story as marion."},{"Title":"The Fall of Atlantis","review":"I personally loved The Fall of Atlantis; I would never hesitate to recommend it. Granted, it's a darker, more subtle novel than either Mists or Firebrand, but in my opinion this is all to the good. Tracing the inevitable arc of the doomed city is an almost transporting experience. Read it!"},{"Title":"The Fall of Atlantis","review":"I liked the book a lot, but it had little to do (that I could determine, at least) with the fall of Atlantis. The topic just pops up in the last few chapters. Perhaps I missed something! The sister relationship in MZB's books continue to be my favorite theme."},{"Title":"The Fall of Atlantis","review":"I liked this book, even though it started out to seem a little borring. The first part about the romance of Micon and Domaris is a little borring - its all very nice, but it's not very exciting - I missed some of the intrigue that marked the ingenious &quot;Mists of Avalon&quot;. Later on, when the focus is moved to Deoris, the book catches better, because the plot becomes more subtle - where stands Rivera etc.So the last two thirds of the book makes it defenitely worth reading. The ending is a bit too sweat, though - I liked the bitterness of the &quot;Avalon&quot;-books."},{"Title":"The Fall of Atlantis","review":"I am loath to give any of MZB's books less than five stars. Yet something in Fall of Atlantis disturbs me...there were quite a few times when I was very tempted to throw up. It is a dark and stormy book, a maelstrom of death and evil magic and concealed betrayals, oh, and it does NOT have a happy ending. It doesn't even have a MZB-esque cryptic-semi-happy ending. As for the characters...Domaris (Isarma) and Micon to me were rather simple, existing only for the making of their son, who had a minor role as well. Rajasta and the other priests are just too...GOOD and one-sided to be interesting. However, Deoris (Adsartha) was who really made the book worthwhile for me. She was in many ways a hypocrite, and was often unjustified, but above all was decidedly human. Unlike the &quot;good&quot; and law-abiding Domaris, Deoris risked everything she had to support those she loved (namely Riveda) yet was not just a &quot;giver&quot; - she herself possessed real, dangerous power that she was not afraid to use. About Riveda...the book doesn't really cast him in a complementary light. It doesn't cast him in any sort of light, really. He's mysterious, even his origins are unknown, and he commits heresies so great that the Fall of Atlantis is brought about from his meddling. Nonetheless, he has real emotions, and to his credit, he does love Deoris, insofar as he can love anybody. I can't condemn him or pardon him, and I think it would be hard for anybody to...In short, The Fall of Atlantis is a book filled with corrupted people trying to cling to their long-lost innocence, and failing. Read it and take it as you will; I recommend it for those with strong stomachs."},{"Title":"The Fall of Atlantis","review":"Absorbing story, excellent for a summer's day. Unfortunately the paperback fell apart in my hand after the first ten pages, very poor binding."},{"Title":"The Fall of Atlantis","review":"I was very disapointed with THE FALL OF ATLANTIS, as I was expecting one of Bradley's Historical Fiction novels along the lines of her Avalon series, or The Firebrand. I thought the plot was weak and uninspiring."},{"Title":"The Fall of Atlantis","review":"Not as good as some of her later books, but compelling none the less. This is actually a reprint of her earlier works, _Web of Darkness_ and _Web of Light_, published in the early 1980s, and when viewed in that context, the book's flaws are more forgiveable. It is a stepping stone on the way to more mature works like Mists of Avalon or Firebrand."},{"Title":"The Fall of Atlantis","review":"The start of a great cycle of work, The Fall Of Atlantis satisfies on many levels. Although not really about Atlantis itself, the time and setting are in line with what popular imagination holds to be appropriate for that epic land. There is much seeking for knowledge, ancient rites and customs, invocation and ceremony, etc. Historical fantasy fiction at its finest.Somewhat darker than her other books. Full of young maidens awakening to their power, sexuality and complexity - themes familiar to readers of Mists and Forest House and such. I wish there had been more description of the land, the culture, the architecture, and so on. MZB seems to me somewhat over focused on relationships and emotions, and sometimes her books feel a little claustrophobic. But I'm a guy, so that may be a factor in my appraisal.Loved it overall, and truly enjoyed dissolving into the read. Recommended."},{"Title":"The Fall of Atlantis","review":"I received my book very quickly and it was in good condition. I enjoyed reading it. I don't think it is as good as Mists of Avalon, though. I would recommend it, however."},{"Title":"The Fall of Atlantis","review":"The story flowed well.The characters where dynamic and likeable. The storyline was interesting and well thought out.

Perhaps because it was written in her earlier years (I think), she does not write with the depth that I was expecting."},{"Title":"The Fall of Atlantis","review":"This was the first book I have read of MZB, and I found it captivating. The characters seemed to be real people &amp; had real emotions. I truly came to care about the characters and was surprised with them at the various twists and turns throughout the book.

Others have said this is not Bradley's finest work, but I wholly disagree.

Bradley knows what she's doing and this book won't disappoint you. Be sure to read it; you won't regret it!!!! I Loved this book..."},{"Title":"The Fall of Atlantis","review":"This book was well written and had intriguing characters, but it gave me nightmares.

It probably didn't help that I read this book while sick with the flu."},{"Title":"The Fall of Atlantis","review":"After reading several of her books, this was a major flop. At no time was I swept away with the story as in &quot;The Firebrand.&quot; At no time did I think &quot;now this could happen&quot; as in &quot;Mists of Avalon.&quot; Nor would I ever want to return to its people or places as in &quot;Forest House.&quot; This was not up to expectations. Certainly not up to the standards I have come to accept as Bradley's. I could not, would not, will not recommend this book to anyone"},{"Title":"The Fall of Atlantis","review":"I was so disapointed about this one... I want you to know, though, that I've read all the MZB books, I love her style and my favourite book ever is &quot;Mysts of Avalon&quot;, and &quot;FireBrand&quot; also. As the rest I find them not so good... but this... it simply isn't worth to read. As far as my opinion goes I believe that there's so much to write about Atlantis... It doesnt even appear to be written by MZB"},{"Title":"The Fall of Atlantis","review":"I loved this book, though it was not as captivating as The Mists of Avalon, it was definatly superb. Filled with characters you could sink your teeth into and plot changes that were truly excellent. I would definatly recomend, but suggest you look at it as a seperate novel, rather than in comparison to some of MZB's other works."},{"Title":"The Fall of Atlantis","review":"The fall of atlantis is a marvellous book, and I recommend it to all that have in reading a hobby. I thought MZB did a great job at this particular work !"},{"Title":"The Fall of Atlantis","review":"This is not really what we have come to expect from a fantasy novel. It is much more a historical romance which takes place in a fantasy setting. The story is about two sisters who are raised to power with very different temperments and ultimately different destinies. One falls in love with a dying priest of the light. The other gets involved with a priest who leads the darker mysteries. They both have their own long road to walk and their own struggles with their constrained society.MZB displays, as usual, her adept touch with female characters. Deoris and Domaris are real, Deoris heart-breakingly real. The world she places around them is detailed and compelling, as are the politics and dynamics of power portrayed in the book.Unfortunately, _The Fall of Atlantis_ lacks the well-balanced plots that make the Darkover novels so wonderful. It really is not much more than a well-written historical romance and lacks the mystery and wonder that characterize the really great fantasies that Bradley has written."},{"Title":"The Fall of Atlantis","review":"This is one of MZB's earliest novels, and you can tell she wrote it early in her career, because the quality of the writing is not up to par with her later books (e.g., the MISTS trilogy). However, this book is ESSENTIAL reading for someone who wants to get the most out of the MISTS OF AVALON series of books----so much of what is contained in those books, especially THE FOREST HOUSE and LADY OF AVALON, relates directly to the plot of THE FALL OF ATLANTIS. So, pick it up now that it's back in print, and enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Fall of Atlantis","review":"I have owned the Fall of Atlantis for a long time now and everytime I pick it up Bradley never fails to draw me once more into the intricate depth of the story that lays down the heritage of her exquisite Avalon novels. The heartache and pain that the characters in her book go through (from Domaris to Deoris, from Micon to Demira), constantly has your emotions at a boil.Bradley has a gifted ability to weave intrigue and magic into the complex web of her stories and the Fall of Atlantis is a clear expression of her talent. Every detail concerning the Atlanteans is so perfectly thought out that the reader is easily immersed in this strange, spell-bound realm and its tragic destruction.The women again figure prominently in this story and through their loves and losses, their actions and consequences, we see again their femininity is laced with a strength and determination that inarguably turns them into the heroines of an epic saga. Despite the dark overtone of the plot, the Fall of Atlantis is a enthralling, enduring story that captivates from the first page to the last."},{"Title":"The Fall of Atlantis","review":"I read this book on the recommendation of a neighbor, and while it did not enchant me like The Mists of Avalon, I still loved it. It is in no way light or joy-filled, but its very darkness is what makes The Fall of Atlantis so compelling. Bradley's characters suffer deeply, and the reader suffers along beside them. Even their final triumph is so tinged with sorrow, that it is impossible to say whether this book ends happily or not. The Fall of Atlantis is a novel of depth, of humanity's weaknesses. In reading it, we are shown that light is forever twined with darkness; the one is just a shade of the other."},{"Title":"The Fall of Atlantis","review":"This book is very important in the Mists of Avalon series, in that it starts everything. This book starts the tale of characters that incarnate through all the other books. The story given here immediately picks up again in the sequal \\"Ancestors of Avalon.\\"I found this original story to be very interesting, spiritual, and having the feeling of history--even though it's about a supposedly fictional place. It is clear that this is one of MZB's earlier works, but it is still enchanting.I wish MZB could have kept her original titles for what she saw as a two part book, because the title \\"The Fall of Atlantis\\" is ill suited here. Most of the story doesn't even take place in Atlantis, but in a more ancient land. The part of the tale that does take place in Atlantis leaves the reader wanting more images and descriptions of this mysterious land. Also there is no \\"Falling\\" of Atlantis in this book, that doesn't happen until the next book \\"Ancestors of Avalon.\\" The image on the front of the book is also misleading, as no scene even remotely like this occurs. I found it a bit of a distraction to the story to keep wondering when this scene of destruction and chaos would occur, only finding that it doesn't.If you are at all interested in \\"The Mists of Avalon\\" series, this is a necessary start, just don't expect the destruction suggested by the cover."},{"Title":"The Fall of Atlantis","review":"I love this book. The Fall of Atlantis is one of MZB's earlier works. The story is not as well-plotted as her later works and there are even some minor mistakes in the book (about who is related and where they come from, etc.) but the heart-breaking character of Deoris brings the book to life. It's worth a read just for her story. The thing I like about MZB's writing is that you get to know her characters' thoughts and self-doubts. You can always relate to them on a real level even though they are set in a fantasy world. I highly recommend this book to anyone with a romantic heart."},{"Title":"The Fall of Atlantis","review":"I think &quot;The Fall of Atlantis&quot; was a very dramatic, emotional book. The first pages seem very good yet not superb, while at the end, you cannot put this book down. Marion Zimmer Bradley's imagination in this book is captivating. The world she created impressed me because it was so much like fantasy (with all the Magicians, Adepts, and Laws), yet so realistic. Domaris and Deoris are two excellent characters; they captured my attention from the start. The other main characters in the book also impressed me, especially Rajasta, Riveda, and Micon. When I put this book down, I thought: &quot;Another one of Zimmer Bradley's excellent works!&quot;"},{"Title":"The Fall of Atlantis","review":"Having read Marian Zimmer Bradley's Mists of Avalon, I expected the Fall of Atlantis to be just as gripping and well-written. And although this book wasn't a complete disappointment, it cannot compare.The book is set to be a prequel to the Mists and the basis of the religion of Avalon.Domaris is a serious young woman who will become a priestess and later a Guardian of the Light in the Ancient Land, a place where people worshipped many deities, but the Great Mother before all. Daughter of a priest herself, Domaris has raised her younger sister Deoris all by herself, since their mother died at Deoris' birth. Her life is basically repetition until a stranger from Atlantis comes to their Temple seeking assistance.Domaris learns that the stranger, Micon, has been tortured at the hands of a group Black Robes (a sort of magician that dabbles into dark arts), and has gone blind from looking upon one of their faces. Micon knows who one of his torturers is but will not reveal anything, much to the fury of Revieda, the leader of the Grey Robes, whose duty it is to purge his flock of any who abused their powers.Domaris and Micon grow to love each other but Domaris' happiness is short-lived. After she bears him a son, Micon will die. And as she grows to love Micon more and grow more devoted to him, she drifts further apart from her sister, who rushes into Revieda's arms for comfort.Their lives are all intertwined and they all have a responsibility in bringing about the fall of Atlantis."},{"Title":"The Fall of Atlantis","review":"I love this book,I read it over the summer at camp and I couldn't put it down, so I sat and read it in my room for four straight hours. MZB really captures your attention and doesn't let it go throughout the entire novel. I have heard that some people say this is not one of her better works, but I DISAGREE. This book was great and I recommend it to anyone who loves to read or anyone who wants to read a really great story with an interesting plot and believeable characters. I recommend this book to everyone . Read it, you won't be disapointed!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Fall of Atlantis","review":"THE FALL OF ATLANTIS begins the 'backstory' of the MISTS OF AVALON trilogy. Two sisters Deoris and Domaris are beginning their training as priestesses, as befits their caste. Their world is shaken by the arrival of Micon, a young priest who had fallen into the hands of the Black Prieshood and tortured. Their lives and those around them are changed by events that will take many lifetimes to resolve.This book has been compared to other MZB books, particularly the AVALON trilogy. This book, and those that follow are much earlier works by MZB, and are, not surprisingly, not as masterful as her later books, particularly MISTS OF AVALON. That aside THE FALL OF ATLANTIS is still an excellent story. The characters are engaging, the plot well thought out and interesting, the world is consistent and plausible.This novel in many ways foreshadows the AVALON series. The characters in both trilogies are victims of the actions of their parents, their own decisions impact the lives of their own children. Both are set into societies that are changing and ultimately dying. And both are betrayed at some point from within. Is this as good a book as MISTS OF AVALON? No, but it is as good as THE FOREST HOUSE or LADY OF AVALON and is definitely worth the time for fans of MZB's other works, and also for those who are not fans yet."},{"Title":"The Fall of Atlantis","review":"Everyone is always entranced by the ancient tales of Atlantis. Did it ever exist, and if so, what happened to it? Some say that those who lived there became too proud and brought about their own destruction. This book tells a tale of what could have been, (at least in the mind of Mrs. Bradley). This book is a sad story, but it does not have a disappointing ending, or a tragic ending. I finished it feeling satisfied with how the story ended. You really feel for the characters. The story does not take place in Atlantis, but near it, and it is only near the end that the characters reach its shores. Mrs. Bradley hints at earlier origins to this story, but leaves you with just this tale. If there is any 'lesson to be learned' from this story, it is that there are things to be learned from both light and dark--but it is one's own choice as to where one should proceed--and with utmost caution!Read this book. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Fall of Atlantis","review":"I've had The Fall of Atlantis for a long time, but just last year managed to buy myself a original language copy, and only read it last month. I've fell in love with the characterization and concepts in the story when I first read it, but reading it in english gave me a new insight and a new passion for the book (it is clear to me that translation might ruin a story, or at least make it less appealing and my copy was a 1st edition, full of mistakes). It brings out some of the best aspects of MZB when building characters, but it does fall short on the plot, that isn't always clear. It reads much more like an early Darkover novel than a late Avalon Series book. It gives you a sense of how much she grew as a writter, and on the author's strong points and talents.The characters in The Fall of Atlantis are wonderfully flawed, even when they are flawless (one might say \\"specially when they're trying to be flawless\\"). The main characters are the sisters Deoris and Domaris, both woman that try to be strong even when being guided by the men around them. It is from the start the story of a society that is decaying, although it might not be so easy to see it at first.The really funny thing about it being renamed The Fall of Atlantis is that the book happens mostly away from Atlantis and it doesn't fall in the end - not literaly, at least. It is the story of how the society fell and how it culminated in the physical destruction of the continent, which still lies in the future by the end of the book. It also gives you an important insight into the following books of the Avalon series since it shows you that some people are \\"the same souls\\" coming back again to repeat their errors, and why they do that.In short, it is the base of the whole Avalon Series and a must read for any fan of Mists of Avalon and it's prequels."},{"Title":"The Fall of Atlantis","review":"I read about half of this book. I didn't hate it; it just wasn't that interesting. I loved The Mists of Avalon and was intrigued by the Atlantis references in that book. I thought it would be fun to find out what really happened there and who the characters were. Unfortunately, the book doesn't take place in Atlantis - it takes place in Britain, among people who have settled there from Atlantis. That was disappointing. What's more, the characters just aren't that interesting. I expected more from Bradley."},{"Title":"The Fall of Atlantis","review":"After the breathtaking THE FIREBRAND, this was stilted and disappointing. Perhaps it went through too many revisions as the characters speak and act like statues. Might be suitable for a precocious fourteen year old reader who nonetheless could be bored. I as astonished that the story could be so poorly plotted. Cared nothing for anyone. Would like to sell my copy as a matter of fact. [...]"},{"Title":"The Fall of Atlantis","review":"As at least one other reviewer has stated, the contents of this book are essential to a full understanding of the other books in the series, especially \\"The Mists of Avalon. \\"The Fall of Atlantis\\" furnishes information about the underlying ontological framework(one might say) that supports all that follows; this must have been Ms. Bradley's own metaphysical view as well, for why would she write at such length about anything else? Celtic? Or pseudo-Celtic cum new-age concoction with a bit of Hindoo (or is that Theosophical) stuff tossed in for a good measure? Or a mixture of both? I can't say for sure, and does it really matter? You'll also come to know the two souls that become bound for all eternity in a sort of cosmic knot that winds with truly Celtic extravagance through the volumes that follow. Intriguingly, those who pay close attention will detect a few subtle, yet significant hints that what today is known as BDSM may be used for spiritual development -- nay, is essential for spiritual development, at least according to Ms. MZB! So if you are a fan, or plan to read any or all of the Avalon series books, you ought to read \\"The Fall of Atlantis.\\"That said, this is one of the most poorly-written, painful-to-read 500-page books that I've ever suffered though. It's difficult to describe why it's so terrible. In fact, if you are like me, you've probably read plenty of totally worthless trash -- churned out by semi-talented and only partially-inspired hack-writers -- that was much more enjoyable to read than this odious little tome. Maybe it's because the book was written early on in MZB's career. Most of the writing resembles what you'd expect to see in a painfully self-conscious fan-zine. For example, the following randomly-selected sentence may astound and amuse:\\"'That is why I am placed so that I may never come near him in the rites,' Demira went on, 'he is a Northman of Zaiadan, and you know how they regard incest -- or do you?'\\" [!]I bought a used paperback copy, via Amazon, about seven years ago, read it cover to cover, hardly able to put it down, all the time being bored to death by a tedious sense of waiting, waiting, and waiting some more for something (anything!) worth reading to appear upon the page. Very little did! My copy now lays on the desk before me; and this is the third time since the initial read that I've placed it there and eyed it with a mixed sense of longing and loathing. But no, I am not going to read this thing again. You, on the other hand, MUST read it. Unless you can find a Cliff's Notes version, which I heartily suggest you seek out. Or you may be able to extract all you need to know from the reader reviews here on Amazon. It's surely worth your time to try that, if it will save you from the misery lol."},{"Title":"The Fall of Atlantis","review":"This is a readable, but flawed book. The flaw is found in the failure to create a coherent world. There are many hints at the structure of the story-world in which this book takes place, but there is a lack of actual description on the part of the author, Marion Zimmer Bradley. Rituals, phrases, and hierarchies are described, without explanation for the naive reader.The main characters are two sisters, Domaris and Deoris, who are priestesses of an unnamed religion. The religion which predates all future religions, perhaps. The (mainland) temple in which they live encapsulates the action of the story, with Atlantis lurking in the background. Atlantis, always out of focus, is a somewhat unorthodox colony where a new temple has recently emerged. The narrative thread begins when Domaris and Deoris are teenagers, and follows their diverging paths. Domaris accepts the world as it is and follows the path of the light.

Both books are long enough to develop each character's personality as she wanders through her world.Not so with \\"The Fall of Atlantis\\". In 500 pages, MZB tries to put numerous characters through a \\"battle between good and evil\\". Because of its shortness, MZB must tell the reader what each person is like in a vague description. Actually, a lot of things in this book are vague- it doesn't say why some ritual is conducted and why it is good/bad, it doesn't say why some person does this, that, and the other thing...The two main characters are whiny, girls. The younger girl doesn't seem to mentally mature past the age of 10, while the older is too goodie-goodie to like much. MZB decides to make the jump through one ring or another for the sole purpose of advancing the nonexistent plot along.I unknowingly found myself rooting for the bad guy and wanting the younger sister to escape while she still could (you'll understand if you read it).The ending doesn't seem to be finished. In other books, MZB brings closure to all characters, whether happy or sad, but this one left new beginnings for people who weren't finished achieving their goal.Despite all the bad things, I found myself liking this book. I don't know why, either. I was glued to it during the entire time it took me to read it, which wasn't very long. It does have that \\"what's going to happen next\\" feel to it.

I am surprised no-one else has commented on this aspect, as this is the aspect which transforms Fall Of Atlantis from a good and captivating, if short, book into a part of a profoundly world-view-altering whole. My only complaint is that I would have liked it to be more patient (and as a result longer), taking its time a little more as MZB does so well in her most well-known titles, but as it is, it is more absorbing the further you go into it."},{"Title":"The Fall of Atlantis","review":"The Mists of Avalon is very tough to beat, and, to be frank, this book can't top it, but it is a good story nonetheless."},{"Title":"Religion In The Liberal Polity","review":"This is a first-rate collection by a highly distinguished list of contributors, all who have published on the philosophy of religion and/or political philosophy before.

But several of the papers, e.g. by Stout, Eberle, and Mouw, do take up this challenge again, building on past work by Wolterstorff, Quinn, and others in reformed epistemology arguing against restrictions on religious reasons.

Bill Transformed the American Dream","review":"Most high school history teachers will tell their young charges that the most important event of the last century was the Second World War. That's probably an accurate statement, but there's another event that is probably just as important to the United States' rise to super power status. The passage of the G.I. Bill in 1944 would pave the way to a better life for millions of Americans and is an important a piece of legislation as the Civil Rights Act.The benefits of the G.I. Bill like help with home loans and funds for college are taken for granted by Americans today but in the 1940s it was a revolutionary concept. Edward Humes delivers a solid book, Over Here - How the G.I. Bill Transformed the American Dream, detailing how the G.I. Bill was created. He lays out how politicians of the day were anxious to create some type of package for returning soldiers, but they were not necessarily anxious to craft something that would change America. He carefully spins out the drama behind the creation of the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944 for modern readers. One of the interesting sub-plots in the book is how the primary sponsor of the Bill, Congressman John Rankin, wanted to give a lesser benefit package to women and blacks so he made sure he was in charge of the Bill's fate.Humes takes the lives of a handful of veterans and overlays them over the various components of the G.I. Bill to show how individuals were impacted. He does a good job of showing how things like the expansion of the arts in America and the suburbs were unintended side effects of the Bill. It's an interesting approach to take and makes the book feel very personal to the reader.But towards the end of the book Humes falls into a trap that is becoming all too common in the history books being published over the last couple of years. He spends the last chapter waxing poetic about how the G.I. Bill does not do enough. The agenda being pushed calls for things like national health care and revamping the Bill's education programs. While that may be a good goal in the bigger picture of things I'm getting tired of reading history books that are pushing an agenda. It would be nice to read a straight forward history book again.Cut out the last chapter and this is a good book on a topic that does not get nearly the attention or credit it deserves."},{"Title":"Over Here: How the G.I. Bill Transformed the American Dream","review":"The GI Bill following World War II was one of the largest, and most expensive, pieces of social legislation in US history. Was that good or bad? Don't answer that question until you have read this book.We have become accustomed to using the words \\"failure\\" and \\"government\\" together, and it seems the federal government goes to great lengths to ensure we keep doing that. We are all familiar with federal agencies, bureaus, and programs that epitomize incompetence, stupidity, corruption, and waste.But not everything the federal government does is a failure. Talk to any veteran who is receiving healthcare from the Veterans Administration today, and you'll realize that, yes, the federal government can actually do some things right. But you would be hard-pressed to find a better example of something done right than the original GI Bill.Humes interviewed WWII veterans who received various benefits from the GI Bill. Those veterans provided fascinating accounts of something the government actually got right. Humes wove these accounts into a larger narrative, so we can see what brought the GI Bill about. We can also understand and appreciate the profound changes it brought to America.Humes' adroit authoring resulted in an informative book that is a pleasure to read. Though well-written, this book contains some errors.ErrorsThe errors involve economics and mathematics, which aren't normally the bailiwick of someone with Humes' background as a journalist. Since he chose to write in these areas (errantly) anyhow, I have summarized the errors here:* Humes mistakenly defines the taxes of Americans in terms of the published federal income tax rates. This narrow view grossly understates the typical American tax burden. It ignores the dozens of other taxing mechanisms. For example, there are 127 different taxes in the price of a single loaf of bread. Did you know that the tax on an airline ticket can be a third or more of its price? Taxes appear to be more abundant than hydrogen.Looking at only one form of taxation as being the form of taxation is intellectually disabling. This \\"blinders on\\" approach leads to false comparisons of the tax burdens among nations, allowing bad public policy to escape scrutiny. Citizens of the United States, a debtor nation, pay higher taxes than do citizens of other industrialized nations. You can calculate the extent of the damage by looking at how much the US government spends. You just need to understand that money to pay for this spending comes out of taxpayers' hides (the pockets were emptied long ago) one way or another. Despite wishful thinking, money does not grow on trees.* Humes talks of the \\"massive tax cuts\\" that allegedly took place over the past few years. It's unfortunate that Humes parroted this political rhetoric. Those \\"tax cuts\\" are just another example of giving a little with the one hand and taking much with the other.In reality, we have suffered an enormous increase in our tax burden over the past decade. The bulk of this increase occurred in recent years. Government spending is been at record levels, and the money thus burned has to come from somewhere--that \\"somewhere\\" is, via one route or another, the citizen. When the citizen has to surrender money to the government, that is called \\"taxes.\\" Ergo, taxes have gone up. Way up.* One way the government \\"taxes without taxing\\" is it borrows. But the borrowing is huge and it has a dramatic and negative effect on the capital markets. Due to the law of supply and demand (Economics 101), it hugely raises the cost of capital, which you pay for (dearly) in the prices of the products and services you buy. Look again at the one-third direct tax on the typical airline ticket and add in this indirect tax, and you start to get the picture of just how massive the tax load is for an American citizen. But it's only a start.* Another way the government \\"taxes without taxing\\" is it expands the money supply. This lowers the value of every dollar you have (if ever so briefly), but allows the government to pay its bills in dollars that have less value to the recipient. We call this form of taxation \\"inflation.\\" How big is this tax? The $20 bill you put in your pocket in 1980 is worth less than $4 now.Imagine going to the store and being told that all prices are quadrupled just for you. Or imagine what it's like to have someone come into your home and steal 3 out of every 4 items you own. That's what the government does to you by putting more money in circulation. If not for inflation, that last airline ticket you bought would have cost less than one-fourth as much as it did. And that includes the huge portion of it that is simply a direct tax. Take all the taxes out, and that $400 airline ticket would run you about 36 bucks. In short, the actual price you pay is pretty much a rounding error compared to the tax component.* Humes says that President Bush inherited a budget surplus, but that is a meaningless and misleading bit of information. A budget surplus is easy to achieve--just do what President Clinton did and move expenditures off budget until you get the \\"budget surplus\\" you want. You can increase spending and produce a budget surplus simultaneously--the two actions do not share a dependency. As an example, consider people who have a gambling addition. They put the gambling \\"off budget\\" but wind up deep in debt anyhow. The federal government has a similar addiction to frivolous spending, with similar results.ContextFortunately, economics and mathematics are not core issues of the book. Humes shines when he presents what the GI Bill did, what it was, and what it accomplished. I especially appreciate the way he brings out the historical context. Too often, authors leave out the context and thus diminish the value of their work. It's better to understand and apply history than to repeat it. Humes' attention to context helps the reader truly understand.Providing the historical context accurately is a formidable task. Doing so when covering the GI Bill is no small feat. Remember the periods over which this took place--the Great Depression, World War II, the Korean War, the Cold War, Vietnam, and on up to the present. These have been periods of great upheaval, socially and institutionally. As various factions have fought for dominance, they have generated propaganda and misinformation that nearly drown out the facts.Humes did a great job of exposing the racial issues that influenced how the GI Bill was drafted, enacted, and executed. It may be hard for the younger reader to grasp just how obsessed people were with skin color during World War II and in the first three decades after it (or the centuries before it). Humes brought this out without being condescending on the one had, and without minimizing the ugliness on the other hand.Legislators haggled fanatically over the GI Bill as the end of WWII approached, purportedly to better serve the national interests. But none of this haggling was due to concern over the federal budget or any other national concern, despite the rhetoric people were spewing at the time. The driving force was racial subjugation. The resulting mistreatment was often extreme.Despite the way they had been mistreated at home, those people whose skin had the \\"wrong\\" color performed remarkably well in the war. But many people today still are not aware of, for example, the respect the German pilots had for the black aviators, whose planes had special markings. Humes' account of this is nicely told. The subject, of course, goes much deeper (in this book, as well as in other sources).In preparation for this review, I interviewed people who lived in Germany during the war and who encountered American troops at its conclusion. One German family had lived in their basement while German soldiers lived upstairs, then later lived in their basement while American soldiers lived upstairs. A woman now in her 90s told me, \\"The black American soldiers distinguished themselves with excellent conduct. They were very polite and respectful. They were gentlemen, and they made me feel safe for the first time in a long time.\\" All of the interviewees held similarly high opinions of the black GIs they had met.But these \\"wrong color\\" Americans returned home to find themselves still disenfranchised and mistreated by their fellow citizens. They also found, as Humes revealed, their rights under the GI Bill greatly reduced or denied to them altogether. Humes ferreted out the facts to present the non-revisionist picture of exactly what went on, and who was behind it. Humes peeled back the layers of this particular onion so we could see the complex and often invisible machinations of people obsessed with abusing other people based on skin color.And that's just touching on the racial issues. The astute reader can pick up at least a dozen other contextual \\"fibers\\" in the book. All of these form a framework that allows the story of the GI Bill to take shape and make sense. Humes did his homework, and it shows.I could mention Humes' coverage of another victim class: women. But I will leave that for the reader of this review to explore in the book itself. The parallels to, and the differences from, the racial misdeeds are quite interesting.Great EffectsA college education was available only to the elite class before World War II. But the GI Bill allowed millions of the Depression-era poor to obtain a college education after the war. Most of the children of these GIs grew up in single-family, mortgaged homes (the GI Bill is why we have suburbs, today) and also obtained college educations.Humes delves into many areas to show us how the GI Bill changed the very culture and fabric of society. For example, most of the people who directly benefited from this government largesse in the 1940s and 1950s would later hold to the worldview that less government is better government. Is that hypocrisy? To answer that question, Humes discusses it in context.The teens who went to war in World War II had grown up with nothing. Then the government put them in the military, where they were constantly being told to what do and then sent off to miserable and dangerous war. After the war, they went to college or trade school at night, working long hours to have something to call their own. Then along came the government with taxes that ate away at earnings and regulations that ate away at freedom. So, it's logical that this demographic, in general, would not be disposed toward liking big government, big brother, or a nanny state. But this is also a generation very conscious of money, because they came through the Great Depression. Go back to the basic math we looked at earlier, and it makes sense that this generation objects to having their pockets picked so voraciously.To see another example of the effect of the GI Bill, just look at the long lead the USA had in science and technology for the decades following the war. Humes explains how this came about, and what factors contributed to it (in addition to the GI Bill).If you've visited Japan (or any of several other nations) recently, you've noticed the USA no longer leads the world in technology. In fact, it has fallen behind in many areas. A November 2006 article on cell phones, for example, revealed that the top nine models aren't even available in the USA. Many other areas of technology follow a similar \\"loss of lead\\" pattern.For a clue as to where the USA fits overall (not just technology), consider one statistic: life expectancy. Americans are ranked somewhere between 40th place and 50th place among nations (the statistic varies by source and methodology). My opinion is this decline is due to such factors as the \\"normal\\" obsession with overeating (which has resulted in a obesity epidemic) and the stress of all the hours we work just to pay our outrageously high taxes. The latter may be the cause of the former.GI Bill 2Because the GI Bill was so transformational at the middle of the previous century, there's been speculation that something similar is needed now. It's unlikely this great experiment in socialism would be accepted today. Americans generally are suffering from statism fatigue, so yet another huge dose of it could be the straw that breaks the camel's back--no matter how beneficial it might be.Even so, Humes puts forth some ideas on how GI Bill 2 might work. We'd have to suspend his contextual way of looking at things to find these ideas applicable to today's world.Indeed, if we apply Hume's contextual observations of the post-war era to today, we can see that the kind of solution we need lies in the other direction. That is, it lies in rolling back our massive government rather than expanding it further. Yes, the GI Bill was a massive investment, rather than a welfare program or pork barrel \\"re-elect me\\" burning of tax dollars. But that was in a very different era, and the federal government of the time was far smaller than the unaffordable monstrosity that is dragging us down today.We can clearly trace the cause of our decline to massive federal overspending (mostly on waste). Repeat after me, \\"Money does not grow on trees....\\" To afford GI Bill 2, we would need to drastically cut current federal overspending. We must do the same, if we are going to restore our crumbling infrastructure. We would need to fund the costs of those essentials before considering GI Bill 2.From a political point of view, bringing federal spending down to a sensible or affordable level is impossible. That's because pork barrel spending is the means by which politicians earn their keep from those who put them in office. The more they waste, the more secure their jobs are. Imagine if you could keep your job, with an automatic pay raise each year, by robbing the homes of your company's shareholders. That's what members of Congress do to keep their jobs--they rob your home via higher taxes, direct or indirect.There are only a few small groups begging legislators for some mercy toward the people who are fleeced to pay for the massive overspending. But there are hundreds of powerful lobbyists pressuring legislators to misallocate your money--and rewarding them for doing so.From a practical point of view, reducing spending to a sensible and affordable level is easy because most of the spending isn't needed. The idea of \\"making tough choices\\" doesn't apply, because there are so many easy ones to make first.Some sources say 99% of federal spending isn't needed, and other sources provide lower estimates. In any case, the amount of unneeded spending dwarfs the amount of spending that serves any legitimate purpose or does the average citizen any good.The federal government is 185 times larger than it was a century ago, and the debt it has saddled us with is astronomical. Yet, our so-called representatives ignore such \\"low-hanging fruit\\" solutions as eliminating costly agencies that serve no legitimate purpose. Let's consider an example, next.The United States spends more on its military than the next five nations combined, while the IRS has more employees than all of our military has soldiers and sailors combined. Yet, the IRS is just another, extremely expensive, layer of taxing that is redundant to other taxing bodies. This massive army that strikes terror into the heart of innocent citizens while consuming vast quantities of tax dollars to do so could be replaced by a single harmless employee who simply coordinates and tracks payments from the 50 states. We could do this easily, if we went back to apportionment.Having an IRS is like turning on all of your stovetop burners to heat one small pan--just a senseless waste of resources (with the added catch you also pour boiling water on your foot). Nobody with any common sense would turn on all four burners just to heat one small pan. Similarly, common sense mandates to Congress and the Senate that they put an end to the IRS with all due haste. They could then put the billions of dollars saved to a worthwhile use.The fact we still have an IRS shows how irresponsible the Congress and the Senate are. Trusting them with a GI Bill 2 is dicey, at best. But the issue is moot because the profligate spending has made any new spending unaffordable.Senseless waste is institutionalized in dozens of federal agencies and programs, most of which we would not miss if they were simply eliminated. Cleaning up that mess would free up enormous financial capital that could be used in something worthwhile like a second GI Bill. The thought is tantalizing.If you can disregard Humes' tax analysis and pseudo-economics, and if you can put his GI Bill 2 proposals in the proper context, you will enjoy this book and benefit from reading it. Understanding one of the major forces that shaped modern life can provide many lessons for us. Thanks to Humes, those lessons come with fascinating stories and some plain old good reading."},{"Title":"Over Here: How the G.I. Bill Transformed the American Dream","review":"As Edward Humes capably points outs, the GI Bill guaranteed that college would be an \\"entitlement,\\" though \\"Inner cities would collapse.\\" Chicago Tribune columnist Mike Royko reminds us that the GI Bill was a mixed blessing, not simply a feel-good high for Democratic party optimism: \\"The majority of guys from my neighborhood did not use the GI Bill for school. They used it for a loan for a home.\\" As Royko laments, \\"That's when the younger couples started moving out. Guys got married and went lookin' to live somewhere else. The neighborhood never recovered.\\" A corporatized Buffalo Commons in big cities everywhere. It might be argued that this Rooseveltian New Deal hand-out helped to ruin the municipal fabric of America just as much as did many other dubious progressive policies associated with urban renewal, such as Robert Moses's Cross-Bronx Expressway during the 1950s, a direct descendant of the GI Bill.What were the benefits of living in long-settled ethnic neighborhoods? Slap-in-the-face obvious to most. During the war, one form of local self-policing stood out as an example, Royko remembers: \\"If a guy came into the tavern with the wife or girlfriend of a guy who was overseas, somebody might have gone after him.\\" Anything changed in our Hollywood-directed climate of libertinism today?Some just as easily argue that the use of the GI Bill for higher education, despite the obvious advantages to individuals and society at times, resulted in a similar upsetting of traditional and secure relationships in society. Individuals were pulled from expected family and personal careers, often to more stressful vocations and locations far from family roots, thus depleting local communities of sustaining input from their best and brightest.It should also be remembered that Jack Short, a retired IBM executive who took advantage of the GI Bill after the war, couldn't help but reflect on the underlying contempt for the working class that lay behind this jackpot-like entitlement: \\"We just didn't want to go back and work in a factory in the hometown. The GI Bill was a blessing.\\"Is it surprising, then, that today our manufacturing has been outsourced to China, while our agricultural jobs go to imported labor? With its implicit attack on the dignity of labor, it seems odd that unions would embrace the so-called progressives supporting such a taxpayer giveaway.Our would-have-been laborer now is programmed to \\"go to college\\" (little mention of the value of learning anything) to reap the benefit of a higher income (no lip service anymore to the value of knowledge itself). Haven't managers at all levels in education, in universities especially, been quick to adjust to this new demand/supply equation? Do undergraduate professors actually \\"profess\\" these days, anymore than any teacher, as such, does? Or have they become glorified junior managers, fitting end products of the well-meaning GI Bill legacy?Even so, Short is not blind to the darker, but realistic implications of the apparent free money of the GI Bill: \\"Yet it was bad in a way. Twenty dollars a week for fifty-two weeks. A lotta people just sat, they didn't even look for jobs. Just like welfare. I think in the long run it might have been detrimental.\\""},{"Title":"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (a Puppet Storybook)","review":"Very nice story for bedtime reading to my kids.

The comedy in it was what gave it it's quality. The father in the book, Daniel, always had a good sense of humor. He was like my father and was always joking with his kids.

This book has been able to touch the laughs and the soul of many who read it.This \\"exceptional\\" book has been awarded for its greatness and even its language that can be understood by 4th graders. But besides that, I have found many reasons to like this book. One is including the personalities, as well as the descriptive writing of the \\"Weird Watson\\" (page 17; paragraph one) family. For example, we have Byron, the oldest of the siblings in the family, that has his classic reputation for being the juvenile delinquent of the family, and also being the \\"god\\" of Clark Elementary. But knowing this great author, Byron has better features as well. Even at one point where Kenny feels depressed and shaken by the bombing event, Byron, steps in to help Kenny through these times, showing a more compassionate side to him. Yet the amazing characters of this book are not the only things that have widen my imagination. I have found that everything; including the places, people and mood, have been woven together to create this \\"exceptional\\" book. Also I liked the fact that there were changes, not fast or slow, in the mood of the book. For example, on page 19 line 1-14 where Kenny begins a dialogue; \\"Joetta guess what. I'm thinking about writing my own comic book.\\" \\"What about?\\" \\"Well, it's going to be about this real mean criminal who has a terrible accident that turns him into a superhero.\\"... \\"Do you want to know what I'm going to call this new superhero?\\" \\" What?\\" \\" I'm going to call him the lipless Wonder. All he does in beat up superheroes smaller than him and the only thing he is afraid of is a cold mirror.\\"This part showed the humorous side of the story where Kenny tells of Byron's story of how he got his lips stuck to a cold mirror in a slightly more enjoyable way. As apposed to the other side where things are sad, for another example on page 75 Chapter 6, where Byron kills a bird by accident, then gets emotional again, slightly grieving its death. Yet the most interesting fact, that interested me the most was the theme of the book.The theme given by this book was hard to find since I got caught up in the book, but reading more than twice, I have found that the book's theme is that life is a person. Thinking back at this book, is makes sense, since Kenny and the Watson family have funny days; like where Byron gets his lip froze up; to dark times, such as the Birmingham Bombing that affected more than just the Watson's. These symbolize a person like the fact that a person has days where they feel good and happy and days where this person fells bad and depressed. But in the end all the wounds eventually heal, with a little help, just like what Kenny did after the Birmingham Bombing. I agree with this theme because I, and almost everyone can relate to this, because everyone has good and terrible days, yet in the end all your wounds hurts, heal with help form family and friends.I recommend this book to age 9-adult. Why I recommend this to so many is because, The Watsons go to Birmingham; for one, is readable by kids because of its easy language and vocabulary, while it gives an enjoyable time and reasonable read for adults, young and old. But why I recommend this book to a wide age is because it can cover many real-life lessons, and depicts accurately the life of a proud African-American, family."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"This book was interesting. It was very good, the author made excellent use of the characters, and used vibrant foreshadowing with a hint of personification. I really liked the characters in this book, they are very interesting."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham is a wonderful comedy book that shows life as an African American in the 1960's.I give this book three stars because it is very funny and a great book for people who love funny and adventurous stories. The main character is Kenny Watson. His family consists of his Mom, Dad, his brother, Byron, and his sister, Joey. Many hilarious things happen to Kenny and his family, like when Byron gets his tongue stuck to the rear-view mirror of the family car, the brown bomber. Also Kenny's friend steals almost all of his toy dinosaurs. Byron gets in alot of trouble for skipping school and playing with fire. He gets in so much trouble that Kenny's parents are going to send him to stay with their Grandma Sands in Birmingham, Alabama. Their whole family drives down to Birmingham to visit with Grandma Sands. While they are in Birmingham Kenny has a live or death situation in a fight with the Wool Pooh, and Byron saves him. In Birmingham at that time many white folk are mad at black people and do racist things against black people in that area. This book shows how those kinds of things affected many people all over the United States."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"I thouhgt this book was a very good ongoing book.

I stongly encourage others to get a hold of this book and read it. It grabbed my attention throughout the first chapter and that is somthing that is very important to me. The story is well developed. It's not overexaggerated. The story itself could really happen to any average person. The Watsons go to Birmingham encourage me to read more of his books."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"I really enjoyed reading The Watsons..... after I got into it. The everyday life of the family and the events they experienced in Alabama really gives readers a good inside look about a small portion of African American life in general. The author also did a great job showing different ways people react to tragedy. The only obstacle I had with this book is that it was hard to get into at first, it moved a little slow."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"i liked this book because i liked the part where the killer chickens avenged their doom by chasing people around with spoons and forks. soon enough people got tired of running so they told the chickens to stop chasing them but they didnt. pretty soon the chickens caught all the people and forced them to eat cows soaked in poo like marinade.

Sure MOST of it leads up to the main point of the story, but do you realize this? I sure didn't.The author's style of writing makes this book hard to follow. I can tell that he tried to write from a 10-year-old's point of view, but obviously he tried a lil too hard, because it sounds like from the point of view fom a very immature ten year old.The description of the setting and characters in this book made it very difficult for me to write a book report for; and I just overall didn't like it, although most of the people I know (from my brother to my best friends) were exclaiming, \\"Oh, you're reading that? Isn't it the best?\\"I usually finish a book this length in 1 1/2 to 2 days.

It is about a rather strange family named the Watsons and their life in general. Join Byron, Kenny, &amp; Joetta as they go on journey filled with classic sibling rivlary, self realizations, and an event that will show how cruel humans can be. A wonderful story that everyone should read!"},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"This book is about a family in 1963 that lives in FlintMichigan but are from Birmingham. They were nicknamed the weirdWatsons and in this book you will find out why.There are 5 people in the Watson family, Momma- with here toothless grin. Dad- time to wax the brown bommer again! Byron- now an official juvenile delinquent. Kenny- the wool pooh is coming! Joetta-as usually just tryng to save Byron's life.Byron is not what you would call a &quot;good&quot; boy, and he is where the story starts. After many months of Byron lighting matches, diying his hair, skipping school, charging cookies to his parent's account, and more, Dad and Momma decided to send him to Birmingham for the summer. They could not afford a plane, Momma hates the train and wouldn't let Byron go by himself, so they decided to drive. Then they could stay at grandma Sands house. but When they get there the circumstsnses change completely. In the end the whole family, including Byron, ends up back home and Kenny ends up in the world famous Watson pet hospital.This is a very good book, and it has won many awards. I would recomend this book to young adults that like touching stories or to laugh out loud, but really kids 9 to 99 will love this book!"},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"My class rated the book and we gave it a 9 out of ten.

How bout making it even better by making a part 2 of the Watsons.There were some things that were kind of boring but don't get me wrong, the book was good but in my point of view, I say you made some mistakes. I think you got a little carried away with the run on sentences. Other than that the book was very good. BY: THE J. MAN"},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"The Watsons go to Birmingham is about the burning of churches in Alabama. I think this book should be Read by ever student. When I was reading this book I didn't know that people were so mean to African Americans in the 60's. In this book Kenny was telling the story and it makes the story more interesting to read because he is a kid like me. After you read this book you can understand why Martian Luther king led the march for freedom for the Africans Americans who being treaded unfairly in the South. Kenny's brother By is a lot like other brother of his age. By made the reading interesting because of all the stuff he would do for example he kissed him self on the mirror and he got his lips stuck on it. There is part in this book were Kenny and By go swimming and they did not listen to the sign that said not to swim. Kenny went swimming any way and almost drowned but his brother By saved him. I would have not gone swimming even of the sign said not to. I would give this book Five out of Five stairs. I think that ever on should read this book."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"From Mr. Barbour's 4th period 6th Grade Gifted Language Arts Class...We all rated the book between 4 and 5 stars so collectively we would give it a 4.7/5 rating.The book is funny and very realistic. When compared to our daily lives and the interactions we have with members of our families, we can really relate to the characters. Joey (the little sister) is like the second mom of the house--very protective. Big brother Byron is mean, but very cool! The siblings alternate between being cooperative and cruel, just like in real life. Kenny is very smart and respectful and many of us identify with him in several ways.We like learning about history through stories like this and not just textbooks. We think it is shocking that someone would stoop so low as to bomb a church just because African Americans went there! There is a powerful message about racism in this book, though at times we were confused when the Mom and Dad taught what we feel are hurtful lessons.Overall, we feel this is an amazing book that we highly recommend to anyone who wants to laugh and be shocked while they learn about history."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"This is one of the funniest books I have ever read.

I am an 8th grader at a public middle school, and my class has just (finally) finished this book after reading it and breaking it down for two months. I have always enjoyed reading and literature, but found reading this entirely tedious! I can also guarantee that every single other in my class would agree with me 100%.The book is basically about an African American family in Michigan. They end up traveling to Birmingham, Alabama (for a very short period of time), where a family disaster of sorts occurs. They then return home, ending the book. My concern is not necessarily with this part of the book, as it is with the first 150 (out of 210) filled with completely meaningless and irrelative stories. They include chapters about Dinosaur Wars (plastic dinos), Movie-making in the toilet, and lazy eyes and brainiacs. While these supposedly \\"witty\\" tales may be enjoyable to a second grader, but anyone above that level has better things to do. Trust me. I'd also like to add that the characters only make the story worse. If you are interested in a book of Country-talking southerners, bad comedians, whiners, dumb 10 year olds, and a barely bully, pick this book up today! In summary, this book drags on for what seems like years, and I would NOT recommend it to anyone with any taste.The book has few \\"good\\" parts, and I found it hard to laugh at what is supposedly a comedy! The jokes (the few that were included) were either: a) so ridiculously simple, they weren't worth printing, or b) not funny enough to even realize they were supposed to be funny in the first place. The plot was very dull and barely recognizable. A torturous read."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"I did not like the book.

They're 100 pages basically just introducing the perfect stereo type family and in two pages with a brief description the church is bombed. Then in two more days it's back to normal. The author used the same metaphors over and over again and it got very tiresome and annoying. The book was very predictable. A long story for a short plot. I don't reccomend you reading it for it's a waste of time and it certainly does not help you better understand history seeing they only spent two pages on it in the 200 page book."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"The Watsons go to Birmingham is a book about a disfunctional family. 9 out of 15 chapters of the book they aren't even in Birmingham.

I believe no one should go through the torture of reading it or waste time during their life.This book depicts the journey of an African American family to Birhmingham during the civil rights movement. It creates a less than substantual climax, more resembling a flat plane, to an empty end. It shows the authors weak insight to childrens emotions.I know this is Curtis's first book but I can't help commenting on his lack of elementry stories segments. No problem, except for that of trivial teasing, is seen in this piece, also the \\"rising events\\" are more like a snail climing Mt. Everest. I'm sorry but I fervently wish you won't read this book.

Grandma Sands is very strict which his parents think will help him with his behavior.For the trip to Birmingham, Mrs. Watson made a schedule with all the break times on it, but it didn't work that well because they ended up not stopping at all. When they got to Grandma Sands house she was already out waiting on the porch. Everyone went up to hug her and say hi including Kenny and Joey who had never met her before. Mrs. Watson was excited to catch up with her mother about all the events that had happened after she had gotten married she learned a lot about what some of her old friends were doing now and were they lived. While the Watson's are in Birmingham Kenny starts to loose control of his behavior and Byron is on his best behavior he could ever be in.The Watson family had heard of a recent drowning and were told not to go to Colliers Landing were the drowning took place, but Kenny decides to go anyway. They next night they heard of another catastrophe, a bombing had taken place at a nearby church where Joey went to Sunday School at. Kenny believed that when the bombing occurred Joey was actually in the church. They spent the whole day worried about Joey until they found that she was okay and had went home earlier. Even after they found out that the Watson family spent many days of sorrow together in Birmingham after they found four little girls had been killed and two injured. Will Byron and Kenny learn to get along?I recommend this book to readers of all ages who like to read about what kind events went on a long time ago in a non-fiction story. This is a very entertaining and adventurous book which I could not stop reading."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"Although this book is about racism during the 60's, it has several underlying elements of poverty, such as the high level placed on relationships, entertainment, and food.In spite of different character traits, each member places a high value on the relationships within the family, especially during a time of crisis. Both Byron and Joetta jump to Kenny's aid when he is caught up in the \\"Wool Pooh.\\" In a like manner, Kenny runs to find his sister when the church is bombed. Also, Byron helps Kenny cope with his insecurities by sleeping on the couch, offering to eat with him, and watching television with him.This story is an excellent read for both young and adult readers. It is historically based, humorous, and more importantly, a good depiction of the 1960's era."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"This book starts off with Kenny and his family being called the \\"Weird Watsons\\". You start the chapter by getting to know the family, Kenny, Joetta, his momma, his dad, and Byron who gets called By, Daddy cool, and Daddy-o. After that it mixes in a typical day with the family introduction.The book is mostly about Kenny's life and how he gets teased, and how he goes to Birmingham and typical ten year old, elementary type stuff in 1963. It's like a portal to 1963 through a ten year old boy's mind during the civil rights movement. Surprisingly enough it effects them in the last chapter, but you will have to read it to find out!!!In this book Kenny has a \\"line\\", if you should say, he repeats it overtime he says \\"...might as well tied to a tree and yelled \`ready, aim, fire\\".The book has a good sense of humor and will make the grouchiest person laugh, it made me crack up!!At the end it has a epilogue that explains the time period and tells about famous heroes like Dr.Martin Luther King JR., and Rosa Parks, and how they did the boycott and how they used Gahndi's tactics to stop civil injustice in a non-violent, peaceful way."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"I love this book. Usually my teacher picks out boring novels for us to read in class. However, this one is excellent. The descriptions are excellent.

But, if you are looking for a good book that is humorous and will hold the reader's attention, this the book you want."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"This book is full of drama, comedy, and so much catstrophe. The part with the most comedy is when Rufus and his brother(new kids) both get on the bus and talk funny.

The story is about a boy named Kenneth Watson who has an older brother, Byron, a younger sister, Joetta, a mom, and a dad. They all live in Flint, Michigan. Byron is constantly getting into trouble, so mom and dad decide that he should spend the summer with his grandmother in Birmingham. The whole family has to go on the trip because they can't leave anybody at home. While they are in Birmingham, the church is attacked by white people who throw a stick of dynamite into it. Kenny goes into the church after this and thinks he sees Joetta's shoe, and he thinks that the Whool Pooh, an imaginary evil twin of Winnie the pooh, is trying to kidnap her, so he leaves. When he finds out that Joetta wasn't in the church, he feels guilty because even if she had been in the church he wouldn't have helped her escape the Whool Pooh. After this, they decide to leave Birmingham. When they get back home, Kenneth hides behind the couch in their house and hopes to not feel guilty about not rescuing Joetta. Byron finally (...). I like this book and would recommend it to readers of any age. It is funny and entertaining. For example, one funny part is when Byron tries to kiss his reflection is the car mirror and gets his lips stuck to it.

I enjoyed it. It is one of those were you have to think and sometimes come up with you own conclusions. You should probably know that the Watsons are a black family. In the begining the Watson are a very relaxed family. THe trouble maker in the family is being sent to Birmingham, Alabama from his home town of Flint, Michigan. When down in Birmingham things get sturred up. One of the churhes gets boomed and on of the Watsons was in the church. The Watsons go to Birmingham has a good story to tell. It tell how tight I family can be and what could make all the changes in your life. This book showed me how it was to be black in the south at this time. You never know when you are safe.

I found the story somewhat drawn out and contrived for the first two-thirds before being redeemed by the final pages. While the book is considered historical fiction, the only thing truly historical involves a church bombing in Alabama, which is contorted to fit neatly into the plot instead of building the plot around the actual event. I didn't find the description of life in Flint, Michigan during the early 60s especially convincing or even descriptive for that matter. Race is virtually ignored until the children confront the ugliness of southern hatred. It seems hard to imagine that racial problems were not part of everyday life, especially considering the violence that would haunt Detroit just a few years later. Overall, an enjoyable story about the importance of our families and other people in general, but not necessarily a great piece of historical fiction."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"&quot;The Watsons Go to Birmingham - 1963&quot; is an intelligent book written by Christopher Paul Curtis on family life and also the disastrous and hurtful effects of racism, prejudice, and discrimination. The story involves a family called &quot;The Weird Watsons&quot;, and they are very supportive of each other, although they get into arguments and trouble. The rough Momma, joking Dad, troublesome Byron, cute Joetta, or Joey for short, and the narrator of this story is the middle child, Kenny. Kenny describes his feelings, and uses many phrases, such as &quot;they might as well tie me to a tree and shout ready, aim, fire!&quot;. &quot;The Watsons Go to Birmingham&quot; is a plus for kids and adults, full of hilarious moments and also serious events toward the end. The first few chapters tells about the family while they are living in Flint, Michigan. There are many unforgettable characters that are involved in this story, and many of them live near the Watsons. During this chapters, most of the storyline is about ridiculous stuff, which Byron (the so-called juvenile deliquent) tells to haunt Joetta and Kenny. Momma fusses about the frigid cold of Michigan, for she is from the south. The middle part tells about the family preparing for a trip down to Birmingham, because Byron would not behave himself. The end tells about the Watsons in Birmingham, especially about the church bombing. &quot;The Watsons Go to Birmingham - 1963&quot; is a fascinating book and combines all the possible genres in it. You have got to read this book to know how amazing it is!!!"},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"I just finished reading your book.I believe the book was great. I think the funniest part of the book was when the the Arkansas boy(Rufus) caught the bus. Then Larry Dunn started tell jokes on him. The bus driver said something about his mother.

An older brother that thinks he is too cool to be seen with Kenny, even though he has failed a few grades, a little sister that complains and tattles on everything that the boys do wrong, and two loving parents that, like most, can be embarrassing. Like a lot of kids that stand out because they have qualities that make him different Kenny gets picked on but soon he finds a great friend that does not mind the things that make Kenny who he is. When his brother Bryon gets into more trouble than their mother is willing to put up with the whole family takes a trip from Flint Michigan to Birmingham Alabama. Throughout this beautifully written book you see how Kenny changes and grows. Realizing that the world is not the same as it is in his hometown the story line takes the reader on a journey during the civil rights movement. This book has several moments that would allow for a moral lesson on what would be the right thing to do, or what would you do if you were put in the same situation as the characters. Some of the language and situations may not be appropriate for the younger reader. Make sure to read through it first to decide if its something you would want your reader to experience. The author has great use in descriptive words when describing the things Kenny experiences and how they affect him. You will be drawn into this book and live out every event with Kenny."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"You may finish this book, but you will never forget it. Not only is it a page turner but the book it heartfelt. Not only will reader's relate to the family dynamics, but will take the reader to the past that seems vastly different from the life we now live. Curtiz does an impeccable job of expanding the awareness to readers of the social injustice in the south during the 1960's with the bombing and killing of several school age children. Although the book does deal with some serious social issues, Curtiz has a way of keeping the book light and funny to balance to the deep issues throughout the book."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"This was read so well it was very hard to put down!

The family consists of a Father who grew up in Flint, a mother from Birmingham Alabama, a juivenille delinquent named Byron who is always causing trouble for himself or others with his best friend called Bup-Head. Then there is Kenny the main character who is 10 years old and learning how to cope with the fact that he is smarter than his brother and he's always going to get beat up, and the youngest member of the family is Joetta a.k.a Joey. The Watsons decide to head down to Birmingham so Byron can learn to behave while spending time with \\"Grandma Sands\\".

I listen to audiobooks with my daughter all the time, and both of us are always asking for this one again.First of all, it's funny--and for me, nostalgic. It's one of the best audio recordings of a children's book I've heard (except of course for Harry Potter, which sets a standard that can hardly be met elsewhere). The voices of each character suit the personality and character and vary with tone enough to make each one distinguishable by itself. The speed and pace of the reading, and its clarity is also excellent, and the speaker's timing helps to keep the story comprehensible even for a child with an auditory processing deficit.Naturally, the book is a masterpiece, so that makes it a lot easier to read well--but don't miss the recording of the book, it's part of the pleasure itself."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"The Watsons Go To Birmingham was the best book I have read. There is so history to be learned from the characters. We really related to the problems that the children faced. We also got a change to learn about life in the 60s when my mom was growing up."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"I have to agree with the reviewer who says that this story doesn't have much of a plot. It doesn't. I was expecting the entire book to be about the trip to Alabama, and not just the last three chapters. The rest of the book is a bit jerky, as it's highly episodic. While certain events in the book do lead to the trip down South, I have to say that this book does not necessarily form a cohesive whole.That said, I do give Curtis great credit for writing a book about this era in history, and making it interesting and educational at the same time. Curtis also does not spare the emotions and feelings of the characters either. No longer do we have to read about a bunh of docile people staring great tragedy in the face and making excuses. The characters in this book know that the actionsof the racists are bad, know that the spitting and leering people following the African American children into the schools are wrong. This made a difference to me as I read the book. It was refreshing to hear these characters call this behavior evil and reprehensible. Perhaps for too long many authors have been afraid to pin such adjectives on the perpetrators of these crimes, especially in children's/young adult books, but I am glad that the anger shows, and that these characters are affected and angry by the turn of events. Of course, I would also hope that this book would foster discussion of the events, and the entire Civil Rights era. Curtis thankfully has a post-script at the end of the book, explaining the events in clear, understandable prose that the reader will find just as interesting as the main story. I am glad that this book got the recognition that it did."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"The \\"Weird Watsons,\\" as they are known in their Flint, MI neighborhood, are an African-American family living in the 1960's. Kenny is the middle child and the story is told from his point of view. His older brother Byron is a bully and a \\"juvenile delinquent,\\" and his younger sister Joetta is the family peacemaker. After a particularly troublesome incident with Byron, the Watsons decide that Byron needs to spend the summer in Birmingham, AL with Grandma Sands.The story follows the adventures of the Watson family in Michigan, their trip down to Birmingham, and the subsequent culture shock the kids experience. The children are not as familiar with the civil unrest the south is experiencing and are plunged headfirst into it with their trip. One of the most significant events in the book does not come until the very end - the church bombing that took the lives of four little girls.Just as Bud, Not Buddy is a great way to teach the Great Depression, The Watsons Go To Birmingham is a great way to teach the Civil Rights Movement. Kids can relate to at least one of the kids in the story and perhaps get some sense of what life was like back then. It does have a bit of mild cursing (mostly from Byron), so you may want to preview it ahead of time. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"The book describes the Watsons--an African-American family of 5--who live in Flint, Michigan. About half-way through the book, they decide to travel to Birmingham, where the mother's family lives. Told by the middle child, Kenny, the story has moments that are hilarious (usually involving Byron--the oldest who is a troublemaker) and moments of great sorrow (such as the church bombing). The epilogue explains what was actually going on in America during 1963, and the impact of the civil rights movement. It gives a history lesson in a way students can understand. For me, this was the most valuable part of the book.Other reviewers have mentioned the language. There are some bad words in the book, usually spoken by Byron. This is part of characterization. Byron is constantly in trouble, and he's always trying to be the tough guy. He uses foul language at times to get this message across to Kenny.I teach junior high students, and this is a book we read every year. It's amazing. My students love it, and it opens the door for great class discussions. Students in today's world cannot fathom the challenges experienced by the Watson family. This book is a window into a different era, and because the characters are so likable and realistic, children can relate to them. This was a book my students were begging to read every day."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"A vividly drawn, probably autobiographical, portrayal of a northern black family that takes a fateful trip to Alabama. The Watsons of Flint, Michigan are a stable working class family. The central character, nerdy, sweet Kenny, is the middle child of three. He's ten, likes to read, and has a \\"lazy eye.\\" His older brother Byron has delinquent tendencies, and his younger sister Joetta loves everybody. The pace is leisurely, with Kenny as narrator. His daily trials are gently enumerated: Byron torments him; other kids steal his toys and tease him about his eye. But Kenny learns from his loving parents to cope with these and other problems.The book picks up pace when the family plans a summer trip to Birmingham in their beloved 15-year-old \\"Brown Bomber.\\" Kenny's father has tricked out the car with the latest gadgets, including an \\"Ultra Glide\\" record player mounted on the dash. The scene in which the family first tries the Ultra Glide is among the book's highlights: though they have a record player inside the house, all five sit for two hours in the stationary vehicle, taking turns playing their favorites (Kenny requests the Coasters' \\"Yakety Yak\\" every single time).Their stay in Birmingham, Mrs. Watson's hometown, goes from interesting to traumatic when little Joetta appears to have been killed in a church bombing. Here the author takes the story to a higher plane as he connects the Watson's experiences with a terrible piece of US history. The book is, in fact, dedicated to four black girls who perished in one of the many racially linked bombings of the 1960s. The story would make a terrific film. The dialogue is pitch-perfect, apart from the author's careless overuse of the word \\"slob,\\" by which he means the noun \\"slobber\\" or \\"drool.\\" The word appears about a dozen times; it draws attention to itself and away from the story.Appropriate for middle school and up, especially those studying the Civil Rights era. Kenny's episode of post-traumatic reaction after he touches a body at the bomb site will offer an opportunity to discuss how people deal with tragedy and shock."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"This book had humor, likeable characters, a story line that everyone can find a connection to.

There were some nitpicky things I disliked, though. I think the title was misleading, since they didn't actually go to Birmingham until very late in the story, and to me, it's not the biggest part of the story. (Maybe it should have just been titled 'The Watsons'? Their familial bonds are what the story is about to me.) Another thing that bothered me was the first page, too many similes and metaphors. This is not continued in the rest of the book, and is also doesn't sound like a ten year old child speaking at all. I did love the chapter titles, though. They were very conversational and informal, exactly what you'd expect from a ten year old like Kenny. The plot was great, until the ending. That was the most abrupt ending I've ever had to read. The story was flowing so well, and then, poof, you never actually find out what happens to Byron and the rest of the Watsons.

So she's ok."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"In the Adventure of the Watsons Go to Birmingham the main characters are Kenny, Byron, Mama, Dad, and Joey. Some of the main events that take place in The Adventure of the Watsons Go to Birmingham are Kenny helping Byron get his lips of the frozen poll outside. Also, when Byron decides to go out and get a conk without his parents permission and ruining his African American hair. The most important event in this story I think is when the Watsons Go to Birmingham on there vacation. This book is mostly fiction is only has one real event that actually happens in real life. The event that is real is when white people bombed an African American church!"},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"I enjoyed the first chapter of the book because it was very entertaning. It started off talking about how cold it is in Flint. Then it went on talking about how they could have been Hambone Hendersons. Later in this chapter was the most hilarious part when By got his name The Lipless Wonder. I thought it was odd that he was kissing the mirror. If I was asked if I would recommend this book I would have to say yes. It is a very entertaning book and you should read it."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"I am an 8th grade student. In my english class we had to read the book The Watsons Go To Birmingham. At first I wasn't at first thrilled but once getting into the 1st chapter my perspectivae changed. The 1st chapter is hysterical. Byron really thinks of himself as a \\"Big Shot1!\\" Why would you kiss you image in the MIRROR on a cold day. Moma finally just pulls him off. This is a very good book. I would recommend this to anyone."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"I think this is a preaty good book. I liked it better than Tom Sawyer. I meet Winnie's evil brother, the Wool Pooh was the best chapter because it wasn't Byron being stupid it was Kenny. the other part I liked about this book was when kenny said \\"ready, aim, fire!\\" or when he said \\"dead as donut\\". my other favorite part is when Byron killed the Morning bird."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"It was ok it did have some funny parts like kenny and by fighting. But it moved arounde alot like it did not stay one thing. But to me was not as good as Tom Sawyer. Because it was not as action pack and Tom was more like me that this book."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"This book is one of the best books I have ever read. (And let me tell you I've read alot of books.) It is a great way to have some fun and learn at the same time. It also replecates the Birmingham church bombing with much detail. The charictars are funny in some ways such as saying Wool Pooh instead of whirlpool and the garbage trucks really picking up frozen southern people. Byron (older brother) is somewhat of what a teenager would probably be like while Kenny is just a regular kid. I think that the best part is while they were preparing to and travling to Birmingham, the landmarks they passed were all real at the time and some of them are still there today.This book is a must read for all, I really wish I could say more, but I can't."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"This book starts out like every book starts; describing Kenny, Byron, Joey and their parents. It was really funny when Byron got his lips frozen to the mirror. Kenny lives in Flint, Michigan and drove all the way to Birmingham, Alabama during the Civil Rights Movement. The reason they go there is because Byron kept getting into trouble and they needed to teach him a lesson. Unfortunately, they have to go back home because the 16th Street Babtist Church was bombed and it was too dangerous to leave Byron with Grandma Sands. I'd give this book an eight and a half out of ten points. It was very good but a little too old for me. I really did like the book; it was really funny."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"I think this is a wonderful book! It is great for middle school children. My favorite chapter is \\"Swedish Cremes and Welfare Cheese\\". I like this chapter because it has a mixture of comedy, drama, and ephiphany. I think it's hilarious how Byron curses Kenny out, and Kenny grins from ear to ear. It is dramatic when Byron kills the mourning dove and immediately reacts badly to it. I think Kenny learns that his brother is a very complex person. He says, \\"Leave it to Daddy Cool to kill a bird, then give it a funeral...to torture human kids...but feel sorry for a stupid little grayish brown bird.\\" I would highly recommend this book to anyone who likes a story that will take them on an emotional roller coaster."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"Kenny and his family go to Birmingham, Alabama. The are going there because they want to teach Byron a lesson. When they get there, they complain about the heat.Later Kenny met Mr. Roberts. Mr. Roberts told them about how his dog almost got drowned by a raccoon. The raccoon tried to drown Toddie, [the dog.] by holding his head underwater. Then they all decide to go fishing. Grandma Sands warned them not to go to Collier's landing. When they got there they saw a sign that warned them not to go to Collier's landing. Kenny said, \\" lets go\\". \\"Didn't you hear Grandma Sands? There's a wool-pooh here.\\" said By. \\"A what?\\" said Kenny. \\"He's Winnie the pooh's brother.\\" said By. so Kenny goes into the water and gets caught in a whirlpool.So Byron saves him. Later Joeys church got bombed. everybody was screaming like crazy. everybody thought Joey got hurt, but she didn't. A boy that looked like Kenny led her away from the church. She didn't know her church got bombed. So they all went home. Kenny stayed behid the couch because he thought that there are magical powers back there. Kenny and Byron call it the Watsons Famos Pet Hospitol. I think everybody should read this book. It is cute and educational."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"Byron said people froze in the streets. Byron was playing with matches. Wilona, his mother, said she would burn Byron for playing with matches. Byron bought cookies and didn't ask. Byron got sick from the apples.Byron got chemicals from his friend Bumphead.

Wilona sweats when she is mad or scared.Byron said that the Wool Pooh, Whinnie the Pooh's evil brother, is real and Kenny believes him. The church got bombed and four little girls died. Kenny thought that Joey died in the church. Kenny went to the church after the bombing and thought he found Joey and took what he thought was her shoe, but she was really still alive.I thought this book was OK.

It is about a family of three kids and the two parents. This book is tooken place druing the winter. This book is full of so many funny adventures. T also has some sad things inclueded aswell. In the story the older boy was behaving badly and wouldn't listen to his parents, so his parents decided to send him away to his grandmothers house, because she was tuff and she was going to make him listen.

I know for sure that I liked this book maybe you will too.There are five members in this family and I find all of them funny. Joetta or Joey is the little angel in the family. Kenny who's the second oldest in the family is really smart, but he always finds himself in a bad situation. Then there's Byron who's the oldest and the troublemaker who is always doing something he's not supposed to. Of course there's the parents who are just as funny as the kids. The book starts out with it being wintertime and all the kids going to school, but then it's about the Watson's trip to Birmingham, Georgia to visit their grandmother. Then at the end of the book one Sunday morning something horrible happens to a church and the people in it and one of them could be Joetta.What I think the theme of this story is treasure your family, because you may not know if something bad may happen to them. I think this theme or moral can relate to us all, because we all get mad at our family sometime or another but just swallow your pride and forgive them or say sorry, because you never know if something bad could happen to them.This heart-warming book is historical fiction written by Christopher Paul Curtis. I recommend this book for anyone of any gender above the age of seven and up that like books that are comical and deeply moving.I know that when I first saw this book I thought it was going to be another boring history book, but trust me this book is far from boring! I'm positive that tons of people like this book too after they read it."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"The Watsons Go To Birmingham was a story about real life things. In the beginning, Byron and Kenny are outside scraping ice off of the Brown Bomber a.k.a. the Watsons car. Then Kenny hears a noise coming from the other side of the car where Byron is. He doesn't go over there because he thinks Byron will trick him, because a few days before Byron and Buphead (Byron's best friend) played a trick on Kenny and hit him in the face with snowballs. When Kenny goes to the other side finally he sees Byron's lips stuck to the mirror. He then ran in to get the family. Daniel (their dad) started laughing because he had never seen anything like that. Daniel and Wilona (their mom) were trying to think of a way to get Byron's lips off of the mirror. Daniel decided to get water so he could pore it on Byron's lips but it just made it. Wilona tells the family to go inside then. When they were all inside Wilona pulled on Byron's lips until they came off. When Kenny was in school he got picked on by Larry Dunn because he had a lazy eye and he was a good reader. One day a new kid named Rufus came to school at Clark. Rufus started getting picked on more than Kenny because Rufus talked different (he had lived in Arkansas) and Rufus didn't have a lot of clothes. Kenny and Rufus became good friends but one day somebody said something about Rufus and Kenny laughed. Since Kenny laughed at him Rufus stopped hanging out with Kenny. They ended up fixing the problem and became friends again. When winter came, Kenny shared his gloves with Rufus for awhile but then decided to act like he had lost them so his mom gave him his other pair of leather gloves and Rufus got the old pair. Then one day, Kenny's gloves went missing and Larry Dunn had gotten a pair of leather gloves instead of cheap plastic ones. Kenny found out that Larry had stolen his gloves so Byron and Buphead beat Larry up. Kenny then got his gloves back. When Byron kept lighting matches in the house Wilona got mad at him and said if he would do it one more time she would do something to him. Then one day, Kenny saw that Byron went into the bathroom and locked the door so he went and looked through the key hole. He saw Byron in there making Kleenex's into parachutes and then lighting matches and burning the parachutes to where they would fall into the toilet. When Wilona came upstairs she smelled smoke and saw Kenny looking through the keyhole so she got Byron out of there and took him downstairs. Then Joey started crying because Mama had gotten out matches and Vaseline. She knew that Mama was going to burn some part of Byron. Joey then got scared and kept getting in front of Byron so Mama couldn't burn him. When she got Joey away she lit a match but Joey ran over and blew out every match that Mama lit. So Byron never got burned. Since their dad only paid for groceries at one time Byron and Kenny thought they were on welfare but then found out they weren't. A few days later Kenny found Byron in a tree behind the grocery store with a full bag and an empty bag of Swedish cream cookies. When Kenny realized what Byron had done it was too late because he couldn't tell on him since he had eaten some of the cookies. A few days later, Byron came home with his hair straightened and permanent red gunk in his hair. Wilona was in shock because she and Daniel had told Byron not to put that stuff in his hair. Wilona knew he had gotten the stuff from Buphead because he was the only other kid with hair like that. Daniel then shaved all Byron's hair off! A few weeks later the Watsons started packing for Birmingham. They were going to Alabama to see Wilona's family. They decided that Byron would stay with Grandma Sands for the whole summer and maybe the school year. The family drove straight through all the way to Alabama. While they were down south the kids went swimming and Kenny almost got pulled under but Byron saved him. Joey went to Sunday school with some friends she had made. Then there was a loud boom. A bomb had gone off at the church. Joey ended up being safe because she had followed Kenny home. Wilona and Daniel decided not to leave Byron in Alabama. When they went home Kenny decided to give his dinosaurs to Rufus and Cody (Rufus's little brother). The Watsons lived there lives like they had before they went to Birmingham. The bombs going off at church made them rethink about there lives and feel good that they had everyone still in their family.

Do you know what happened at the bombing of the 16th Avenue Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama? Well you'll have to read this wonderful book by Christopher Paul Curtis. The Watsons Go To Birmingham-1963, is a historical fiction novel about a black family who lives in the frigid town of Flint, Michigan, that goes to Birmingham, Alabama during the civil rights movement to visit their grandmother. While living in Flint, the older brother in the family, Byron, is continuously getting into trouble. The family decides that he needs to stay the summer with his Grandma in Birmingham. While the family is in Birmingham, they experience the bombing of a predominantly black church. The younger boy, Kenny, believes that his younger sister, Joetta, is still in the church when the bomb goes off, and the family freaks out. When they find that Joetta wasn't in the church, and that she is OK, they decide that the town is not safe enough and they go back home. This book is a very well written and very highly reviewed book that should be read by any and all literate people.One thing that pleased me about this book, was the very interesting use of humor. The author uses the character Byron, to bring humor and wits to this book. For example, Byron decides to look at himself in a car mirror one morning when it is below freezing outside. While staring at himself and gloating in the mirrior, he puckers up and pretends to kiss his reflection, and his lips instantly become frozen to the surface. The author uses Byron many more times in situations similar to these, and they bring much life into the book.Another critical element that pleased me about this story is the unique ethnic vocabulary the author uses in the book. The characters use slang words that create a more humorous feel to the book. For instance, in one part of the book the mother snaps at Byron and tells him to \\" Get yo butt outta here bustuh\\". Its sentences like these that bring life to this novel.The last thing in this book that really stuck out to me, was the use of different types of characters. You had the main character, the gullible little ten year old who didn't fit in, the annoying sister, and the trouble making older brother. The author works these characters into the book in many different ways, like how he uses Byron for humor, he uses Kenny to express the main views of the book. This is the last big reason that I enjoyed reading this book.In conclusion, The Watsons Go To Birmingham-1963, by Christopher Paul Curtis is a very interesting, witty, humorous and yet somehow very informative novel. This is a great book that should be real be everyone who can read, and if you cant, learn to because you're missing out on one of the great books of our time.Jackson Powell"},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"The Newberry Award winner, The Watsons go to Birmingham-1963 ,is an excellent book.

Especially because their mother is from Birmingham and she overdresses her kids in winter. Also their dad put a record player in their car. They think Kenny is weird because he is so smart and they call him \\"Poindexter\\". Byron is a bully and calls himself cool. Their little sister Joetta is a follower. They could be weird, but every family is different.Azjenae:The \\"Weird Watsons\\" are a family who have their fun and their share of problems. Byron, who is the oldest and a troublemaker, causes his parents to take the trip to Birmingham, Alabama. As a result, many changes happen to the Watsons.Takuma:In the end, the watson family is serious and loving to each other. It might be your family - or mine.Rynisha:This book tells about an event that happened in American history. A church got bombed and killed little children. I think the author wants us to think about the things that every single person had to deal with in Birmingham in 1963. The book is emotional, funny and sad.Raekwon:This is a book that entertains and tries to explain about a family going to Birmingham, Alabama in 1963. You learn that people didn't always get along. You see how a family related to each other. I felt the book was inspiring. I recommend people to read it."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"One of the best well written books using all the stop,turns,and suspence.The main people are dad,mom,Joey,Kenny,and the big brother Byron.I like this book for two reason the suspencean information.Suspence grabe's your intrestand your imagination making your want more.Information the authoris writting of something that has really happen in the world.

With the style and energy of Bud Not Buddy, this is a definite read. Christopher Paul Curtis brings his characters to life with his outstanding writing. I found myself falling into another world as I began to read each and every night.Kenny, Byron, and Joetta are just a few kids living in Flint, Michigan with their wacky and drastic parents. Together they travel through laughs, hardship, and love. \\"I ain't eatin' no welfare cheese,\\" is just one thing these youngsters must overcome. However, when they take a trip to Birmingham to visit relatives, they take a vacation they'll never forget.With all the right morals like live and love, \\"the Weird Watson's\\" are some of the most likable characters ever. I give this book ten out of ten, and five stars. It was a likeable plot from the beginning to the end. So if you're a realistic fiction lover, ten and older, and screech with laughter, this is the book for you. Curtis's story will make you laugh and cry from the chilly beginning to the reliving end. I recommend The Watson's Go to Birmingham with my highest regards."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"In this book, I liked how at the end Bryron came together with his brother Kenny and talking to him and making him feel safe. Although they had alot of conflicts between each other, he finially realized that the love he had for his brother. When I read that Joetta was in the building that was was bombed, my heart went out to her because she was so sweet. The thing that amazes me is when a look alike of Kenny led Joey away from the dasaster. Who was that gifted person, who was chossen to save an innocent life? Over all the book was really GREAT!"},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"It is SO cold in Flint and all the weird Watsons are huddleded up on the couch in the living room trying to stay warm.

Once they reach Birmingham, a tragedy happens that became a major place in time and history."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"The Watsons Go To Birmingham-1963 is a beautifully written book that tells of a family's interaction, dedication, and love. Told from the viewpoint of ten-year-old Kenny, the reader is introduced to the Watson family- Momma, Dad, Joetta (Kenny's little sister), and Byron (Kenny's older brother), who is described as an \\"official juvenile delinquent\\". As the result of several humorous incidents, their family is affectionately known as the \\"Weird Watsons\\" in their hometown of Flint, Michigan.Set in 1963, the story shares the experiences of this African American family as they travel into the deep South where racism is a cruel reality that the children have never seen before. In hopes of changing Byron's ways, the family takes him to Alabama to visit his maternal grandmother. In Birmingham, they are soon drawn in the Civil Rights movement and suffer a great tragedy that forever changes all of their lives.The Watsons Go To Birmingham-1963 is an excellent young adult novel that not only presents the ugly reality of racial discrimination but shows in a humorous way the many facets of an African American family. Because the characters are so realistic and warm, the reader experiences the Watsons' joy and pain on a personal level. Middle school aged students would not only enjoy the humor in this book, but would get a true picture of the horror of racism in our country's past. I would definitely recommend this book!"},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"At the time of the Watson's family trip, the southern states were caught up in a struggle for basic human rights that became known as the civil rights movement. Although the Declaration of Independence states that all men are created equal and the Constitition had been amended after the Civil War to extend the rights and protections of citizenship to African Americans, changing the law of the land did not always change the way people behaved. This book here is a great way to introduce to students in grades 4-6 about how the movement began. It also illustrates how African American families lived in the north and south during this period of time. We feel that this is the most important theme from the book.The writer I must say does an excellent job in showing how African American families lived during that time through the eyes of young boy. Many things that the author wrote about were things that we actually thought about or experienced as children. I can not get over Byron getting his tongue stuck to the side mirror of the car. Kenny reminded me of myself when I was younger. I was the guy who was always picked on and never the bully. Amber sees herself somewhat through Joetta because she was always defending for her sister when they were growing up.This book again was a good book to read but I recommend again that it be read by 4th, 5th and 6th graders."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"Have you ever read a book that's actually interesting even though it's dated back in history? The Watsons go to Birmingham 1963 is a good example. It's a great book by Christopher Paul Curtis. It's the kind of book that you can relate to. You can really feel the pain and humor the Watsons go through. Christopher Paul Curtis can really make you understand the hurt and constant worries of being black in 1963.Christopher Paul Curtis makes the characters so realistic. Strict is one way of putting Momma. She becomes so strict she warns the kids that she would burn Byron and Kenny if she ever catches them playing with fire. Dad the joker. He likes to make jokes so that Momma laughs and you can see the hole between her teeth. This part is really funny. Byron is the troublemaker. Being the oldest in the family he really tests Momma and Dad to see his boundaries and ends up getting into loads of trouble. Kenny is self-conscious. He has a lazy eye so he always feels bad about him self.The plot is about a black family living in flint Michigan during 1963. Ten-year-old Kenny is often picked on because of his lazy eye. Soon two new kids from the south show up talking with an accent and wearing ragged clothes. Now the bullies had new kids to pick on besides Kenny. Soon Kenny became a friend with the new kids named Rufus and his younger brother Cody. Being a \\"official\\" teenage juvenile delinquent, skipping school and getting into loads of trouble is all in a day's work for Byron. Once Momma caught Byron paying with matches and if it weren't for Joetta his little over protective sister, Byron would have had burned fingers. Then like it wasn't enough Byron comes home with a new hairdo. He knows how Momma and dad feel about putting \\"those chemicals\\" into his hair, but he did it anyway. Momma and Dad just can't control Byron any more. You can see what I mean by the Watsons acting like a real family. They have real problems just like a real family and have fun just like a real family.This story takes place back in 1963 when it was a dangerous place to be black. This time period was called the Civil Rights Movement. In the northern, eastern and Western states, African Americans often faced discrimination. Communities and states passed laws that allowed discrimination in schooling, housing, and job opportunities; prohibited interracial marriages and enforced segregation by creating separate facilities for African Americans and whites. I think that the color of you skin in not important in a person. It's what is in the inside that counts.If I had to rate this book on great, good, ok and poor I would definitely rate it great. I would rate it great because I think it has humor, sadness, and things you can relate to. It's a great way to find out how a black family had to live during the Civil Rights Moment. So if you want to read a great book full of enjoyment read The Watsons Go to Birmingham 1963."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"Andrew Yount Evan Hosseini ELA- MS 4/6/2000Mequon Post Book Review of The Watsons Go To Birmingham 1963Have you ever wanted to read a good book that took place during the Civil Rights Movement? Well this book is all that and more. Now let me tell you a little bit about it. The Watsons Go To Birmingham 1963, by Christopher Paul Curtis, is a comical, and sad story of a family that lives in Flint, Michigan who go to Birmingham, Alabama to visit their grandma, and to drop off their troublesome teenager there for the summer, so their grandma can teach him a lesson. The story doesn't start in Birmingham though, it starts in Flint and, takes the Watsons almost the whole book till they finally go to Birmingham, Alabama.This book takes place back during the civil rights movement, and the the Watsons are a \\"colored\\" family, so you must imagine that the Watsons had to go through many hardships in Birmingham. Kenny the narrator goes through a big personality change, and so does his brother Byron, [the troublesome teenager]. Byron starts out in the book as a bully who only cares about himself. At one time, Byron was \\"the lead dog\\" in the family according to him. Towards the end of the book Byron is a caring brother who cares about his family.Kenny, the narrator, is a nice, and normal kid when the book starts out, but after an incident that took in Birmingham he doesn't think he can really trust other people, but his family. He hides behind the couch for a long time, so \\"the magic powers\\" can help him find out more about himself. The magic powers are something Kenny believes in, and they live behind the couch. Kenny thinks the magic powers help his hurt pets, because whenever his pets get hurt, they go behind the couch. When the animals come out they end up feeling better.There are many themes in this book. some of them are, that racial discrimination can be painful to a family, and can destroy the lives of people. Kenny learns that a friend isn't just someone you play with, it is some one you trust and value as a person. This book also deals with how people deal with loss.I give this book four stars out of five, which means this book is good, but not excellent. If I could change something in this book I would put more action in it to make it more exciting. Towards the end the book jumps from event to event without explaining things inbetween events. If I were the author, that is another thing I would change."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham-1963 is a great book for all ages. It teaches children about what happened during those times without going completely in depth.

The story combines comical scenes that readers can relate to with a very important part of America's history. The Watsons are a humorous, close, loving family who go through the typical day to day antics that children and adults will find very familiar. When the Watsons head south, young readers will be introduced to the events that were taking place in Alabama in 1963.

At first, when I saw the title, I didn't want to read this book because I thought it would be too heavy and sad. Instead, it was one of the funniest books I have ever read. I look forward to using it to integrate poetry and history into lessons. I think this book should be read as a team effort for adults and children together, because there are several parts in which children may need some support to truly understand all the implications of what is written. This book is wonderful on so many levels...not to be missed!"},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"This book is full of hilarious scenes and interesting characters. However, it seems to be just a collection of stories. The bombing at the end seems sensational and does not tie the rest of the book together. Another problem I had was that the ten year old's personality changed drastically when the got to Alabama. Back in Flint, he was the perfect kid with the delinquent brother. When he gets to Alabama, he becomes disobedient. This was plot maniuplation to set up the Wool Pooh incident. I hope the author comes out with another book soon as he is an excellent writer. I'm not sure he's a children's writer, though."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"In the beginning Byron was mean to Kenny but towards the end of the book he got nicer. Kenny was a smart nice boy through the whole book. Dad was funny and nice, momma was nice but strict at some times and little sister Joetta was the sweetest of them all.The idea of the book is to get people to see how hard it was to be a black and live in Alabama in 1963. And to see how that family lived back then."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"This book was cool to read. This book could be read by all ages.

Another part we like was when the two new boys got on the school bus. We also like when Byron's tongue got stuck on the window and when Byron's dad cuts off his hair. The bad things about the book is the last chapter, it was not good for a ending of a story. The part about the wirl pool (wool pool) was confusing."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"This book was about a black family facing prejudice. I liked this book because it was funny and serious. The main idea was that Kenny, the Watson's teenage son, did a lot of things that were bad but he turned out to be a good kid.

But as a teacher I want everything I give my students to have an inpact upon them and this book won't do it."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"I don't like this book at all. The plot is extremely weak. There is kids torturing each other -- some all right, some not all right (not all right is like banging a kid into a metal fence - and in below 0 degrees weather in the snow and all) -- and fowl language, the older brother Byron disobeys his mother awfully, and there's a couple of other inappropriate things in there. Some of the people in here seem rather barbaric -- I just did not like it. If I were you, I would not let your kids read this. It's not good for you. I'm surprised so many people rated it 5 stars. I think it's ridiculous that they totally ignored all the bad parts of the book -- there are too many at least a few bad things for each chapter. I suppose it makes sense that lots of people might have a family life like this, but I am so glad I don't.Also most of it wasn't too interesting. And the part about the Wool Pooh and the bombing are very very vague it's hard to get what's going on there.I do NOT recommend this book, especially to anyone under 12 years old or to anyone who doesn't have very good values already.If you want to read a really good book published in 1963 read Henry Reed's Journey, which is hilarious and fun and so well-written! (It's about a boy who goes on a road-trip with his friend and her parents starting out in San Francisco and ending up in New Jersey.)"},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"For a report I read this book. Yes it was a first book by the author but I feel the author failed to get the general picture he was saying in this book out except for one brief moment. Most of the book is a story of the adventures of a normal kid. What little is left a showing of feeling of the whites against the blacks in the the early 1960's. Not at all what I would expect in a book, seeing I have been reading books that do get the general picture out all year long in my history class!"},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"Never read it.

On top of that, it's just plain rewarding to read about African-Americans as depicted by a talented African-American writer. I so enjoyed reading this book that I forgot where the plot was heading, so that when the \\"fact\\" part of the plot occurred, I was shocked . . . even though I knew the plot had been heading toward the 1963 Birmingham church bombings all along. A very worthwhile and enjoyable read. The author is good at writing humor as well as good at writing about things that matter."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"This book was very good! The author wrote about Mystery, Civil Rights, and Sadness. He did a very good job. He is awesome. I recomend this book to everyone of all ages."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"After listening to the audio version of Bud, Not Buddy with my kids, which was excellent btw, we decided to give this one, another by Christopher Paul Curtis, a try. It's a wonderful story about the Watsons (aka the \\"weird Watsons), an African American family who live in Flint, Michigan, where all but the mother (a transplant from Birmingham) were born (as was the author). The family consists of Mr. (Daniel) and Mrs. (Wilona) Watson and their three children, 13-year-old Byron, 10-year-old Kenny and a younger daughter, Joetta.Kenny narrates their story, set against the backdrop of the civil rights movement, which is mostly about family and school life and is filled with anecdotes of events that run the gamut from lighthearted to very serious. Using expressions, like, \\"for a hot second,\\" \\"smack-jab\\" and \\"awww, man,\\" the story really feels as if Kenny is right there at age ten recounting the highlights and lowlights of his life. Included are such things as: his brother's antics as a \\"juvenile delinquent,\\" a term used somewhat affectionately to describe Byron's behavior (although often defiant, doing things like playing with matches, getting a butter, and getting back at a schoolmate for stealing, readers will see that he also has a sensitive side); his sweet, kind, loving sister's support of her brothers; and Kenny's experiences at school and at home, which teach him valuable lessons about friendship, family, and life. The Watson parents are wonderful, though very strict compared to many parents of today (some of their methods might come as an unwelcome surprise to more pampered young readers). Near the end of the story, the family travels via the Brown Bomber to the kids' maternal grandmother's house in Alabama, where the family experiences an event that will change their lives forever.The audiobook, performed brilliantly by Levar Burton, is definitely the best way to experience this story, which I listened to and then read. Note: due to mature themes and language, this book is best for age 11 and up. Also good: Bud, Not Buddy by Christopher Paul Curtis, Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass by Russell Freedman and The Giver by Lois Lowry."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"I purchased this item as an alternative to buying it in a bulk order because it was actually a better deal. The book arrived in no time and in good condition. I was very pleased!"},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"I read this book when I was 12 years old. It was so great I read it again when I was 16. Little Kenny is a great character. Christopher Paul Curtis did an amazing job here. Ten-year-old Kenny tells the story of his life in 1963, during the Civil Rights Era. They live in Flint, MI and travel to Birmingham, AL for a family trip. Kenny made me laugh (Byron got his lips stuck to the car mirror from kissing his reflection) and cry (children dying in the church). I think this would be a great book to incorporate into any lesson plan while teaching kids about the Civil Rights Movement. It gives great insight into what went on back then and what blacks had to go through. I'm 22 now and I would definitely read it again. I'll give this book to my children to read as well. I definitely recommend this book to everyone, young and old."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"A wonderfully entertaining children's story that covers very difficult topics (including poverty, racism, and self-blame) in a heartfelt, personable, and often humorous way. The last few chapters take a darker turn than earlier parts of the story, but all ends happily for the Wacky Watsons."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"This is the only other novel I have read by Curtis and I enjoyed it even more than Bud, Not Buddy. I did not have to read this one in school so I had to track it down myself. I remember listening to the audio version at age eleven or twelve and loving the Watsons and all of their random adventures. The first incident, the one where the elder brother gets his lips stuck to a car mirror in winter because he was kissing his reflection, is one of my favorite moments in fiction so far. The brothers throwing cookies at birds, or eating them until they are sick is easily remembered as well. Even the scenes about school back in the early 60s and the cruelty of kids to those less fortunate was brilliantly done. The last third of the book becomes much more serious with the church bombing, however, and only now that I'm a little older can I appreciate the genius in that. When I was young I didn't really understand the significance of that section of the book and the only thing I remember really enjoying was the \\"whirlpool\\" scene which gave me chills. Later, the way the author made everything in this book work and still made it something that anyone can enjoy floors me. Brilliant novel. Absolutely brilliant and I recommend it to all those who didn't already have to read it."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"Byron Watson is \\"an official juvenile delinquent.\\" He skips school, plays with fire and drives his little brother crazy. Kenny isn't sure anything will make his brother stop acting out. Especially not his parents' plan to send Byron to Birmingham to live under the iron fist of Grandma Sands--and the oppressive hand of racial segregation. But Kenny doesn't count on the events in Birmingham in the summer of 1963 and how a terrible tragedy can make a man out of his \\"delinquent\\" brother.Byron's coming-of-age story is beautifully told through the funny narrative voice of his little brother. The Birmingham church bombing helps Kenny see that real family love shines through even the darkest night. The Watsons Go to Birmingham--1963 was a Newberry Honor Book in 1996."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"Ten-year-old Kenny has a weird family: a mom from the south, a silly father, a sweet little sister, and a juvenile delinquent older brother, Byron. When Byron seems out of control, the Watsons pack up their car for a trip down south to their grandmother's house. But they are also on a crash-course with history and the tragic events of the Civil Rights movement. Greater historical themes take a back seat to the personal story of a close family, which is a bit refreshing, especially when the ending hits the readers, shocking them in its impact, just as it did in reality, fifty years ago. Characters are real and fully developed, absolutely loveable and hilarious. Might be a difficult read for younger students due to some of the obscurity/allegorical nature of the writing, as well as dated slang, but definitely a worthwhile and engaging young adult novel. Grade: A-"},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"I have had a difficult time finding very many of the episodes funny unless you had grown up in the 1960s. If you were born in the 80s-90s I think most of the humor would be lost, because it needs the cultural/historical background to be understood. I found the book zenophobic (negative remarks about Chinese and people from the south) and it also seemed to glorify bullying. I think there are far better books out there that deal with the issue of racism than ones that include such negative subtexts.I have read a lot of juvenile fiction and this is one of the slowest paced books I have ever read. I think the only things that young readers might be interested in would be the bullying scenes. It takes a long time for the novel to move into the interesting plot line and there are several unexplained gaps in the end that leave the reader confused. I had to read this book as part of my job, but I really wanted it to end. Sorry, just being honest."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"The Watsons Go To Birmigham was written by Christopher Paul Curtis, I gave this book four stars because I didn't like all the cussing in it from Brian.This book tells about a little african american boy named Kenny. It tells about his thirteen year old brother Brian. Kenny has a little sister named Joetta, she is very protective of Brian. There are some very funny parts in this book. Like in the beginning of this book when it is winter time. Brian and Kenny are cleaning ice off the family car when Brian kisses his reflection in the mirror. His lips get stuck. The whole family tries to get him unstuck. They pour hot water on his lips, but this only makes him more stuck. Kenny begins to wonder is they will never get him off. He wonders if the would have to drive around with a skellton on their mirror. Finally, their mother grabs his head and pulls really hard. Brian gets unstuck, but for a while he was outside crying because his mom, when she pulled him free, had torn off some of his lips! It was also funny when Brian started to play with fire. His mother finds out. Then she swore she would burn him next time he plays with fire. He stoped for a while, then he started to play with it again. But his mom coun never burn him because Joetta would always put the fire out before the mom could burn him. All these antics from Brian force his parents to send him to their grandmothers for the summer.I also gave this book four stars because when I got to the end of the book, they were in Birmingham to drop off Brian when a bomb ent off at the church where Joetta was having sunday school. She survived the accident but Kenny saw some scary things. Every one was crying, but Kenny tuned out everyone and walked right up to the church. This really happened in 1963, so it would be a shocker for little kids. After this incident he starts hiding behind the sofa and listening to his parents talk about what happened. He thinks that being back there would heal him and make him feel better. His brother makes him come out and tells him there is no such thing as magic. But Kenny thinks in hi mind at the end, ther is magic. Like the magic you feel when you are with your family.I would recommend the book to any one. I would also recommend any book written by Christopher Paul Curtis. I love to read and think that each book teaches you something. I think this book teaches us about how important family is."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"Why this book is a Newberry Honor Book escapes me.

I cannot wait to read it again with my kids. Aside from the great lessons in this book, the story is fun and you miss the characters when you are finished.

Everyone who reads this will be better off for having done so."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"The book Watsons go to Birmingham-1963 is about the Watsons' family. HOw they depended and trusted eachother to live and go through all the hardships in their life. Kenny which is the main character in the book is cross eyed and has problems in his school with his friends. Since Kenny is very smart and doesnt fit with others everybody picked on him. His brother By was the only reason why his school days were a little better. By was the strongest and the meanest bully in the school. Everybody obeyed him. Outside he was acting mean and like he didnt care but at the end the readers will realize the real side of him. The story gets more interesting when they move to Birminham for two months. I think this book is a great book for grades 5 through 7."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"Christopher Paul Curtis's book \\"The Watsons Go to Birmingham -- 1963\\" is certainly one of the most engaging, provocative, and moving books for young readers of the past decade, and the emergence of Mr. Curtis as an award-winning writer for young readers is cause for celebration in America. The audio version, read by noted reading advocate and actor LeVar Burton, is astonishing. Like most successful books for young readers, the story works brilliantly when read out loud, and Burton makes the most of the cadences of the storytelling and the richness of characterizations in this story. This is a world-class reading by Mr. Burton, certainly one of the best I've ever heard, and the musical motifs are just right: brief, evocative, and tastefully adding color to the story. The protagonist and first-person narrator of this story, Kenny Watson, is a vital addition to the pantheon of great American characters, and his tale is a deeply inspiring one. This story is full of laugh-out-loud moments and intense drama. It raises and illustrates issues about family, class, violence and bullying, parenting, racial struggles, love, and healing in unique, powerful ways, and it has spoken quite profoundly to our children, who LOVE this book."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"The Watson's go to Birmingham-1963 is a book about a black family in 1963.

She leaves shortly since she got too hot! After she left two white men drive by and throw a bomb at the church and it blows up!

They drive South to Alabama because Bryron was getting into much trouble. I think it has got good humor and tells about history too. Also I like when Byron's dad is going to cut off Byron's hair.

In 1963, many people wanted the racism to end, but the change was difficult.This book is mostly about a 10-year-old African-American boy named Kenny and his family, the Watsons. Kenny has a little sister named Joetta and an older brother named Byron. Byron is the school bully and is ALWAYS getting in trouble. The first half of the book focuses on the family--especially Byron and the problems caused by his bad behavior and misadventures.The second half of the book is about the Watsons going down South to Alabama and how their lives change during this visit.In my opinion, this is an AWESOME book! I laughed out-loud as I read it because of the funny things the kids say and do. They act like real kids. I would recommend this book because it is both entertaining and educational."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"This story takes place in Birmingham the year of 1963.This story is about a family that is known as the weird Watsons.The characters that are in the story are a boy named kenny one of the main characters his sister Joetta,his brother Byron known as the neighborhood juvenile delinquent,his mother Wilona,and his father Daniel Watson.The Watson family is a common family they are similair to real life families.The events that happen to the Watson family happen to anybody's family on a regular day.It's mainly about African-American family that's trying to make it through life.

Kenny's dad daniel watson is very sarcastic and tries to be funny and he also the one who moved them all up to Flint Michigan.

It is hilarious but also has some good historic information. The main character is Kenny. Kenny has a younger sister and an older brother named Byron who is a juvenile delinquent. Kenny's mom starts to get tired of the things Byron does, and decides to send him to their grandmother's house in Birmingham, Alabama. Finally they leave Michigan to go to their grandmother's house. While they are there, someone bombs a church that Kenny's sister is in. Luckily, nothing happens to her. This book is also funny. Kenny gets caught in a \\"whool pool\\"; whom Byron says is Pooh's evil brother. It is especially funny when Byron gets his tongue stuck on the car mirror, and his dad makes fun of him saying that he is attracted to himself. Another part that I liked was when Kenny stayed behind the couch, a.k.a. the pet hospital, hoping it would make him feel better. He didn't come out for days. I think this book was well written. It also deserves the Newberry Honor medal that it received. If you want to find out more about this book, then you should read it. My recommendation is that everyone should read it, but that's your decision."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"I gave this book three stars because it is a little confusing.This book is about a ten-year old Kenny and his family,the Watsons.Their momma,dad,little sister Joeta,Kenny and Byron.Byron is a thirteen-year old and an official juvenile delinquent.Momma and Dad decided to go visit Grandma and then they have a lot of problems."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"The Watsons go to Birmingham-1963 is a hilarious story about 10-year-old Kenny Watson and his family. They have many funny stories like when 13-year-old Byron Watson gets his lips stuck to the frozen car window, the Nazi parachutes attack America and get shot down by captain Byron Watson and his Flamethrower of death, and when LJ and Kenny had the greatest dinosaur war ever. But then Byron did something to get him in big trouble,and he was getting sent to live with Grandma Sands in Birmingham. The whole Watson family was going to visit their grandma for a week and Byron was staying there. The Watsons did not realize that they were driving straight into an area where African Americans were disliked by whites. I liked this book because it tells a great story and has important imformation about our past. Also, it is very funny. I disliked this book because it is sad, but otherwise it was great."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"The novel \\"The Watson's Go to Birmingham 1963\\" is wonderful. The time setting of the book is in the early 1960's, during the Civil Rights Movement. The two places where most of the events take place are in Flint, Michigan and Birmingham, Alabama. There are five main characters and they are: Kenny, Byron, and Joeta Watson, and Kenny's mom and dad. Kenny is a good kind and smart kid. His brother, Byron, on the other hand, is a punk who is always in trouble and has failed several grades. Joeta, Kenny's little sister, is six years old and very gullible. Kenny's mom is strict but kind. Kenny's dad is a typical dad. He means business, but still goofs off from time to time. They are all in the same family.One chapter that I really liked was titled \\"Nazi Parachutes Invade the Flint River but get Shot Down by Cpt. Byron Watson and his Flame Thrower of Death\\". One morning Byron goes into the bathroom with army men and matches. Kenny watches what Byron does through a key hole and sees that Byron is dropping army men with toilet paper parachutes that are lit on fire. Byron had already done similar things. When their mom finds out, she grabs Byron and goes to burn his fingers. Joeta blows out the matches every time until their mother stops.In my opinion, \\"The Watson's go to Birmingham 1963\\" is a very good and funny novel that I strongly advise reading."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"[[ASIN:044022800X The Watsons Go to Birmingham - 1963] This is a good book to read. It starts out funny and ends with a family dealing with tragedy. The book takes place in 1963 and is about an African American family named the Watson's. Kenny is a 10 year old who is telling his story about his family and their experience dealing with racism. The first part of the book is about Kenny's older brother Byron who stays in trouble all of the time and his little sister Joetta who was a very smart. One of the funniest parts of the book is when Byron gets his lips stuck to the frozen mirrors on the Brown Bomber (their car). The second part of the book is about the family going to Birmingham to visit their Grandma Sands and how their lives changed during this visit. While at Grandma Sands house, the church that Joetta attended was bombed. Due to the bombing Kenny was overcome with fear and it made Byron turn towards becoming a mature young man. Byron helped Kenny deal with his fears and pull through this horrific tragedy. The book teaches you that family is very important and as a family you can get through anything good or bad."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"The Watson Go to Birmingham-1963 by Christopher Paul CurtisPublisher: Scholastic Inc.Copyright 1995Fry Reading Level: 7th gradePages: 210Genre: Juvenile FictionThe author builds up anticipation of the much-expected trip of the Watson family to Birmingham, Alabama. The first half of the book allows the reader to become familiar with the family. Curtis uses humor to engage the reader and provide a highly positive tone about the African American family that lives in Flint, Michigan. The dynamics of the family appear to be usual. There are the parents, one from Flint and the other from Birmingham. The two brothers Kenny (the narrator) and Byron have an interesting love-hate relationship. Kenny is cross-eyed but very bright and respected by teachers at their school. Byron is the \\"King\\" of the school, yet he is in danger of repeating grades. Although Byron is the coolest guy in the school this reputation does not affect the relationship of Kenny and the other children. Kenny remains the smart boy with the eye problem that teases his older brother when he has an opportunity to win that upward battle. Joetta is the smallest Watson. Her personality is determined and strong even as she challenges her mother about burning Byron's fingers because he has a pyromaniac period in the household. The relationships between each family member is revealed as the parents, determined to save their wayward son- Byron, plan a trip to Birmingham to show their children how the world really works for African Americans.The book is an easy-read for 6th, 7th, and 8th grades. The book is not recommended to teach structure or correct grammar. There are some words that are intentionally mis-spelled to help with the tone of the author and the mood of the book. When the family uses southern slang and encounters that when they arrive in Birmingham the grammar is really bad. Students should be aware of the figurative language that is used in the book, as well as the humorous purposes of certain phrases. Foul language and cursing is used in the book particularly with Byron and his mischievous friend Buphead. It is not encouraged to have younger readers use this book due to the certain level of maturity necessary to accept the language and its purpose- to entertain.This book is highly recommended. The author uses vocabulary and imagery to humor and entertain the reader. A shift does take place when the family arrives in Birmingham and the children notice the differences between Michigan and Alabama. The church in the black community is blown up; an active hate crime against the African American community. The author captures the dynamic of the African American family well and portrays positive and caring relationships between the parents and the children throughout the novel."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"The novel The watsons go to Birmingham-1963 by:Christopher Paul Curtis was a fantastic book!!!

You could realy tell why it won the Newberry Honor Award. I could relate some of the characters. Like Byron and Joetta. The best part of the story was when Byron got his toung stuch to the rearview mirror. I wanted to burst out laughing. From my point of view I know you would love this book.

In retrospect, if I had paid a bit more attention to the subject matter, I might not have chosen to participate this year. However, up until the last third of the book, the family deals with situations that are typical of many families--sibling relations, friction between older children and parents, being a nerd at school, learning how to be a friend. Mr. Curtis' writing and Mr. Burton's reading are magic together. My son and I listened to this book on a long car trip, and at one point, when Kenny, the narrator, \\"makes up\\" with a friend, I heard him fall back against the back seat with a grateful \\"whew!\\"My husband listened to the last part of the book with my son, so I can't speak to his immediate reaction. However, over the next few weeks, we had several conversations about race relations, which made me grateful that the book had opened the door to discussion. Some families at school did feel that some language was inappropriate for young children but frankly I'm not sure it is any worse than what they hear on TV or at school."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"The Watson family, African-Americans living in the 1960s, live a pretty normal life, as narrated by ten-year-old Kenny. They live in Michigan, although that gets too cold in the wintertime for Kenny's mom's taste. Kenny's dad is something of a clown, always doing things to make his wife and children laugh. Kenny himself is a smart kid who likes to read but doesn't have many friends. His older brother Byron picks on him and is something of a punk, but since he has a reputation for being tough, not many other kids pick on Kenny. Kenny also has a little sister, Joey, who is five.This story chronicles a year in the lives of the Watson family. Kenny generally keeps a cool head about things, even though he is constantly a witness to his brother getting into trouble and he is ofen a victim of his brother's punches. But Kenny's parents are getting tired of Byron's behavior, and they have decided to do something about it. That summer they get their old car all cleaned up and the five of them pile in for a trip to Alabama, where Kenny's grandmother lives. She is said to be quite a disciplinarian, and Kenny's parents have threatened to leave Byron there for the entire summer and, if necessary, the entire next year if he doesn't straighten up.While in Alabama, though, something awful happens that throws Kenny into a state of shock, which he can't quite shake off even when they are all safe at home back in Michigan. Will Kenny be able to recover from what he witnessed in Alabama?I liked the fact that Kenny narrated; he told the story of his family in a way that made them interesting to the reader. I also liked how Kenny's parents treated their children; they spent a lot of time joking around with the kids, but when they did something wrong the parents took it seriously.I didn't like that the big event that the story had been building toward happened right at the end of the story. I thought that the family would have had more contact with the events going on in Alabama, and the story would include more history of what was going on at this time in the South."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"When The Watsons returned home to Flint, Michigan, we saw that Byron and Kenny had changed.

The main character telling the story is Kenny. He is the middle child out of his little sister Joey and his older brother Byron. They live in Flint, Michigan. I think that Kenny is curious and smart but the kids at school make fun of him because of it, so he lacks a little bit of self confidence. The problem in the story is that Byron gets into a lot of trouble and their parents decide to send him to Birmingham, Alabama to live with their Grandma Sands who is very strict. While they are in Birmingham, they see in racism and violence all around them. The plot isn't that well described. It is not one of the strong points in the book. The characters make the plot more interesting, so if you are looking for a book with a good plot, you might not want to read this one.I really enjoyed reading this book because it taught me a lot about how it was for African-Americans in the South in the 1960's. It was really funny and it made me laugh out loud. I think the theme of this book is friendship, because after the trip to Birmingham, Kenny and Byron get along really well and they understand each other better. The Watsons Go to Birmingham-1963 is a good book for learning about racism in the early 1960's and how violence affects kids emotionally"},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"This chapter book is certainly a funny genre of African American literature.This Newbery Honor Book is about a black family called the Watsons (a.k.a \\"Weird Watsons.\\" Gets funny at the first chapter, such as Kenny's brother's lips are stuck on the car's mirror.It is Antarctica in Flint, Michigans, so when the Watsons gets an Ultra-Glide, they go south to a warmer U.S.A city, Birmingham, Alabama.Trip's cool.

Because he thinks its embarrassing but when they find out their father cant pay it off till the end of the week.

It tells about his older brother Bryan and his teenage adventures. Kenny has a little sister named Joetta; she is very protective of Bryan. During this book there is a lot of cussing from Byron. But there are some very funny parts. Like during the winter time when Kenny and Byron have to clean ice off the family car. Byron kisses his reflection in the mirror and gets his lips stuck. The family tries putting hot water on his mouth but that only gets him more stuck. Kenny wonders if they will ever get him off and if not, maybe they will drive the car around with a skeleton stuck to the mirror. His mom finally pulls him off. But while doing this she rips off his lips. It is also funny when Byron starts playing with matches. His mom finds out and swore she would burn him next time he plays with matches. He stops playing with matches, but then he starts playing with them again. But his mom could never burn him because Joetta would always put the fire out before mom could burn Byron! All of these antics force the family to send Byron to his grandmothers for the summer.I also gave it four stars because when I got to the end of the book, they were in Birmingham to drop off Byron when a bomb went off at the church where Joetta was having Sunday school. She survived the accident but Kenny saw some pretty bad things. Everyone was crying, but Kenny tuned out everyone. He walked right up to the church. This really happened in 1963, so it would be a real shocker for little kids. After this incident he starts hiding behind the sofa and listening to his parents talk about what happened. He thinks that being back there would heal him and make him feel better. His brother makes him come out and tells him there is no such thing as magic. But Kenny thinks in his mind at the end there is magic. Like the magic you feel when you are with your family.I would recommend anything written by Christopher Paul Curtis, he is a great writer. I am a person who loves action books. This book had a lot of action in it. That is why I liked it so much!"},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"This book is funny, expecially for kids, because of the humour of the ten year old kid, Kenny Watson. However, it has a deep meaning to it-that there is racism and injustice in the world. The story is about a black family, the Watson, traveling to Birmingham, but unfortunantly, goes at the time when the bombing of the 'colored' church happens, and how the narrater,(Kenny) feels about the event. It's good, since the author uses the narrater like you are actually him, and that the story moves slowly explaining every small, but yet funny details."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"This book is Awesome! I loved it. I got so into it on the first page. It is filled with exciting events. This book is thrilling and interesting. It teaches you the real reason of having a good family."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"In his book, The Watsons Go to Birmingham--1963, Christopher Paul Curtis creates a wonderful story of family that prompts a reader's desire to be part of the \\"weird Watsons,\\" traveling in the great Brown Bomber, listening to \\"Yakety Yak\\" on the Ultra-Glide, and even falling for thirteen-year-old Byron's tall tales and antics. Not only is Curtis a master at telling his story, he also carefully engages his readers in the experience of a tragic episode of racial tension from the perspective of ten-year-old Kenny Watson. When Kenny believes that his younger sister Joetta may have been among the victims in the bombing of the Sixteenth Avenue Baptist Church, he is overcome with fear and its shame. This distressful event triggers something in Byron which matures him into the brother who pulls Kenny through this difficult time. As Kenny is restored to the normal activities of his family, he begins to see them from a lovingly different perspective. This is a memorable story of family and friendship built between brothers, a touching contrast to the lasting impression of a senseless tragedy that should never have happened. Christopher Paul Curtis has produced in The Watsons Go to Birmingham--1963 a beautifully written story that will be loved by young teens and adults as well!"},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"The Watsons go to Birmingham-1963, by Christopher Paul Curtis, is a great book. It takes place during the Civil rights movement. It is about a Family that lives in Flint, Michigan. The family is made up of Daniel (dad),Wilona (mom), Byron,Kenny, and Joetta, also known as Joey. I think the characters in this story are really interesting. Kenny is smart. He reads stuff to higher grades than he is in. He is also one of the least popular kids in his school. And, he has a lazy eye. Kenny's big brother Byron is a trouble maker. He is known as the god of the school children at Clark elementary. Joetta, Kenny's little sister, likes to protect Byron from her mom. She also believes all the tall tales he makes up. The whole family seems so realistic. Christopher Paul Curtis does something cool with Byron in the book. Byron changes from a trouble-maker to a nice person. He changes because of a true historical event that happened in this story.In the beginning of the story is parents get so mad because of the bad stuff he did. They decide to drive to their grandma Sands house in Birmingham, Alabama. That is how they end up going to Birmingham.Christopher Paul Curtis has a cool bad guy for the story. When they are in Birmingham, Kenny goes some where he shouldn't go and meets the bad guy of the story,The Wool Pooh. He says that it has a gray body, no face, square feet, square shoulders, and square fingers. Kenny sees the Wool Pooh twice in the story. When he is swimming where he shouldn't and after the historical event. Kenny thinks that it means death.I think there are some bad things about the book. Christopher Paul Curtis skips the part when they are going back to Flint. There are some other things he doesn't tell about. For example,He doesn't tell when Kenny tells his Mom, Dad, and Byron that Joey is back at Grandma Sands house I give this story four stars. It is a great book to read. One of the morales of this story is how important family is. That is why Byron became changed from a trouble-maker to a nice person. So all in all I think you should definitely read this book. And if you want to find out what the historical event is, read the book."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"I just got done reading this book for a second time. The first time was in a Children's Lit class during my undergrad. This time around, I decided to use it as a tutoring tool for one of my students. I always find that Newbery books/honor books are the very best in YA literature and Curtis' first novel is no exception.Not only is the story side-splittingly funny, but it manages to segue into very serious subject matter without appearing divided or awkward. The \\"Weird Watsons\\" lives come to intersect with the 1963 Birmingham church bombing in Alabama where four young black girls were needlessly killed. This book proved to be a nice introduction to the civil rights movement of the 60's, which my student knew little about, but became very interested in thanks to this book. The church bombing in Alabama is a reminder to us all of what comes of ignorance.If you have never read Christopher Paul Curtis, you must make it a point to try. His second book, \\"Bud, Not Buddy\\" is also wonderful. Simply put, the man is a gifted storyteller. Kenny Watson's narrative will make you smile, but more importantly, it will make you think.This book, as with most Newbery books/Newbery Honor books, is not just for kids...I promise, they are adult-friendly, too."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"In some ways, this is an excellent book, for use in schools as well as for recreational reading. It shows a loving and stable black family and the freedoms and challenges they have living in a northern state in 1963. The narrator of the story is Kenny, a smart, put upon kid, with a younger sister and an older brother, who the book mostly revolves around. Byron is 13 and in trouble all the time, and apparently on the edge of moving beyond childish pranks to real trouble; a reference to an unnamed \\"problem\\" with a girl, joining a gang, thieving and assault. Byron seems to have respect for no one or anything, and it doesn't look like his ways are going to change. The family decides to take him to Birmingham to spend the summer, and maybe the next school year, with his maternal grandmother, who they hope will straighten him out.This is where it begins not to make sense. Kenny says that Byron, upon meeting his grandmother, is transformed and is polite and respectful. This is hard to believe. There is a long bit about the \\"Wool Pooh\\" which lost me, and then the Sunday morning the young sister goes to the church that is bombed, killing four little girls. More Wool Pooh stuff with Kenny, and then everyone, including Byron, is back home in Michigan, with Kenny trying to figure life out behind the couch.It is important that the book make sense, chronologically as well as emotionally, and this did not. How would Byron immediately change his behavior completely? How could the Watsons have been there for the bombing, which took place in September, if they had just arrived at the beginning of summer? If the whole family was there all summer, why didn't we see any progression of the \\"new\\" Byron, or what they found life like in Birmingham, or why they would still be there in September, with Kenny and Joetta needing to be back in school? Why would northern parents send their problem son to a deeply prejudiced South, where a black boy or man could be killed just for looking at someone the wrong way? Why didn't the author feel it important to have the timeline feel accurate?Other issues presented well, and good for discussion is as said, the difference in the freedoms of those living in the north and south, the reality that black travelers faced with having to plan carefully as to where they could stop for food or lodging in the south, and the impact the bombing had on the boys, being unaware of what those in the south had to live with daily. I wasn't sure if Byron's comments on the church bombers were profound or hypocritical, since he had been on the road to criminal behavior himself. Another good point was Kenny's being proud of his intelligence and academic ability. This is not something that seems to be valued often by some in the black community.I think it is a shame that some people seem to be getting hung up on the language as inappropriate, when for one thing, people talked as they talked, and the extremely minor bad language is practically innocent compared to what we hear today. It's not the most important thing about this book."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"Christopher Paul Curtis is the master-mind behind the book The Watsons Go To Burmingham 1963. His writing styles in this book are most interesting,not the least bit boring! Each chapter leaves you wondering about the next. He adds in amazing details you think you would have never thought of yourself. Every reader immediately can tell that Mr.Curtis puts an amazing amount of thought into his characters. The Weird Watsons wacky ways will leave you laughing. Mr.Curtis also includes some hilarious titles such as \\"Every Chihuahua in America wants to Take a Bite Out of Byron.\\" Even if the book didn't tell you which character was using dialogue you would know who right away. I'm not a critic but I give this author five stars! His writing style is 100% perfect!"},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"\\"The Watsons Go to Birmingham\\" is a hilarious book and sad book that you never want to put down.The main characters are Joey: the baby of the family, Byron: the oldest and rebellious child of the bunch, Kenny: the middle child, and Momma and Daddy: the parents.Now Kenny, is a little eight year old who gets picked on alot because of his lazy eye, but when he looks at you side ways you can't even tell he has one.Joey, is just like all little girls who tell on their older siblings, protects her older brother when he is getting into trouble, and tries hard not to let her older brother have his fingers burned by matches.Then there is Byron, he's the kind of guy who thinks he can whatever he wants to because he is cool, and old enough to make his own choices like getting his hair flatten like Mexicans.The family seems tight and close whenever Byron isn't kissing his reflection or starting arguements.The weird Watsons decide it's time to go visit Grandma Sands in Birmingham. Birmingham is not like Flint,Michigan. People down there have country accents and white people hating other people for the color of their skin. You have to watch out where you walk and who you hang out with. While they are down there everybody is growing closer and closer together and Byron is becoming way more mature about situations.On one Sunday Joey decided to go to church, little did she know that some white men had put a bomb in the church and it was suppose to go off at a certain time.The Watsons had thought they had lost Joey for good but that wasn't the case. A angel that looked just like Kenny had went to the church and motioned her to follow him back home.Once the family returned home with eyes ful of tears and sadden hearts they saw Joey and their hearts filled with joy and gladness.Once they thought everything through, they decided it was about that time to return home. On the way back it was as if a little baby that had just fallen asleep that had not slept in hours and everyone was careful to try not to say anything because they were afriad to wake it up.After a few of days of returing home it was different, Byron: wasn't in trouble twenty-four seven, Kenny: wasn't in a talking mood and was always behind the couch, and Joey: she was just Joey.One day Byron, decided it was time to get Kenny talking again and it worked even though Kenny, cried for what seemed like hours, but he talked.Just because some one reached out to someone it changed the family some meore.So the reason I like this book is because it shows love,caring, and what real families do in times of trouble."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"This book is about a family and the problems caused by Byron that get him sent to his grandma in Birmingham.Kenny, who is 10 years old is telling the story.

In most circumstances a book of this nature is written from an adults perspective dealing with adult problems, which I sometimes find hard to relate to and uninteresting.

It traveled a different road by really developing the characters of an african-american family with only one racist act in the entire novel. The fact that it was a children's book gave it a great perspective from little Kenny's shoes. Most of the books and movies show how racist it was by presenting every racist thing that happened. But in &quot;The Watsons Go to Birmingham&quot; it shows a normal african-american family with only one racist act, the church bombing. It showed, more than anything I have ever seen or read, how a racist thing like the bombing can affect a normal family.

Especially when Kenny found that shoe.On a scale from one to five I would rate it a five.One reason I would rate it a five is because it was humorous yet some parts were serious. I like a book that is not to serious. I also like an author who has a sense of humor. That is a characteristic that that Christopher Paul Curtis seems to have. I really enjoyed reading this book.I look foward to reading more of his books soon.I plan on reading Bud,not Buddy.

He is very determined to do things, and his brother and him do not get along very often.The very best part of the book was when Kenny's brother, Byron got his tounge stuck to a mirror trying to kiss himself outside in snow.Mainly the story is about Byron, who is not a good child and gets sent to his grandmothers house in Birmingham, Alabamama. Kenny's younger sister, Joetta to church one Sunday. Later on everyone hears a very loud bomb.

EVELYN GRIFFIN."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"The novel The Watsons go to Birmingham-1963 by Christopher Paul Curtis is about an African-American family living in North America. It is about the relationship between Kenny, his older brother Byron and his younger sister Joetta. Kenny is a really smart ten-year-old boy. Only his eyes are lazy, that's a handicap for him. He is not accepted at school, as he wants to be. Byron is in his thirteen-year-old phase and causes a lot of problems for his parents. He colors his hair, has not the \\"right\\" friends etc. Finally his parents decide to bring him to his grandmother to Birmingham over the summer. This story finds place in 1963- during the Civil Rights Movement. It is a hard time for the Afro-American people especially in the South: churches are bombed, people killed and the whites try to work against the movement. Joetta get nearly killed when a bomb is thrown at her church. It is interesting educational book. It is based on the life of an Afro-American family in the middle of the Civil Rights Movement. I think it is important to read literature like this about the history of the USA. It is rather the history of the life of the inhabitants of the USA. This history still influences the life of today. Curtis writes his book with much humor and irony, e.g. when Byron kisses the car mirror. He writes about a hard time for all African-Americans. The book is written from Kenny's perspective, so that I had the feeling that I was a part of their family. I had all the experiences with them. This book is like a trip into the 1960s, into the time of the CRM. Curtis life is related to the book, he was born in Flint, Michigan, where this story begins. When I read this book I could feel the emotions that were going on. He gives a good view into this time. Curtis rapped the time of the Civil Rights Movement successfully in an interesting story. I would suggest when children read this book that they read it with an adult to explain to them what was going on during the CRM. A reader from CA writes about this book: \\"I reccomend it to people that like history.\\" But I think Curtis wrote it so well that I didn't have the feeling that the whole book is about history. It is a story that contains history. But Curtis leads skillfully back to it. I didn't want to stop reading. I really enjoyed reading this book and also it is a children book my suggestion: read it."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"This is an okay book. I reccomend it to people that like history. It has a little adventure. My favoret part is when they get the record player. The grosest part is when Byrun gets his lips stuck to the Brown Bomer."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"I will first say that I read the author's book \\"Bud, Not Buddy\\" before this and loved it, which is why I went and got this book. The book was OK overall and I would've given it 3.5 stars if I were able to. But I missed something somewhere. The bombing took place in September 1963, as is noted in the book. However, the Watsons drive down to leave Byron there for the summer, or perhaps the following school year as well. Wouldn't that imply they went in June or July? By September 15, they would've had to be back home for Kenny and Joey to be in school, even if the whole family had stayed down South for the summer. What am I missing?"},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"I read this book for a children's literature class and was not particularly impressed with it. I do not feel that the author ties everything in the book together. The book should end much earlier than it does. Also, I did not particularly like any of the characters. Some parts of it were funny but not that many and a lot of the parts that I think were meant to be funny actually made me cringe.

Through the main character, Kenneth Watson, we vicariously sense the trauma he experiences as a witness of a horrific incident while visiting grandmother Sand's. Kenneth is preoccupied with the fear that one of his family members may be dead. The images of the \\"two little girls on the grass. . .\\" haunts him. He leaves the scene holding what remained of a shoe-he's not sure who it belongs to. In the aftermath, the family returns home to Flint, Michigan, but Kenneth becomes despondent over his deep grief and his sense of guilt. He questions whether he could have done more, he questions the existence of angels, and he questions why any one would be involved in such heinous acts. His older brother, Byron, who is normally the tough guy, patiently listens to Kenneth's sobbing questions: \\"Why would they hurt some little kids like that?\\" It is a sad moment for a young boy who had previously been happy and playful. Luckily, Byron sets him straight and renews his sense of hope for the future. The Epilogue in the novel provides a brief historical sequence that demonstrates the events leading to the adoption of the Civil Rights Bill in 1964. The author's facts in the epilogue pay tribute to six African-American children who died as a result of horrific events in September 1963. The political implication of this work is that the author makes us aware that for many centuries African-Americans have carved out their rightful place in America and that 1963 was the landmark year that would finally legitimize their equal status as American citizens. Excellent read for young adults."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"Well the very first thing is Byron got into trouble alot.The other thing is that the takes a trip to Birmingham to leave byron because of his behaver.The last thing is that there was a \\"CHURCH BOMBING\\"! and 4 girls young girls died.Well there was two settings one in a snowy ice cold Flint,Michigan.The other thing is a hot sunny place in Birmingham,Alabama.The conflict of the story is that there was a CHURCH BOMBING! in Alabama.So Kenny feels that something is going to happen in Flint.But the resolution of the story is that Byron talks to kenny and tells him that people are just plan evil and don't worry about it."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"This book is required at my Godson's college and I am sohappy I found it."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"I thought it was pretty funny when Kenny Watson went to see if there was realy a woolpoo.

At first he gets his tongue stuck to the car mirror. But one thing is weird about Byron some times he is nice to Kenny some times he isn't. I think By has mood swings. Kenny on the other hand is a nice kid who if he is in trouble his big brother Byron will help him. Joey is their little sis. She is not bad but just a tattle tale. One day mom and dad got tired of By being bad they wanted to send him to Birmingham, but they change there mind.

The author wants us to know that families can have problems together, and they can get out of them together. He also wants us to know that there was a lot of racism back in the 60's.

My teacher, for one, cracks up every other paragraph and most of the kids adore it. Author Christopher Paul Curtis writes with truth, yet adds comical scenes to make a historical- fiction book seem more interesting and less educating. The characters are fully developed and the plot is fast moving. Kenny appears to be very innocent, smart, and nerdy, while Byron plays the role of the \\"juvenile delinquent\\". Momma and Dad are absolutely hilarious- and Joetta is just the annoying, yet protecting, little sister. \\"Watsons...\\" is also great if you want to teach vocabulary along with the book, as it contains words that are probably new to most young readers.

This book was really humorous and taught about the culture of the South. Don't get a CONK!!! People from the South do not have thin blood. When your child asks why I have wear all this stuff, tell the garbage truck story."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"Have you ever wondered what it was like to live during the segregation period? Well, Byron and his younger brother Kenny had to live through it. This fiction book is about a family known as the \\"Crazy Watsons\\" that took a trip from their home in Flint Michigan to their Grandma Sands house in Alabama.The Watsons is a cliffhanger it leaves you in suspense. It has funny things and humorous points. Just like when Byron sets his paper parachutes on fire over the toilet in his bathroom. Then his mom founds out (who is outrageously scary), threatens him, and says that she's gonna do something with him. This book was easy to under stand - (one) because of sequential order and (two) the fact that he is around our age. We can relate to the problems, fears and situations that may come in their lives. It will teach the reader a lesson to do the right thing and to stay on the right path that leads you to a successful future and life. Just don't follow Byron's example, Oh! And (three) there is a lot of humorous things that makes you want to keep reading. Most books to me are boring but this one isn't PLEASE READ IT!!!"},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"It all started in Flint where it is very cold. If you go outside you will probably freeze and die. Anyway Kenny's mother is really mad because they moved to Flint. Byron is Kenny's big brother and Joey is the cute little girl who always cares for Byron. One day after the freezing cold is gone they leave for Birmingham. When they got there everybody started to cry except for Byron when they hugged grandma. When Joey started to go to Sunday school in the first week there was an explosion and she was in church. Now my question is is she dead or alive? To find out read The Watsons go to Birmingham. I recommend this book to everyone who likes climaxes and who love a little bit of laughter."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"The Watsons Go To Birmingham- -1963Christopher Paul CurtisIn the beginning, Byron and Kenny are outside scraping ice off of the Brown Bomber a.k.a. the Watsons car. Then all of a sudden, Kenny hears a noise coming from the other side of the car where Byron is. He doesn't go over there because he thinks Byron will trick him. Byron and Buphead (Byron's best friend) had played a trick on Kenny and hit him in the face with snowballs a few days before. When Kenny finally the other side, he sees Byron's lips stuck to the side-mirror. He then ran inside to get the family. Daniel (their dad) started laughing because he had never seen anything like that. Daniel and Wilona (their mom) were trying to think of a way to get Byron's lips off of the mirror. Daniel decided to get water so he could pore it on Byron's lips but it just made it worse. Wilona told the family to go inside then. When they were all inside Wilona pulled on Byron's lips until they came off. When Kenny was in school he got picked on by Larry Dunn because he had a lazy eye and he was a good reader. One day a new kid named Rufus came to school at Clark. Rufus started getting picked on more than Kenny because Rufus talked different (he had lived in Arkansas) and Rufus didn't have a lot of clothes. Kenny and Rufus became good friends but one day somebody said something about Rufus and Kenny laughed. Since Kenny had laughed at him, Rufus stopped hanging out with Kenny. They ended up fixing the problem and became friends again. When winter came, Kenny shared his gloves with Rufus for awhile but then decided to act like he had lost them so his mom gave him his other pair of leather gloves and Rufus got the old pair. Then one day, Kenny's new gloves went missing and Larry Dunn had gotten a pair of leather gloves instead of cheap plastic ones. Kenny found out that Larry had stolen his gloves but when Kenny told Byron about it, Byron and Buphead beat Larry up. Kenny then got his gloves back. When Byron kept lighting matches in the house Wilona got mad at him and said if he would do it one more time she would do something to him. Then one day, Kenny saw that Byron went into the bathroom and locked the door so he went and looked through the key hole. He saw Byron in there making Kleenex's into parachutes and then lighting matches and burning the parachutes to where they would fall into the toilet. When Wilona came upstairs she smelled smoke and saw Kenny looking through the keyhole so she got Byron out of there and took him downstairs. Then Joey started crying because Mama had gotten out matches, Vaseline, and band-aids. She knew that Mama was going to burn some part of Byron. Joey then got scared and kept getting in front of Byron so Mama couldn't burn him. When she got Joey away she lit a match but Joey ran over and blew out every match that Mama lit. So Byron never got burned. Since their dad only paid for groceries at one time Byron and Kenny thought they were on welfare but then found out they weren't. A few days later Kenny found Byron in a tree behind the grocery store with a full bag and an empty bag of Swedish cream cookies. When Kenny realized what Byron had done it was too late because he couldn't tell on him since he had eaten some of the cookies. A few days later, Byron came home with his hair straightened and permanent (well only for awhile) red gunk in his hair. Wilona was in shock because she and Daniel had told Byron not to put that stuff in his hair. Wilona knew he had gotten the stuff from Buphead because he was the only other kid with hair like that. Daniel then shaved all Byron's hair off! A few weeks later the Watsons started packing for Birmingham. They were going to Alabama to see Wilona's family. They decided that Byron would stay with Grandma Sands for the whole summer and maybe the school year. The family drove straight through all the way to Alabama. While they were down south the kids went swimming and Kenny almost got pulled under but Byron saved him. Joey went to Sunday school with some friends she had made. Then there was a loud boom. A bomb had gone off at the church. Joey ended up being safe because she had followed Kenny home. Wilona and Daniel decided not to leave Byron in Alabama because of some of the racism down south. Kenny kept sleeping behind the couch which they called \\"The Watsons World Famous Pet Hospital\\" because he thought that maybe it would help him forget about the bomb going off. Byron helped Kenny stop thinking of it all the time, so Kenny started doing the things he normally did. The Watsons lived their lives almost the same but still had the aftershock of the bomb going off and almost losing Joey."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"The book Watsons go to Birmingham 1963 is the coolest book ever.I don\`t know anyone who dosen\`t like this book.I love this book,it\`s soooo funny,except the true part that was sooo sad.My favorite charactor is Byron he\`s very funny.I love the part when Byron got his lips stuck on the window of the brown bomber.And dad was making fun of him.When I get a chance I\`ll buy the book becauce it is awesome."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"Dear Christopher Paul Curtis, Your story is Great.I like the part when Byron got kenny out of the wool pooh and said BREATHE, STUPID BREATHE and the part when he drops Kenny into the puke-- GROSS!

When he leaves his hometown in Michigan to visit Alabama in 1963, he discovers how difficult it can be to be accepted as a black American. This hilarious novel deals with a variety of themes including acceptance, diversity, loneliness, adversity and insecurity. A reader gains a greater appreciation for the American Civil Rights movements in the 1960's through the eyes of an entertaining protagonist. This would be an excellent book to read when trying to participate in Black History Month, to read a funny story with a novel, or to read when a student feels a prejudice brewing inside of himself/herself."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"Have your parents ever made a threat and actually done it.

You did have some comas missing and run on sentence."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"My sixth grade class greatly enjoyed this heartwarming novel. Above all its many merits, this is one hilarious book, which works especially well as a read-aloud. Within the first chapter, my students were rolling on the floor with laughter and I had tears coming out of my eyes. It is truly hysterical. But the brilliance of the novel is the weaving of humor with important lessons about family, love, and racial problems faced in the 60s, which invariably leads to excellent discussions of prejudice and racism today. It got to the point where my students would beg me to read the book and they had long faces if we got too busy to read it for a day or two. Bravo to Mr. Curtis for his outstanding work. It would have gotten my Newbery vote!"},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"I picked this book up from a book fair at the school I worked at, and let me tell you it was the best money I ever spent, well in recent memory. The author does a great job of turning a tragic event into a heartwarming story about a family and the trials they went through to come back together again. The fact that he used that horrible, inhuman event to do it took a lot of guts and creativity. The characters in the book were very well developed, they were also very believeable. I have reccommended this book to several of my friends to read. I had my doubts about the book when I realized what moment in time it as centered around, but I took a chance and read it and I am glad that I did. It was quick reading but to the point. I would suggest that anybody who remembers the turbulent 60's should read this manuscript."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"The main character is ten-year-old, African-American, Kenny Watson. Kenny is the middle child of a family that lives in Flint, Michigan. This story is mostly about Kenny, his times at school and the love/hate relationships with his older brother, Byron and little sister, Joetta. Kenny is a bright child, and an excellent reader, but he has lazy eyes. These attributes sometimes cause him to be made fun of. Kenny's brother gets into much trouble during the time of the book and the parents decide to send him to his grandmother for the summer. Near the end of the book, the whole family takes a trip to Birmingham, Alabama to drop off Byron. While there, Kenny almost drowns in a lake and Joetta is nearly killed, during one infamous bombing of an African American church. The children are exposed to the hatred felt toward their people and the book ends with their dealing of this hatred. The epilogue is excellent in summing up some of the events of that time period, and of the heroes that were prevalent. The hatred and racism touches you deeply because you had grown to love and respect the Watson family."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"The Watson's Go to Bermingham-1963Would you like to be black in Alabama in 1963?I thought a lot about this while I was reading , \\"The Watson's go to Bermingham-1963\\" by Christoher Paul Curtis.I cannot imagine that I am black and am in Alabama.It must have been an experience of a lifetime. This book helped me realize the point of having a family.I never thought about death before I read this book Four insentient girls were killed, because of the bombing of the church in Alabama,during Sunday school. The author does a good job of character description.He describes the characters very well,by using hyperbole.He uses words like\\"It was about a zillion degrees below zero.\\"\\"His lips stretched a thousand miles.\\" These are some examples of hyperbole.He also made up some of the jokes like the wool pooh or know as whirlpool.

Both are along the same lines since both the classic movie and this book look at life from a totally random perspective of a young boy.This is a light-hearted look at the ugliness of segregation, although it does so only at the end of the story. The beginning is disjointed and seemingly disorganized.

He and his family, who are known around town as the &#65533;Weird Watsons&#65533;, live in Flint, MI, and in the summer of 1963 take a drive to Birmingham, AL (where his mother's from), in order to \\"deliver\\" his 13-year-old \\"juvenile delinquent\\" brother to live with his grandmother for the summer.This story is so full of laughs, and great tales of every day family struggles and triumphs. It's hard to believe the author is an adult. All readers will be easily be able to relate to Kenny and remember feeling as he did when his parents hand down discipline, when his big brother picks on him, when life mysteries puzzle him, and as his little sister pesters him. We can also relate to his parents, who are hard working folks filled with integrity, just trying to raise their family the best they can. Their perspectives are hysterical, too - one laughs out loud when they speak of promising to \\"get a cheap divorce\\" if either one ever comes to love country (\\"hillbilly\\") music.The author also beautifully weaves in the turbulent 60's and the hardships African Americans faced at that time, particularly in the south. When the Watsons are driven north again earlier than they&#65533;d expected, we realize from the history shared the tremendous risk they were taking in the first place.I HIGHLY recommend this one!"},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"This book is a wonderful way to discover the feelings of blacks during the civil rights movement and the changing laws of segregation.

The novel can be confusing at some points but I could easily catch up. The book is by Christopher Paul Curtis and he is definitely one of my favorite authors. The book takes place in several different places. Most of the book takes place in Birmingham, Alabama. A lot of it takes place in Flint, Michigan, the Watson's home town. Some of it takes place on the way to Birmingham. But no matter where they go,the Watsons are still hilarious. All the characters in the book have their own wacky personalities. The person telling the story is Kenny Watson, the star of the book. Kenny has a sleepy eye and many people think that it's strange. Kenny likes to read and he began reading at a very young age. No matter how weird people think Kenny is, he still has a great role in the book. The plot of the book can be hard to understand but you can catch up. The book is about the Watson family who want to eascape from Michigan's cold weather. It's so cold that your lips can get stuck on the car mirror! To get away, the Watsons go to Birmingham, Alabama where it's extremely hot. As the Watsons experience Birmingham, they learn about peace, sadness, and life. Many things happen to the Watsons in the book-both good and sad. The characters in the book are not real people but the events are true. Some people actually have died in a bombing at a Birmingham church. Sadness or happiness, I still loved the book."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"The Watsons go to Birmingham-1963The Watsons go to Birmingham-1963 is a great book. The fun, silly book captured me, and made me laugh out loud. I think Christopher Paul Curtis is a compelling author. A young boy named Kenny Watson tells the story through narration.In 1963, in Flint, Michigan, the Watsons packed up to go to Birmingham, Alabama. Dad got an Ultra Glide then packed the records. When they got to Birmingham they were melting from the heat before they even got out of the car. At this time, in Birmingham there were racial issues that made African Americans and the Watsons uncomfortable.A nice friendly kid named Kenny Watson has a lot of interesting stories to tell. One of his stories was the time Byron ( Kenny's big brother) got his hair dyed, and his mom went crazy. Even though Kenny is nice he still has a sense of humor. When Kenny's dad came home, Kenny saw what his dad did to Byron, and Kenny laughed so hard he could not stop. Kenny's dad shaved Byron's hair because Byron didn't obey his mother. But Kenny was very smart and knew what Byron did was wrong.One family called the \\"Weird Watsons\\" lived in Flint, Michigan. They decided to go to Birmingham, Alabama for warmer weather. They were going to go for a vacation. When the Watsons arrived in Birmingham they have tons of stories, and had a lot of fun. Then one terrible Sunday Kenny's sister Joey was in her church while it was bombed. The family went home sad and still scared but even though Joey was with them, Kenny still thought she was dead, in his mind.Though this book has a sad ending I thought it was great. The funny stories kept me wondering. Christopher Paul Curtis's book Bud Not Buddy was also great. I would recommend the book The Watsons go to Birmingham- 1963."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"What would it be like living in a black family during the civil rights movement? We'll it isn't a tea party! The Watsons seem like a normal family if you think the like a normal family if you think living with four other people in freezing Flint is normal. A little chaos never hurt. Right?Kenny, the main character, has to put up with his older brother, Byron the tough guy. His little sister, Joetta \\"the laughing sock of the school.\\" And on top of that they're going to their stern grandma's house in Birmingham. Byron is going to be disciplined there. Christopher Paul Curtis did a great job with The Watsons go to Birmingham - 1963. The book was so good the pages seemed like they turned themselves! The author made the book so funny, like when Byron got his lips frozen on the car mirror and yet so sad. When you think everything is smooth sailing, then BAM!!! A life changing tragedy hits the lives of millions of people. The book tells about the love and hardships of the Watson family.I recommend this book to every one who needs a good laugh. It's impossible to be unsatisfied with the book. I'm positive if you ask anybody who read the book they'll say it is one of the funniest books they've ever read."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"The Watson's Go to Birmingham-1963, by Christopher Paul Curtis, is an excellent book, but I only gave it four stars for various reasons.In Flint, Michigan, the Watson family lives in a quite comfortable and secure life. Even though 13 year old Byron, or By, is an \\"Official Juvenile Delinquent\\", he cries when he kills a bird with a Swedish Cr&egrave;me cookie. Kenny is a 9 year old kid who is his brother's punching bag and test dummy, and he is the narrator of the book. Kenny's younger sister, Joetta, or Joey, is about five years old and \\"has the smile of an angel\\". When Byron becomes a bit too big for his britches, Mom and Dad Watson decide that Byron needs to be humbled with a visit to Grandma Sands in Birmingham, Alabama. So the Watson's set out, after what seems like an eternity of reading, even though it's only 133 pages. Similes are in a lot of places, and add good detail, but it can be monatomic after a while.I liked how the author gave creative ways to title his chapters. It would have been boring to read, \\"Chapter 5\\", but \\"Nazi Parachutes Attack America and Get Shot Down over the Flint River by Captain Byron Watson and His Flamethrower of Death\\" was a little more interesting. The author didn't use a boring and repetitive storyline of a black family traveling to the South during Segregation and being treated like dirt. He told of the family's life before the trip so that, I guess, you could better understand the characters before and after the trip to Birmingham, and what happens while they are there. One part that I disliked strongly was when Kenny is looking for Joetta, and he cannot find her. He goes home and then Joetta tells him that he led her to Grandma Sands. Another thing never fully explained is the man who grabs Kenny's ankle and is later seen in the chruch.Besides this book, I would recommend The Blue Sword, The Black Stallion, Johnny Tremain, Eragon, and Eldest (Both of those books are part of a series).

I don't know why it took me a decade to get around to reading one of the most critical pieces of children's fiction published in recent years. But, at last, I absorbed it in several sittings. I enjoyed getting to know the Watsons (who never seemed as \\"weird\\" as Kenny kept telling us they were), but my hesitation in embracing it centers on how much Curtis throws at us. It feels as if we know this family's problems - primarily, their troublesome oldest son - far better than we know the family members themselves. This may be because we get the story firsthand from 10-year-old Kenny, whose innocent perspective is not quite up to the task of the subject matter as it develops. By the time we move into the near-tragedy of Kenny's encounter with the \\"Wool Pooh\\" and the very real tragedy of the church bombing, the tone shifts so drastically that things feel tacked on and not as emotionally involving as they should be."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"Entertaining family road trip choice with some historical references as well!

Byron, a juvinile deliquent, has to be sent to Birmingham, Alabama because of his rude behavior at the Watsons home in Flint, Michigan. Kenny, a smart kid at school, has to play the youger brother role and put up with his older brother. At the end of the story Byron turns into a loving brother and a nice kid.

Watch for some comical and entertaining moments along the way.While in Birmingham, some frightening situations occur. Will the Watsons come back alive?The story, told from Kenny's imaginative point of view, is often filled with exciting, larger-than-life moments. Byron's exaggerated stories are full of dramatic images, which he uses to gain control over the situation. Be aware of a small amount of language that might not be appropriate for younger children."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"This book was great.

It's about a goofy family going to Birmingham, Alabama and getting into all kinds of adventures.There are three main characters, Kenny, Byron, and Joetta Watson. My favorite character was Kenny, he's really different, and Byron, he's always getting into trouble, and then there's Joey, she's just Joetta, always whining.Read the book,o.k, it's really great, besides it has alot of surprises towards the end.

It was hilarious how Mr. Watson made jokes to get his wife mad, and how Kenny's big brother Byron was always getting into trouble especially when he dyed his hair red and his mom called him her long lost son from Mexico. I loved the way the author wrote it from Kenny's point of view because it let you better understand what was going on better than if it wasn't. I loved how many details he put in there because the more he described something, the better you could picture what he was talking about in your mind.

The Watsons have to travel all the way to Alabama because of Byron and because they wanted to visit their grandma.

I would highly reccommend this book to my fourth grade peers."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"I think this book was a very good book. It tied fiction with reality. In 1963 Birmingham was basically a war zone. It was very heartless and un christian like for that man to kill those little girls. There was just no reason.

It's not only historical but histerical as well. It's got lots of funny scenes that will make you laugh so hard you'll have to go back and read it again. All the chapters are hilarious but my favorite was chapter 11 \\"Bobo Brazil Meets the Sheik\\". It's about the oldest son in the family, Byron, goes to live with his Grandmother Sands for the summer because he is getting into too much trouble in Flint. So after the long trip from Flint to Birmingham, they finally reach Grandma Sands. Kenny, the younger son, thinks that Byron is going to fight with and disrespect Grandma Sands just like he does his parents and everyone else. But when they get there, Byron cowards down and gives Grandma Sands a big hug and talks to her with respect.

This is a wonderful piece about civil rights in the US - a black family from the north visits relatives in Birmingham. GREAT read."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"The book, The Watson's go to Birmingham by Christopher Paul Lewis is about an African-American family from Flint, Michigan. The book takes place during the 1960's, which was during the Civil rights movement. Kenny, the narrator throughout the book, is the middle child to his older brother Byron and younger sister Joetta. Byron is continually acting out and causing problems so his parents decide to visit their grandmother in Birmingham, Alabama hoping she can straighten him out. Most of the book is about the car trip out to Birmingham. Once they get to their grandmothers house, an unexpected happening occurs causing the family to bond together, and step up and help their family.This book is written through the eyes of young Kenny, who is still learning about what his family and African-American's are subjected to during this time. He is just as young and nave about what is going on, yet depicts emotions very well. By reading this in an older classroom (5th-8th grade) the reader is able to relate in the sense that both the narrator and the reader are learning about what is going on and feeling the same emotions that any young African-American kid would. I would highly recommend this book to help shed light on this era and the Civil Rights movement that was present during this time. The book is an awesome way to help kids understand this important event in history and does so in such a great way with the outlook of a young kid, just as they are."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"In the town of Flint, Michigan lived ten-year-old, Kenny, and his family, the Weird Watson's. Kenny's brother, Byron, a \\"juvenile delinquent,\\" can't help himself from getting into trouble. Finally, his parents having enough, decide its time for Byron to spend sometime with strict Grandma Sands in the deep south. With the Brown Bomber and the Ultra Glide, the Watsons set off to Birmingham, Alabama, where they encounter the harsh realities of a dark time in American history.The Watsons Go To Birmingham is a comical, moving and eye opening novel about an African American family living during the 1960's. Not only does it take you into the life of a ten-year-old boy but also into the realism of discrimination. A very educational and engaging story that gives insight into the world of African Americans living during the Civil Rights Movement. Experiencing the emotions of the young boy, Kenny, leaves a lasting impression on American history.Overall The Watsons Go To Birmingham was a very enjoyable read but not something to take lightly, recommending it to an older audience of 5th and up."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"In this powerful book about an African American family is a fourth grade boy named Kenny that documents a time in his life around 1963. The setting of the book is in Flint Michigan, until about mid way where the family goes on a road trip to visit Kenny's grandma in Alabama. During the time of the story there was great conflicts between white and black people over civil rights (mostly in the South). The family finds themselves experiencing just a taste of the conflict while in Alabama before the end of the story.The book the \\"The Watsons Go To Birmingham- 1963\\" is an interesting, humorous, and moving book that I feel many children should have the privilege to read. I personally found myself moved by the book even after being an adult and hearing about the civil rights movement most of my life. I feel the reason the book is so moving may be because you become so entangled in Kenny's life that it feels as if its your own."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"In the beginning of the book I thought it was going to be very boring because I had to read it in school but as I red it it got very interesting then at the end it truly showed that there where still problems with colored people but in conclusion this disaffected good book!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"It was so funny .I loved it so much. This is one of the best books I've ever read I'd read it again."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"The Watsons go to Birmingham is an awesome book written by Christopher Paul Curtis.This book is fiction, but it has some fact to it. It tackles the tough issue of racism- while still being the most hilarious book I've ever read.Kenny has a brother, Byron, and a sister, Joetta (Joey). Byron is a troublemaker and Joey is a tattletale. The beginning of the book is mainly about Byron's troublemaking schemes- which eventually leave his parents into taking the family to Birmingham to visit Grandma Sands and leaving Byron there for a while. At Birmingham, Kenny seems to find trouble like a magnet, and Byron acts like an angel. He encounters the \\"Wool Pooh,\\" or the angel of death, twice. These leave him emotionally scarred until the end of the book.This book has stayed in my mind for a while. It makes me appreciate the small things in life. This author did a powerful job of explaining the issues of the civil rights movement. The book, like I said, was really,really funny, but I managed to learn a few things about the movement.Overall, this book was amazing, and everyone reading this review should take the time to read it. You'll be glad you did!"},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"My class of 5th graders is currently reading and listening to the audio tape of this story. We are on chapter 7. The students beg me to give them more time to read to find out what's going to happen next. The book lends itself to open discussions about safety with matches, cruelty to animals, and bullying so far. I believe the book will lead us into discussions about what it was like in 1963 for the African American people. My class is majority, african american and need to know more about the history of civil rights. The audio tape is fantastic with Levar Burton reading. He uses Southern accents and jive talking that the kids crack up.The book is hilarious, heartwarming and thought provoking. I am ending this school year with this book in the hopes that they will want to pick up another book and read, read, read!"},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"While it's not difficult to imagine a novel for young readers that does a better job of dealing with sensitive issues than The Watsons, it would certainly be difficult to write or find such a novel.The novel's primary strength lies in the Watsons themselves, an instantly recognizable, universal, and likeable family whose interactions transcend any ethnic or class backgrounds by entertaining all. By the time Curtis turns his attention to explicit matters of race, one has been won over by the charismatic family, and is more than ready to follow them on any journey, no matter how unpleasant it may turn out.If Curtis' downplays the Birmingham bombing, and he does, it is certainly an understandable, if perhaps regrettable, decision. And, if his ending seems far too clear-cut, predictable, and ideal, it is far less so than most books for young readers, and the quality of the rest of the book renders this a forgivable flaw."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"Looking at the cover gave me no idea what I was in for. The wonderful book by Christopher Paul Curtis taught me much about the racially motivated bombing in Burmingham. I truely loved this book. It taught a great message. I loved the way it showed the sibling relationship between Byron and Kenny. Also the way it was told from a child's point-of-veiw. It was well written and I recommend it to anyone! The message of this book will stay with me always."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"This book is funny and lighthearted, but doesn't have much of a plot -- most of the chapters are not even essential to the plot. Mr. Curtis' &quot;Bud, Not Buddy&quot; is a much better book."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"I agree when people say that this novel was deeply moving. There were many parts when I almost felt like crying. For example, in the part where Byron is beating up Larry I feel very sad for Larry, the way people are laughing at him. Sometimes I felt very relieved. For example, when I found out that Joey was actually OK after the bombing I felt so relieved and happy. This novel really helped me understand the whole segragation and civil- rights movement thing better. I felt really informed and touched after finishing the novel. I would have to say that this book has to be one of my favorite out-of-series books I've ever read."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"This book is great. I loved it. It was funny, but the last few chapters were very suspenseful. I was required to read it for English class, but I would have found it anyway. Kenny's view of what happened was interesting. Overall grade: A+++++++++ Totally dugular."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"Have you ever had you tongue stuck to a car mirror in the middle of December? Or has your mother ever purposely try to burn your finger?

With a juvenile delinquent brother named Byron. A take along sister, Joanna.

Mixed up in the middle of the civil rights movement, this is a wacky ride that you need to take!"},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"I read this book last year but enjoyed it so much I wanted to add my two cents. Adult or child, you will enjoy the characters in this wonderful story of family. The Watson's trip was minimal compared to the rest of the story.

Curtis wote a very interesting book about the civil rights movement."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"This book was a very nice, a very nice book. This book is about 3 Northeners. They live in Flint,Michigan;it is very cold. The littlest, Kenny, is very smart out of the whole family. The oldest, Byron, is a juvenile delinquent. He is very bad and he is always doing stuff, like playing with matches. But the book is great! You sould read it! One more thing - Joetta. She is a littl girl that helps her mom out a lot. The part I liked was when the mom was getting ready to burn Byron's hands, because the momma told him not to play with them or look at them. So he decided to be obedient; so she was about to to burn him, but Joetta blew out the fire.If you like comedy and dramma, you would love WATSONS GO TO BIRMINGHAM- 1963."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"This book is about an African American family called the Watsons,during the 1960's.I think they had one of the hardest times to live in because during the 60's was when the Civil Rights movement was going on.Curtis shows us the differences in the North and the South at that time, and to be in Birmingham, AL at the time would have been scary for all African-Americans, for sure. His book is easy to follow and to understand and is both sad and funny."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"The book was good because they were really talking about the family relationship such as Byron and Kenny. These are two brothers; Byron is the oldest and Kenny is the youngest. Byron always is pushing Kenny around, but Kenny didn't know that at first. One day they had to wash his daddy's brown bomber, their nickname for their old car, and Byron kept on playing tricks on Kenny. It makes the book funny and easy to read. It also has a serious side when it describes the racism of the South in Birmingham, AL in 1963.

The story was about a ten-year-old boy name Kenny. He has one brother who is a juvenile delinquent. The family was very weird to many people. The sister was kind of quiet but Bryon, the brother, was out of control. I would recommend the book for age 12 and up. Because young children would not understand.

It's very uninteresting for me."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"I never thought much of Christopher Paul Curtis until I read The Watsons go to Birmigham-1963. This book mixes humor, mystery and historcal books all in one. The Watsons go to Birmigham is for all ages but I encourage older kids to read it to fully understand this book. While reading the book I felt I actualy got to know the characters because Christopher described them so good.

It talks about a fmaily going to Burmingham, Alabama. This book takes place when the Civil Rights Movement was going through. It also talks about life in 1963 for a black family.

If you want to know what happens you have to read the book and I recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"I thought that this book was good and would be excellent for those who like humor and fun. I really enjoyed it and would recommend it. One theme of the book was that people get into trouble in steps, and people always can turn around and step out of it. Another theme of this book was the life of a black family and the troubles and changes they all go through. Each of the characters went through changes and trouble. Byron turns out of his trouble and helps Kenny to stay out also."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"Enter the exciting life of the Weird Watsons who are taking a trip to their Grandma Sands who lives in Birmingham. The story is told by Kenny, a ten year old boy. Kenny is a younger brother of Byron who is an official juvenile delinquent. Their little sister is Joetta, nicknamed Joey, and a little pest.

It is a very good novel about an African American family. Christopher Paul Curtis did a great job with this book."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"The Watsons may have gone to Birmingham, but the author seems to be afraid to tell of the horrors of racism that are supposed to be the main point of the book. I hardly kept awake through the eight full chapters it took before the Watsons actually went to Birmingham. The characters just aren't real. The ten year old narrator is like a 12 or 13 year old kid in the beginning, but in the end comes off as being someone who can't understand the concept of death. The brother character-Byron goes through a metamorphosis that actually has some realism. Byron's transformation, and a few laughs the book gives, are the only things that make this book even O.K. The bombing of the church and the family's reaction to it, is poor. The bombing incident, based on the 1963 bombing of a Baptist Church in Birmingham that killed four people, just doesn't cut it. I recommend it only to fourth or fifth graders, or those who have spent much time imprisoned or in a cave. An hour of reading this book is equivalent to five hours of dental surgery.

When dad brings home the magnificient Ultra Glide for the Brown Bomber, the parents tell Byron, Kenny and Joey that they are going home to Birmingham, Alabama where Grandma Sands lives, and that Byron will be spending the summer there. A few days after arriving in Alabama, they witness a church bombing. You will have to read the book to find out what happens. Colyn Courtney, Mason County Middle School, 8th grade"},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"I liked this book because the author, an adult, did an excellent job of narrating the story through a child's eyes. Because of this, it is easier for all ages to relate to the events. Although the setting of the book was the 1960's, we can still see a lot of similarities in our world today. This book deals with a lot of different issues that we all have to face sooner or later and gives us a positive way of dealing with them, from having a borderline juvenille delinquent such as Byron in the family, to having a dad such as Daniel who always tries to be funny, to a mother such as Wilona who talks real &quot;Southern,&quot; and to having barely escaped death such as ten year old Kenny and his younger sister Joetta. A tear-jerking, yet hilarious novel, this book is one I recommend especially for eight to twelve year olds to read.

My favorite part of the story is when the bully, kenny and joetta's brother which is 13 now and thinks he is all that, and he gets his lips stuck to the car door window because he was trying to kiss his reflection. Then when they were about to leave to go Alabama then Kenny says I think I am going to start a comic book and I think he is going to call it...... the lipless wonder.

The book touched on the tragedy of the four little girls who died needlessly in Birmingham. I was thinking that the book would have discussed more racism in Flint. Racism in this country was everywhere and not just in the South. It amazes me that the Watson family never experienced any racial bigotry in Flint. Sundown towns were towns were if you were black, you had to be inside before the sun went down. If not, a person could be lynched for being outside.

This book is good for all ages and it is hard to put down.This book shows the struggles that most African American people went through in 1983. The main character's name is Kenny. His older brother is Bryan, and his younger sister is Joetta(Joey). Along with their parents, people call them the 'Wierd Watsons'. Bryan is the type of guy that loves attention and is always getting into trouble. From lighting things on fire and dropping them into the toilet, to throwing a guy into a fence,he does every bad thing you can think of. Joey is the kind of sister that is your best friend one minute, but will tell on you the next.The Watsons are having some family problems. For starters, Kenny is getting picked on. Then Bryan starts to get into trouble that you can't imagine. However, like most sisters,Joey is perfect. The kids have all heard of Grandma Sands but none have seen her. Bryan says that she's the devil but Kenny and Joey don't believe him. Mr. and Mrs. Watson threaten Bryan that they will take him to Birmingham where Grandma Sands lives. After the last straw the Watsons follow through and decide to go to Birmingham. As they load up, they make a lot of new changes to their car for this journey. They go to Birmingham and meet Grandma Sands. Kenny, Bryan, and Joey have a blast in Alabama and find out that Grandma Sands is the nicest person ever. They realize that being African American doesn't change who the are and they can still have a great time."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"It was a great book that taught about every day life. Myisha liked the use of the author's writing style especially in how he developed the charactedr of Byron. Justin liked the end because Byron had shown his real identity and how much he loved his family. Saron felt that Kenny's character was critical to the telling of the story. Mikia liked the book because it held her interest through the ral life adventures that the Watson's encountered daily. Derrius liked the story because he could relate to the character of Kenny. Michael thought Byron was a really good person, especially after having gone through the shock of the church bombing. All of the class believes that this book will help all young readers to gain a better understanding of relations between different races of people. A definite read for all fifth graders!"},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"This story was so much fun to read. I really enjoyed the full rich characters. I felt like I was reading about my own family. The dynamics of the family make this book remarkable. I cherished every moment of the weird Watsons. The account of the church bombing left me with a chill... Kenny's behavior after the family's return was touching. Christopher Paul Curtis did the book justices by having Byron step up and take care of Kenny. I will remember this one for a long time to come. A must read for summer!"},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"The Weird Watson's have the same loving and quirky qualities of many American families. The Watson's will make you laugh and cry. Christopher Paul Curtis makes his reader's really feel they are Kenny. Then when they family experiences the tradgedy of a church bombing in Birmingham, he emotionally pulls the reader in further as if they are living in this trivial time as well. Curtis found a way to communicate the history of the early sixties to children in a very simple and meaningful way. This book would be a great edition to any child's library and I would hope that parent's and teacher's would encourage their children to read this book."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"Are you stuck to a mirror,isnt that a great title.The reason why I used that title is because it shows that it was my favorite part of the book.Byron's lips got stuck to the mirror and his mother pulled him off.I thought that part was hilarious,but about the whole book I liked it because it had alot of laughs in it and it showed us how much we use to be prejudice."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"Are you stuck to a mirror,isnt that a great title.The reason why I used that title is because it shows that it was my favorite part of the book.Byron's lips got stuck to the mirror and his mother pulled him off.I thought that part was hilarious,but about the whole book I liked it because it had alot of laughs in it and it showed us how much we use to be prejudice."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"I thought this book was an ok book it doesnt have a very big plot. i liked the book a lot"},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"Upon discovering that I was expected to read this book for a Children's Literature class at Kent State University I was more than a little dismayed. I certainly didn't think that I would be able to enjoy this book at first glance. However, I was pleasantly surprised with how much I grew to adore the main character and his wacky family.This story is not only humorous it is also very poignant. It takes the reader along for a ride of emotions. Prompting thoughts about not only the way in which a society perpetuates cruelty but how it can then promote love so strongly at the same time. Not only do the characters grow to love and accept each other but the reader feels as though they too, are a part of the household. Thus, promoting a familial bond to these people.This feeling of being a part of the story is important in literature because the reader has a strong desire to feel as if there is a purpose in reading the story. The author fulfills this by assimilating the reader into the cast of characters albeit a silent member. Curtis is quite successful in this attempt to bring the reader in and make the emotional content of the characters' situation influence the reader.After all was said and done I must admit that although I know better, I did judge this book by its cover and was wrong. I was excited to have a story make me feel as though I have invested myself into the plot as well as the characters and this was certainly accomplished here."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"The Watsons go to Birmingham was a book about the life of the wierd watsons.

Read it, and you'll love it!"},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"The Watsons Go To Birmingham-1963 is a hilarious combination of a fictional story and real events occuring in Birmingham in 1963. This fictional story is about the Watson family trip from Flint, Michigan to Birmingham, Alabama in the \\"brown bomber\\". Intertwined in this fictional story are the events of the Sixteenth Avenue Church bombing where four African American girls lost their lives.This book contains both comedy and tragedy. The narrator is fourth grader Kenny Watson. Because of his age and innocence, Kenny is able to bring many questions about prejudice and the civil rights movement during 1963. Readers of this book become familiar with the character Joetta. Joetta's character gives a face to the girls killed in Birmingham. Byron, the oldest brother, has many trials and tribulations in his attempt to grow up. Teenagers can relate to the character of Byron. He is frustrated, isolated, and trying desperately to find his way to becoming an adult.Christopher Paul Curtis did a great job writing The Watsons Go To Birmingham-1963. Curtis is from Flint, Michigan where he attended the Flint branch of The University of Michigan. Many of the funny stories in this book are events from his own life. Curtis has been awarded the Coretta Scott King Award, the Newberry Honor, and is currently a full time writer."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this book! I think that the author, Christopher Paul Curtis, not only does a great job at describing the characters, he also shows a black family promoting strong family bonds. I was \\"brought in\\" to the book not only by the humor, but also by the strong emtions of the mother trying to keep her family on the right track. I enjoyed how at the end of the story not only did the main character, Kenny, grow spiritually and emotionally, but Bryan did too! I think Curtis did a good job at addressing racism and the tragedy of the church bombing by keeping it second, to the characters lives and experiences. This would be a great book for adolescents because not only is this book enjoyable, but history is being addressed along with humor and drama."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"The book reminds me of my childhood and so many coming of age movies I've seen. The honesty found in the book gives us the human side of growing up in a family with siblings. Throughout the book we see the roles of each family member. When the mother was going to burn Byron for playing with matches the little girl tried everything to keep her brother from getting hurt. The little girl always took up for Byron. At the end of the book when the swimming incident happened and the bombing took place the little girls character played a big part. We saw through the book how she wanted her brother to be good and not get in trouble and her life was spared on the day of the bombing. The book would be good for middle school children because they could be taught that although siblings fight they still have a loyalty to one another. Children can also get an idea of what it was like to be there and feel the effects of the bombing."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"This award winning novel by Christopher Paul Curtis is a piece of historical fiction that is fun to read. The African American family that is portrayed in this story can be considered somewhat comedic. The descriptions given of each character allows one to get a picture in one's mind of what each person might have looked like. This novel takes place during the 1960's when freedom in America was not necessarily free for African American. Byron Watson, the headstrong teenage son of the family often gets into trouble and Kenny, the younger brother does his best to let everyone know what it is like to grow up in the Watson home with Byron and his younger sister Joetta. This book is a great read."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"Imagine if you were black in the year of 1963 down in Alabama. Do you think you'd like it? You can see what an African - American person feels like by reading this book. This book is one of the best books I have ever read. Some parts are emotional and some are funny. I can't explain this book with only one word, it's almost impossible. The characters are . . . unique in their own way. Like the oldest child, Byron. He causes so many problems, it's what causes the book to be comical. What caused me to read this book is the blurb. It's simply superb. I got so many recommendations for this book that that only made me want to read this book even more. The author has only written two books, and now I REALLY, REALLY want to read the other book. Christopher Paul Curtis describes the characters, plot and situation so well that they make the story even better. The way that the whole family acts and communicates with each other, they make you think they hate each other, but they really do love each other. Racism is completely horrible, there's no explanation for it."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"If you like humor and want to add fun to your reading then you must read The Watsons Go To Birmingham: 1963. This book made me think that other people have a hard time being different like African-Americans. Also, that even in your ordinary life you can find excitement. I think that the Weird Watsons is a great book and once you start it you will not want to put it down as it takes you over their journey to Birmingham, Alabama and even through a bombing. I liked this book so much that I gave it 5 stars; I gave it 5 stars because it is very breathtaking"},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"This is a story about an African family who lives in Flint, Michigan who decides to visit their grandmother at Birmingham, Alabama. Because Alabama was in the south, they had to face a racism tragedy. They have to go through sometimes-funny times such as Byron getting his lip stuck to the mirror or other horrible times such as the bombings. When they get to their grandmother's house, they experience one of the most hated times for African Americans.I liked this book because it talked about racism and how it should never happen again. I also liked this book because it was a mix of history and humor. This book was great with the idea of viewing it from the kids mind. I liked this book a lot and would recommend this to anyone who enjoys learning history and likes to laugh.My favorite part in the story was when Byron wanted to have his hair Mexican-style and gets it even when his parents don't like it. It was funny when his dad comes home and gets mad. He shaves Byron's hair off so that he looks bald."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"The book is about a family that has funny and very hilarious conflicts. Kenny, Joetta, Byron, and their mom and dad go through very interesting and scary adventures. As a vacation, the Watsons go to Birmingham to visit Grandma Sands ( Kenny's mom's mom ). There they experience one of black history's most davistating moments.My favorite part in the book is when Kenny talks about his old friend and him playing miniture dinosaurs wars. He is not his friend anymore because his old friend stole half of the one million dinosaur figures he has.Kenny's friend steals his toys by a very tricky and cunning way.First, they decide who is going to be the American dinos and the Nazi dinos.

Written as a comedy, it still successfully expresses not-so-light hearted points that are a part of American history. Funny passages, such as the ones that follow, are plentiful in the wonderfully written novel.\\"I moved closer. I couldn't believe my eyes! Byron's mouth was frozen on the mirror! He was stuck as a fly on flypaper!\\"Not to mention some of the more serious sections that address real-live problems:\\"I'd never been more scared in my life! I hollered, \`Momma!' My arms were punching the water like it was a person and my legs were going a mile a minute to try to get back to shore. But now even my toes couldn't find anything to touch.\\"The Watsons are a simplistic family of five, never touched by racism, until the day four children were killed at a segregated church.

It has a good story line with a wide variety of characters that keep the book colorful and filled with different points of view. The only reason I dont give the book 5 stars is the fact that segregation and the 1960s from an African American family never really sparked my interest. It is a topic that brings in many different points of view and debate, so i belive this book mainly teaches you about how awful segreation was and how hard it was to manage an African American family in the 1960s. All in all I learned a lot from this book and I hope that you do to."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"The Watsons Go To Birmingham-1963 was an excellent book.

This book though will probably be one of my most favorite books and will go at the top of the shelf.

We LOVE this book!"},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham-1963 by Christopher Paul Curtis is an historical fiction about an everyday family growing up in racially stricken Flint, Michigan. The story is written through the eyes of ten-year-old Kenny Watson, the middle of three children. The Weird Watsons, a nickname given to the family from the people of the community, consist of the father, Daniel, the mother, Wilona, and the three children, Byron, Kenny, and Joetta, Byron being the oldest. The Watsons Go to Birmingham follows Kenny as he experiences the torment of his brother Byron's bullying; finding a friend who doesn't criticize him for his lazy eye; discovering the true meaning of discipline; and ultimately finding out the hard way how serious the racial situation really was.This book brings hilarity as well as meaning to it, making it a fun and interesting read. It also brings out historical events that have made a huge impact on our society. I find that this book is not only informal, but it can also be related to some of our lives today. Sibling rivalries, family hardships, and maturation are all things that we go through, and the author does a great job of expressing these things. After reading this book, you will feel more informed on what it is that everyday families had to go through during these times, and you will learn to appreciate the changes that have been made to make the world what it is today."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"The Watsons Go To Birmingham-1963 is a good book. If you don't like realistic fiction books don't read this, but otherwise I thought it was a good book. Also if you read it you will kind of understand what it was like in the 60s and before. In the back of the book you can learn some civil rights facts and some poems about the bombing."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham - 1963This is a good book to read. The family goes to Birmingham because Byron keeps getting into trouble and plan to leave him with Grandmother. Once they reach Grandmother Sand's house it is Kenny who starts getting into trouble. He almost drowns but Byron saves him. A bomb goes off at the church Joetta is attending Sunday morning in Birmingham. She was not in the church at the time the bomb went off she had went outside for air. After the bombing the family heads home. Kenny struggles with what he saw at the church and Byron ends up helping him through it."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"The Watsons go to Birmingham - 1963 was a good book to read, but it would not be my first choice for content. The author wrote the book using vivid imagery when he retold the scene of the church bombing. As I read about the bombing I could visualize what was going on at that time. The author used enough details to describe what the church looked like after the bomb went off and how the characters reacted to the scene that the bomb created. Joetta was the only person who did not change her mood because no one told her what had happened. However, the author waited too long to get to this part of the book. He told about the Watson family and how they lived in Flint, Michigan during this time period. He often described how cold it was there. The author did include some funny parts. For instance, when Byron got his lips stuck to the side mirror on the brown bomber trying to kiss himself because he thought he was the best. This was funny because everybody reacted in a different way. Mom and Kenny were very worried, but dad was laughing hard because he had been through this before. It was also funny when Byron got a haircut that his parents did not approve of him wearing. Instead of the usual grouding or spankings, his dad made him shave his head. This caused the other characters to make fun of him. Overall the book was a good read, I just wish the end would have lasted longer or the author would write another book letting the readers know what happened to the family later on in their life."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"This book is a must read for people of all ages. The relationships and insight of an African-American family during the 1960's is exceptional. I highly recommend it for grades 3rd-8th."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"Birmingham, Alabama in 1963 was still troubled by the violence and was in the heart of the civil rights movement. The author has dedicated this book to four African American girls who died in the Church bombing in Birmingham of that year. The author in his first novel which is an impressive achievement writes about life in Flint, Michigan and growing up there in the wintertime in 1963. His mother would rather raise the family in the warm south, particularly her home state of Alabama. The book is really written for young adults but any adult can read this book and appreciate the realistic dialogue and situations of the Watsons, an African American family, in the midst of the Civil Rights movement."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"The Watsons go to Birmingham-1963 is a book you can stick to like peanut butter and jelly!This incredible novel is all set in Alabama. But the Watsons take a trip to the city of Birmingham, where their grandmother (Wilonas mother) lives.These characters that are starred in this comedy story. There's Kenny, Byron, Joetta, Daniel (dad), and Wilona (mom). Well let me tell you a little more about the \\"Weird Watsons.\\"First there's Kenny. He's the middle child. He's the one who gets messed with by his big bad brother Byron. He is also a very sharp kid. But I guess not so smart if he always falls for his retched schemes.Then there's Byron he's the really obnoxious one. And the thing I loved how the author makes him so real, I mean Byron thinks he's such a cool kid to even sit by his family. It's just like a typical thirteen year old.Next there's Joetta the small sweet one, not much to sat though.After its mom and dad. Wilona and Daniel Watson. They are the lucky parents with these kids.You know the thing I love about this book the most is how C.P.C puts \\"in memory of\\" and these little girls' names that died in the church bombing.

I suggest everone read this book.(And if you dont like this book you are a wendylicker)."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"This book tells a wonderful tale of an African-American family in the early 60s. Most of the book just reveals each family members unique personality and shows that this family really loves each other. Not wanting to spoil the ending, but hoping to warn parents, the book, near the very end, brings up important ideas about racial prejudices through the use of very violent, almost graphic descriptions of tragic events in our history. The author does a marvelous job of really making the reader fall in love with the Watsons family, so that by the time the main event hits at the end, the reader really understands the cruelty of racial prejudice. I really thought the book was great and that it the topic is something people need to learn about and understand. However, I would caution that this book might be too frightening and violent for younger children. I wouldn't recommend it until maybe the middle school level."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the family tale of the Watsons heading out to straighten out that \\"juvenile delinquent\\" brother of Kenny's as well as the aftermath of those appalling events in Birmingham at the time. The humor of the story served the shocking tragedy well, placing these horrific acts within the context of a family just living life and dealing with everyday issues.

Also, one of the funniest. There was one funny thing after another. First of all, Byron, Kenny's older brother does dumb things to put himself in danger. The big car they have called the Brown Bomber is not in good shape. Also they travel to Birmingham, Alabama, where some of the story takes place. It will jump back and forth once in while. The main characters in the book are Kenny, Byron, Mom, Dad, Joey, and Grandma Sands. The book's conflict was about how Byron gets in trouble all the time and for punishment he is sent to Birmingham, Alabama. On their way there, many conflicts and funny things happen. Like I said earlier, this is the best book I have yet to read. One reason why I liked it so much is that it takes place in 1963, when times were different from what they are now. Another reason is that it is funny, how they live and how they talk sometimes. A third and finally reason in that I can relate to it.

Not only does thus book have a good fictional story, it also incorporates a lot of history.

It demonstrates the triumphs and struggles of African American had to deal with. This book isn't just historical; in fact it's mostly fictional. This book can relate to any family.

This was one of the funniest books ever. At the beginning of the book it shows what it is like having a little sister that was the laughing stock in kindergarten, and an old car that needed some fixing up. These are two reasons why this book relates to me. Having people that teased or bothered me and knowing that I have best friends and family that I can count on is another reason why this book relates to me. The saddest part in this book is when the four little girls died in the church bombing. This was a great book and I enjoyed reading it. I hope you do too."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"I call the Watsons Go To Birmingham- 1963 an okay book instead of the best book I have ever read becuase I didn't like some parts of this book. This book was about a family that is going visit Grandma Sands. The charactors are Kenny, Byron, Joetta, Dad, and Momma. They are sending Byron to stay with Grandma Sands, in Birmingham, Alabama, because of all of his mischievous adventures from shooting down Natzi parachutists with his flamethrower of death to the time he dyed his hair.When they get to Birmingham they find it surprisingly hot. Byron's whole attitude changes, he saves Kenny from the \\"Wool Pooh\\" and doesn't make fun of him. On Sunday, Joetta has to go to Sunday school and her church blows up, but lucky for her, who she thinks is Kenny, guides her away from danger.

I ended up reading it in its' entirety, and thought it was an incredibly wonderful book for young adults. Christopher Paul Curtis writes in a lively, readable and understandable way, starting with topics that all kids can relate to: school bullies, a teasing older brother, and protective parents. He continues to weave into the story, and finally finishes with touching clarity the importance of a close family, love, and strong ties between siblings. He brings the reader through concepts of death, fear, humor, confusion, and love through the family's voyage to Birmingham, Alabama in 1963, and their inevitable journey to and place in the 1963 Church bombing which changes the Watson family forever. It serves as a horrible awakening to a 10-year-old boy to the horrors of racism, violence, and death. The changing relationship between Kenny and his older brother Byron that cumulates at the end of the book shows that family love can conquer anything is realistic, heartwarming, and not at all mushy. Throughout the book, the author writes through the eyes of a 10 year old boy, so it is quick, fast moving, and most importantly, not boring for kids to read.I intend to read the rest of his books. I would also like to see the author do some writing for adults-I for one hope very much that he does!"},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"The Wastsons go to Birmingham is a great book that I read in third grade and always made me laugh when they said whir poo when it was supposed to be whirlpool. I would recomend this book to any one who likes humor. This book is about a kid named Kenny and his familly who live in Flint, Michigian then go to Birmingham, Alabama. That is why I would reccomend this book to anyone I knew that liked humor.I give this book... 5 stars!!!"},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"\\"The Watsons Go to Birmingham--1963\\" is amusing enough that it's hard to see the educational value. As a sibling, I appreciated the conflict between Byron and the rest of the family. As a white person in the age of Affirmative Action and Jesse Jackson, I needed to understand the racial tensions, and the lack thereof. Whenever a new character entered the book, it took me several pages to remember that they were black. I realized that this is appropriate, because Kenny doesn't define people by their skin color. Later in the book, he realized that not everyone shares this view.Christopher Paul Curtis does a masterful job of portraying black society on the eve of change. While his work loses steam towards the end--the \\"Wool Pooh\\" business is confusing and detracting--\\"The Watsons Go to Birmingham\\" is worth reading thrice."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"I thought this book was awesome, it mixes reality with humor at the same time. I thought that this book kept me interested and curious. The characters seem like realistic people that made you feel like you were a part of the story. It also revealed the harshness that people had to bare during that time. It moved me emotionally and it made me laugh at the same time which is what a good book is supposed to do. I Feel this book is awesome and everyone should read it! Have fun!"},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"The Watson's Go to Birmingham 1963 is a great book. We really like the part when Byron got his tongue stuck to the rear view mirror of their car. They had to get warm water and it still didn't come off very easily. The story is from Kennys point of view. It also talks about how you need to be nice for good things to come. The Watsons family traveled by car from Flint,Michigan to Birmingham,Alabama. They went there at a time when white people hated black people and the Watsons were some of those black people. I learned a lot from this book and I hope you do to."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"I read six chapter books this summer and the Watsons go to Burmingham was my favorite.

The main characters are Kenny and Byron Watson,they face many conflicts in the book. Kenny is a 10 year old boy who is very intellegent for his age and gets bullied alot at school. Byron is a 13 year old who is nothing at all like his little brother Kenny he is a bullie and picks on Kenny alot. The two boys biggest conflict is racism."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"This book is the best! I thought it was boring at first so I put it down, but then I read it for my book project and it was great!It's about this black family that lives in Flint and it is freezing so they went to Birmingham. The youngest of the Watsons was in a church when it was bombed. It is a great book and I really recommend it."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"At the time of the Watson's family trip, the southern states were caught up in a struggle for basic human rights that became known as the civil rights movement. Although the Declaration of Independence states that all men are created equal and the Constitition had been amended after the Civil War to extend the rights and protections of citizenship to African Americans, changing the law of the land did not always change the way people behaved. This book here is a great way to introduce to students in grades 4-6 about how the movement began. It also illustrates how African American families lived in the north and south during this period of time. We feel that this is the most important theme from the book.The writer I must say does an excellent job in showing how African American families lived during that time through the eyes of young boy. Many things that the author wrote about were things that we actually thought about or experienced as children. I can not get over Byron getting his tongue stuck to the side mirror of the car. (...) Amber sees herself somewhat through Joetta because she was always defending for her sister when they were growing up.This book again was a good book to read but I recommend again that it be read by 4th, 5th and 6th graders."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"The Watsons Go To Birmingham was one of the best books I have ever read! Although it was a little confusing at times,I liked it very much.The reason that I liked it so much was because Christopher Paul Curtis took some real things and twisted it up a little.He mixed the real stuff with the made up stuff.By doing that,in my opinion,he just made it even better.The story made me realize that I'm not the only one with an, at times, wierd family.The book was about a normal family with a mom,dad,younger brother named Kenny,older brother named Byron, and a younger sister named Joetta. In this family,odd things happen like when Byron, also known as daddy cool, was kissing his reflection and got his lips stuck to the rear view mirror of the car.In addition to that,very intersting things started to happen while the family was in Birmingham.By the way,they went to Birmingham because they were going to leave Byron at Grandma Sands house. The things that happen in Birmingham vary from Kenny getting taken in by a whirlpool to a church being bombed.The way that the author of this book left you in suspense at the end of a chapter which makes you want to it read even more.I think that this book was worth the while to read it and was very good.Another thing that made the book so good was that the author mixed in all the different kind of emotions. In the story he put things that would make you laugh, cry, wonder, and even relate to your own life. If I could read this book over and over I would and I'm sure you would to."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"This book was very interesting. it was about a family who went through many problems in their time.As a normal family,they had a mom,dad,a sister named Joetta,and younger brother named Kenny,and an older brother named Byron.Thsi family has many problems like when Byron got his lips stuck to a car's rear view mirror because he was kissing his reflection. In addition,at the end of the book,when the family goes to Burmingham,to me, it was the most interesting part.Things that happen in Burmingham vary from getting caught in a whirlpool to having a church bombed.Although this book at times was sad,it was a very interesting yet,wonderful book.In my oppinoin,Christopher Paul Curtis is a very talented writer."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"This book is funny.

The way Christopher paul Curtis was able to take the life and events of a 1960's african american family and make a book showed the work of a genius. It is not often I can read a book and observe such vivid words that make such a point. Then of course the scenes he used made me want to keep on reading and not stop till morning. Almost unknowingly as I read I was taught about the true life of a family being perdecuted for the color of their skin.

This book is a masterpiece!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"The Watsons go to Birmingham was a great book. I thought that the most interesting part of the book was when the bomb was thrown into the church and they did not knoe what it was. When they found out it was the church they ran all they way down there and were very sad. When they got there they were to scared to go in to try to find Joetta. I thought this was an interesting part, because they were trying to get there as fast as they could to try to find out about Joetta, but when they did not know what to do. I thought this book had good potential and should be taught in a group to classes. If I had a choice I would choose this book because it is on of the most hilarious and entertaining books I have ever read.

Set during the Civil Rights Movement, the Watsons Go to Birmingham, tackles a serious time through the eyes of a not-too-serious family. Kenny, the younger brother is both smart and caring, while the older brother Byron is his exact opposite. Their brotherly relationship sets up for some hysterical adventures. The first chapter gives a tremendous look into the characters, and gives of the funniest story lines of the book. When vain Byron gets his lips stuck on the family's car mirror, the adventure has just begun. Through the well-rounded characters that Curtis created, both laughter and tears are ignited. This is an excellent book for teaching about character, bullying, friendship, family, and, of course, the Civil Rights Movement. There are many references to television shows of the time, as well as music, and the like. One concern of this book is the language, as it contains some curse words that parents (and maybe some students) may find uncomfortable."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"I just read this book to my 11-year-old daughter who laughed and laughed at the corny humor (I did too) and regularly begged me to keep reading when I was ready to take a break. She loved the characters and could identify with the love/hate relationship of the siblings--which was a key theme of the book, one that brought the social issue of the 1963 bombing to a personal level. My daughter didn't cry as much as I did during the excruciating emotional recovery of the narrator after the bombing (I could hardly even read), but she did feel the full impact of the admonition in the epilogue: \\"You must remember that these children [the 4 actual girls who died in the bombing] were just as precious to their families as Joetta was to the Watsons or as your brothers and sisters are to you.\\"Note: Indicating that there is a bombing in this book is not a spoiler, just as indicating that the Titanic was going to sink is not. This fictional book is based on an actual historic event."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"This is a very warm, youthful portrayal of an African American family and their experiences in Flint, Michiga and Birmingham, Alamaba. The book is jovial and centering on the theme of youthfulness, it also has some corny humor. It indirectly touches on racisim. This may be a good book to introduce young children to some of the social and moral issues pertaining to racism. Getting involved in the story naturally leads one to thoughts on racism, though rather indirectly."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"This is a great book for students at the middle school level. My students loved it and it was an excellent springboard to discussions on American history and terrorism in this country.

It's about a family who has a son thats a deliquent of Juvenile. He bullied kids around and he loved to pick on the main character (his little brother) Kenneth.

I encourage all of you to read it."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"This book is funny, expecially for kids. However, it has a deep meaning to it-that there is racism and injustice in the world.

It was a laugh out loud, funny book. Byron is a juvenile delinquent living in Flint Michigan with his brother Kenny, his sister Joetta, and his mom and dad. Byron is the school bully, known as the \\"King\\". He does a lot of mean things. For instance giving his brother face washes in the snow or pushing around other kids. Also I thought this book could have had more of an ending. I would have liked to have known how Byron got out of some of the mean things he did. Also about an incident that happened in Alabama. I would recommend this book to kids and adults 10 and above. There is some bad language from Byron. But most importantly there are some serious things about racism and segregation that you might want to talk about with an adult."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"In the book,\\"The Watsons Go To Birmingham, 1963,'\\" anything can happen, or anything weird can happen!

I rated this book four stars because it was very, very funny."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"The weird Watsons, the main characters of this story, definitely stick too their name. The Watsons go to Birmingham 1963, written by Christopher Paul Curtis is a well written, can't put it down comedy. If you've read any of his other books, like Bucking the Sarge, or, Bud, Not Buddy, and liked them, then you'll love this. This historical fiction book has won three awards, The Corretta Scott King award, the Newbery Honors award, and the IRA Young adults' award.The Watsons go to Birmingham is a story about a young boy named Kenny who always gets pushed around by his brother, Byron, and his friend, Buphead. Then, new kids start riding the bus, become friends with Kenny, and get pushed around just like him. Since By (Byron) was such a mean kid, his parents decided to take him to their grandma's house to get it all sorted out. Then, they buy a new CD player, called an Ultriglide for the long trip to their grandmas. The Watsons then head out for Birmingham, where many black people die from a bomb that was planted in a church, on Sunday, by white people. It was a sad and touching moment, but everyone soon gets over and heads home. When they get home, you'll never guess how much By has changed!The story is LOL hilarious, from funny chapter names, to just plain stupid ideas. The chapters have the weirdest names, like, Every Chihuahua in the World Lines Up to Take a Bite Out of Byron, or, (this one will get you) Nazi Parachutes Attack America and Get Shot Down Over The Flint River by Captain Byron Watson and his Flamethrower of Death. Byron himself even does stupid things. In one part of the book, he was looking in the rear view mirror of a car in negative 20 degrees Fahrenheit and tried kissing himself but, of course, he gets stuck. He would try to scare Kenny and Joetta, Kenny's younger sister, by saying that there was something called a wool pooh and it was Winnie the Pooh's evil twin brother.All of the characters are nice and excepting, except for Byron of course. Mrs. Davidson is a loving neighbor that gave Joey (Joetta) a toy angel for the trip to Birmingham. When the Watsons get to Birmingham, they meet a nice man named Mr. Robert. He then offers to take them to one of the best fishing spots in town. Once again, Byron thought he was helping his little brother, but was still beating someone up for giving people face washes. The Watsons send Byron to their grandma's house to straighten him up, and it really does change Byron.The Watsons go to Birmingham is one, no, the funniest book I've ever read. In every chapter, there is a part that your eyes water, you fly back, and you start laughing your head off. It doesn't have a whole lot of suspense, but it has just enough to keep you wondering. This book is good for probably 4th grade through adult. It's 4th grade through adult, because of some rude body language, and some mild language. It's a must read!!!"},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"How would you feel if you had to sit through a one thousand mile road trip? Well, that's what Kenny had to do in The Watson's go to Birmingham. The Watson's go to Birmingham was written by Christopher Paul Curtis. It has many awards like: The Coretta Scott King, The Newbery, ALA booklist, and more. Other books by Curtis are: Bucking the Sarge and Bud, not Buddy. This amazing book is historical fiction.Enter the hilarious world of Kenny, Byron, Joey a.k.a. Joetta, Mr. Watson, and Mrs. Watson. It starts out with a normal family called the Watson's that others like to call the Weird Watson's. Byron, who just turns thirteen, is officially called the teenage juvenile delinquent. Kenny finds Byron stuck to the side view mirror by his lips. Kenny has a normal life, he goes to school, makes a friend, and plays with plastic dinosaurs. Byron on the other hand plays with matches. One day Mrs. Watson gets a call from her mom saying that her and her family should come down to Alabama from Flint, Michigan, where it is zero degrees. The reader can experience life through Kenny's eyes on a one thousand mile trip.This book made me laugh. It was one of the funniest books I've read. Byron and Byron's friend, Buphead, were teaching Kenny how to survive a snowstorm by throwing him into the snow. Another part was that Byron messed up his hair by putting some sort of jell in it. So Kenny's parents had to cut it off. Kenny's dad sounded like me because he likes to joke around. Mrs. Watson calls it acting it \\"Acting the fool\\".I liked this book because it parts in it that made me happy. One of them was that Kenny has special rights because he has an older brother. Bullies don't beat him up because they know Byron will beat them up if they do. Another part was that Kenny made a friend. He usually doesn't because he has a lazy eye that every one laughs at.The Watson's go to Birmingham is a funny, entertaining, amusing, and suspenseful book. I would recommend it to kids in fourth through seventh grade. A parent could even read this book if they like funny things. This book is great to read aloud to a class. If you like books that make you laugh until you cry, The Watson's go to Birmingham is a perfect book for you."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"I think this book would be appropriate for children all ages.

As you read, you can watch the characters grow and change. Often, the author's dialogue makes you feel as if you are in the room with the people, and you can't wait to see what kind of exaggerated story Byron is going to tell next, and if there is any truth to it.

Byron, the oldest kid in the family is a juvenile deliquent and he wants to be cool. Kenny the middle aged child is well behaved and he respects the rules. Byron is always getting in trouble so his parents decide to take him to Birmingham to to stay with Gradnma Sands so she can straightren him up.

Was all of the sarcastic things. That Byron & Kenny said during the time they were up in the mountians and what all. That could be hiding out in the woods and how mama felt when Daniel the daddy went. Straight through Alabama instead of stopping like she planned the trip to be and they made it to Birmingham a day before they where to arrived.This is one of the best books that I have read and took the time to sat down and just read all of the pages."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"The book in general was a really great book.

I have learned a lot about this time period from this book. I know that this is an educational book, but i loved the entertainment in it also. I would recommend this for all the children to read this. Our teacher just said to carry on a conversaition with ourselves, but i think that i will add on a little bit to my favorite character's life-the whool pooh. I mean what if he really does exist? I believe that this character might be a just a little something that kenny uses to put some type of physical form on one of his biggest fears in a stressful situation. However, what if he was real? Do you think that his brother will ever accept him into his family and let him meet his friends in the hundred acre woods? This is a torn family. We need to help the poor Pooh family by sending encouraging letters to the both of them telling them how much we would like to see a family reunion. My closing words are, Winne, why so much anger to your twin he is only a mass murderer, or maybe you just were seperated at birth and you don't know that he exist?

It was a good empty though the kind that makes you think. I though about the reason and meaning of things in a more indepth way.While funny and entertaining it also invoked thought. I liked the way the author wrote. His style was cut to the chase with just enough detail to keep you turning the Page. The author decribed things in a way that painted a picture in your mind.It starts off a tad slow and it seems pointles to keep reading it but by the end I thought it was well worth my time.Though not my favorite book I would recomend it to anyone with the time to sit back and enjoy a lazy afternoon full of reading or a rainy day stuck in the house."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"I think the book is very educational and at the same time it is very funny in a couple of places of the book.I do enjoy the book, but sometimes the book just doesn't catch my attention and so it gets boring; for most of the time the book is very good. The best part of the book in my opinion is the chapter about the Wool Pooh. I enjoy when Kenny starts to act all big and bad and then he gets what he deserves by getting in a whirlpool, but Byron deserved it more than Kenny in my opinion. The most suprising event in the whole book was probably when Byron saved Kenny from the whirlpool, because I thought that Kenny was about to die for disobeying his grandma. I do wish that the book would of included some hunting events or sport events, but that is okay. The book I thought also went on and on and on for just one subject which I really don't like unless it is funny or interesting. I do think that the book was very good and I hope that the author keeps on writing as good as he has in this book, only he needs to write some sport books."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"I thout that the book was i prity good book and people shoud read this.

My preface is that we don't use profanity or even crude bathroom words in our home, however this book was recommended to me by a friend with the caveat about the language. So I read it before deciding whether to read it with my 10-year old daughter. She has just finished social studies units on the Civil War and the Civil Rights movement and has also written a report on Dr Martin Luther King, Jr. I thought this book might dovetail nicely with her school work.If you read other reviews, you'll see the book is written from 10-year old Kenny's perspective. His 13-year old brother Byron is a juvenile delinquent who has been held back one or two grades (his parents \\"never talk about it\\"). Byron is the \\"god of Clark Elementary\\" and provides some relief to Kenny has he is bullied by school kids, but has no trouble being cruel to him both physically and verbally. Yes, this is hard to read, but is necessary to the pay-off at the end of the book.SPOILER ALERT +++++++++++++++++++++++++Kenny's parents decide to drive to Birmingham, Alabama, so that Byron can live with their Grandma Sands, a woman they believe can straighten out Byron over the summer or the next school year. They've been threatening Byron with this for years, but his behaviors finally warranted following through on their threats.While they are in Birmingham, two things happen that change both Byron and Kenny. First, Byron saves Kenny's life and then there is a bombing at the church that their little sister went to for Sunday School.When Byron rescues Kenny, we see how panicked he was at the thought of his little brother dying. This is the first step in his transformation. When the Watsons return home after the bombing, Kenny is severely withdrawn and it is Byron who finally talks to him and brings him back into everyday life. Both of these events are show such a drastic change in Byron from a potty-mouthed brat wannabe to a young man who has seen senseless violence and has determined he doesn't want to go that route anymore.I started reading the book with my daughter yesterday after telling her about the bad words. No, we don't say those words in our house, but this book is worth reading regardless.

I would really reccomend it to anyone. Any not trying to be disrespectful or anything, but I really don't know what y'all were talking about for the language. I'm in 6th grade and pretty much all I hear coming out of kids' my age mouths is curse words. Seriously, there's nothing wrong about it. It just opens you up to what went on in that time period, and the curses, and \\"innapropriate terms\\" added a little dash of reality and humor into the book. I think Mr.Curtis did a fabulous job with the story, and I enjoyed reading it. My class actually got a read aloud version and it was funny, and just a great read. I think if it was a movie it would be, like, PG or PG-13, and hey, all you parents, and teachers, this book isn't that bad. You might see a couple \\"bad words\\" but just because we're kids doesn't mean we're babies. OPEN UP TO THESE TYPE OF BOOKS! I already read \\"teenage books\\" and see curses all the time. It's just a fact of life that they'll come up. The historical part was great, and all in all, this book was an awesome read.

Byron tends to say foul language a lot. The reason I rated it two stars, not one is because the bombing chapter was interesting, but confusing."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"In the Newbery Honor and Coretta Scott King Honor winning novel, The Watsons Go to Birmingham, a struggling family lives in Flint, Michigan, home of the author, Christopher Paul Curtis. While their juvenile delinquent son, Byron Watson, is gradually bringing his family members to the brink of destruction, a devastating event related to Civil Rights Movement pieces them back together. Believing his grandmother may be the only saving grace for Byron, the family embarks on a trip to Birmingham, Alabama.Told through the perspective of the middle child, Kenny details the daily life of the Watson family and the events they encounter. The two brothers experience normal sibling rivalry as they point out each other's insecurities, but are willing to take a stand against anyone else who tries to do so. Furthermore, they have a younger sister, Joetta, who plays the part of the annoying tattletale with innocent intentions.We enjoy how Curtis writes with such a strong, relatable humor. Byron's cockiness often leads to hilarious results in which the reader cannot help but laugh aloud. A prime example is when he attempts to kiss his reflection on a car window, but ends up freezing his lips to it instead. As future educators, we appreciate Curtis's understanding of his audience and how he purposely uses his humor to keep some of the deep subject matters found in the book from becoming too heavy for children to handle. While doing so, children are subconsciously learning a historical event and time. Also, The Watsons Go to Birmingham gives teachers an excellent way to introduce The Civil Rights Movement to their students.While in Alabama, the family is brought together through a serious of perilous events. Despite his grandmother's warning of the dangerous whirlpool, Kenny must decide whether or not it's worth the risk. His older brother Byron, now the voice of reason, tries to stop him. Will he listen? Later, Joetta's Sunday school class is bombed. Did she make it out in time? Brought together through these tragic events, the siblings must rely on each other for their survival."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"The Watsons go to BirminghamThe Watsons go to Birmingham is about a family that moves to Michigan from Alabama. Its 7 below zero there and they are mad at the dad for making them move there because its 70 where they used to live.I would suggest this book for 4th, 5th, and 6th graders for racial comments, cursing, and the reading level. This author really lived through this story and it was pretty much true. This is when people judged people by there color.You should read this book for more info. It's worth your time to read about your history."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"The Watsons Go To Birmingham - 1963 was a good book with some hilarious scenes. I think that Byron was the funniest in the whole book. The things that he did would almost make you laugh out loud. The first incident he had was that he was kissing himself in the mirror of their car called the brown bomber. It was cold so his lips got stuck to it. He also bullies his little brother named \\"Kenny\\" and some of the ways he does it is funny. He told Kenny that they picked up frozen people in the garbage trucks. He said that because Joetta kept griping because she wears so many clothes and she does not want to. He also tells Kenny there is something called a wool pooh that kills people by drowning them. The Wool Pooh is not real and it is really just a whirl pool. If you're looking for a funny book, this is one I recommend you read."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham -1963 By:Christopher PaulCurtisIf you're looking for a great book that you never want toput down, The Watsons Go to Birmingham is perfect. It is written by Christopher Paul Curtis. It's full of adventure, comedy, and tragedy. This book is based on the life of a black family in the middle of the Civil Rights Movement. The book is narrated by one of the young family members, Kenny.The family goes through many problems with Kenny's big brother Byron. Byron thinks he's so cool and thinks he can do whatever he wants including dying his hair, play with matches, and he does other stuff like kissing himself in the mirror. Kenny also has a mom who is very strict and a dad who is always positive. One more family member is Joetta. She is Kenny's younger sister and is very caring.One of the things we really enjoyed about this book was, that the author really expresses the character's characteristics.The theme of this story is based on the Civil Rights Movement and family. The book goes through problems in both of these categories. Such as, bombings during the Civil Rights Movement, problems with Byron and Kenny, and so many more usual, and some unusual, problems. Many of the Watson family members change during the story. An example of this is, Byron changed from a disobedient child, to a mature, young man full of respect. The theme of this book really expresses the authors feelings on family and the Civil Rights Movement. Christopher Paul Curtis is a great author and uses many different \\"secrets\\" to make his writing as good as it is. First of all, he tells things like they are. There isn't any fantasy in this book and you can relate to the story. The Watsons are just like any family. They go through difficult times and good times. Curtis also does a good job of describing the things that are happening. For example, he told in detail what happened after the church was bombed and what Kenny saw while he was in the church. Curtis has humor in his book too. This makes a big difference, because it makes the book more interesting by making you laugh. Sometimes he uses humor to describe. Like when Byron got his lips stuck to the rearview mirror and Kenny said, \\"...Byron's lips stretched a mile before they finally let go of that mirror.\\" One thing that we didn't care for about the book was that he didn't use any cliffhangers. We think that that is wanted in a good book, but otherwise it's a great book. We think Christopher Paul Curtis's life really relates to the book. Christopher Paul Curtis was born in the same place that the book took place, Flint, Michigan. He began working on the book The Watsons Go to Birmingham-1963 when he was in high school. He attended the University of Michigan, where he won the Avery Hopwood Prize for major essays and the Jules Hopwood Prize for an early draft of The Watsons Go to Birmingham. Curtis has won a Newbery Honor and a Coretta Scott King Honor for this book and it was named a Best Book of 1995. Christopher Paul Curtis currently lives in Windsor, Ontario, Canada with his wife Kaysandra, and children Steven Darrel, 18 and Cydney McKenzie, who's four. Can't you see how Christopher Paul Curtis's life really reflects on this book?The Watsons Go to Birmingham is a great book that is worth the reading. We would rate this book an eight on a scale of one to ten with ten being the highest. We would rate it this because, the author has well-developed characters, great describing and really expresses his feelings about family and the Civil Rights Movement You learn many things from this book about appreciating your family and will learn that you never know what you've got until it's gone."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"In 1963, I was a white kid attending a predominantly black junior high school in Seattle. &quot;The Watson's Go To Birmingham-1963&quot; rings true to what I saw and experienced in those days.It's true that this story doesn't have much of a plot in the usual sense, but then how many families have lives that are neatly plotted out? Instead we see episodes in the life of nerdish Kenny Watson, his older brother Byron who is always getting into trouble, his little sister &quot;Joey&quot; who is a little angel, their Momma who still has some of the old South in her, and Dad, a loving, but sometimes stern, man.This is an important piece of historical fiction. It shows an intact African-American family, struggling with many of the same things families of other races were dealing with in those days, however one is given a taste of their fear of racial violence as Momma and Dad plan--and take--their trip into the deep South to visit Grandma Sands during those turbulent times.This is an important book, but one I can only recommend with reservations. Some of the situations, and more especially some of the crude language used by Byron and his friends, would cause me to give it a PG rating. I think it's unfortunate that some authors of children's books think it's OK to use language that most educators are otherwise discouraging students from using."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"This was a great book about racial injustice and family. Although it was set in the '60's,the story felt just as real as if it were occuring right now. It was very funny,especially when Byron got in trouble for staging WWII battles in the bathroom and got his lips stuck to the car mirror. When I read the book in reading period,I often began having laugh attacks and had to cover them with fake coughing spells. I understood Kenny's depression after the bombing. However,the Wool Pooh scenes were vague. Who was he really? What about Kenny's vision? Overall,though,this was a wonderful,entertaining book. It conveyed the message of racial tolerance without preachiness and showed how alike we all are inside."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"I bought a whole set of the Watson's Go To Birmingham to share with my students. Knowing it was an award winner and covered the topic of racism, I was counting on a delightful read. By the end of the first chapter, I felt like I had a gem. The writer is clearly a master story teller. I laughed along with the characters as the two brothers and little sister tortured, tricked, and mocked one another in the typical way siblings do. I loved Mamma and Daddy's playful comments and the way the entire family was portrayed as colorful, real, and multidimensional.Therefore, it may surprise you that I don't read this book in class. I was overwhelmed and disappointed that a gifted writer chose to use so many curses throughout the book and so many sensitive topics. There are over ten examples of the children using foul language. Two ten year old boys get excited about going to the club house to look at books of 'nekkid' ladies and remark that the older brother keeps some copies of such materials in his own bedroom for he and his friends. Also, Dad puts his hand on mom's chest when he think his children don't see (which Kenny does).I'm a teacher. I work with children every day. I'm not blind to the fact the our children see these things on TV, encounter them in the home, and even come across them on the school field. However, as one who believes we should do better by our children, I am disappointed by the material Curtis has chosen to include in his work. Seeing descriptions in print and visualizing the pictures in the mind (which is a great aspect of books) is very powerful - even more so, I believe, than on TV, which children have learned to tune out. As an educator, I refuse to have my students visualize the things Curtis includes.Too bad because it would have been a great book."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"The Watsons Go To Birmingham-1963 is an awesome book. The story is told by the eyes of a boy named Kenneth Watson. He and his family, Byron, Joetta, mom and dad live in freezing Flint. They decide to go to Birmingham because of Byron's behavior. Byron was pretending to make a movie called Nazi Parachutes Attack America and Get Shot Down over the Flint River by Captain Byron Watson and his Flame-thrower of Death. He made a lot of toilet paper parachutes and would light them with matches and then drop them into the toilet and hear the go whoosh when it hit the water. The main setting in this book is in Birmingham and in the Watson's house. While at Birmingham the kids learned a lot about the cruel world back then. One of the things that they learned was that some and most whites hate black and will do anything to stop them from getting a good education. Even blow them up if that is a choice. Which it was a choice during the Civil Rights movement. One day when Joey was going to Sunday school, she got there and decided not to go since it was so hot. A couple of minutes later a group of white men drove by and threw a bomb into the church and injured and killed many little kids. This book was an awesome book and I recommend this book to everyone young to old. I feel that it would be a great thing for people to read it was funny, sad, and happy and almost every emotion you could think of. I hope you get something out of this review and enjoy this book as much as I did."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"Book Review For Watsons The Watsons Go to Birmingham-1963 is a fascinating story about a family during the Civil Rights Movements. Although the story dates back in history it is very interesting. The story was written by Christopher Paul Curtis. Important events occur not only in this family, but also others. The following will tell more in depth about the story. First, the beginning of The Watsons Go to Birmingham-1963 is in Flint, Michigan. The Watsons are different than the other families in the community. Momma and Daddy decide to go to Birmingham, Alabama because of Byron\`s miss behavior. They are planning to leave him down there for the summer, and make even leave him through a year of school. Byron is astonished to learn this! After racing back from Alabama Kenny is surprised find himself in the World Famous Watsons Pet Hospital. It shows real creativity how Mr. Curtis makes this family, and sets their story during the time of the Civil Rights Movement. The book makes me realize what was going on at this time. Next, Christopher Paul Curtis does a great job on picking the characters actions. He makes the book fun, interesting, and unique. In this book, the Watsons are a family of five. Joetta the youngest of the family is a cry baby and tattles about everything. Kenny who is the narrator of the story and also the middle child, likes to look up to Byron his older brother. Kenny also likes to do the right things and is self conscious. Byron the oldest of the children has bad choosing of friends and likes to pick fights. He gets into a lot of trouble. The family mother does not like when her family members go out and buy stuff with out telling her, and is very strict. The family father is also very strict and thinks his car is the most important thing. He is also the humorous character in the book. Then, have you ever wondered what it would be like when blacks (colored) and whites were separated by segregation- in schools, bathrooms and drinking fountains, and more? If you want to know, then I would say The Watsons Go to Birmingham-1963 is a good book for you. The book is very factual. It is full of humor, tragedy, and happiness. The book is very detailed. The book does not keep you on your toes on what is going to happen next. Next, The Watsons Go to Birmingham-1963 is Christopher Paul Curtis' first published book. While in his twenties he practiced his detailed writing by sending love letters to his now wife. For example \\"Dad was doing his best not to explode laughing. Big puffs of smoke were coming out of his nose and mouth as he tried to squeeze his laughs down. Finally he put his head on his arms and leaned against the car's hood and howled.\\" That is an example of his detailed writing. He has a wife Kasyandra and two children, Steven and Cydney. Steven is twenty-one and Cydney is 7. They make up the family that encouraged and gave him a year to see what he could come up with. That year he would get up at 5 am. At this time he would revise his earlier days writing. At 8 am he would head to the Children\`s\` Library. What he wrote was higher than his family\`s expectations. The Watsons Go to Birmingham-1963 received many awards including the New berry Honor, Correta Scott King Honor, and ALA Best Book. I think the book deserves all of these honors for many reasons. One of these reasons includes that he has very detailed writing. For example, he can change a boring car ride to three chapters of fun filled delightful time. For some final information, if you read this book, we will say that you will want to keep on reading to you get to the end. It might seem like it starts slow, but it really does get better. There are a ton of events that happen before the climax does. When you get to the climax, you will think one thing happens, then another thing happens that changes the whole story. In a way you think you might know the ending, but the author has a different ending. All in all, the book is very interesting. If we were to rate it from the worst book we have ever read at one star to the best book we have ever read at ten stars we would rate it with a nine star. We say this because the end of the book really did not explain much on what happened later on when Joetta might find out about her miserable past. The Watsons Go to Birmingham-1963 is very fascinating and informative on what happened during the Civil Rights Movement."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"This book was a great tribute to the four littl girls thatt were killed in the bombing in Birmingham, 1963. I was a little confused as to how Joetta (Kenny's, or the main character's) little sister escaped from the bomb. I was also confused by the &quot;Wool Pooh&quot;, but my curiosity to comprehend kept me involved in the book. I loved this book, and in fact, a friend and I are recommending it in our school newspaper for the people of the world. I loved the book! I think that there should be a sequel. Keep writing, Christopher Paul Curtis! And I'll keep reading!"},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"This novel, a Newbery Honor book for 1996, consists of two very different parts.In the lighthearted beginning of the book, Kenny and his quirky family, the Weird Watsons, have a series of funny adventures in their hometown of Flint, Michigan. Kenny's older brother, Byron, provides much of the hilarity, from his sub-zero mirror-kissing fiasco, to his ill-fated attempt to consume an entire bag of stolen cookies. However, some of Byron's stunts cross the line between innocent hi-jinks and juvenile deliquency, and the Watson parents decide to intervene. They arrange a trip to visit awe-inspiring Grandma in Birmingham, Alabama. The Watsons set off in their car, equipped with an Ultra-Glide record player and all the latest tunes.Until three quarters of the way through the story, the tone remains lighthearted. Shortly after the Watsons arrive in Birmingham, though, Curtis changes gears. The event that causes this rather abrupt shift is the bombing which killed four young girls in a Sunday school class. The story's mood becomes dark as Kenny grapples with the deaths, and the existence of evil in the world.Although I recognize the importance of including the serious event, I confess that I did not enjoy Curtis's writing as much after the change in tone. Overall, though, I really enjoyed this book for its fascinating characters and funny adventures."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"Much like Curtis's other hit, \\"Bud, Not Buddy\\", \\"The Watsons\\" explores the everyday life of African Americans in Flint, Michigan. Also like \\"Bud\\", the book has probably garnered some criticism for its portrayal, or lack thereof, of active racism. No character in this book ever confronts an actual racist personally. Though the boys attend public school, there isn't even the slightest indication that Flint was any different then than it is today in terms of racial strife. The family does stop briefly in Appalachia, fearing unseen racists in the woods about them, but that's the closest any plot point comes to it. Just the same, the action in these stories is concerned primarily with the interactions between family members, and I am reluctant to criticize Curtis's choice of dramatic tensions. This is a story I've never seen told in a children's novel, let alone told so well. The character of By is more than just a two-dimensional bully, and the stories are downright fascinating in a couple instances. Finally, I appreciated that the narrator is affected realistically in reaction to the 1963 Birmingham church bombing. His nervous breakdown is done with dignity. I've only a small qualm with the unexplained event of the boy's sister claiming he drew her out of the church before the bombing. What does this mean? It's left unclear, though By makes it perfectly obvious that no supernatural occurrence has taken place. This book would either pair well with other stories taking place in 1963, \\"Through My Eyes\\", being only one example. It would also pair well with some sort of a buddy story like the \\"Soup\\" books. Or it would go well with \\"Stories Julian Tells\\", as a series of tales that take place between brothers. Reading this book aloud would also work very well. Because of its humor, it's a wonderful story."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"This book is about a family that have fun, but also have problems.. .

I read just a few excerpts to my 9 year old over the summer and plan to read it to him in it's entirety this school year. However, as I read some of the funny parts of the book to him, my 13 year old daughter overheard us and joined us on the couch. She tells me her fifth grade teacher had read it to the class and the kids loved it. Anyway, after I'd read the funny part to both of them, she grabbed the book and ran off to her room to re-read it. She loves to read and so I like to keep quality books on hand. I know one reviewer didn't like the use of bad language used by the teenager, Byron, in the story. Let's be real, this is how many teens talk with their friends and at school and I found it made Byron more realistic as a character. If teens aren't talking like this at school then they're certainly hearing it all around them. Shame, but, that's the world we live in."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"I really enjoyed Christopher Curtis's glimpse into the lives of an African American's family in the U.S. during the turbulent 60's. His book reflects a strong loving family with a sense of humor and loyalty to each other and also zeroes in on the effects of the racial prejudice in Alabama during that time period. Being that the 60's was the time of my childhood, I especially enjoyed all the references to TV shows, music, and other icons of that decade, like \\"The Miracle Worker\\", \\"The Magnificent Seven\\", \\"Felix the Cat\\", \\"Beany and Cecil\\", \\"Under the Boardwalk\\", \\"Betty Boop\\", \\"King Kong\\", and so many others. It's a must-read, especially if you're from that era."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"I'm a teacher (30) who pre-reads all of the books that go on the shelves in my classroom.This one was astonishing. I read books of this level by the truckload, and find many that have won awards without reason. This is not one of those books.I can't think of a book I've read (maybe Where the Red Fern Grows) where you care more about the characters than I did in this story. I loved the mother. She is written so well, described exactly and portrayed with such honesty and wit.The other family members are distinct and memorable. Probably we all pick, to love, the one most like us. Each scene begs to be identified with well beyond class and race and home town. I found myself retelling parts of it to other adults I was so pleased to be reading something I enjoyed so much.I also invested in the story line. I recognized the significance of the dedication at the beginning, linked it to Kenny's little sister, and was tormented by the events that I knew were coming.Won't spoil it.Kids: read it.Parents: read it.Teachers: This book has two \\"hells\\" and an \\"ass\\" in one chapter, but I'd say they are firmly explainable and more than appropriate.

Very important topic for everyone to explore, though it will never be fully understood."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"Lots has been said already...My take: This book has won so many awards that I had very high expectations. I did find that this book offered numerous openings for important discussions, such as being black in the north and the south, racism, the church bombings and other history, bullying, snitching, and the \\"code,\\" what it means to be a family, or a friend, growing up, and more... Many good teaching moments! Plus, I liked the basic story (stories.)However, the writing really disturbed me. I found myself rereading numerous passages trying to understand what happened. I felt like the author left out too much information - not that the reader needs everything spoon-fed - more like missing information. I simply felt confused at many parts of the book. My son, who read this for school, also mentioned that parts were hard to understand.The confusion started at the very beginning, as the author was trying to describe, a few times, the order the family was sitting on the couch in. I never could figure that out. There were more instances throughout the book, but the most glaring example was towards the end. I read the relevant parts numerous times, but still have no idea where Joey was during the bombing or afterwards - what she knew and when she knew it...So, a mixed bag."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"This is a great book about a young boy named Kenny who has trouble with his older brother that is a juvenile delinquent efficiently. I thought that the story was a little slow paced when the family was on the road trip on their way to Alabama to see their strict grandma Sands and leave Byron there for the summer. Momma and Dad had had enough of him getting in trouble. Once the family arrives in Alabama the pace picks up a lot more and Byron learns that family and love are the most important things that anyone could have! The author made you feel that tense and scary moment of the bombing of the Sixteenth Avenue Church in Birmingham and the four little girls that were killed. I would recommend this book to readers that don't mind crying."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"My 11-year old son recommended this book to me and he's right, it's a winner.The voice of Kenny, a 4th grade African-American boy living in Flint, Michigan in 1963 is strong, smart and funny. Through the opening chapters we get to know Kenny and his family. His mom is a transplant from the Deep South, which is the first way that his family (Dad, Mom, brother Byron, sister Joey) stand out. Kenny himself is different due to a lazy eye and his exceptional smarts. Whether it's avoiding the school bully, befriending the new kid at school, or making sure his 'friend' doesn't steal all his toy dinosaurs, Christopher Paul Curtis shows us a family and an era. These everyday occurrences, told so skillfully through the eyes of Kenny, lead to a final step - driving south to Birmingham, Alabama. This is the height of the civil rights movement. The family experiences the unrest and is forever changed.This is an uplifting story about family set against a dark time in our nation's history.

The author's ability to convey aspects of African-American family life in an urban, Flint, Michigan, setting is fantastic! Adolescent and teen readers learn what was cool among then urban &quot;black&quot; teenagers through self-absorbed Byron's adventures. He does everything from 'conking' his hair against his parent's wishes to skipping school and setting fires. Teens can understand this black family's values given the control the strict parents try to have over Byron's behavior. They decide to go south so that the grandma can 'take him in hand'. Many of the episodes are hilarious, others sad, and all are engaging. Teen readers will become acquainted with groups and events from the 1960s American civil rights era through the events of Kenny's life. Just like today's teens and pre-teens, Kenny and Byron are portrayed as well-rounded characters with emotional challenges that they must overcome as they mature. When the KKK bombs a Birmingham church, Kenny's fears of unseen threats become real. Young adult readers will enjoy this book because the protagonist is in their age group. Those from other cultural backgounds will enjoy the exposure to the working class, African-American experience. The author skillfully interweaves historical aspects of American culture into the plot. Older adults will appreciate the book as they reflect on past experiences. Educators will enjoy Curtis' adept use of the language in a story that offers many avenues to teach history, English, social studies and other subjects.

Kenny Watson liveswith his mom and dad, older brother Byron, and little sister Joey in Flint,Michigan. Through the eyes of Kenny wesee the lives of an African American family living in the time of the CivilRights Movement. The story sheds lighton the difficulties of growing up with a disability, and also a young adult's struggle to accept the changes that come with age and responsibility. When the Watson family decides to go toBirmingham tragedy strikes, and what is truly important becomes all tooclear. This story is a perfect exampleof the trials and tribulations faced by many families of the time, but alsodemonstrates the unexpected happiness that life can bring.In the cold townof Flint, Michigan the \\"weird\\" Watsons live a relatively normal life. Like every family they have theirproblems. Mrs. Watson is foreverplagued by the cold northern weather, and dreams of the warm days back in herold home of Alabama. Kenny has a lazyeye and is constantly tormented for this. His only defense against the other kids at school is his big brother,Byron. Byron is the \\"popular\\" kid atschool, even though he has been held back several times. He is looked up to for his age and becausehe seems to be so tough. In hisparent's eyes, however, he is quickly on his way to becoming a juveniledelinquent. When Byron has finallypushed his parents to the end of their rope, they decided to take Byron toBirmingham to live with his grandmother for the summer. Suddenly the Watsons have entered acompletely different world. Whitepeople look at them like they are inferior or lesser people, and they are onlyallowed to use certain facilities. When white activists bomb the Avenue Church in Birmingham, the Watson'sworld is turned upside down. Only time,love, and trust can heal some wounds.Kenny Watson wasextremely intelligent for his age, and this only added to his problems. He was in the fourth grade, but often didwork at levels beyond his grade, which made him a prime target forteasing. He was continuously made funof by the other children because of his eye. This story is a good example to show that children can get past physicaldisabilities. Kenny's self-confidencegradually grows with the support of his family, and especially his brother,Byron. He learns to deal with the otherchildren, and get on with his life. Ibelieve that this is an extremely important lesson that is useful to allpeople.Another reason Ithink this was a good book was the way it used humor. At one point Byron was looking at himself in a car side mirror when he decided to kiss himself because he was so beautiful. The only problem was that it was freezing outside and his lips got stuck to the mirror. Throughout the story the author introduced events and descriptions thatmade the story much more appealing. Humor from a child's view can be a very difficult thing to do, andCurtis does this well. I also thought that Curtis did a good job incorporating a serious historical time with the humor. It gave the writing a variety ofemotions that left the reader feeling as though they had truly experienced those events.The Watsons Goto Birmingham-1963 is a very well written story that people of all ageswould enjoy. This charismatic story is a book I would recommend. The characters will charm you, and as they experience joy and sadness you will feel their emotions with them. Curtis does a great job of entertaining his audience while dealing with an important historical time period for ourcountry."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"If you like funny and realistic fiction you will like this book.

This story is told through the eyes of ten-year old, Kenneth Watson. Kenny lives with his family, Byron, Joetta, mom, and dad in freezing Flint, Michigan. Later in the story, the Watsons decide to travel to Birmingham, Alabama because of Byron's mischievous behavior. When they reach Birmingham, Kenny and Byron have semi-adventures that make them realize that life isn't always fair and pleasant. Christopher Paul Curtis made the Watsons seem realistic and ordinary. Unlike some families you see on television, they aren't always so happy and cheerful. Kenny has his problems. For instance, his brother Byron is mean to him, the other kids tease him about his lazy eye, and that he's smarter than the rest of the class. This isn't a cursed family either. The Watsons have their happy times too. For example, when Daniel, Kenny's dad, got a record player for their car, the Brown Bomber. Byron is one of the most comical characters in the book. Once he made a movie in the bathroom called, Nazi Parachutes attack America and get shot down over the Flint River by Captain Byron Watson and His Flamethrower of Death and ended as, Captain Byron Watson Get Shot Down by the Evil Snake Woman and His Own Flamethrower of Death, and this is just one of them. After his mom told him not to play with fire again, she swore that the next time he plays with matches, she was going to burn his fingers. If it wasn't for Joetta, Byron's fingers would've been charred. Also, not all of the events in the book are realistic fiction. When Joetta's church was bombed, Curtis mentioned that four little girls were found under some cement and bricks, dead. This made me realize that almost anyone can go outside into the world and make a difference. In conclusion, I give this book a five-star rating because it was comical, tragic, and the theme teaches you a very important lesson. Plus, the epilogue in the back of the book tells more about the Civil Rights Movement if you want to learn more. I hope you'll enjoy The Watsons Go to Birmingham- 1963 as much as I did!"},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"This was an incredible book with a wonderful introduction that made you want to keep reading.

I am very uncomfortable with the enthusiasm with which the book embraces violence as a staple of black family life. There is a chapter about a bully who does a \\"Maytag wash,\\" scrubbing his smaller victims with snow and then flinging them against a chain link fence - apparently meant to be funny, but my audience of ten-year-olds just looked puzzled. In another chapter, the mother approaches naughty brother Byron with matches, Vaseline and bandages, intent upon burning his fingers as punishment. Fortunately, sister Joetta blows out the matches - also meant to be funny, I guess, but it is difficult for me to see the humor in child abuse. I might concede that this book is a valuable illustration of a particular time in history, but the Birmingham experience is overshadowed by the portrayal of African Americans as stupid and scary . . . not the lesson I had hoped for."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"The book was hard to put down.It was unbeliveble.

Levar Burton does an excellent job narrating. The story was humorous, and yet, sad in places. There are a lot of morals that come in to play--also, a lot of consequences for choices and actions one makes. There are many situations for the listener to think about and make for family discussions about rights,wrongs and social injustices. The only objection I had to the tapes was the use of profanity by Byron Watson. Even so, I explained to my 12-year old that Byron was, afterall, a &quot;juvenille delinquent.&quot; One definitely can develop empathy for the characters in this story and relate to some of their situations."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"It all starts when Byron decides to keep burning those matches.

Kenneth and his family take many risks including driving through the night trying to get to Birmingham instead of stopping. Some other examples are how Kenneth almost gets sucked into a &quot;Wool Pooh&quot; and how Joey almost dies in a fire. All in all I enjoyed this book very much and will read it again.

The book tells a real story of a family who moves to the southern states and sees how different their lives change, and the lives of how their family lives in the south. The book is truly a winner.

I know I can because everytime my family went on vacation my dad would fix up the car before we would leave. Curtis does a nice job of tying in The Civil Rights Movement even though he does not come out and say it, an example would be when the Watson's thought Joey was at the church when the bomb went off.

I reccommend this book to anyone who is looking for an interesting, entertaining, easy-to-read book."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham is a wonderful story about a family in Michigan during the Civil Rights Movement. The family survives tragedy and humiliation. Each character in his book has a different personality and all the personalities put together make a usual family. I think that some of the most interesting and hilarious things in the book are the characters. They are a huge part of the story. Byron, Kenny's thirteen-year-old brother(an \\"official juvenile delinquent\\"), absolutely adores himself. \\"You know what square? I must be adopted, cause there just ain't no way two folks as ugly as your momma and daddy coulda give birth to someone as sharp as me!\\" says Byron on page 8. Byron is extremely comical. Kenny, the narrator of the story, has a lazy eye and is made fun of at school all of the time. Kids call him poindexter, professor, and egghead. Kenny really dislikes Byron and he hates how his sister Joetta always stands up for Byron.(Kenny dislikes Byron because Byron always makes fun of him.) Joetta who is Kenny's little sister tries to act like her mom all of the time. Mrs. Watson has a southern accent so Joetta would sometimes talk in a southern accent too. Joetta kind of favors Byron. Mr. Watson, Daniel, is also comical and makes fun of Byron a lot. He calls Byron \\"Daddy Cool\\" because Byron thinks that he is so cool. Mr. Watson is very nice though. He is always there when his family needs him. Mrs. Watson, Wilona, is kind of harsh. When Byron was playing with matches, Mrs. Watson tried to burn Byron's finger. Joetta jumped out and protected Byron so that Byron didn't get burned. At the beginning of the book, Christopher Paul Curtis creates Byron as a rude, misbehaved thirteen-year-old. Mr. and Mrs. Watson decide that they should bring Byron to Grandma Sand's house for the summer... or as long as it takes for Byron to behave! Kenny pictured Grandma Sands as a tall, strong, mean woman. She ended up looking like a miniature Momma, but her skin was wrinkly. Christopher Paul Curtis is also good at writing about tragedy. He wrote about the sixteenth street church bombing in this book. He wrote about how everyone in the town heard a \\"boom\\" and the town became frantic. People ran left and right, screaming about whether or not their child was dead or alive. Four unfortunate girls were not so lucky. They were killed in the blast.(Addie Mae Collins, Denise McNair, Carole Robertson, and Cynthia Wesley) The Watsons Go To Birmingham-1963 is a story of courage and despair. I think that Christopher Paul Curtis' message in this book is that life and your family and friends are the most precious things that you can find. I think that the book is absolutely terrific. I give it five stars."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"I liked The Watsons go to Birmingham because it made you laugh in about every sentence! For example, when the Watson kids called their brown car &quot;the turd on wheels.&quot; I think the author made the book like it was real. I think the book made you feel like you were in the setting because of all the details. I gave this book four stars because I didn't get the part about the Wool Pooh, Winnie the Pooh's evil twin brother. Besides that, it was great! My favorite character was Byron who thinks he's too cool for anybody. I would recommend this book to you because of all the humorous moments!"},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"THE WATSONS GO TO BIRMINGHAM 1963If you think your family is strange, then you haven't met the Watsons. The Watsons are a black family that lived in Flint Michigan in 1963. At that time there was a lot of discrimination. The book is about how the Watsons take a trip to Birmingham to visit their Grandma Sands. In the story they survive the Sixthteenth Street Church Bombing.Humor is one of the keywords in this book. In the novel Christopher Paul Curtis relates some of the humor from his life. For example, when Byron, the brother of Kenny kisses himself on the cold mirror and gets his lips stuck. In real life Christopher Paul Curtis had a friend go out in winter and start the car, when he started the car, he saw himself in the windshield.He kissed himself and got his lips stuck to the freezing windshield. The author also connected his own life to the book alot. Christopher Paul Curtis grew up in Flint Michigan and knew what it was like to be a black at that time. He also connected his own life to the book. For example, the Watsons went to Clark Elementary School. In real life Christopher Paul Curtis went to Clark Elementary School. We also connected our own life with Kenny's, Nick and Kenny have somethings in common. We both have a younger tattle tale sister. We both get made fun of at school, him because he reads well and I do because I'm short.Chris and Kenny do not have much in common.Chris is not made fun of as much as kenny.Also Chris has a younger brother not a sister. In conclusion I give this book five stars. I think that it was a grrrrrrreat book because it was fun to read and we could not put it down."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham-1963 By Christopher Paul CurtisIf comedy, tragedy, and humiliation is what you are looking for in a good book, I can guarantee you this is the one for you! Christopher Paul Curtis does a wonderful job making the Weird Watsons in The Watsons Go to Birmingham almost come alive. Some of the hilarious incidents in this book happened in his life, like the setting begins where he was born. And the school Kenny went to is the school he went to for grade school. So because of the way he related his life to this kooky family, this magical book received two major awards; the Newberry Honor and the Coretta King Honor. Byron Watson is the best example of Christopher Paul Curtis's funny side. The way he makes Byron so full of himself that he gets in trouble is just hilarious. For example, when he dyed his hair red because he thought it looked cool, when he got his head shaved it was really funny. And when he lit toilet paper parachutes on fire and dropped them into the toilet, the chapter ends by saying, \\"Captain Byron Watson Gets Captured and Buried Alive by the Evil Snake Woman with his own Flamethrower of Death.\\" So as you can see, even though this ends in a tragedy, it does have some funny lines. But one really great thing Christopher Paul Curtis does is he lets the characters in the book tell the story of the terrible tragedy in 1963. The way he writes makes the Watsons come alive and really gets you into the book. When you normally read about American history, it really depends on the person you are, but most people find it just a little boring. And it gives you a sense of feeling like you were really there and it happened to your family. It makes this novel so much more interesting. Another great thing the author does is dialect and choice of vocabulary. When you read it, it feels like you are really there in the room as Byron is getting yelled at for his hair. It makes you feel like you are really there when you read about the look on Kenny and By's faces when they realized By killed the bird. Curtis makes you feel like you are there in that important point in history and are feeling the family's pain during the bombing. The dialect is so important and adds color to the story. So if you are looking for a book that you just can't put down without reading another chapter, this is the book. It will remind you of how racist people can be and how it effects the people who are different. This is a GREAT book and I would give it four out of four stars. That is how much I like this book and would highly recommend it as a trade book in the classroom, or reading it just for fun. Whatever the case may be this is a wonderful book and I suggest you should read it. You will get a lot out of it."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"In 1963, Kenny Watson and his family from Flint, Michigan, decide to go to Birmingham for a family vacation. This book entails the journey, but more importantly, it is a perspective of the life of the Watsons. Even though they are black, they are the ideal American family of the 1960s. As seen though the eyes of a fourth-grade boy, Kenny, the book is funny, innocent, true to life, and often quite profound. Kenny's point of view makes this book a great one whether the reader is eight years old or 80 years old. There are many levels upon which this book can be enjoyed, and personally, it was a true delight to read."},{"Title":"The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963","review":"For me, this book was a break from having to go into definite deep thought.

The way Curtis wrote made you not even realize that the family was even black until the end. I would recognize the fact that people of all ages, genders, races, and religions would enjoy this book."},{"Title":"XENOGENESIS","review":"In a world devastated by nuclear war with humanity on the edge of extinction, aliens finally make contact. They rescue those humans they can, keeping most survivors in suspended animation while the aliens begin the slow process of rehabilitating the planet. When Lilith Iyapo is \\"awakened, \\" she finds that she has been chosen to revive her fellow humans in small groups by first preparing them to meet the utterly terrifying aliens, then training them to survive on the wilderness that the planet has become. But the aliens cannot help humanity without altering it forever. Bonded to the aliens in ways no human has ever known, Lilith tries to fight them even as her own species comes to fear and loathe her. A stunning story of invasion and alien contact by one of science fiction's finest writers. Ingram Known for her African-American feminist perspective, the author presents the first installment of a trilogy exploring the death of the earth as we know it and the advent of interbreeding between humans and extraterrestrials. ----In this sequel to Dawn, Lilith Iyapo has given birth to what looks like a normal human boy named Akin. But Akin actually has five parents: a male and female human, a male and female Oankali, and a sexless Ooloi. The Oankali and Ooloi are part of an alien race that rescued humanity from a devastating nuclear war, but the price they exact is a high one--the aliens are compelled to genetically merge their species with other races, drastically altering both in the process. On a rehabilitated Earth, this \\"new\\" race is emerging through human/Oankali/Ooloi mating, but there are also \\"pure\\" humans who choose to resist the aliens and the salvation they offer."},{"Title":"XENOGENESIS","review":"...and that's saying something. This was my introduction to Octavia Butler and what an introduction. This edition was the collection of three novella's previously released by Butler (Dawn, Adulthood Rites and Imago) and I believe this chronological collection is exactly how those books should be read--as one continuing novel. The collection tells the story of the salvation of mankind after it nearly destroys itself in a nuclear war. But that salvation comes at a price that may mean the extinction of the human race as we know it to make way for something new. I think Dawn, the first section, is the strongest of the three but that's like saying which of these three masterpieces is more beautiful? I pick this book up again and again over the years and never grow tired of it. It has been re-released under the title \\"Lilith's Brood\\" but the cover art for Xenogenesis is by far the more telling. This book is how science fiction should be done. In this Butler schools them all."},{"Title":"XENOGENESIS","review":"I loved this book. I can't wait to dig into the next book in the sequel. The story was fascinating.Butler was a wonderful writer.

Instead, readers who complete the book will find Alexandra Mosca to be a talented, sensitive and seasoned writer who has the ability to evoke emotion from the most hardened of souls. Mosca, a licensed and practicing funeral director, gives us a mesmerizing glimpse into the inimitable world of funeral service in New York City. The early portions of her spellbinding autobiography include admirable insights into the hardships and indignities she endured some years ago as a female apprentice and young funeral director. Mosca clearly understands how difficult it truly is for an \\"outsider\\"- someone who doesn't originate in a wealthy funeral service family- to enter and survive in the funeral service profession. She decidedly has a flair for describing her years of difficulty and adversity. Blended with her extraordinary adventures as a Playboy model, the second half of Alexandra Mosca's tale clearly uses striking philosophy and allegory as she describes how she matures into a caring, thoughtful and professional funeral director.Final analysis: This is a \\"must read\\" for anyone interested in, or currently working within the funeral service or allied professions. Do not dismiss this fine effort because some of the truths about greed and malice in funeral service surface in its pages. Mosca realizes, as many of us do, that serving as a funeral director is a true gift. \\"Grave Undertakings\\" shows us all that Alexandra Kathryn Mosca was blessed with other gifts. She has the ability to be a stunning model who is inherently more attractive inwardly. Mosca also displays a tremendous talent to describe her life experiences in a book that you absolutely will not be able to stop reading once you begin.

I sometimes laughed so hard at some of her stories, I cried.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who would want an insider's view to the funeral industry. Contrary to what one might believe, there are so many bizarre and amusing stories. The interactions, customs and odd requests are amazing. I would encourage anyone to get a copy (or two or three) so that they too might experience Ms. Mosca's journey as a pioneer in the industry.

These facets include a stint with Playboy, acting roles in community theater, and writing assignments for popular funeral trade magazines. I am excited to see that these journalistic adventures have led Ms. Mosca to the writing of a new book, this time, about one of the most famous cemetaries in the country.

Alexandra Mosca's true life story tells of the uphill battle to be accepted and licensed by her peers. The \`formaldehyde curtain' is parted as we learn about the \`long secretive' profession of caring for the dead, the proper etiquette for services and final disposition. Ms. Mosca is not only a educated, skilled and respected funeral director-she has both acting and modeling credits to her name. Beautiful lady that she is, also takes us behind the \`scenes' of a Playboy feature photography session. This is another part of life that people always think they know so much about and are so misinformed!For anyone interested in today's modern society, the funeral directing profession and the autobiography of a gutsy, tenacious lady with lots of moxie-this is a perfect read. As a former funeral director, the story is accurately told with finesse and shows how a caring and well trained director takes care of their (her) clientele.Among her many talents, Alexandra has honed her writing skills and funeral industry education to become a leading feature writer in many funeral trade publications.This is a great book that is interesting, well written and captivating.

However this is not a new theory at all. In 2005, the Washington Post published an article \\"Many Blacks Cite AIDS Conspiracy\\" stating that almost half of black Americans believe that AIDS is a man-made disease, and that 15% believe it is a form of genocide against blacks. AIDS Exposed was published in 1996 and questions many of the pillars of the widely accepted AIDS canon. Unlike many of the other \\"conscious rasta reports\\", AIDS Exposed seems to be aimed more at a general public audience rather than militant afrocentrists.Keidi Obi Awadu believes that AIDS is a umbrella term for a handful of unassociated diseases. Therefore if there is no single AIDS virus, it is impossible to treat or eradicate the disease because research will necessarily yield inconclusive or incorrect results. So for example, somebody could have one AIDS-labeled disease, but may be treated for a totally separate illness. Another issue Awadu mentions is that of the \\"false positive\\", meaning that someone can be diagnosed with HIV and not actually have AIDS. Naturally this will cause the diagnosed to submit treatment, with potentially ghastly results. On page 18 he states that \\"no matter whether the test is accurate or not (...) anyone who begins the standard AIDS treatment of AZT, DDI, DDC and D4T will most likely succumb to an acquired immuno-deficiency within 3 years.\\"The most popular \\"alternative theory\\" of AIDS is that HIV doesn't lead to AIDS, or that it is unrelated to AIDS. The majority of this booklet is devoted to some aspect of this notion. There is an article on the accuracy of HIV tests and not one but two articles critiquing the HIV/AIDS connection. One article entitled \\"Exploding Five Major Myths About AIDS\\" contains a lot of useful information, but avoids taking a firm position on the issue with regard to the origin of AIDS.Although Awadu doesn't explicitly say in this booklet that he believed that AIDS was created to kill blacks, he says on page 45 of his bookletRap, hip hop, & the new world orderthat \\"the AIDS epidemic is a hoax which is really disguising the manmade medical/pharmaceutical and environmental catastrophe of the 20th century.\\" The next obvious question is why anybody would want thousands to die of a disease that won't be cured. Awadu writes that:\\"The so-called human immunodeficiency virusquite likely has little to do with these diseases.The AIDS Hoax is a massive conspiracy betweenthe U.S. national security establishment (and itsglobal allies), government health agencies, theAmerican Medical Association, pharmaceuticalmanufacturers, the research establishment,corporate media, population control agenciesand numerous commercial interests. This cabalis motivated by greed, power, racism, politicsand barbaric self-preservation and is able tofunction solely because of the ignorance of agullible public.\\" (pg. 20)The final article addresses the AIDS death of rapper Eazy-E. The article almost entirely consists of questions about Eazy's ties to counterintelligence projects, luciferianism, and the nature of biowarfare. While some of the questions are interesting, this text weakens the overall credibility of AIDS Exposed. The article \\"Inquiry into the Death of Eazy E\\" also appeared in Keidi Obi Awadu's booklet 'Gangsta Propaganda: Attack on the Youth' in 1995.My own opinion is that this booklet does a good job of pointing out inconsistencies in officially-accepted AIDS research, but doesn't conclusively demonstrate that HIV and AIDS are unrelated. Nevertheless, more than a decade has passed since this booklet was published, and this theory has become more popular over time. AIDS Exposed is an interesting time-capsule of AIDS heresy before the widespread availability of the internet.Here are some of the books referenced in this booklet:AIDS, Inc. by Jon RappaportAIDS Hope Hoax and Hoopla by Michael Culbertthe AIDS Warby John LauritsenDeadly Deceptionby Dr. Robert E.

I recommend this book highly."},{"Title":"The Actuality of Atonement: A Study of Metaphor, Rationality, and the Christian Tradition","review":"As an engineer, I found Gunton's writing style verbose, unconcise and difficult to read. Frequently, I had to read sentences several times just to understand what he was saying grammatically. Even after understanding him grammatically, I often felt like he was describing a fuzzy and unclear periphery to his theology, rather than describing the core of it explicitly. I have read more scholarly books that are presented much better.The book primarily draws on the works of other people, and Gunton highlights aspects of their ideas as he sees fit. However, I was left at the end of each chapter still waiting for any real content from the author. It seemed dry and tedious, with no useful insight.To his credit, Gunton seeks to deal fairly with the views he investigates. It often seemed that he devoted much time to relatively minor points, while when it came to important aspects of doctrine he glossed over them with words like \\"obviously...\\", \\"clearly...\\" and \\"the fact that...\\". He certainly does not outlay a cohesive view of the atonement in a logical manner. In some cases, his logic seemed circular - e.g. that the words used to describe the atonement are themselves defined by it.There was little consideration given to recent scholarly developments, which he often simply glossed over with phrases suggesting they were wrong and needed to be \\"defended against\\". There is only limited use of Scripture, but even when used it is often out of context and somewhat glossed over to provide superficial evidence in his discussion.I found nothing new in this book, and would not recommend it."},{"Title":"September 11, 2001: American Writers Respond","review":"September 11, 2001 American Writers Respond is a compilation of musings written within days of the worst terrorist attack in U.S. history, making this book a gem for its timeliness. The contributors express in poetry, essay, letter and other forms of composition the thoughts and feelings they had regarding the horror of that day of infamy. With over 120 writers included, the impressions encompass a spectrum of opinions and feelings. It is safe to say there is something for everyone in this book. The entries range from serious realism to fantastic prose, all relating to September 11, 2001. The writing is flawless and stimulating, both for its originality and for the variety of emotion the pieces create.Now that almost two years have passed since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, it is interesting to read the book and remember the misconceptions and rumors that were reported on the news or written in magazines and newspapers right after the attacks. No one knew at that time what the long-term effects would be on the nation. Writers predicted events that have not happened. Reading their forecasts now is amusing and sometimes sad. It recalls our naivety before the loss of innocence.Above all, this book is a montage of American thought. Readers will find a voice that echoes their own. One will take note of new friends, but carefully walk around those who reflect an opinion too far from their own. It is a timely book, but a monster in the closet. One must choose wisely when to take it out, for it will make even the most callous reader remember, reflect, and react to that awful September 11th."},{"Title":"September 11, 2001: American Writers Respond","review":"although i'm sure this anthology will be used in classrooms across the country, i love it because it puts poetry back in the hands of emotional people. from well-respected writers such as John Updike, W.S. Mervin, AI, Wendell Berry, and dozens more to writers for whom this marks their first publication, these essayists, poets, and writers of hybrid forms of letters and fiction talk about September 11th in personal terms that, because they are so candidly offered, provide insight and consolation for all of us, anyone whose tv flickered for days while the towers fell, fell, fell. some of the writers were there, some knew someone who was, but they all react as if they felt that collapse in their teeth."},{"Title":"September 11, 2001: American Writers Respond","review":"September 11, 2001: American Writers Respond is a carefully put together anthology dealing with the attacks on the World Trade Center. This compilation contains pieces written by over 100 different authors and its diverse contents allow it to appeal to a variety of people.Stylistically it is difficult to describe September 11, 2001: American Writers Respond because the genre is so widespread. The anthology includes poems, essays, short stories, fictional stories, non-fictional stories, letters, and poems-the list could continue. Each author has their own style yet the pieces have a way of fitting together and creating an amazing collection of artist's reactions to the events on September 11th. Authors like Daniela Gioseffi makes the reader laugh because she writes about an entertaining (and touching) conversation she has with a nine year old girl while authors like Fred Moramarco makes the reader cry because the contents of his poem include the final conversations of September 11th victim's lives. The different authors attempt to affect the reader in different ways creating an extremely effective anthology.The pieces in the compilation of writings are arranged in alphabetical order by the author's last name. This unoriginal organization is actually a very effective technique used by the editor, William Heyen, because it leaves the reader in anticipation of what is left to come. Heyen could have organized the anthology by grouping similar pieces together but this option is undoubtedly inferior to his choice of arrangement. Because every author has a different point of view and style, the reader has no idea what to expect when they begin the next piece in the anthology. The reader may find two poems similar in content back to back, or an essay followed by a memoir with contents differing from one extreme to the next. The anticipation that builds within the reader regarding the content of the upcoming pieces makes September 11, 2001: American Writers Respond a book that people do not want to set down.It is impossible to read September 11, 2001: American Writers Respond without questioning your own view on the attacks. The anthology represents an abundance of different points of view. From Muslims to Christians, Middle Eastern people to American people, presidential supporters to presidential protestors; every view is represented. One of the most amazing things about this collection of writings is the wide range of feelings it produces. There are pieces like \\"the window, at the moment of flame\\", by Alicia Ostriker, that produce feelings of anger and disbelief in many readers because it blames the Americans for the tragedy. There are also pieces like Richard Wilbur's \\"Letter\\" that produce nationalistic feelings and recreate a true sense of love and pride for America. A person's opinion of the nation and the attacks prior to reading September 11, 2001: American Writers Respond will definitely be challenged because of this book. Pieces such as \\"America United\\", by Ishmael Reed, force even the strongest supporter of the government to reevaluate the strength of our leaders and, consequently, take a second look at their own view on the matter. Initially some of the pieces included in the anthology may produce feelings of rage because the point of view of the reader and the author differ greatly. One of the things that make this anthology as effective as it is, however, is that the differing opinions (regardless of who the reader is) will be retaliated by another piece somewhere in the book. The anthology contains such a large variety of pieces that it is impossible for a person to not be able to identify and agree with at least one of the pieces.It is inevitable that the attacks on September 11th had an affect on every American, but what is not as certain is the effects that it had on people other than Americans. September 11, 2001: American Writers Respond helps prove that the attacks were not simply an American tragedy, but rather a world tragedy. The anthology contains non-fictional stories such as \\"Sisters\\", by Karen Blomain, in which two American sisters are spending an ordinary day shopping in a flea market when the attacks occur. In this story the tragedy brings the American sisters together to mourn with Russians, Koreans, Latinos, and Indians. Many of the authors that are included in the anthology come from different cultures. The ability of this one book to cross cultures and force any reader to see the impact the tragedy had on people other than Americans is simply amazing. After reading this book it is impossible for a person to see the attacks as affecting only Americans, but instead the book forces readers to have feelings of empathy and respect for other cultures.September 11, 2001: American Writers Respond is one of the most moving and motivational anthologies of today. Although the attacks on the World Trade Center occurred almost two years ago, it is still hard for people to cope with the tragedy. Books like this one help people (both Americans and non-Americans) deal with the truths of the attacks and come to the realization that they are not alone in whatever they are feeling. The amazing thing about September 11, 2001: American Writer's Respond is that it has the capabilities of touching every single person's life because of its diverse content. In a time period as dangerous emotional as this, people need to find a place to turn when they feel that there is nowhere left to go. Thankfully this book can be that place for anyone."},{"Title":"September 11, 2001: American Writers Respond","review":"I seldomn read.

The poets/writers in this compelling collection of responses to the horror of that day chisel us a foothold, a starting point from which we can begin to collectively understand ourselves in relation to our new community - shared angst as sinews. Not only is the book stuffed with peice after peice of gripping and devastating prose and poetry, it lives as one entire work. Each stands as a new brick in our hopeful and sometimes pessimistic reconstruction. William Heyen is our Master Mason. His selection of contibutors and subsequent arrangment of their words allows us to tread for a while with them and then with our own bombarded constitutions.Heyen has brought together the big names, the poetic underground, and the gristly spine of the writing community. This book should be on all of our shelves as a peice of living national histroy, and in the reeling hands of all school children."},{"Title":"September 11, 2001: American Writers Respond","review":"This collection needs to be on our shelves for a long, long time, as we come to understand and articulate what occurred in New York and Washington, DC, on September 11, 2001. The book is more powerful than many other books on the subject because it's a collection of many voices and because these are the voices of people who devote their lives to writing, to finding language that captures a moment or grapples with an idea.Moreover, this book isn't just the usual, big-name authors, though they are represented well by Wendell Berry, Lucille Clifton, Diane Glancy, Maxine Hong Kingston, Ishmael Reed, John Updike, and others. Some of the best--the most delicate, the most demanding--writing in this anthology is by relative unknowns. Nancy Kuhl's piece obsesses on the numbers, on their truthfulness and their discrepency. Richard Deming writes of the inadequacy of normalcy, the role of television, and the theory of language. Al Hellus, like a friend of my own, states \\"It was my birthday.\\" Bruce Mills explores the ways in which we understand space and perspective as we look to the horizon. Almost every writerly voice matters here.Indeed, this text would be a good one for high school and college students. Really, though, it's for all of us. This collection by American writers at a particular moment will serve as an intellectual, emotional, and artistic resource for years to come."},{"Title":"September 11, 2001: American Writers Respond","review":"The events that occurred on September 11, 2001, changed the history of the United States forever. No longer are Americans fearless of other world powers, no matter how large or small, but now Americans are to some degree living in fear. Terrorist attacks can happen again today, tomorrow, a month from now or a year from now. There is no way to plan for the unexpected, even though cautionary levels are through the roof. The outcome of that fateful day changed American attitudes. The hatred felt toward the U.S. was overwhelming. I believe that if it would have been possible, there would not be a single American man, woman or child alive to tell the frightening tale. The history of the U.S. changed that day, and luckily, there is people left to tell about it and share stories and emotions.Following Spetember 11, 2001, there has been numerous literary works that have popped up about the issue. One of these works is by William Heyen and is called September 11, 2001 American Writers Respond. This literary work is an anthology of 127 American writers that responded to the tragedy. The anthology is a collection of fiction writings, essays, and poetry and prose. What is amazing to me is that these writers were able to respond at all. Following the events, there was numbness throughout the U.S. Mass confusion and hysteria was going on. No one knew for sure who was involved, who was killed, or what the meaning behind the event was. It was as if, for Americans, the world had stopped moving for days at a time while they watched over and over again the planes crashing and the towers falling.For months afterwards, news headlines and magazine covers were filled with pictures and stories of people's experiences and thoughts. This is what September 11, 2001 American Writers Respond is all about-experiences and thoughts. The stories and prose included in the anthology are by various writers throughout the U.S. and vary in length, depth, and character. This may be the only downfall of the anthology. If there was some uniformity to the pieces, I believe, the anthology would be much stronger. Nonetheless, the fact that the writers were able to capture their thoughts and emotions during this chaotic and emotionally charged time is all that matters, because these thoughts and emotions are exactly what everyone in the U.S. wanted, and in some ways needed.Americans couldn't get enough of others thoughts and were also eager to share their own. Most of the pieces in the anthology explore the meaning behind the events, such as what does this say about humanity, what does this say about everyone's sense of well-being and why is the U.S. so hated. Some explore what should be done as a counterattack, and other simplier pieces, recollect what a particular writer was doing at the time of the incident. The reaction of the people to this tragedy is similar to when Kennedy was shot or when the U.S. first landed on the moon. Everyone talks about what they were doing. Curiosity is great but it is more than simple curiosity. A uniting of the nation came to pass, and the people want to feel as though they belong, as though they all shared a common experience and grew as a result of that experience. This also is what the anthology does for the reader.One piece that particularly grabbed my attention was by Antler, and was taken from Skyscraper Apocalypse. The lines that made me grasp the events in a different light go as follows:Have the winds blown enoughthat by now all of us have breathedparticles of the burned-up corpese?Sooner of later all of us will inhaleinvisible remains of the incinerated victims...I had never thought of the events in this light. Living in Wisconsin, and not knowing any victims, made me disengage myself from the tragedy in some ways. My life wasn't changed in a drastic manner so I didn't think about it constantly. However, when I read these lines, and I think that at this very moment I could be breathing someone's remains, makes me look and remember the tragedy in an altered way. This is also a major part of the anthology, looking at others perspectives and making them part of the larger picture. The people that lost their lives were live human beings, and even if I didn't know them, their death does make a difference in my life.Overall the anthology was well put together. The writers all had something intellectual to contribute and did so in a meaningful manner. It is a mixture of works that makes the reader feel the tragedy all over again yet, at the end there is hope, even though nothing has been resolved at the time the anthology was published. The anthology's greater purpose, I believe, is to console and also to share thoughts and emotions, which at a time like this, as any psychologist would say, is very crucial."},{"Title":"September 11, 2001: American Writers Respond","review":"September 11, 2001: American Writers Respond is a collection of voices of well-known authors along with lesser-known authors who are just as effective. The authors, including award-winning poets, teachers, professors, war veterans, and Pulitzer Prize winners, try to express themselves to help readers deal with the events of September 11th. It is an assortment of powerful poetry and prose mixed with gripping letters and short essays.The book, arranged in alphabetical order by author, is a candid set of thoughts and feelings that the authors experienced during the days following September 11th. The various backgrounds of the one hundred plus authors are evident by their written thoughts and expressions about the September 11th tragedy.The best pieces in the book are the one's where the authors decided to express themselves through poetry. There are two poems that stand out to me. The first poem is \\"Monday Sundown\\" and is part of a collection by Lucille Clifton titled \\"9/11/01 - 9/17/01.&quot;i bear witness no thingis more human than hatei bear witness no thingis more human than love&quot;It deals with the two major emotions felt during the tragedy-love and hate. Those emotions are exactly what every American was dealing with after September 11th. We hated the people responsible for the attacks, but loved everyone who passed away or was lending a helping hand. The second poem in the collection that moves me is Lucien Stryk's \\"Quiet, Please!\\" It contained a verse that September 11th survivors could understand and quite possibly, help put their thoughts into words.\\"down the stairs. Survivalheaps dead flowers into sleep.Keep still. I think I'm dreaming.\\"The piece in the book that is both my favorite and most personal is coincidentally is not a poem. It is Karl Elder's short essay titled \\"The Silence.\\" I must make a note that Karl Elder is a professor of mine at Lakeland College, but I have no bias as Elder's piece deals with the exact same experience I had. He writes about a Green Bay Packer's football game played at Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wisconsin just 13 days after September 11th. He describes how his Iranian friend, now a United States citizen and also a professor at Lakeland, is treated as he enters the famed stadium. He illustrated his feelings as the game wore on. The funny thing about the piece is that I enjoyed it without having to completely read it. I attempted to read it five times before I could make it through without daydreaming of that night. Elder's piece took me back to that game on September 24th.The piece transported me to when I was standing in the long lines before the game and how I actually asked God to protect us that night. I thought of how I took my Green Bay Packer hat off during the Star Spangled Banner because I wanted to show respect for the nation and not just because it was routine. It recaptured the eerie feeling I had about halfway through the second quarter when I realized that an important football game was nothing more than a distraction for the events in New York. It brought the chill back to my neck as I remembered when Chris Gizzi, a reserve linebacker for the Packers and an Air Force reservist, led the green and gold from the locker room under a banner of red, white, and blue. It reminded me of the time when the crowd chanted \\"USA, USA!\\" and I finally realized what patriotism felt like. And lastly, \\"The Silence\\" took me back to the drive home when my brother-in-law (a volunteer firefighter) and I had an hour-long talk and not once brought up the Packers.The book is being used in my class at Lakeland College, but it is unlike any textbook I have ever read. September 11, 2001: American Writers Respond is not facts and figures, but a book that brings back many of the same feelings that were felt on September 11th-fear, sadness, confusion, and disillusionment. The stories of September 11, 2001: American Writers Respond, told through the words of the book's brilliant contributors, are not meant to inform or entertain, but as Elder's \\"The Silence\\" took me back, the pieces evoke one's own remembrance of September 11th. Through the works in this book, I began to understand the feelings I felt after September 11th.Every reader that reads this book will be transported back to September 11th. Whether the reader was watching the events unfold on television or from a New York rooftop, September 11, 2001: American Writers Respond will cause the reader to remember how they felt. That is why Americans should buy the book and the personal remembrance of September 11th is the only reason necessary to buy it. After reading September 11, 2001: American Writers Respond readers will place it on a shelf or a coffee table, but they should never leave the stories far from their conscience."},{"Title":"September 11, 2001: American Writers Respond","review":"This compilation, by a huge array of authors, unites each and every one of us in grief.

But in at least three directions Hesse has given me plenty to think about and purely enjoy, and this book documents everything... maybe it slights the drawings a bit, but there's another book out there with nothing but drawings, drawings galore. The implications of what Hesse accomplished remain &quot;mindblowing.&quot; Anyone who has only heard about her or seen one or two works needs to see what they've missed."},{"Title":"Eva Hesse","review":"I have this book and I love it. You are given a glimpse of the New York art scene in the 1960's and get a feeling of what it must have been like during that exciting period. In fact, it's a little scary to imagine being around during that time, kind of overwhelming. Conceptual art, pop art, Andy Warhol, the whole psychedelic hippie scene. But oddly still a man's world, for all the miniskirts and 'free love' hype. Her contemporaries were pretty much all men, and the women tended to be more like sidekicks and dilettantes. (Not to take anything away from male artists, that's just the way it was at the time.) The end of Eva's marriage, to another artist, seems almost a given once she really started to come into her own right. It must have been kind of lonely, men were probably threatened by the idea of a female artist, or maybe it was just that she didn't have time to find the right person in her short life. Also, at the time there was much less awareness of toxicity in art materials both traditional and non-traditional. I have to admit I'm fascinated by the romance of this heroic figure producing art despite the cost to her personal life and health. I don't see her as a martyr but as a brave pioneer who left us with beautiful art. Many of Eva Hess's sculptures were made using ephemeral materials but this book has pictures of them when they were new. Even if the actual sculptures don't survive, the image of them will somehow continue to survive, maybe with the help of virutal reality technology?

I've read quite a few WWII to the present submarine books, and this one did not disappoint at all.Although not a submarine man himself, Captain (later Rear Admiral) Gallery commanded a hunter-killer force of surface ships and carriers in charge of tracking down German U-boats. Although the cover of the book makes it sound as if the focus of this work is on the capture of the U-505, it really is much more than that (in fact, the capture itself doesn't even begin until chapter 17!!). It talks about almost every aspect of WWII submarine warfare. I really appreciated the fact that he managed to inject a very human touch to sub operations, describing what life was like on submarines, their history, the commands etc. He described just enough technical details in order for you to understand the basic science in sub design. A number of submarine books, especially the more recent ones) have tended to get bogged down by excessive technical fineprint. If you're like me, and are more into the human/adventure/historical aspect of submarines, you'll really love this book.Like a true sailor, Captain Gallery has a deep respect for all those who have served at sea, even when they happened to be wearing the enemy uniform. He gives credit where credit is due. There is no excessive jargon in this book. The author is very direct in his language, which added to the honesty of his words. The only parts that I didn't care too much for were when he gets a little &quot;preachy&quot; in professing his complete faith in the divine, but thankfully that's not a huge portion of the book at all.I finished reading this book within 2 nights. You'll come away with a deeper appreciation of the brave men who served on submarines during WWII. You'll understand the reasons behind the decline of the U-boat campaigns as the war dragged on. It's a great read!"},{"Title":"Twenty Million Tons Under the Sea: The Daring Capture of the U-505","review":"The men of a Hunter-Killer task group keeping the sea lanes clear for the Allies in 1944 meet up with one of Hitler's dreadedUboats off Africa in this factual and entertaining read by the commander of said task force, Capt. Daniel V. Gallery. The Navy's version of a renaissance man, Gallery demonstrates by his own personal history during the war (as well as the history of the U505)that there are no accidents in wartime, merely opportunities lost or gained. I would heartily recommend Adm.Dan's book to those in high school or above who might notknow this bit of naval history, who enjoy the sea, and who honorthose (as Adm. Dan did) who \\"go down to the sea in ships\\".

Consequently I suspect their names are pseudonames. My guess is that Richard Wyckoff is one of the authors. But maybe not.The reprint includes a foreword by Don G. Worden.The first ten pages alone are invaluable, covering training, ignorance, intuition, mental equipment, study, planning, paper trading, etc., not in some superficial and useless way, but providing practical advice that you can use.Chapters cover- market manipulation and how to recognize and take advantage of manipulation;- recognizing stages of accumulation and distribution, then how to use that to your own advantage;- tape (time and sales) interpretation;- and so on.The authors first give you concepts and reasoning, including recognition and interpret them, then tell you how to apply all of that, in practical, specific ways.Even if you have many successful years trading and investing, this book is worth reading at least once yearly!"},{"Title":"THE FLICKER'S FEATHER","review":"Longmans, 1953, 1st; 220 pp. Juvenile hardback.

(edited by Jessica Amanda Salmonson) is a curious fantasy antique, the winner of the 1979 World Fantasy Award for a short-story anthology that still offers some decent reading (outside of the editor's long, intrusive commentaries). It contains:* The Dreamstone, C.J. Cherryh: a nicely written, if slowly paced, tale of the haunting faerie, Arafel* Wolves of Nakesht, Janrae Frank: visceral, swords-against-sorcery tale starring the fascinating Chimquar the Lionhawk (a woman usually mistaken for a man); more background as to the setting and culture would have helped ... and perhaps this is found in Chimquar's collected tales (In the Darkness, Hunting)?* Woman of the White Waste, T.J. Morgan: unremarkable revenge tale* The Death of Augusta, Emily Bronte: excerpts from a heroic poem by Bronte; either filler or a scholarly addition to the anthology, depending on one's perspective* Morrien's Bitch, Janet Fox: mediocre tale made engaging by its shocking anti-heroine* Agbewe's Sword, Charles Saunders: very good quest-tale set in a mythic Africa; one of the best tales here* Jane Saint's Travails (Part One), Josephine Saxton: a bloody mess (one part too many); the editor included it to diversify the book, while at the same time defending her choice: \\"zealot loyalists [will] condemn the piece as polluting heroic fantasy with higher ideals of breadth and experimentation ...\\" While not a zealot loyalist, I simply found it bizarre and unclear.* The Sorrows of Witches, Margaret St. Clair: decently written but distant and forgettable tale of necromancy* Falcon Blood, Andre Norton: long and descriptively vague tale of a girl shipwrecked with a man from a misogynistic culture* The Rape Patrol, Michele Belling: not quite as horrible as \\"Jane Saint\\" but equally out of place; some women in a contemporary city become vigilantes and hunt rapists (and one uses voodoo to qualify it as fantasy)* Bones for Dulath, Megan Lindholm: the utterly determined heroine Ki stalks a monster in a desperate effort to save her dying lover, Vandien; a true sword-and-mind-against-monster tale, and one of the best tales here--and the most unjustly introduced. In a highlight of the editor's intrusiveness, she spends a paragraph explaining how she almost chose another story over this one. Fortunately, justice has been served, as this was the first published story by the popular author now known as Robin Hobb. (Her first novel, Harpy's Flight, concerns the meeting of Ki and Vandien.)* Northern Chess, Tanith Lee: Jaisel, a tomboy-swordsman extraordinaire, aids a camp of knights against a seemingly unbreakable curse; although the plot is not especially innovative, the setting, descriptions, and characterization made this my favorite in the anthology.* The Woman Who Loved the Moon, Elizabeth Lynn: lovely tale in an Asian setting, though I had to raise my eyebrows at the editor's prophecy, \\"If only two stories in this book prove long-standing classics of fantasy, [this] will be one.\\" (Why only two? And please tell me the unnamed other wasn't \\"Jane Saint\\"!) A satisfying, bittersweet conclusion to the anthology.Overall, an uneven collection worth browsing by dedicated fantasy fans, feminists, and those interested in the history of fantasy. Recommended as a library loan or dirt-cheap used purchase. Three stars."},{"Title":"Amazons! (Amazons! High adventure in heroic fantasy by Andre Nortton, C.J.

But, SURPRISE, Richard Hall paints a colorful historical picture of many patriotic and dedicated women who, in a period in our country's history dominated by hoop skirts and constricting corsets, secretely traded their hoops and corsets for military battle uniforms. Disguised as men -- the only way for these women to serve in our country's Civil War military campaigns -- they served in disguise, discovered as women only when they were injured and required medical care in field hospitals! Author Richard Hall has researched these women's lives extensively, and the many pages of actual Civil War-era photographs and engravings included in the book bring these women's stories to life in vivid detail."},{"Title":"Patriots in Disguise: Women Warriors of the Civil War","review":"In Patriots in Disguise by Richard Hall, I learned about all the roles the women played in the Civil War, from nursing, serving as patriotic leaders, and some even would go so far as to dress in male attire to serve their cause. The book mainly focuses around the stories of a few important figures: the nurse Anna Etheridge, and soldiers-in-disguise Sarah Emma Edmonds (aka Frank Thompson) and Loreta Janeta Velazquez (aka Lieutenant Harry T. Buford). In a time when women had limited rights, the only way that these courageous figures could serve was in disguises of military uniform, a big difference from the hoops skirts and corsets that they had previously worn. It was a major step in women's rights and the fight for gender equality.I enjoyed the topic of this book, women's roles in the Civil War, but I continued to wonder exactly how the women could pull off male disguises without being known. I did find it amusing at the end of the book to discover that some women were caught when they had babies and even one was discovered after trying to pull her pants on over her head. This book didn't exactly give me more information about the Civil War itself, but I liked that the roles of women was mainly told through the tales of the women who had done them. Before I read this book, I never really had thought about how courageous these women were to risk their lives and take the secret of their identity to their grave, all because they wanted adventure and they believed in their cause or wanted to support their home state, and feel like a true patriot. They could take action in the war, instead of just staying at home and helping the wounded troops, but by helping fill their ranks.I didn't exactly enjoy the writing style of the book because it read more like a history book without one specific plot line, but it wasn't too long of a book, so I was able to finish it quickly and get it over with. I don't think that I would recommend this book as either a book for pleasure or even as a book that you should choose when needing to read about the Civil War. On the other hand, I wouldn't say that it is the worst book ever as long as you are at least interested in women roles in the Civil War, but the information given is only satisfactory."},{"Title":"Patriots in Disguise: Women Warriors of the Civil War","review":"I enjoyed this well-researched book even though I'm not a history buff. I found it light on Confederate stories with a pro-North undertone, but was pleased with what seems to be a fair reporting of facts. The stories were interesting and the book was an easy and very interesting read."},{"Title":"Patriots in Disguise: Women Warriors of the Civil War","review":"Not wildly scholarly, but reasonably useful discussion of women who were on the battlefield in the Civil War. This is structured around descriptions of specific women such as the nurse Anna Etheridge, the soldier Franklin Thompson, the whatever-she-really-was Loreta Janeta Velazquez. There isn't much theoretical discussion here, nor is there much explanation of how women's disguises were able to work--and, despite the title, much time is given to vivandieres, nurses and the like."},{"Title":"Lagrangian and Hamiltonian Mechanics","review":"I read physics books in my spare time, and what I've found are the best ones are short, good books: if they're short you stand a chance of getting through them, and then if they're good you can pick up the essentials of the subject quickly.This book is both. If you're looking for a primary textbook, you might be looking for something different, but for a reference to the concepts it's short and sweet: eg. what are canonical transformations, why are they defined the way they are and what is their importance.What's particularly mind-blowing is the 5 page discussion of field momentum. That's the qA term in the hamiltonian for a charge q in a magnetic field (vector potential A). This form of the hamiltonian always puzzled me: Calkin explains the meaning of the qA term beautifully.

The other books on the subject either do not cover the details, or if they do, they do so using unnecessarily more advanced techniques. For example, Calkin's book derives in the clearest and most straight-forward way the invariance of Poisson and Lagrange Brackets under canonical transformations. (A derivation that even Goldstein got wrong in the first edition of his now classic text -- see the footnote on integral invariants in the second edition of his book.)Regrettably, Calkin doesn't cover Lagrange multiplier techniques, the Routhian, and relativistic Analytical Mechanics.

It is an account of six individuals who lived during the MA's; Bodo, a Frankish Peasant; Marco Polo, the famous Venetian merchant; Madame Eglentyne, prioress of Chaucer; an anonymous middle-class Parisian housewife; and two English merchants, one engaged in the wool trade and the other a clothier in Essex. The author has illustrated various aspects of social life of the era by drawing on such sources as account books, diaries, letters, records, and wills. She starts the work with a previously unpublished essay entitled &quot;The Precursors,&quot; which describes the barbarian conquest of Rome. In this, she describes the lives of three men, Ausonius, Sidonius and Fortunatus and uses them to foreshadow the life that would re-emerge in the Middle Ages.She starts by imagining a day in the life of the Peasant Bodo, in the time of Charlemagne. From her study of primarily economic documents from the Middle Ages of this time, she not only extrapolates but truly brings to life Bodo and his wife Ermentrude. From there, she goes on to the better documented life of Marco Polo, and also describes how he served as an inspiration for Columbus. Madam Eglentyne is next. Here, Power humorously details the inner workings of a gossipy nunnery and how Eglentyne would have gone about her life as an aristocratic women of God. She next details the life of a middle class Parisian housewife by studying the contents of the Menagier's Wife and validating many of it's points by citing other documents. She concludes by detailing the lives of the two Thomases; Betson and Paycocke of Coggeshall. Both are merchants and provide a chance for Power to really show off her grasp of medieval economics as well as an ability to compile disparate correspondences into a story of a life. This is a rare scholarly work that truly entertains while being read. One of the best books I've ever read."},{"Title":"Medieval people, (Pelican books)","review":"Eileen Power studies the Middle Ages, not from an abstract historical point of view but from simple and real people and what we can know about them. I particularly like her study of Marco Polo, from his notes and diaries, which gives us a materialistic and realistic vision of what they saw of the world, and not what we want to see of what they saw. I also loved Madame Eglentyne, a prioress taken from Chaucer but at once identified to one particular prioress through real life archives and descriptions. A very interesting and useful book to enable us to capture the density of everyday life in the Middle Ages.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"Medieval people, (Pelican books)","review":"Wonderful scholarship in a most readable written style.

Instead of showing peasant life as merely nasty, brutish, and short, the author gives 3 dimensions to Bodo as he works for himself and the monks, how he and his wife spend their respective days (note: Ermentrude did NOT merely stay home and \\"raise the children\\"), their enjoyment of festivals and fairs, their relationships with other peasants and landlords, etc. The author's summary of the Householder of Paris' treatise on marriage to his young wife was concise and entertaining. Suggestion: If this section piques your interest, have a look at Tania Bayard's outstanding translation, \\"A Medieval Home Companion\\"."},{"Title":"Medieval people, (Pelican books)","review":"Since this book attempts to describe the daily lives and lifestyles of people living during the Medieval period, the concept behind it is brilliant, so I had high expectations. Unfortunately, this book fails miserably in its execution.I read the first chapter, the one on Bodo. It was OK, so I thought the book had potential. The next person was Marco Polo. After pages and pages in English, and also in Latin and French too (which I do not know), describing places, people, rulers, dates, trade-routes, and exotic merchandise connected with Venice (and still no mention of Marco Polo), it became difficult to decipher what she was saying since it was all so unfamiliar to me.The author's narrative is difficult to follow, unless you are an academic scholar already well versed in the historical and literary events, people, and places she refers to in her work. The positive reviewers are most likely more learned and read than I, and could therefore follow the storyline and enjoy the book. However, for me, it became a chore to plow through the seemingly endless and unfamiliar references that form the basis of this book. I had to skip all the Latin and French parts, which are not translated into English. In the end, I gave up. Even though I did not enjoy the book, I gave it two stars because the Kindle edition is free, if you want to try.If you are knowledgeable about the Medieval Period and its history then you might enjoy this narrative. If you want more down-to-earth descriptions about the people and lifestyle of the Medieval period, I suggest you search for a book that is easier to read."},{"Title":"Medieval people, (Pelican books)","review":"I cannot say more than what the other reviewers have said in their positive reviews about this book. The Middle Ages have always fascinated me, and I would recommend this little book highly to anyone who wants an introduction to that time period, without having to worry about Kings and Queens and dates of battles. While those are important--of course--the author emphasizes the lives of several people at different time periods during the Medieval era.Thinking of how long the Medieval era lasted, depending on what source is followed, it could be from the fall of Rome to the Renaissance...this was not a static time period. Just like our own era there was constant change and a steady growth in science, and in rediscovering what had been lost during the worst of the \\"Dark Ages\\". This book, while short, gives the feel of the movement, the forward progression that was occuring during this era.Her chapter on Marco Polo is one of the most interesting ones; it is not quite in keeping with all the others, in that he is someone famous then and now, and his discoveries changed beliefs in his own time and after. She ends that chapter with a little known sailor, Christopher Columbus, referring to Marco Polo's books and maps while planning his voyage to India...Otherwise the majority of the five individuals profiled are average people of their time. Certainly the author could have chosen any differnt five to make similar points, but overall the book gives a good look at that era and whets the appetite for more."},{"Title":"Medieval people, (Pelican books)","review":"I very much enjoyed this book on my MP3, but I would hesitate to recommend it to anyone who is not (as I am) fluent in the subtleties of the mores, language and customs of Medieval times, as well as Latin and French.Eileen Power (the author) frequently uses terms with which the modern reader will not be familiar without explanation. For example, she speaks at length about the cloth industry, and repeatedly mentions fullers and fulling without once explaining the duties of the fuller. Wikipedia defines fulling as a step in woolen clothmaking which involves the cleansing of cloth (particularly wool) to eliminate oils, dirt, and other impurities, and making it thicker. Few modern readers would know (without continually resorting to another reference) many of the terms frequently used which are important for following the stories told in this book. The rare definitions she does provide tend to be for terms which are not essential to the stories and are notable by their very rarity.Long sections of the book are written in Latin french (I have no idea if it is modern or Medieval french) with no translation. As someone who knows little to no french or Latin, this was quite frustrating. An occasional french phrase might be puzzled out in a similar book, but entire pages are not within the grasp of the average reader, even the average well educated (American) reader.The author dropped names from literature with which she expected the reader to be immediately familiar. She expected an immediate familiarity with each of the characters from Chaucer, and their habits and stories, as well as other literary and historical figures. I can not quote other examples as I have to admit to not being familiar enough with some of them to have remembered them, and as I tend to listen to my MP3 while driving I could not take notes for later reference.A note specific to the audio listener - the reader had one of the best voices. It was smooth and melodic, an absolute joy to the ear!Although I enjoyed this book quite a bit, I could not help but wish the author had written it for the common man, not to impress her fellow scholars. One would expect her editor to see this problem and tell her to define her terms, and to translate the foreign passages. This small change would have made this book go from a book which now would confuse most people to a medieval primer, suitable to introduce the masses to social history."},{"Title":"Medieval people, (Pelican books)","review":"This book gave me some good insight to those who lived in Medieval times. Much better than I had before. Yes people lived on Manors with a lord, and serfs who took care of the land for them by planting, caring for animals, barrel making, housekeeping and the like but life in the middle ages was so much more. Residents of Venice worked in trading and shipping with Asian goods. Marco Polo spent years in China with Kubla Khan. People were well connected to the church and many lived as priests and nuns. They were all called to their vocation and the rules were so strict that many lived to defy them. The lives of husbands and wives were not usually love matches but arranged and the power of the woman was much less of a man's. But in the excerpt chosen we see a much older husband provide valuable advice to his young wife. England grows in power near the end of the middle ages bringing increase contact with the outside world and into what would be called its Renaissance.

First of all, author seems to be one of the left leaning \\"liberals\\" who hate everything Indian. Mahabharat is one of the literary masterpieces and largest work of literature in the world.Now let's discuss Flavia's review. She says \\"This textual analysis makes it clear that programs such as Mahabharat reinforce a specifically Hindu-Hindi/North Indian image of India, thus marginalizing other regional, linguistic, and religious groups.\\" Nothing can be more ridiculous than this. Mahabharat is a scripture revered by people all over India. It has nothing to do with Hindi/Hindu. It was originally written in Sanskrit and when no Hindi existd. That the serial was made in Hindi was because of commercial reasons than anything else. By this logic I can conclude that a program on Bible will reinforce a Semitic worldview. Will it Flavia???Again Flavia says \\"Dr. Mitra concludes that there exists a hegemonic system informing the centralized production of television programs does exist in India, the author suggests that it is possible to challenge this system through regional and alternative programs.\\" Again, this is the usual nonsense from leftists who are uncomfortable with the popularity of the serial. The author conveniently forgets that same Doordarshan broadcast \\" Bible Stories\\" after Mahabharat. But that was not at all popular like Mahabharat. Leftists cannot digest that (By the way, are you a missionary Flavia? ). And hence, they launch a vilification campaign against innocuous things like a television serial like Mahabharat. The real reason behind this is leftists fear that serials like Mahabharat will expedite the rightist movement and will marginalize the left. Serials like Mahabharat present history form Indian perspective and which is in contradiction with the lies propagated with leftist historians ( or their masters elsewhere???).And finally, the religious strife in India is a result of political skullduggery and has nothing to do with a television serial. It has been there for ages and is because of historical reasons which I would not like to go into here. Get a life Flavia and show some rationality in your arguments."},{"Title":"Television and Popular Culture in India: A Study of the Mahabharat","review":"Ananda Mitra's \\"Television and Popular Culture\\" is a path breaking study, which considers television in India as a distinct cultural form with a specific role in the production of popular culture. Dr. Mitra presents a set of conclusions about the state of television in India and its ability to produce a national image. He discusses the political, social and cultural movements in India with an emphasis on religious fundamentalism and the struggles over issues of language and gender.. The first chapter \\"Introduction and History of Doordarshan\\" talks about the various developments in Indian television and gives an overview of the different time periods in the history of Doordarshan.. The second chapter \\"Reformulating Culture in the Indian Context\\" examines the position of Doordarshan in the cultural map of India. Mitra here examines the relations between television and the nation, television and religion, and the role of television in relation to gender and language. He reconsiders the notion of culture as a combination of a variety of practice that are often in conflicting relationships, pulled together by ideology and circulated by a hegemonic leadership. Ideas of Gramsci and Althusser are also incorporated in this chapter with respect to ideology. Chapter three \\"Doordarshan: A Critical Glance\\" examines television formation as an independent cultural element. Mitra considers the variety of texts like Mahabharat and Ramayan in depth to obtain some conclusions about the position of Doordarshan in Indian culture. Chapter four \\"Mahabharat on Doordarshan\\" examines the position of the religious soap opera and its relationship to Doordarshan in variety of cultural practices. This textual analysis makes it clear that programs such as Mahabharat reinforce a specifically Hindu-Hindi/North Indian image of India, thus marginalizing other regional, linguistic, and religious groups. He specifically examines the role television plays in shaping as well as reflecting Indian popular culture. Defining culture as a set of everyday practices that reflect the lived experiences of various groups of people, Mitra explores and interprets the way in which it is presented in the extremely successful serial Mahabharat. Chapter five \\"Beyond Mahabharat\\" examines the way in which the struggles represented in the serial are connected with the ongoing tensions in India. Dr. Mitra argues here that Doordarshan is redefining what is currently considered the preferred combination of social, religious and cultural elements. He says that Mahabharat is redefining the image of a secular India to a Hindu Fanatic India. Chapter six \\"Television and the Nation: Doordarshan's India\\" examines the same concern as in chapter five of India's representation through Mahabharat. This qualitative look at the serial concentrating on its signifying practices and narrative strategies leads to a discussion of the ideological effectively of Doordarshan. Mitra says, \\"Doordarshan selects a small set of interconnected elements for representation on television and this in turn, produces a national image of India on Doordarshan\\". Chapter seven \\"Doordarshan: Its Internal Contradictions and Positions in Everyday Life\\" comments on the Mahabharat serial and its increasing popular culture, where the dominant articulations are between Hinduism, Hindi, Northern India and a male patriarchy. He also considers the position of television within the everyday material practices of the people who watch it. Dr. Mitra concludes that there exists a hegemonic system informing the centralized production of television programs does exist in India, the author suggests that it is possible to challenge this system through regional and alternative programs. Finally, a broader perspective of India's current political, social, and cultural movements is suggested to rethink the phenomenon of television in India. \\"Television and Popular Culture\\" by Ananda Mitra analysis the extremely popular serial Mahabharat in the 90s and describes a set of relations drawn between the narratives, its representation on Doordarshan and its relationship with the popular culture of India. There are hardly any books of local origin that are based on a cultural studies approach. \`Television and Popular Culture in India' attempts to redress this imbalance and is arguably the first exploration of its kind in the Indian context. This book is based on the cultural studies approach combined with its policy implications for the future role of television in India. The understanding of popular culture in India will be an invaluable resource both to students interested in the methodology of cultural studies as well as those who are on the look out for a critical introduction to television in India. It should stimulate an interest in an exploration of the underlying connections between popular culture and the complex, multivariate terrain of cultural politics in India.Althusser referred to ideology as a false consciousness. He explained how myth is naturalized, contrived and constructed to blindfold people. Mitra in his book tries to expose this ideology by a textual analysis of the serial Mahabharat. One important aspect that puzzled researchers was why the serial was so popular.. If we examine Mahabharat in the light of study done by Rossen, we come to the conclusion that Mahabharat has impacted the general public by its conservative dogma. . But in context to the religious soap opera, Mitra shows us how such serials try to portray a Hindu reality depicting the \\"Hindu Sensibility\\" and didacticism.What Mitra questions in this book is very true as in reality these religious soap operas project a Hindu macho image and fanaticism which has swept across the country, bringing in its wake miserable violence and threatening the very integrity of India as a secular and united nation. We have witnessed this in the 1993 bomb blasts on the Ayodhya issue.While reading this book one realises that Doordarshan is not free of internal contradictions. The struggles over language, region, religion and gender are textually reproduced in the diversity of texts that are available on Doordarshan now. A textual analysis such as this takes a step towards rethinking the issues that are often considered as normal and natural, pointing out that there are indeed contradictions that exist."},{"Title":"Sunday Golf","review":"The characters are so real and interesting.

Hopefully, they are your children's favorites too. This is a new story from Laurent de Brunhoff. As much as I like the story, I must say that I like the illustrations even more. This is one of the most beautifully illustrated of all the Babar stories.One night in Celesteville, Alexander (King Babar's and Queen Celeste's elephant son) awakens. Drawn by the bright light coming through the window, he walks out onto the terrace to look at the moon. But there is no moon. The light is caused by a beautiful red and gold bird with sparkling feathers. The bird says, &quot;Tash! Succotash! What are you doing here so late?&quot; Alexander replies, &quot;I can't sleep.&quot; The bird says that he is a wizard, and asks Alexander if he wants to play parachute or swing-swing. Alexander doesn't know what either one is. He chooses swing-swing, and soon he floating in the air, swinging gently back and forth and left to right. Alexander loves it. The wizard eventually returns Alexander to the terrace and persuades him to return to sleep.Since Alexander has had such a good time, he wants to know if the wizard will come back to play with him again. The wizard says that he may, but issues a warning. &quot;But remember, there are good and bad wizards, and sometimes it's hard to tell friend from foe.&quot;The very next day, the elephant family goes for a walk and Alexander spots another bird, this time a brown one, that says &quot;Succotash!&quot; And the adventure begins in a new direction.The moral of this story is that life is full of right and wrong mixed together, like succotash is &quot;lima beans cooked up with corn.&quot; Youngsters need to be on the look out.All humans are inclined to draw patterns in their minds that may or may not be present. You have a wonderful time with a new friend, and expect that the next time will be exactly the same. But you may have met that person on the happiest day of his or her life, and the next time you see the person is the saddest. Also, because your aunt and uncle are nice, that doesn't mean someone else's aunt and uncle will be, too. I thought that this book was unusually good in helping a child establish a sense of skepticism and distinction, rather than extrapolating blindly from the last experience. If this lesson can be learned well, your child's life will be much happier and more successful.Nice writing!After you finish enjoying this story, I suggest that you think about where you and your child may be drawing false conclusions from incomplete or misleading evidence. For example, if you and your child went to the aquarium on a day when it was crowded and she or he was sick, perhaps you had a bad time and have avoided the aquarium since then. If so, perhaps you should try again on a not-so-crowded day when both of you feel terrific.Look for the best and worst, and embrace the best!"},{"Title":"Babar and the Succotash Bird (Babar (Harry N.

The pictures are nice and have the same spirit as the originals; my 6-year old boy likes the way that the pictures are drawn. However, the story is a bit choppier. The lessons are carefully and explicitly made: (1) be careful what you wish for as you might be surprised and (2) that life is mixed between good and bad just like succotash is mixed with beans and corn.If you're looking for the classic Babar stories by Jean de Brunhoff, then this would be a second choice."},{"Title":"Babar and the Succotash Bird (Babar (Harry N.

Abrams))","review":"All little kids are garunteed to love this book."},{"Title":"Channan: Heart of the Heians","review":"This is the first book of it's kind to my knowledge. Dr. Schmeisser presents for us two kata, Channan Dai and Channan Sho, of Chinese origin, that he believes are the root kata that Itosu Yasutsune used as the source material to create the 5 Pinan kata (known as Heian in Japanese styles). Dr. Schmeissar's writing style and organization is extremely logical. There's no fluff here, just the meat. He begins by providing us with a background and historical context of these kata to convince us of his theory. This chapter is chalked full of fascinating footnotes from the research that he did. He then takes us right into Channan Dai and Channan Sho, showing the movements with pictures and detailed written description with full Bunkai. In the fourth chapter, he relates the Channan sequences and bunkai to their respective Heian sequences, teaching us bunkai for the Heian kata. The 5th chapter is a historical note discussing the kata origins and the question of whether they are the root kata of the Pinan/Heian. The chapter demonstrates to me the author's professional integrity and honesty by admitting that his theory cannot be proven beyond a shadow of a doubt but provides us his reasoning and allows us to make our own judgement. The last chapter provides us with a photographic sequence of the kata to use as a reference for learning. This is, perhaps, the only place in the book where I find fault which, quite possibly, could be due to my own short comings. I found it hard trying to follow the sequence and often got confused on which direction I needed to go in or what my feet needed to do during some of the turns and transitional movements (I'll need the video to get my performance correct). In my opinion, more photos of the transitional moves would have alleviated this for me. Despite this small fault, I believe this to be an extremely valuable book and there's no other like it on the subject. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Channan: Heart of the Heians","review":"Channan: Heart of the Heians, by Elmar T. Schmeisser, explores the possibility of the modern day Heians as derived from the chinese kata Channan-Dai and Channa-Sho. The author makes no definitive claim that his studies are absolute, but presents his research in a sound historical manner leaving the reader to make his or her own decision regarding the origins of the Heian kata based on the research presented. The book is loaded with simple-to-follow, step-by-step, photos of Channan-Dai and Channan-Sho and accompanying text for each step. In a simple straight forward way, the author clearly illustrates apparent or perceived correlations between the Channan kata and the modern day Heians. An added plus in this book is the way it is laid out; the book is designed in such a way that keeps the reader flowing seamlessly from one photographic illustration to another. Only two things might have improved this well produced book and research, one of which is nearly impossible to do on the printed page, showing the transition moves in sequence, and crisper photographs with a higher quality camera. Overall, regardless of these two minor shortcomings, this book is a fantastic work and will be greatly appreciated by anyone who enjoys the study of traditional Japanese kata, bunkai, and kata origins."},{"Title":"Channan: Heart of the Heians","review":"Author Elmar Schmeisser has, in this book, tried to uncover the kata at the root of the Heian/Pinan kata: Kata Channan. His research has led him to a Chinese Chuan-Fa system that entered the US via the Philipines; however, Dr. Schmeisser has made a convincing argument that, while the kata he presents may not be exactly like the one that Itosu used when constructing the Pinan kata, they at least have the same root. I don't have a problem with the probability that the two kata, Channan Dai and Sho, may not be the exact kata that Itosu derived the Pinan from, as a cursory observation of the same kata in different systems will also reveal small variations. Kata change over time; that's just the nature of the beast.In the first chapter, Dr. Schmeisser gives some historical background on Heian/Pinan in a concise but informative summary, and then gives some background not only on the various stages of learning kata in general, but also in analyzing the kata for practical applications (bunkai). Though the author does a wonderful job for the space provided in this section, I would love to have seen it expanded and given more detail. The next two chapters demonstrate the kata Channan Dai and Channan Sho. In both chapters, each sequence in the kata is given a paragraph or so for explaination, and the bunkai is usually shown along side the kata sequence. Chapter Four takes examples from the Heian kata (Shotokan style) and demonstrates where the sequences from the Channan kata fit in, sort of offering a short comparitive analysis of the Channan and Heian kata. The book ends with a very short chapter on historic implications, and one last chapter showing photo sequences of the full Channan Dai and Channan Sho kata without the interuption of text or bunkai.While I strongly believe that the original bukai in most kata are lost to history, most of Dr. Schmeisser's bunkai make sense, in a self-defense context. Included are strikes, throws, standing locks, chokes, off-balancing techniques, hand traps, and even some finishes for a kneeling or prone opponent. While I'm not a fan of every bunkai he shows (I think his punches that target the limbs could be better served being directed at the head or torso), they are far more encompasing and realistic than much of what is normally taught. Those familiar with Aikido and Judo will find techniques from those systems fitting right in alongside the punches and kicks of karate. The author also makes good use of end-notes, which inform the reader further of his research and don't interupt the flow of the text.The one notable negative of this book is the lack of enbusen lines. It's difficult at times to understand the footwork of some sequences, and an enbusen diagram would have helped. This, as well as the lack of elaboration in the first chapter that I mentioned earlier, keeps the book from getting a full five stars.Still, I find the book valuable as a historical work on the roots of the Pinan/Heian kata, as well as a source for realistic bunkai. Those interested in either should take a look."},{"Title":"Channan: Heart of the Heians","review":"This does little to shed light on the original form the Heian Kata are taken from...Add to this the photos are of poor quality and the Sensei is executing poor technique and stance.I also looked it up on You Tube and it confirmed his poorly executed form...Save your money and find someone that knows the form.Even if it costs you some bucks."},{"Title":"Channan: Heart of the Heians","review":"It is great to see another book from this author who actually caters for those who seek new knowledge instead of just repackaging old theories and techniques. I have been teaching similar theories about kata in my class for years and having done Judo I found many throws, chokes etc., in all the kata. A great book for beginners to aspire to and some good direstion for veterans."},{"Title":"Channan: Heart of the Heians","review":"Could someone who has this book list the evidence that Mr. Schmeisser provides to explain how he happens to know a Kata that has been lost for almost a century now. The only karate masters who ever mentioned it, in books written in the 1940's, say that no one knew it then and it had been forgotten. They obviously did not teach it, so how has it now popped back up? I would like to know whether this book is credible, or just a clever way to make a buck..... before I buy it."},{"Title":"Channan: Heart of the Heians","review":"I read this book with great interest. I have known a few people that practiced these kata. This book does not present the real kata but instead a modified version of the first two pinan. The history is good but if you want these Kata get Funakoshi's Karate do Kyohan because the heian/pinan kata are there. I guess this wasn't a bad attempt just misguided. There are still a few that practice these Kata if you look hard enough."},{"Title":"A Work of Heart : Understanding How God Shapes Spiritual Leaders","review":"It is said that before one can address a problem - or opportunity - one must understand that problem (or opportunity). McNeal certainly has understood the opportunity offered the Christian Church to reach out to a pre-Christian (not post-Christian) North American culture. This work presents a passionate appeal to transition to a missional, externally focused approach to ministry by gaining insight into how God shapes the hearts of spiritual leaders through six distinct shaping dynamics in the Christian life. These spiritually formed leaders will have drawn closer to the heart of God, thus recognizing their call to serve in Jesus' name and in His way. Excellent book. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"A Work of Heart : Understanding How God Shapes Spiritual Leaders","review":"In theory, this should have been a good book. It had endorsements from a lot of prominent leaders, and it's premise is very interesting. The author breaks the book up into two parts. In the first, he examines the leadership style and qualities of four Biblical leaders: Moses, David, Paul, and Jesus. In the second, he applies what was gleaned from these leaders to our own lives, breaking these qualities down into six alliterative (he is Baptist, after all) categories: Culture, Call, Community, Communion, Conflict, and Commonplace.Unfortunately, A Work of Heart fails to deliver on its promise. Despite a few practical and pragmatic suggestions that are genuinely good advice for leaders, the theological foundation for most of McNeal's assumptions is terribly weak. I am not entirely sure what his gauge of \\"success\\" in ministry is, but it does not appear to be the proclamation of Biblical truth, the genuine conversion of the lost and discipleship of the saved. On the rare occasions when Scripture is used to back up the author's assertions, it is consistently misapplied.There are plenty of great books on leadership, both sacred and secular. A book which seeks to offer merely pragmatic advice under the guise of a vaguely \\"Christian\\" spirituality is ultimately pretty useless. Pass on this one."},{"Title":"A Work of Heart : Understanding How God Shapes Spiritual Leaders","review":"One of the best books on leadership I have ever read. The four brief biographies (on Moses, David, Paul and Jesus) that make up the first part of the book are extremely insightful and practical. McNeal writes with authenticity and clarity. There's not a lot of \\"fluff\\" or stuff that's rehashed from one leadership book to another. Every chapter is well worth a slow read. His dry wit also adds some spice to the read. Very good stuff."},{"Title":"A Work of Heart : Understanding How God Shapes Spiritual Leaders","review":"Are you wondering if God is calling you to something?

The second half of the books presents the more concrete nuts and bolts.I really think the book will help people answer for themselves, \\"What is a call from God,\\" \\"Do I have a calling,\\" and \\"What is it I'm called to be.\\"While the book is applicable to any Believer, it's a must read for any one even considering going into Seminary or religious studies with the intent to serve in vocational ministry."},{"Title":"A Work of Heart : Understanding How God Shapes Spiritual Leaders","review":"Absolutely the best book on spiritual leadership and development I've ever read!

Did Jesus not always know the hearts and minds of men?He asserts that Jesus developed a sensitivity and learned the needs of others. Is the author suggesting that at some point Christ's sensitivity was lacking?On page 56 he says \\"Jesus also grew in His relationship with the Father.\\" I would ask: So at what point did Jesus and the Father become one?Many of the chapters in this book are bad, but the chapter describing Christ's development is terrible. It sounded to this reader like the heresy of Dynamic Monarchianism. This author does begin chapter 6 saying that Jesus was fully God and fully man, but he does not demonstrate that he knows what that means.I found this book more troubling than helpful."},{"Title":"A Work of Heart : Understanding How God Shapes Spiritual Leaders","review":"I have not received the order and have not heard back from the seller nor has anyone given my money back.

This book, I've been reading on for several months. I take in some, read some more as the Spirit guides me and allow Him to teach me His truths and how I am to use the material.This book is one of a confirmational aspect of Spiritual Cleansing. Many elements of the book thus far have been truths to which I have been accustomed and practice some and others I have yet to start. Others listed in the book I might never or would ever conceive. I feel confident about this statement; this book is written from a heart of God, through Spiritual Guidance. Some of the material will be more difficult for some to adhear or understand due to their prevailing orthodoxy, to me it is confirmational.My view is that everyone that chooses to believe in the Spiritual Truth written in this book would be greatly enhanced to achieve a more profound ministry in the Kingdom of God.Other reviewer's of this book have given very good points of satisfaction, and I would concur with them.

Absolutely awful! The concepts weren't terrible, but the author obviously has no reverence for scripture. It would seem that his approach to the Word of God is assumption. He draws lines that simply do not exist and are not taught in the passages he references. For example: He claims that Moses was a good leader when he realized that he wasn't good and public speech and asked to take his brother Aaron along. Anyone can see by reading the Bible that it just didn't happen that way. God was calling Moses to go free his people from slavery in Egypt, and Moses was using every excuse in the book to get out of it. It was at that point that GOD told Moses that he would give him Aaron to convince Moses to obey. Scriptural inaccuracies abound throughout this book. Do not read it!I feel bad for this author. I would not want to be the one who stands before God and have him ask me why I treated his word with such disrespect."},{"Title":"A Work of Heart : Understanding How God Shapes Spiritual Leaders","review":"I just finished reading this book for a class: \\"A Biblical Theology of Leadership\\". Look elsewhere -- this book is relies more on psychological and cultural perspective than actual Biblical exegesis. The author frequently narrates creatively regarding the lives of the four profiled Biblical leaders. Later, when developing his six themes of leadership, the book is simply unreliable -- it's not that everything is bad, it's just that there's enough bad (unscriptural) to categorize the book as \\"man's opinions\\". For example, dead sinners abiding under the wrath of God are termed \\"pre-Christians\\" throughout. It's assumed we have a need to \\"love ourselves\\" (p 125). Arminian theology throughout. A big emphasis is placed on becoming a \\"new apostolic leader\\" -- guess what? Our generation and culture is not as different as we think (Ecclesiastes); what we need is the same old truths that have always served as the foundation of the church and of leadership. You'll find those truths in the Bible, but you'll find only bits and pieces in this book."},{"Title":"A Work of Heart : Understanding How God Shapes Spiritual Leaders","review":"Most books for Christian leaders I have read lately deal primarily with skills. I recommend many of these to pastors in my work as a church consultant, because leadership skills are critical to effectiveness.But McNeal in this book deals with something more foundational than skills--how God shapes the heart of a leader. After four wonderful character sketches, tracing how God shaped the hearts of Moses, David, Paul, and Jesus, preparing them for leadership, McNeal moves into what he calls the six &quot;subplots&quot; of the leader's life: culture, call, community, communion, conflict, and the commonplace.In the chapter on culture, the author describe two options for how the church can relate to the world--as refuge or mission. Refuge &quot;congregations focus on the past. Fearful of change, these churches create a safe, nostalgic haven for their members.&quot; In the missional church, however, &quot;leaders who want to transform the culture seek to build as many bridges as possible to the world outside the faith.&quot;The chapter on communion is probably the best treatment I have seen of the importance of &quot;sabbath time&quot;--regular, protected periods of time alone with God--that I have read. I have been suprised in my work by how few pastors have a discipline of regular, intentional blocks of solitude every week or every other week. I believe that this, far more than learning any set of skills, has the potential to infuse power into the ministry of spiritual leaders. For many pastors and other spiritual leaders, this chapter alone, if heeded, would be worth many times the price of this book.I sometimes close or follow a consultation by giving the senior pastor the gift of a timely book. This is one I expect to be giving often."},{"Title":"A Work of Heart : Understanding How God Shapes Spiritual Leaders","review":"McNeal pulls no punches in this book!

A must read for every Christian leader!I highly recommend the book."},{"Title":"A Work of Heart : Understanding How God Shapes Spiritual Leaders","review":"A Work of Heart: Understanding How God Shapes Spiritual Leaders (Updated Version) by Reggie McNealSpiritual leadership is a work of heart. That is the focus of this book as it takes us on a journey through the spiritual development of four biblical characters, two from the Old Testament (Moses and David) and two from the New Testament (Jesus and Paul) then part two discusses the six areas of a leader's life that are used to develop him spiritually to lead others. These \\"arenas\\" are culture, call, community, communion, conflict, and the commonplace. Through the stories of the biblical characters and the \\"arenas\\" the writer leads us to marvel at God's design and handiwork in our own life to make us a great person and not just a great leader.For those of us that have been focusing on the functions of a leader this is a strong reminder to refocus our attention to our own spiritual development so we can properly lead others to develop in their relationship with God. The flip side of that coin is the warning that is given in the book to those to neglect their heart development will reap the rewards of that inattention. He lists the fruit of our neglect as ranging from \\"spiritual powerlessness to lackluster leadership to spiritual bankruptcy. The lesson is if we pay attention to our spiritual development through our personal relationship with Christ and partner with Him in our own \\"heart-shaping\\" we avoid many of the pitfalls and reap many of the blessings. Make certain we intentionally look after our own hearts while dealing with the hearts of others.The book is well written and challenges the reader page to page and paragraph to paragraph. I believe you will find this volume an added help to your leadership efforts as you serve Christ in an ever changing world."},{"Title":"A Work of Heart : Understanding How God Shapes Spiritual Leaders","review":"Reggie McNeal, in A Work of Heart, displays a fully developed holistic approach to what shapes the heart of a Spiritual Leader. He believes that everything within the sphere of existence in the leader's past, present, and future is what culminates in who the leader has, or will, or will not become.McNeal first gives a biographical sketch of four prominent leaders of our faith: Moses, David, Paul, and Jesus. It is through these sketches where he moves into the subplots that create the whole story of a leader's life. He calls these subplots the six C's: Culture, Call, Community, Communion, Conflict, and Commonplace. It is by each of these subplots that experiences of the leader are engrained into the heart and mind and where the \\"who I am\\" of the leader is developed.This is by far one of the best books on spiritual leadership and development that I have recently read. As McNeal emphasizes in the book, there are an abundance of \\"how-to-do\\" leadership and \\"follow-this-model\\" leadership books out on the market. But, the best approach of leadership understanding and development must come from the heart; and, it must come from the whole encompass of the leader's story.Every sphere, both past, present, and future, are what has made or is making the leader...both good and bad. All leaders must develop a keen self-awareness and understanding and the ability to apply our experiences to our shepherding; that is, how has his entire life story, each of the six subplots, made him who he/she is today.And so, by understanding where he/she has come, where he/she is presently at, and where he/she is going, a leader is better able to lead from God and not from the world. We are not an autonomous entity in this world. We \\"are\\" what have been influenced by our Culture, our Call, our Community, our Communion with God, our Conflict(s), and our Commonplace (that is, our daily life/routine). This is who we are. Reggie McNeal hits Spiritual Leadership right in the heart because Spiritual Leadership \\"is\\" A Work of Heart.The only negative that I might transcribe about this wonderful work is the lack of connectivity between section one (the biographical sketches) and section two (explanation of six C's). This is not to say that the reader will be left with a multitude of questions. Each section is fully developed in thought. I just feel that as one reads section two, McNeal could have done a better job at showing greater examples from the four leaders' lives at how they more specifically connect/relate to each C. But, in his defense, maybe he thought that this might be left to the reader's creativity and critical thinking opportunity. Other than this slight distraction, my opinion is that this work is the best spiritual leadership development book on the market at this present time!A leader who leads from their spiritual heart, and not from the current trend of church growth or leadership model, is a better leader that God can use for the advancement of His Kingdom.Blessings!

The book is a revelation of the heart. As you are reading, the insights that are given hit home into the chest because you can relate to the situations. It is a comforting book because of the feelings that are generated. You realize that you are not alone with the feelings that come from leading a congregation. This is one of the best ministerial books I have ever read. It would be best for a minister of course, but also elders within the church would grow from it. The book begins with a character studies of Moses, David, Paul, and Jesus. These character studies connect well with the present leader. The nature of leadership within God's people have not changed much through the centuries. God's process of developing leaders is the same. The book continues with an exploration of a leader's culture, call, community, communion, conflict, and the commonplace. All of these chapters are excellent with the section on conflict being the best. The book is a modern day masterpiece for congregational leadership. It is a book that is intended to refine and train the heart. It accomplishes the desired purpose."},{"Title":"Westsylvania Heritage Trail (Insights (Harrisburg, Pa.).)","review":"I first found this book at my library, and was amazed at how many locations it covers!

Accordingly, I have been moved to write a review of this book in an attempt to correct the unreasonable calumnies put upon it in the earlier customer review. 'Frpm Giotto to Cezanne' is probably the best introduction to the history of painting that anybody could have. It also has the added bonus that Levey's prose is lucid and intelligent. Criticising this book because it doesn't deal with more female artists is a silly canard. I'm sick and tired of people thinking that we have to be politically correct in our attitude to the past. This book isn't meant to be a detailed history of painting but a concise introduction to the most important artists and their works. Artemisia Gentileschi is simply not important or good enough to be included. Neither were most of the American artists of the period, when the US was a cultural backwater."},{"Title":"From Giotto to Cezanne: A Concise History of Painting (World of Art)","review":"This book contains many famous paintings in full color.For this reason alone, it is worth the price.

You get so many reproductions of paintings in so few pages. Unfortunately, Levey leaves out female painters like Artemisia Gentileschi and Rosa Bonheur. He also leaves out the Russian painter Ilya Repin and completely ignores Bouguereau and Gerome, who have been reevaluated recently and are included in such primary art history books as Gardner's Art Through the Ages. Even more blatant is the fact that the Hudson River School painters are left out along with many other very significant American painters such as Benjamin West, whose Death of General Wolfe appears in every major art history book. I also found the quality of the illustrations rather poor, with the colors not being faithful to the actual paintings. The Sistine chapel photos are from before Michelangelo's frescos were cleaned up, and he cuts off the top half of Raphael's School of Athens. If the book was 30 to 40 pages longer and included more American and female painters and the publisher made an attempt to improve the quality of the reproductions, it would be a much better reference on the history of painting. Otherwise, it's just a nice way to get photos of many famous paintings, the reason I bought the book. Besides, most books about the history of painting include some pictures of drawings by the painters in order to illustrate their work methods, etc. No drawings in this book at all!"},{"Title":"The Art of Getting Even: The Do-It-Yourself Justice Manual.","review":"This is a pamphlet at best, puffed up to book size by inane, unrelated cartoons and half-pages of print.

What makes this even more of a tragedy is that this happened hours before the British occupied this section of Germany. The survival of one of the authors, Benjamin Jacobs, and his brother, as well as the others who made it to shore is the true miracle of the story, which is one that had to be told. My only criticism is that the book could have been a bit better written as I found it hard to follow in certain spots. That is the reason for a rating of a four as opposed to a five. However, the story is such a compelling one that any short comings in style are more than overcome by its substance and I highly recomend this book. If the reader is interested, a more complete and, in my opinion, better written story of Benjamin Jacob's experiences is available in The Dentist of Auschwitz, A Memoir."},{"Title":"The 100-Year Secret: Britain's Hidden World War II Massacre","review":"Like other classic Holocaust accounts (Art Spiegelman's Maus books and Ilona Karmel's An Estate of Memory are 2 that come to mind), The-100-Year-Secret brings to life the torture and misery concentration camp inmates endured at the hands of the Nazis. Unlike other Holocaust accounts, this book tells what--if it were not true--would be an almost unbelievable story of the death of thousands of concentration camp survivors at the hands (or airplanes) of the British.The story of the sinking of inmate-filled ships in Neustadt Bay on May 3, 1945 is simultaneously riveting and heartbreaking. The authors vividly describe the events leading up to the tragedy, both from the point of view of the inmates (of which Mr. Jacobs was one) and that of the British fighter pilots who flew the tragic mission that sunk the ships.How Jacobs and Pool were able to recreate this story when the official records of it remain sealed for another forty years is beyond me. But recreate it they did, powerfully. You will not be able to put this book down until you have finished it, and once you finally do put it down you will continue to see the images of that frightful night in Neustadt Bay for a very long time."},{"Title":"The 100-Year Secret: Britain's Hidden World War II Massacre","review":"Jacobs (d. 2004) was a part of the awful World War II episode written about--namely, the bombing of ships filled with Jewish concentration camp victims trying to flee from Germany in the closing days of World War II. Pool, a graduate of Harvard, is a writer and English teacher. The episode took place in the Baltic Sea. Jacobs' account moves smoothly from experiences of him and his brother, including their separation and eventual reunion, to the larger picture of how the Jews from the camps came to be on the boats, were caught between the desperate Germans and the advancing British Armies (with the possibility the Germans meant to sink the boats once they were at sea), and British Royal Air Force operations and decisions which led to the bombing of the ships and deaths of more than 7,000 persons. Jacobs and Pool lean toward the position that the \\"R. A. F. sacrificed the prisoners\\" in its effort to prevent German officials from escaping by sea to Denmark or Sweden. The authors see the British government's sealing of records relating to the episode until 2045 as lending support to this deduction. This tragic WWII episode is not unknown, and questions about it have been previously raised. But these two authors give the most thorough account of it. Jacob's first-hand experiences and the authors' inspection of the limited official and historical records which are available make this work stand out."},{"Title":"The 100-Year Secret: Britain's Hidden World War II Massacre","review":"If you're contemplating purchase of this book, odds are, you already know something about the Cap Arcona tragedy. This book won't teach you much more. This was written from one survivor's perspective, and regrettably, a lot of the book deals with life in the camps and the march to the Cap Arcona rather than the sinking or the attack itself. It takes a painfully long time to get to the attack on the ship, and once there, the details are slim and as I stated, from only one rather limited perspective. This one's worth getting if it's on sale, but the photos are poor and this book doesn't do the 5,000 plus victims of the Cap Arcona justice. Both books on the Wilhelm Gustloff sinking are far superior to this much larger volume."},{"Title":"The 100-Year Secret: Britain's Hidden World War II Massacre","review":"Just when they thought help was on the way, the survivors of the concentration camp where attacked by their supposed rescuers.

From the moment I first witnessed its performance, Boubill and Schonberg's LES MISERABLES, inspired by Victor Hugo's novel, has held me in thrall. The musical is nothing short of magnificent in its portrayal of growing despair leading to revolutionary explosion among the proletariat and the idealistic students who identify with the \\"noble workingman.\\" It is relentlessly realistic in its depiction of the crushing of that revolution by the State, yet ends with the inspiring challenge to \\"be strong and stand with me\\" to achieve a better world \\"when tomorrow comes.\\" However, for all my admiration of this musical, I could have explained very little of the actual history that gave rise to it, and that is why I came to Harsin's book.I've included this introduction so that those who may read this will understand that my reaction to BARRICADES is not that of the historian or the specialist in the evolution of French government. Indeed, it seems to me that concentrating one's interest in early to mid-nineteenth century French politics would likely appeal to very few academicians. My reactions to the book are those of a general reader, one who was drawn to what is really a very specialized study by a desire to understand the historical reality behind a widely read novel and the musical spun from it.My goals were very largely met, for I now have a much better understanding of the tumultuous succession of monarchies, empires, and republics that characterized that period of French politics and governments. Harsin puts human hands and faces on sterile historical facts and events that are more or less reported in world history textbooks that most American high school students must struggle through. The competing societies and clubs, the ambiguous and changing fealties of the Parisian national guard, the waxing and waning of moderate and extreme republican factions, the growth of socialist and communist groups, and the intentional exclusion of women from the masculine society of republican politics all emerge from the veil of history to present a picture of a society in political and social upheaval. We also see the bitter irony in that the abdication of King Louis-Philippe brings no reward to the militant montagnard republicans, whose further attempts at social revolution are brutally suppressed by the moderate republican government that succeeds the monarchy.As with my feelings of satisfaction, my frustrations with Harsin's book are those of a general reader and are likely not shared by competent historians. She occasionally refers to events (\\"Bloody Week,\\" for example) that are outside the period illuminated by her book. Inasmuch as I have no idea of the meaning of most such events, I'm at a loss as to their significance to the history at hand. Brief explanatory footnotes would have been helpful in such cases. Harsin also feels free to include quite a few French terms that she feels would suffer a loss of nuance through translation into English. Inasmuch as quite a few years have passed since I grappled with the French language in the university, I found that reference to my well-thumbed translating dictionary was an occasional necessity. Explanatory footnotes would, once again, have sped up the research process. My final criticism is merely that the wealth and depth of detail in Harsin's book may bog down the general reader who is perhaps more interested in a larger picture of the republican movement in the era. I say this in full awareness that a professional historian would likely find this to be another strength of the book. However, from my own limited perspective, I must judge the overall readability of the book at three stars and its research and detail at five, hence my \\"compromise\\" rating of four. If you, like me, find yourself emotionally captivated by LES MISERABLES, novel or musical, I believe that you will find Harsin's account of the real history behind it to be worthy of your reading time and effort."},{"Title":"Barricades: The War of the Streets in Revolutionary Paris, 1830-1848","review":"This is a very good history of the revolutionary turmoil in the period between 1830 and 1848, with the trials and tribulations of the Montagnard movement centerpiece to the account. The left seems discredited now, but if we consider the endless reactionary attempts to foment difficulties at the birth of republican government we can see the heroic quality of the period beyond the incidents of (endless) failure. This period also illuminates the writings and thought of Marx who is the child of this generation and a participant in this revolutionary drama at the rising moment of industrial/capitalist civilization. We ouwe a debt to this classic period when the conservatives resisted the birth of democracy every step of the way. Class struggle was no fiction in this period, and the naked combat, betrayal, and exploitation of class and class division in age of the barricades vividly illustrates the Marxian analysis, whatever one's view of Marx's later theories."},{"Title":"Barricades: The War of the Streets in Revolutionary Paris, 1830-1848","review":"Victor Hugo's fictional account of the student uprising of 1832 in Les Miserables is so vividly written that it will always form the images of 19th Century French republicanism in the popular imagination.Jill Harsin's barricades is a good historical overview of the same era. It moves a little too quickly and is drying written in parts, but since it's one of the only detailed accounts of the movement that existed between the revolutions of 1830 and 1848 in English, it deserves 5 stars.Among other things, you leave wondering if all of those tourists snapping photos of Mont Saint-Michel are aware that all through the 1830s and 1840s it was used as a concentration camp for political prisoners.August Blanqui, an important but forgotten historical figure (the real precursor to Lenin), is discussed in great detail."},{"Title":"True bear stories","review":"Califronia as it once was.
