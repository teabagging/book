One of history's greatest artists, we are often told, had a special affinity for Judaism. With so many of Rembrandt's works devoted to stories of the Hebrew Bible, and with his apparent penchant for Jewish themes and the sympathetic portrayal of Jewish faces, it is no wonder that the myth has endured for centuries. Rembrandt's Jews puts this myth to the test as it examines both the legend and the reality of Rembrandt's relationship to Jews and Judaism. In his elegantly written and engrossing tour of Jewish Amsterdam which begins in 1653 as workers are repairing Rembrandt's Portuguese-Jewish neighbor's house and completely disrupting the artist's life and livelihood Steven Nadler tells us the stories of the artist's portraits of Jewish sitters, of his mundane and often contentious dealings with his neighbors in the Jewish quarter of Amsterdam, and of the tolerant setting that city provided for Sephardic and Ashkenazic Jews fleeing persecution in other parts of Europe. As Nadler shows, Rembrandt was only one of a number of prominent seventeenth-century Dutch painters and draftsmen who found inspiration in Jewish subjects. Looking at other artists, such as the landscape painter Jacob van Ruisdael and Emmanuel de Witte, a celebrated painter of architectural interiors, Nadler is able to build a deep and complex account of the remarkable relationship between Dutch and Jewish cultures in the period, evidenced in the dispassionate, even ordinary ways in which Jews and their religion are represented far from the demonization and grotesque caricatures, the iconography of the outsider, so often found in depictions of Jews during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Through his close look at paintings, etchings, and drawings; in his discussion of intellectual and social life during the Dutch Golden Age; and even through his own travels in pursuit of his subject, Nadler takes the reader through Jewish Amsterdam then and now a trip that, under ever-threatening Dutch skies, is full of colorful and eccentric personalities, fiery debates, and magnificent art.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3sWuCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Westerners (Five Star First Edition Western)","description":"When this unforgettable novel was first published in a much shorter form in a magazine in 1914, it was a rousing success and was made into a movie four times by 1941.

And so a masterpiece of Western fiction remained unpublished in book form for more than 80 years. Finally, this powerful tale is available in its entirety. Buck Duane's father was a gunfighter who died by the gun and, in accepting a drunken bully's challenge, Duane himself was forced into the life of an outlaw.

The groundbreaking book that redefines what it means to be smart, with a new introduction by the author  A thoughtfully written, persuasive account explaining emotional intelligence and why it can be crucial.  USA Today Everyone knows that high IQ is no guarantee of success, happiness, or virtue, but until Emotional Intelligence, we could only guess why. Daniel Goleman's brilliant report from the frontiers of psychology and neuroscience offers startling new insight into our  two minds  the rational and the emotional and how they together shape our destiny.

These factors, which include self-awareness, self-discipline, and empathy, add up to a different way of being smart and they aren t fixed at birth. Although shaped by childhood experiences, emotional intelligence can be nurtured and strengthened throughout our adulthood with immediate benefits to our health, our relationships, and our work.

This vision, which is rooted in the intellectual debates of his epoch, cements his ideas into a coherent whole and provides a compelling defence of modernity. The main feature of Oakeshott's vision of modernity is seen here as radical plurality resulting from 'fragmentation' of experience and society. On the level of experience, modernity denies the existence of the hierarchical medieval scheme and argues that there exist independent ways of understanding our world, such as science and history, which cannot be reduced to each other. On the level of society, modernity finds expression in liberal doctrine, according to which society is an aggregate of individuals each pursuing his or her own choices. For Oakeshott, to be modern means not only to recognise this condition of radical plurality but also to learn to appreciate and enjoy it. Oakeshott did not think that it was possible to find a comprehensive philosophical justification for modernity, therefore the only way to preserve modern civilisation seemed to be an appeal to sentiment. As a consequence he was a passionate defender of liberal education as the best way to underwrite the 'conversation of mankind.'","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZKO7BAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"One More Spring","description":"In the spring of 1941 the Nazis invaded Greece, and by the end of April, they had invaded most of the islands of the Aegean, including the beautiful Lesbos, home of young Takis (Peter Kalellis). While cycling to school, fifteen-year-old Takis was horrified to see a swastika flying atop the old castle in Mytilene, the island's capital city. Later in the day, the soldiers ransacked his home town of Moria, and a Nazi lieutenant confiscated his bike. That night, under cover of darkness, Takis violated the curfew to remove the direction signs erected by the Germans. So began the struggle against the invaders. This riveting account of fighting and enduring the occupation is both a memoir of harrowing times and a story of Kalellis and his three idealistic, fiercely loyal young friends who defy the invading powers and suffer the consequences of imprisonment and torture. It is also the story of the people of the ancient city of Mytilene who cling to the hope of liberation and freedom for three long years. On September 10, 1944, Lesbos was officially liberated. The four young men who survived the occupation were able to see the emancipation of their beloved homeland, and life gradually returned to normal as they went their separate ways. As Takis left for America, his comrade Papavasile handed him a small vial, saying, Take this with you, Takis. It is a little vial of earth - Greek earth. You can look upon it as an amulet to ward off evil and grief. There is nothing more precious, my son, than this little piece of Greece, cooled by nocturnal winds, baptized in the blood of the brave, and scented by Aegean breezes. Takis kissed his hand. I'll keep it close to my heart and draw strength from it. And some day, Papavasile responded, come back to us.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uhlLAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Set-Up-to-Fail Syndrome (HBR OnPoint Enhanced Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DbKwAAAAIAAJ&dq=The+Set-Up-to-Fail+Syndrome+(HBR+OnPoint+Enhanced+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cycling the Mediterranean: Bicycle Tours in Spain, France, Italy, Greece, and Beyond (The Active Travel Series)","description":"The Active Travel Series Cycling the MediterraneanBy Kameel Nasr.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yIKnQlk0viwC&dq=Cycling+the+Mediterranean:+Bicycle+Tours+in+Spain,+France,+Italy,+Greece,+and+Beyond+(The+Active+Travel+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nazism and War (Modern Library Chronicles)","description":"An incendiary work of scholarship arguing that racism was the driving force behind Nazism, rather than a by-product of it essential reading in an age of renewed fears of bigotry, tyranny, and fascism. World War II was the defining event of the twentieth century, redrawing the political map in ways that continue to affect nearly the entire human race. What was unprecedented, however, was not simply the war s scale, but its causes. Unlike previous territorial or political clashes, the war launched by Nazi Germany was an ideological one, waged to wipe entire peoples and cultures from the face of the earth. In Nazism and War, Richard Bessel, one of the preeminent authorities on the social and political history of modern Germany, demonstrates that  Nazi war was racial struggle; Nazi racial struggle was war.  War was the anvil on which Hitler s worldview was forged: German National Socialism emerged triumphant over a country deeply scarred by defeat and eager to reclaim its greatness. As a political philosophy, Nazism glorified struggle and conflict, viewing them as the purpose of a nation and a measure of its overall condition. As a political movement and state system, Nazism made its ideology real, plunging the European continent into a war of annihilation and a sea of blood. Nazism destroyed the old Europe, and thus helped to create the world in which we live. Praise for Nazism and War  [A] stimulating and thoughtful volume.

It s from the cross that Jesus' full humanity draws us closest to him. It s from the cross, as Jesus breathes his last breath and speaks his last words, that his deep trust in the Father and his divine glory are revealed. Those who listen to Jesus' last words from the cross will discover what he most wants them (the world) to hear and will experience an intimate and divine awe only available to those who are willing to draw near his cross. In Seven Words, Susan Robb looks at the seven last words of Christ on the cross through a lens that finds life and hope in his final sayings, while exploring each from a biblical and historical perspective. The book brings a hopeful and contemplative take on the cross during the weeks of Lent. Additional components for a six-week study include a DVD featuring Susan Robb and a comprehensive Leader Guide.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-GjTDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+seven+words&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Elmo Pops In!

Such crisis involves their impact on, and role within, society; their popularity among students and scholars; and their identity as producers and promoters of knowledge. The modern western world and its economic policies have been identified as the strongest cause of such a crisis. Creating the conditions for, but in fact encouraging it. However, a self-critical assessment of the situation is called for. Our primary fault as humanists was that of stubbornly thinking that the world s changes could never really affect us, as  we felt  our identity was sacred. In the light of these approaches, the main strengths of humanities have been identified in the ability to: promote critical thinking and analytical reasoning; provide knowledge and understanding of democracy and social justice; develop leadership, cultural and ethical values. The main problems of humanities are the lack economic relevance; the socio-institutional perception of them as  impractical  and unemployable; the fact that they do not match with technological development. Finally, the resulting crisis consists mainly in the absence (or radical reduction) of funding from institutions; a decrease in student numbers a decrease in interest; a loss of centrality in society. A Numanities (New Humanities) project should consider all these aspects, with self-critical assessment on the first line. The goal is to unify the various fields, approaches and also potentials of the humanities in the context, dynamics and problems of current societies, and in an attempt to overcome the above-described crisis. Numanities are introduced not as a theoretical paradigm, but in terms of an  umbrella-concept  that has no specific scientific content in it: that particularly means that the many existing new fields and research trends that are addressing the same problems (post-humanism, transhumanism, transformational humanities, etc.) are not competitors of Numanities, but rather possible ways to them. Therefore, more than a theoretical program, Numanities intend to pursue a mission, and that is summarized in a seven-point manifesto. In the light of these premises and reflections, the book then proceeds to identify the areas of inquiry that Numanities, in their functions and comprehensive approach, seek to cover. The following list should also be understood as a statement of purposes for this entire book series. These, in other words, will be the topics/areas we intend to represent. Once elaborated on the foundations of Numanities, the book features a second part that presents two case studies based on two relatively recent (and now updated) investigations that the author has performed in the fields of musical and animal studies respectively. The two cases (and relative areas of inquiry) were selected because they were considered particularly relevant within the discussion of Numanities, and in two different ways. In the first case-study the author discussed the most typical result (or perhaps cause?) of the technophobic attitude that was addressed in the first part of the book: the issue of  authenticity , as applied, in the author's particular study, to popular music. In the second case-study, he analyzes two different forms of comparative analysis between human and non-human cognition: like in the former case, this study, too, is aimed at a critical commentary on (what the author considers) redundant biases in current humanistic research  anthropocentrism and speciesism.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=unZCDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Taking Positions: On the Erotic in Renaissance Culture","description":"\\"The book is generously illustrated and includes full translations of the infamous sonnets that Pietro Aretino wrote to accompany I modi.

The European theater of operations)","description":"(Includes maps) To many an Allied soldier and officer and to countless armchair strategists, World War II in Europe appeared near an end when in late summer of 1944 Allied armies raced across northern France, Belgium, and Luxembourg to the very gates of Germany. That this was not, in fact, the case was a painful lesson that the months of September, October, November, and December would make clear with stark emphasis. The story of the sweep from Normandy to the German frontier has been told in the already published Breakout and Pursuit. The present volume relates the experiences of the First and Ninth U.S. Armies, the First Allied Airborne Army, and those American units which fought under British and Canadian command, on the northern flank of the battle front that stretched across the face of Europe from the Netherlands to the Mediterranean. The operations of the Third U.S. Army in the center, from mid-September through mid-December, have been recounted in The Lorraine Campaign; those of the Seventh U.S. Army on the south will be told in The Riviera to the Rhine, a volume in preparation. Unlike the grand sweep of the pursuit, the breaching of the West Wall called for the most grueling kind of fighting. Huge armies waged the campaign described' in this book, but the individual soldier, pitting his courage and stamina against harsh elements as well as a stubborn enemy, emerges as the moving spirit of these armies. In the agony of the Huertgen Forest, the frustration of MARKET-GARDEN, the savagery of the struggle for Aachen, the valor of the American soldier and his gallant comrades proved the indispensable ingredient of eventual victory.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lOb2sgEACAAJ&dq=The+Siegfried+Line+campaign+(United+States+Army+in+World+War+II.+The+European+theater+of+operations)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"CIVILIZATION.","description":"Perhaps the French philosopher's masterpiece, which is concerned with an extraordinary question: What does it mean to be mad?","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=U68zY4-nb1wC&dq=CIVILIZATION.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Disciplines of Life","description":"How does God mold us into the image of Christ?

She charts the historic and contemporary relationships between colleges, athletics, and white middle-class communities that ensure white suburban youth are advantaged in special athletic admissions. Suburban youth start ahead in college admissions because athletic merit the competencies desired by university recruiters requires access to vast familial, communal, and economic resources, all of which are concentrated in their neighborhoods.

Insisting that such methodology can actually be taught, it tries to make the mental processes underlying the practice of a \\"concept-driven sociology\\" more explicit. Many sociologists tend to study the specific, often at the expense of also studying the generic. To correct this imbalance, the book examines the theoretico-methodological process by which we can \\"distill\\" generic social patterns from the culturally, historically, and situationally specific contexts in which we encounter them. It thus champions a \\"generic sociology\\" that is pronouncedly transcontextual (transcultural, transhistorical, transsituational, and translevel) in its scope. In order to uncover generic, transcontextual social patterns, we need to collect our data in a wide range of social contexts. Such contextual diversity is manifested multi-culturally, multihistorically, multisituationally, as well as at multiple levels of social aggregation. True to its message, the book illustrates generic social patterns by drawing on numerous examples from diverse cultural contexts and historical periods and a wide range of diverse social domains, as well as by disregarding scale. Emphasizing cross-contextual commonality, generic sociology tries to reveal formal \\"parallels\\" across seemingly disparate contexts. The book features the four main types of cross-contextual analogies generic sociologists tend to use (cross-cultural, cross-historical, cross-domain, as well as cross-level), disregarding conventionally noted substantive differences in order to note conventionally disregarded formal equivalences\\"--","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ty8DEAAAQBAJ&dq=Generally+Speaking&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Adolescence and Youth in Early Modern England","description":"This book is an investigation of youth and adolescence in pre-industrial England.

Every family has secrets. Ours were just bigger than others. \\"My earliest memory is of a gun.\\" That gun was in his father's hand - and it was pointed at his mother's head. John Davis grew up in the 1970s and '80s on the rough streets of Brooklyn, a place where no one thought twice when parents smacked around their kids-or each other. At the center of the tumultuous neighborhood, and John's world, was his larger-than-life father, Roberto. The Argentinean butcher and kingpin drug dealer was a sadistic bully whose mercurial temper left a trail of tears and chaos across his family. John, in particular, seemed to bear the brunt of Roberto's wildly swinging moods. Any wrong word could cause an explosion. Every knock on the door might be one of Roberto's enemies, or the police. In his publishing debut, Davis recounts how he spent his childhood in constant terror and his teen years learning to fight back. But it was much later, as an adult, that he learned the most shocking thing of all about his father, his past, and himself. Told with raw honesty and deep emotion, My Father's Son is a memoir of fear, abuse, survival, and identity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=D1PijwEACAAJ&dq=My+father%27s+son&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Sleepless Mind: Why are there left-handed water fountains?","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Imperial Screen: Japanese Film Culture in the Fifteen Years' War, 1931-1945 (Wisconsin Studies in Film)","description":"From the late 1920s through World War II, film became a crucial tool in the state of Japan.

Found here is the record of his views of postmodernism and the work of such contemporary figures as Paul Ricoeur, George Steiner, Frank Kermode, and the late Norman Perrin. As background, Wilder also includes two pieces that fill in the story of his own encounter with biblical scholarship dating back to meeting Albert Schweitzer at Oxford in 1922. In 1961 John Dominic Crossan authored Wilder's intellectual biography for the Society of Biblical Literature's series on biblical scholarship in North America (A Fragile Craft: The Work of Amos Niven Wilder). The chapter \\"Wilder on Crossan on Wilder\\" offers an enticing dividend of this overview of New Testament studies in the twentieth century by a scholar whose active career spanned more than six decades.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JhOvCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Real Wild West: The 101 Ranch and the Creation of the American West","description":"Cowboy theatrics and rich American history are revealed in this chronicle of the famous Wild West review that brings together Geronimo, Buffalo Bill, Will Rogers, and many others to explore the grandeur, and the tragedy, of the American West.

It was never published. But in a draft prospectus Whitman described  a new book . . . with its framework jotted down on the battlefield, in the shelter tent, by the wayside amid the rubble of passing artillery trains or the moving cavalry in the streets of Washington . . . a book full of the blood and vitality of the American people.  Walter Lowenfels has edited the book Whitman could only envision. From a mosaic of materials newspaper dispatches, letters, notebooks, published and unpublished works as well as thirty-six of Whitman's great war poems, Lowenfels has created a thrilling and unique document. Sixteen pages of drawings by Winslow Homer, another distinguished eyewitness, are reproduced here from the artist's field sketches. The result is a book that produces in the reader exactly what Whitman had hoped, one that captures  part of the actual distraction, heat, smoke, and excitement of those times.

Yet the Macedonian Campaign was, in Lord Hankey's words, 'the most controversial of all the so-called sideshows.' In his definitive The First World War (1999) Sir John Keegan hailed Alan Palmer for having written 'the best study of the Macedonian Front in English.' Palmer tells the story of this extraordinary polyglot army (it included, at various times, contingents from seven countries) from the first landing at Salonika in 1915 to the peace in 1918. He also illuminates the political and strategic background: the ceaseless argument in London and Paris over the army's future and the maze of Greek politics within which it and its commanders were enclosed.

Ryder discovers that in Paris, late 1944, a Jewish widow accused a German SS officer of stealing the painting. The officer was reported to have died in a car crash at the war's end, and the whereabouts of the Trabuc between then and now remain a mystery. Ryder's search for the widow's heirs leads him to Rachel Meredith, who teaches at NYU. The museum presents the painting to her in a spectacular public ceremony that winds up on the front page of newspapers around the world. Though the case is closed, Ryder can't seem to shake it. When Rachel Meredith is attacked, she calls on him; what might be a simple assault doesn't quite add up. And he still wonders who sent the van Gogh from Argentina. One of his most reliable contacts in the art world floats a theory that ties the van Gogh portrait to a black market auction in the 70's that might have involved a Swiss art dealer and an international crime kingpin with unlimited cash. Then Israel's Mossad pays Ryder a clandestine visit; the news splash about the van Gogh is the first link they've had to the SS officer in decades. Meanwhile, art dealers, auction houses, and museums vie to buy the van Gogh from Rachel Meredith. When she refuses to sell, the situation goes from predatory to violent. Ryder has to race against time to outmaneuver a cunning mastermind who will resort to as many murders as it takes to get hold of the Trabuc.

The greatest surprise I encountered in discussing this topic over the past ten years was the consistency with which I was asked a single unvarying question: Are you writing about physical pain or mental pain? The overwhelming consistency of this response convinces me that modern culture rests upon and underlying belief so strong that it grips us with the force of a founding myth. Call it the Myth of Two Pains. We live in an era when many people believe--as a basic, unexamined foundation of thought--that pain comes divided into separate types: physical and mental. These two types of pain, so the myth goes, are as different as land and sea. You feel physical pain if your arm breaks, and you feel mental pain if your heart breaks. Between these two different events we seem to imagine a gulf so wide and deep that it might as well be filled by a sea that is impossible to navigate.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PhJ2LOp4BW4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Tomb of Abysthor","description":"Restore an Abandoned Temple Enter the catacombs near the desecrated Temple of Muir, Goddess of Paladins, and search for the lost tomb of Abysthor.

Something has happened inside...something that will haunt many over the coming years. From acclaimed writer Guillermo Arriaga comes a multilayered drama in which six people separated by time and space discover that the past and the present have a curious way of affecting them: Mariana and Santiago, teenagers in a small New Mexico town, attempt to understand through forbidden love the mystery of the tragic end of Mariana's mother and Santiago's father; Sylvia, a troubled woman living in Portland, undertakes an emotional odyssey to resolve a sin from her past; Gina and Nick grapple with their intense, clandestine affair in the New Mexico desert; and Maria, a young Mexican girl, helps her mother find forgiveness and love. The story of The Burning Plain explores many themes that are constant throughout the work of Guillermo Arriaga: the weight that the dead exert over the living; the paradoxical nature of love; alienated characters in search of identity; and people with physical and emotional scars who come from the dark extremes of life with the hope of finding redemption. \\"The structure of The Burning Plain,\\" says Arriaga,\\"differs from other films I have written in the sense that this is only one story, but told through different time frames. We watch the characters for a period of around twelve years. I wanted to create a story of connections and consequences.

Each chapter radically dissents from one or more mainstream opinions about deviance. The first chapter examines the alleged causes for the decline of American poolrooms and finds them wanting, traces the rise and fall of poolrooms to historical changes in America's social structure, and cogently dissects the recent poolroom revival. The second chapter, reports a field study of a deviant occupation, pool hustling, describing the hustler's work situation and career from recruitment to retirement. In revealing how pool hustlers, although dedicated wholly to a vocation that merely breaks unenforced gambling laws, frequently supplement their income by means of outright felonies, the author develops a new theory of \\"crime as moonlighting.\\" The third chapter sharply criticizes our criminology textbooks for avoiding the study of uncaught adult criminals in their natural environments. It demonstrates such research to be both necessary and practical with career felons as well as moonlighters. The author describes field techniques he has used with career felons, offers new findings gleaned by means of these techniques, and answers moral objections to such research. The forth chapter presents the first genuinely empirical study of the beat delinquent sub-culture, in which the author corrects some journalistic views such as that most beats are exhibitionists and some sociological ones such as that \\"retreatist\\" drug-users can meet neither legitimate nor criminal success norms. The final chapter, on the sociology of pornography, holds that the courts are wrong to claim that naturalistic erotic art is non-pornographic, and wronger still to claim that hard-core pornography is, in Mr. Justice Brennan's words, \\"utterly without redeeming social importance.\\" The author's unusual blend of","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Jx4uDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wireless Web Development","description":"Rischpater's second edition has new coverage of HTML, WAP 2.0, XML, Palm's WCA and iMode in detail and improves the text of the first edition with time-tested information.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tfHUf1yRkhUC&dq=Wireless+Web+Development&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mary Peters,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TLrUqwghTCMC&dq=Mary+Peters,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Inn at Little Washington Cookbook: A Consuming Passion","description":"This cookbook is the distillation of a life's work by a self-taught American chef who learned to cook by reading cookbooks and went on to become one of the world's most renowned chefs. O'Connell began his career with a catering business in an old farmhouse, cooking on a wood stove with an electric frying pan purchased for $1.49 at a garage sale. (The pan was used for boiling, saut eing and deep frying for parties of up to 300 guests.) This experience sharpened his awareness of how much could be done with very little. The catering business evolved into a country restaurant and Inn which opened in 1978 in a defunct garage and which is now America's only 5 star Inn. Craig Claiborne raves, \\"the most magnificent inn I've ever seen, in this country or Europe, where I had the most fantastic meal of my life.\\" This is not a typical \\"Chef's Cookbook\\" filled with esoteric, egomanical, and impossibly complicated recipes which only a wizard with a staff of eighty would ever attempt to produce.

Everyday ingredients are elevated to new heights through surprising combinations and seductive presentations.

Careful and detailed instructions, all written by the author, assure success.

But unlike the Spartans, who succumbed to overwhelming Persian forces at Thermopylae more than two thousand years before, the Confederate underdogs triumphed in a battle that over time has become steeped in hyperbole. Providing a meticulously researched, scholarly account of this remarkable victory, Sabine Pass at last separates the legends from the evidence. In arresting prose, Edward T. Cotham, Jr., recounts the momentous hours of September 8, 1863, during which a handful of Texans almost all of Irish descent under the leadership of Houston saloonkeeper Richard W. Dowling, prevented a Union military force of more than 5,000 men, 22 transport vessels, and 4 gunboats from occupying Sabine Pass, the starting place for a large invasion that would soon have given the Union control of Texas. Sabine Pass sheds new light on previously overlooked details, such as the design and construction of the fort (Fort Griffin) that Dowling and his men defended, and includes the battle report prepared by Dowling himself. The result is a portrait of a mythic event that is even more provocative when stripped of embellishment.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0pDZDAAAQBAJ&dq=Sabine+Pass:+The+Confederacy%27s+Thermopylae+(Clifton+and+Shirley+Caldwell+Texas+Heritage)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ether, God & Devil & Cosmic Superimposition","description":"These companion volumes, long out of print, are now presented together for the first time so that the reader may better grasp their essential unity. In Ether, God and Devil, Wilhelm Reich describes the process of functional thinking and reveals how the inner logic of this objective thought technique led him to the discovery of cosmic orgone energy. In Cosmic Superimposition, Reich steps beyond the character structure of man to an understanding of how man is rooted in nature. The super-imposition of two orgone-energy systems which is demonstrable in the genital embrace is revealed as a common functioning principal that exists in all of nature. Concluding this work, Reich returns to the human sphere \\"to ponder about the greatest riddle of all: the ability of man to think, and by mere thinking to know what nature is and how it works.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lHNEmyyR4VUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stammering,: Its cause and cure","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_TwuAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wolverines (Animal Scavengers)","description":"008-012.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=F2alAgAAQBAJ&dq=Wolverines+(Animal+Scavengers)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Encyclopedia of Ancient Egyptian Architecture","description":"The definitive reference on the diverse monuments built by the ancient Egyptians across three millennia, this generously illustrated volume surveys the ancient world's most remarkable architecture. Dieter Arnold--a leading expert on Egyptian building and design--includes more than 300 illustrations and 600 alphabetically arranged entries spanning every type of building and every aspect of construction and design. He provides separate entries for each of the major Egyptian sites, from Abu Simbel in the south to Cleopatra's palaces in Alexandria. These document ordinary towns and houses as well as monuments as varied as the Step Pyramid of Djoser (the world's first significant stone building), the tombs of the Valley of the Kings, Hatshepsut's mortuary temple at Deir el-Bahari, and the great temples that line the Upper Nile. Other entries cover materials (from reed and mud-brick to sandstone and granite) and construction techniques (including pyramid building and the erection of obelisks). The accessible text also addresses the symbolic meanings of various types of building, the importance of building orientation, and myriad architectural features, such as columns and false doors. Destined to be the standard reference for years to come, this comprehensive encyclopedia offers a welcome overview of the magnificent structures that continue to lure pilgrims and tourists, impress architects, and inspire awe. It will be enjoyed by serious devotees of architecture and archaeology as well as by armchair travelers and all who have wondered how the great pyramids were built.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XIns9M_9DcgC&dq=The+Encyclopedia+of+Ancient+Egyptian+Architecture&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"B Is for Bethlehem (Picture Puffins)","description":"Rhyming verses introduce the letters of the alphabet and the events surrounding the birth of Jesus.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dMo2YxK3Aj8C&dq=B+Is+for+Bethlehem+(Picture+Puffins)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Citizen's Guide to Lobbying Congress","description":"Individuals and grassroots organizations interested in becoming involved in petitioning their government will discover essential information on the techniques and laws to lobbying in this clear and enlightening guide.

The New York Times  Absorbing the definitive life story.   Kirkus Reviews  A fascinating study.   Los Angeles Times In The Chairman, the authoritative biography of John J. McCloy, Pulitzer Prize-winning author Kai Bird chronicles the life of the man labeled  the most influential private citizen in America.  Against the backgrounds of World War II, the Cold War, the construction of Pax Americana, the Cuban missile crisis, the Kennedy assassination, and Vietnam, Bird shows us McCloy s astonishing rise from self-described  chore boy  to  chairman of the Establishment.  His powerful circle shaped the postwar globe. But McCloy stood out among them as a towering figure of achievement: as a Wall Street lawyer who earned the confidence of captains of industry and presidents; as Henry Stimson s right-hand man at the War Department; as president of the World Bank and chairman of the Chase financial empire; and as presidential adviser. Bird captures every facet of this self-made man. We see McCloy s commercial acumen as the most in-demand lawyer of Wall Street; his dictatorial will as high commissioner of occupied Germany; and his stoic loyalty as adviser to Presidents FDR, Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Carter, Ford, and Reagan. Bird brilliantly explores how McCloy came to epitomize the American Establishment and the values of a generation that led the United States through bitter war and unparalleled prosperity.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-f9QDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beethoven the creator,","description":"Many of the earliest books, particularly those dating back to the 1900s and before, are now extremely scarce and increasingly expensive.

As with the first edition, it explores the interaction between psychology and epistemology and addresses empirical questions about how we should arrive at our beliefs, and whether the processes by which we arrive at our beliefs are the ones by which we ought to arrive at our beliefs. The new material includes a critical examination of Quine's views on epistemology by Jaegwon Kim and an interesting psychological approach to our understanding of natural kinds by Ellen Markman. In other new chapters Jerry Fodor places the notion of observation in a naturalistic perspective, Christopher Cherniak shows how work in the theory of computational complexity bears on the form of an epistemological theory, and Alvin Goldman looks at the relationship between our ordinary epistemological concepts and those of a scientific epistemol-ogy. The prospects for improving our inductive inferences are examined by John Holland, Keith Holyoak, Richard Nisbett, and Paul Thagard, and Stephen Stich suggests a way in which normative concepts may be integrated into a naturalistic epistemology. The book retains articles by W. V. 0. Quine, Alvin I. Goldman, Hilary Kornblith, Philip Kircher, Michael Friedman, Fred Dretske, Richard Nisbett and Lee Ross, Gilbert Harman, and Stephen P.

In addition to the text of the original, Dr Hill provides thirteen new chapters which take account of otherpublications since the first edition, bringing his work up-to-date in a stimulating and enjoyable way. This book poses the problem of how, after centuries of rule by King, lords, and bishops, when the thinking of all was dominated by the established church, English men and women found the courage to revolt against Charles I, abolish bishops, and execute the king in the name of his people. Thefar-reaching effects and the novelty of what was achieved should not be underestimated - the first legalized regicide, rather than an assassination; the formal establishment of some degree of religious toleration; Parliament taking effective control of finance and foreign policy on behalf of gentryand merchants, thus guaranteeing the finance necessary to make England the world's leading naval power; abolition of the Church's prerogative courts (confirming gentry control at a local level); and the abolition of feudal tenures, which made possible first the agricultural and then the industrialrevolution. Christopher Hill examines the intellectual forces which helped to prepare minds for a revolution that was much more than the religious wars and revolts which had gone before, and which became the precedent for the great revolutionary upheavals of the future.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RrEqAQAAMAAJ&dq=Intellectual+origins+of+the+English+revolution&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hermann and Dorothea","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Sir Isaac Pitman,: His life and labors,","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TWtfoRq6B_wC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"SCRIBES, SCROLLS AND SCRIPTURE (BIBLICAL CLASSICS LIBRARY)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WK1pPwAACAAJ&dq=SCRIBES,+SCROLLS+AND+SCRIPTURE+(BIBLICAL+CLASSICS+LIBRARY)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Benjamin Franklin Takes the Case (The Benjamin Franklin Mysteries) (Pine Street Books)","description":"More than ten years ago, Robert Lee Hall made a startling discovery. Within a secret compartment of an old armoire once owned by his great aunt, he found a yellowing manuscript describing a series of mysterious criminal cases. What made these stories so unusual was that they were solved by the renowned scientist and statesman, Benjamin Franklin, while he was a resident of London to plead the case of the American colonies before the British crown. Written by Hall's ancestor, Nick Handy, who happened to be Franklin's assistant throughout these adventures, Hall transcribed the tales and presented them in the order of their occurrence. In Benjamin Franklin Takes the Case, the first mystery in Hall's series, the great Doctor Franklin meets the young orphan Nick Handy in the print shop of an old friend. When his friend is suddenly murdered, it is up to Franklin and Nick to prove who was responsible for the grisly deed. Turning detective, Franklin pursues the strange case along the dark byways of London and into its grand houses, uncovering a theft ring, a profitable trade in slaves and prostitutes, and strong reasons to believe that Nick is in grave danger. Employing his keen sense of scientific observation and his inventor's creative mind, the doctor is able to solve a case that the constables had thought would be impossible to break.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ruIKAAAACAAJ&dq=Benjamin+Franklin+Takes+the+Case+(The+Benjamin+Franklin+Mysteries)+(Pine+Street+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Exploring Exodus (Bible study textbook series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Bj3MxQEACAAJ&dq=Exploring+Exodus+(Bible+study+textbook+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"VIP Ency of Religious Phenomena","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5IjWAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Errol Flynn: The Life and Career","description":"Errol Flynn set the standard for the modern action hero in films like The Adventures of Robin Hood, Dodge City, and The Sea Hawk.

It was published on 8 June 1949 by Secker & Warburg as Orwell's ninth and final book completed in his lifetime. Thematically, \\"Nineteen Eighty-Four\\" centres on the consequences of totalitarianism, mass surveillance, and repressive regimentation of persons and behaviours within society. Orwell, himself a democratic socialist, modelled the authoritarian government in the novel after Stalinist Russia. More broadly, the novel examines the role of truth and facts within politics and the ways in which they are manipulated. The story takes place in an imagined future, the year 1984, when much of the world has fallen victim to perpetual war, omnipresent government surveillance, historical negationism, and propaganda. Great Britain, known as Airstrip One, has become a province of a totalitarian superstate named Oceania that is ruled by the Party who employ the Thought Police to persecute individuality and independent thinking. Big Brother, the leader of the Party, enjoys an intense cult of personality despite the fact that he may not even exist. The protagonist, Winston Smith, is a diligent and skillful rank-and-file worker and Outer Party member who secretly hates the Party and dreams of rebellion. He enters into a forbidden relationship with a colleague, Julia, and starts to remember what life was like before the Party came to power.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PEpoEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Miss Tallulah Bankhead","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sTAoAAAAMAAJ&dq=Miss+Tallulah+Bankhead&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Getting Away With Murder.","description":"\\"Presents a true account of the murder of fourteen-year-old Emmett Till in Mississippi in 1955 and the lasting impact of his death\\"--","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yqhCDwAAQBAJ&dq=Getting+Away+With+Murder.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ferrara's little Italian cookbook","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=biqJngEACAAJ&dq=Ferrara%27s+little+Italian+cookbook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"100 Years of American LaFrance (An Illustrated History)","description":"From the creation of the American-LaFrance Fire Engine Co. in 1904 through the company's latest deliveries in 2004, McCall provides insight into the company's often complex corporate history with emphasis on the development of ALF motor fire apparatus.

Priscilla L. Walton and Manina Jones focus on this recent proliferation of women writers of detective fiction, providing the first book-length study of the historical and societal changes that fueled this popularity, along with insightful and entertaining readings of the texts themselves. Walton and Jones place the genre within its aesthetic, social, and economic contexts, reading it as an index of cultural beliefs. Addressing the ways that Sara Paretsky, Sue Grafton, Marcia Muller, and others work through the conventions of the \\"hard-boiled\\" genre made popular by writers such as Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler, and Mickey Spillane, the authors show how the male hard-boiled tradition has been challenged and transformed. Issues of child, spousal, and sexual abuse are more likely to surface in women's detective novels, the authors show, and female sleuths face many of the same dilemmas as those who read about them everyday problems with relationships, parenting, and money. Detective Agency also integrates interviews with authors and publishers, reader surveys, publication data, and analysis of internet discussion groups to present a fascinating picture of the \\"industry\\" of women's detective fiction. Authors of these works are powerful players in the publishing system as well as agents of cultural intervention, Walton and Jones claim. They conclude by examining the rise of female detectives in television and film.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KyYsWAn2w8sC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Of Midnight Born","description":"Sixteen-year-old Kylie Galen thinks her misbehavior in the wake of her grandmother's death and her parents' separation are the reasons she has been sent to Shadow Falls Camp, but learns it is a training ground for vampires, werewolves, and other \\"freaky freaks,\\" of which she may be one.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vcnXAQAAQBAJ&dq=Of+Midnight+Born&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Aquatic Habitats: Exploring Desktop Ponds, Grades 2-6","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Fi02BGSVm0QC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pestilence","description":"Tracing the history of infectious diseases from the Philistine plague of 11th century BCE to recent SARS and avian flu scares, this volume provides descriptions of more than 700 epidemics, listed alphabetically by location of the outbreak.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tzRwRmb09rgC&dq=Pestilence&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Quality, Reliability, and Process Improvement","description":"Thoroughly revised and updated, this widely acclaimed reference/text is both an ideal teaching source and a succinct working manual for organizing effective quality-reliability programs in any industrial plant.

James Reston, Jr. offers a gripping narrative of the epic battle that left Jerusalem in Muslim hands until the twentieth century, bringing an objective perspective to the gallantry, greed, and religious fervor that fueled the bloody clash between Christians and Muslims. As he recounts this rousing story, Reston brings to life the two legendary figures who led their armies against each other.

One of the world s most respected authors of science fiction imagines an apocalyptic near-future Earth where a remarkable young woman discovers that her destiny calls her to try and change the world around her. Octavia E. Butler s brilliant two-volume Earthseed saga offers a startling vision of an all-too-possible tomorrow, in which walls offer no protection from a civilization gone mad. Parable of the Sower: In the aftermath of worldwide ecological and economic apocalypse, minister s daughter Lauren Oya Olamina escapes the slaughter that claims the lives of her family and nearly every other member of their gated California community. Heading north with two young companions through an American wasteland, the courageous young woman faces dangers at every turn while spreading the word of a remarkable new religion that embraces survival and change. Parable of the Talents: Called to the new, hard truth of Earthseed, the small community of the dispossessed that now surrounds Lauren Olamina looks to her their leader for guidance. But when the evil that has grown out of the ashes of human society destroys all she has built, the prophet is forced to choose between preserving her faith or her family. The Earthseed novels cement Butler s reputation as  one of the finest voices in fiction period  (TheWashington Post Book World). Stunningly prescient and breathtakingly relevant to our times, this dark vision of a future America is a masterwork of powerful speculation that ushers us into a broken, dangerously divided world of bigotry, social inequality, mob violence, and ultimately hope.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VG-9DgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Beginning (Chronicles of the Door #1)","description":"Creation...the fall of man...God's relationship with his people...the birth of Christ...his resurrection.

It's these parts of the South, so often ignored, that have caught Theroux's keen traveler's eye.

She crafts for us an excellent experience.   USA Today From internationally bestselling author Tracy Chevalier, author of A Single Thread, comes a riveting drama of a pioneer family on the American frontier 1838: James and Sadie Goodenough have settled where their wagon got stuck  in the muddy, stagnant swamps of northwest Ohio. They and their five children work relentlessly to tame their patch of land, buying saplings from a local tree man known as John Appleseed so they can cultivate the fifty apple trees required to stake their claim on the property. But the orchard they plant sows the seeds of a long battle. James loves the apples, reminders of an easier life back in Connecticut; while Sadie prefers the applejack they make, an alcoholic refuge from brutal frontier life. 1853: Their youngest child Robert is wandering through Gold Rush California. Restless and haunted by the broken family he left behind, he has made his way alone across the country. In the redwood and giant sequoia groves he finds some solace, collecting seeds for a naturalist who sells plants from the new world to the gardeners of England. But you can run only so far, even in America, and when Robert s past makes an unexpected appearance he must decide whether to strike out again or stake his own claim to a home at last. Chevalier tells a fierce, beautifully crafted story in At the Edge of the Orchard, her most graceful and richly imagined work yet.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=h95JBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The 2000 Hispanic Scholarship Directory","description":"The only book of its kind, The 2000 Hispanic Scholarship Directory is a must for all Hispanics in college and those headed for college.

Throughout the centuries there was a need for masters who possessed highly effective martial skills for positions in the military, protection services, and law enforcement. Out of this historical reality emerged a national treasure we call taijiquan. Chen-style taijiquan formulated during the days of military strategist Qi Jiguang (15281587), and its founder is considered to be militia battalion commander Chen Wangting (16001680). The art evolved. Its mystique remains fundamentally a true fighting art, including bare-handed forms and applications, plus an arsenal of weapons that includes the spear, straight sword, broadsword, and halberd. Then there are the associated training methods used to master this complete system, such as qigong, push-hands, and standing post. All of these practices are infused with knowledge associated with the physical and mental aspects of the human condition. Chen style encompasses a complete martial system. It has a deserved reputation for its combative efficiency, but also as a health-nurturing modality. The vastness of the Chen-style curriculum is way beyond the scope of most people to fully learn, so practitioners focus on what they can handle. Usually a solo routine is sufficient. Since all taiji styles stem from the original Chen family system, the Chens certainly share in the credit for taiji s popularity in general, especially as an exercise purely for health benefits. Regardless of taiji style be it Chen, Yang, Wu, Sun, Hao, or other any serious taiji practitioner or scholar should have some understanding of the Chen family roots to get a vision of the whole tree. This two-volume anthology brings much of the rich heritage conveniently together for your reading. In this first volume, prepare yourself to sit at the feet of the main representatives of the Chen Village, including Chen Xiaowang, Chen Xiaoxing, and Wang Xi an. Read rare text from Chen Xin, a member of the literati who expounded on the inner workings of Chen taiji by utilizing Daoist and traditional medical knowledge. In addition to the detailed history and penetrating philosophy you ll find here, perhaps of greater importance are the clear explanations outlining each step in the learning process toward mastering Chen-style taiji. Only a very high-level teacher can understand what methods of instruction work best. Students don t know; that s why they should follow a teacher s instructions as closely as possible. Chapters included here clarify what proper training entails and why much time and effort (gongfu) are necessary to gain results. As echoed among practitioners in taiji s birthplace:  If you drink water from Chen Village, your feet know how to kick.  This two-volume edition brings you to the village for traditional instruction.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oz8QEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Reach for the Sky: The Story of Douglas Bader, Legless Ace of the Battle of Britain","description":"Douglas Bader was a legend in his lifetime. After losing both legs in a 1931 air crash and being dismissed by the Royal Air Force, he fought his way back into the cock-pit of a Spitfire and became one of the great heroes of the Battle of Britain. Bader's story is so extraordinary that no one would dare invent it, and his accomplishments have been an inspiration to many. Told he would never walk without a cane, Bader became not only one of the RAF's top combat pilots but a squadron leader and innovator of fighter tactics.

Equates Celtic customs with Native American traditions and rituals ?

In Walking the Maze she explores Celtic culture both in comparison to Native American ways of life and in its own light and strength, examining the attributes that define and sustain the vitality of the Celtic spirit. Four aspects of traditional Celtic life common to both Celtic and Native American cultures are kinship consciousness, a high regard for women as part of a general commitment to freedom, a fluid perspective of reality, and a primal spiritual engagement with the land. For the Celts this crafted rugged, land-loving individualists, fierce and free in their expression, gracious to all, answerable directly to Spirit but responsible for the entire community. This vision of Celtic spirit informs the vision of how we may live in the present, renewing a cultural integrity that is inseparable from personal wholeness and ecological consciousness.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=z14oDwAAQBAJ&dq=Walking+the+Maze:+The+Enduring+Presence+of+Celtic+Spirit&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Old Mr. Toad","description":"Peter Rabbit and the other woodland animals discover that they have misjudged Old Mr. Toad, who also learns some important lessons.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9Hp8DwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Adventures+of+Old+Mr.+Toad&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Mystery of the Pink Waterfall","description":"Before his death, Jennie Maria's grandfather gives her the clues to a secret which will provide the orphan with a secure home.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WNKqpwAACAAJ&dq=The+Mystery+of+the+Pink+Waterfall&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Christian yoga","description":"People often equate yoga with Eastern religion, but Brooke Boon sees it as an exercise style that Christians can use to generate patience, strength, and deeper worship.

Ambrose s D-Day is the definitive history of World War II s most pivotal battle, a day that changed the course of history. D-Day is the epic story of men at the most demanding moment of their lives, when the horrors, complexities, and triumphs of life are laid bare. Distinguished historian Stephen E. Ambrose portrays the faces of courage and heroism, fear and determination what Eisenhower called  the fury of an aroused democracy  that shaped the victory of the citizen soldiers whom Hitler had disparaged.Drawing on more than 1,400 interviews with American, British, Canadian, French, and German veterans, Ambrose reveals how the original plans for the invasion had to be abandoned, and how enlisted men and junior officers acted on their own initiative when they realized that nothing was as they were told it would be. The action begins at midnight, June 5/6, when the first British and American airborne troops jumped into France. It ends at midnight June 6/7. Focusing on those pivotal twenty-four hours, it moves from the level of Supreme Commander to that of a French child, from General Omar Bradley to an American paratrooper, from Field Marshal Montgomery to a German sergeant. Ambrose s D-Day is the finest account of one of our history s most important days.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=N3mEH3ozXL0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tommy's Train Ride on the Alaska Railroad","description":"Bonnie Pennington moved to Alaska's Kenai peninsula with her family in 1981.

Never engraved or published in the poet/artist's lifetime, the poem remains in a single manuscript, apparently unfinished and heavily revised, and yet is widely celebrated as one of Blake's most powerful narrative works. Ault challenges the view that the poem is intrinsically incomplete and flawed, arguing instead that the famous difficulties of the text are aspects of Blake's transformative narrative strategies. By respecting the integrity of Blake's work, taking every written mark on the page as potentially functional, Ault shows how the intricate interweaving of narrative patterns and interruptions are instrumental to conscious reading. The poetic intent is nothing less than a complete renovation of the reading experience, the potential of which is the realization of what Blake has called Four-fold vision. Ault's approach serves as a guide both to reading The Four Zoas and to participating in a radical poetic method.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xPQKAQAAMAAJ&dq=Narrative+Unbound:+Re-visioning+William+Blake%27s+The+Four+Zoas&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The African Condition: A Political Diagnosis","description":"The noted political scientist Ali Mazrui explores six fundamental paradoxes of Africa today, focusing on Africa's key geographical position in relation to issues of economic distribution and social justice.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_e43AAAAIAAJ&dq=The+African+Condition:+A+Political+Diagnosis&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Maurice: A novel","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=N2jWvgEACAAJ&dq=Maurice:+A+novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Baseball Reader: Favorites From the Fireside Books of Baseball","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Y6TW-c7fyocC&dq=The+Baseball+Reader:+Favorites+From+the+Fireside+Books+of+Baseball&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Religion: A Cross-Cultural Dictionary (Oxford Paperback Reference)","description":"\\"This encyclopedia is a welcome exploration of the great variety of social networks that human beings create and participate in.

August Wilson has already given the American theater such spell-binding plays about the black experience in 20th-century America as Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, Joe Turner's Come and Gone, and the Pulitzer Prize-winning Fences. In his second Pulitzer Prize-winner, The Piano Lesson, Wilson has fashioned perhaps his most haunting and dramatic work. At the heart of the play stands the ornately carved upright piano which, as the Charles family's prized, hard-won possession, has been gathering dust in the parlor of Berniece Charles's Pittsburgh home. When Boy Willie, Berniece's exuberant brother, bursts into her life with his dream of buying the same Mississippi land that his family had worked as slaves, he plans to sell their antique piano for the hard cash he needs to stake his future. But Berniece refuses to sell, clinging to the piano as a reminder of the history that is their family legacy. This dilemma is the real \\"piano lesson,\\" reminding us that blacks are often deprived both of the symbols of their past and of opportunity in the present.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Gk-iDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"*Signed* Annemarie's Cookingschool Cookbook","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1eAwAAAACAAJ&dq=*Signed*+Annemarie%27s+Cookingschool+Cookbook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fabulous Beast (Silhouette Promo)","description":"This collector's edition of an out-of-print romance is by one of the genre's most popular authors--Jayne Ann Krentz, writing as Stephanie James.

They give a fresh, absorbing picture of the early years of the colony of Pennsylvania and of the inner (as well as outer) life of London Quaker merchant James Claypoole, who was by turns generous and penny-pinching, forbearing with important clients, intolerant with others, deeply religious, often irritable--but certainly never dull. He loaned large sums of money to his brothers and friends, knowing he would never get it back, yet he haggled for months over tiny debts. A man of peace, he quarreled with most of his correspondents, writing them verbose sermons but continuing to do business with them. He was strictly honest in all his business dealings, but he cheated the Customs when he could and was furious when they caught and fined him. He was a good friend of William Penn and George Fox, and of all the leading Quakers of the day. He was hard-working and popular in his Meeting, and one can only conclude that he had charm. Claypoole also had intelligence, as Fox and Penn consulted him about their writings, and he helped Penn draft the Frame of Government for Pennsylvania. He held a prominent post in the Free Society of Traders. As the letter book begins about the time Penn was granted his colony, the reader can follow, week by week, the founding of the state, in which Claypoole played an important part. The reader can also see the frustrations in the life of a seventeenth-century merchant and the workings of an expanding colonial trade. Although Claypoole was in debt when he left London to follow Penn to Philadelphia, when he died a few years later he was one of the richest merchants in that infant town.

Robert Byrnes, writing in the Journal of Modern History, called him \\"one of the most remarkable men in the Western world working in the field.\\" Over a span of three decades, in books ranging from Russia and Germany to the recent Black Hundred, he has won a reputation as a major writer and a provocative thinker. Now he turns his attention to the greatest enigma of our time: the rise and fall of the Soviet Union. In The Dream that Failed, Laqueur offers an authoritative assessment of the Soviet era--from the triumph of Lenin to the fall of Gorbachev. In the last three years, decades of conventional wisdom about the U.S.S.R. have been swept away, while a flood of evidence from Russian archives demands new thinking about old assumptions. Laqueur rises to the challenge with a critical inquiry conducted on a grand scale. He shows why the Bolsheviks won the struggle for power in 1917; how they captured the commitment of a young generation of Russians; why the idealism faded as Soviet power grew; how the system ultimately collapsed; and why Western experts have been so wrong about the Communist state. Always thoughtful and incisive, Laqueur reflects on the early enthusiasm of foreign observers and Bolshevik revolutionaries--then takes a piercing look at the totalitarian nature of the Soviet Union. We see how Communist society stagnated during the 1960s and '70s, as the economy wobbled to the brink; we also see how Western observers, from academic experts to CIA analysts, made wildly optimistic estimates of Moscow's economic and political strength. Just weeks before the U.S.S.R. disappeared from the earth, scholars were confidently predicting the survival of the Soviet Union. But in underscoring the rot and repression, he also notes that the Communist state did not necessarily have to fall when it did, and he examines the many factors behind the collapse (the pressure from Reagan's Star Wars arms program, for instance, and ethnic nationalism). Some of these same problems, he finds, continue to shape the future of Russia and the other successor states. Only now, in the rubble of this lost empire, are we coming to grips with just how wrong our assumptions about the U.S.S.R. had been. In The Dream That Failed, an internationally renowned historian provides a new understanding of the Soviet experience, from the rise of Communism to its sudden fall. The result of years of research and reflection, it sheds fresh light on a central episode in our turbulent century.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=imDnBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Global Sourcing (The Purchasing Excellence Series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=W3MHAAAACAAJ&dq=Global+Sourcing+(The+Purchasing+Excellence+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Name Above the Title An Autobiography","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0mZZAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Name+Above+the+Title+An+Autobiography&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hurricane Hex (Charmed)","description":"When Phoebe, Piper, and Paige head to the Sunshine State to visit friends, they discover that their friends have taken up practicing folk magic and are soon facing a dangerous hurricane that may be unnaturally influenced by the spells.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Uhp2cI8TxR4C&dq=Hurricane+Hex+(Charmed)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tigers on the Tenth Day and Other Stories (Emerging Voices (Quartet))","description":"Satirical stories of Syria and the Arab world look at the abuse of power by men over women, the rich over the poor, and the strong over the weak.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=66sPAAAAYAAJ&dq=Tigers+on+the+Tenth+Day+and+Other+Stories+(Emerging+Voices+(Quartet))&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"New mind, new body: Bio-feedback; new directions for the mind","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0SSvnhNqPhQC&dq=New+mind,+new+body:+Bio-feedback%3B+new+directions+for+the+mind&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Trophy Hunt (A JOE PICKETT NOVEL)","description":"In this thriller in the #1 New York Times bestselling Joe Pickett series, the Wyoming game warden is up against a vicious killer who's more beast than man...

During World War II, SS Hauptsturmf hrer Nikolaus  Klaus  Barbie earned a reputation for sadistic cruelty unmatched by all but a handful of his contemporaries in Adolf Hitler s Gestapo. In 1942, he was dispatched to Nazi-occupied France after leaving his bloodstained mark on the Netherlands. In Lyons, Barbie was entrusted with  cleansing  the region of Jews, French Resistance fighters, and Communists, an assignment he undertook with unparalleled enthusiasm. Thousands of people died on Barbie s orders during his time in France often by his own hand including forty-four orphaned Jewish children and captured resistance leader Jean Moulin, who was tortured and beaten to death. When the Allies were approaching Lyons in the months following the D-Day invasion, Barbie and his subordinates fled, but not before brutally slaughtering all the prisoners still being held captive. But the war s conclusion was not the end of the Klaus Barbie nightmare. With the dawning of the Cold War, the  Butcher of Lyons  went on to find a new purpose in South America, just as tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union were escalating. Soon, Barbie had a different employer who valued his wartime experience and expertise as an anti-communist man hunter and murderer: the US intelligence services. In Klaus Barbie, investigative journalist and documentary filmmaker Tom Bower tells the fascinating, startling, and truly disturbing story of a real-life human monster, and draws back the curtain on one of America s most shocking secrets of the Cold War.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=idv5DQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Electrolux Service Parts & Accessories Catalog July 2004","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=v9pcPQAACAAJ&dq=Electrolux+Service+Parts&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I ching.El libro del cambio","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xxdLDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THe Process","description":"Ulys O.

This new book by acclaimed author Paul Gillcrist is a series of true stories about the U.S. Navy carrier aviation from the perspective of a Navy pilot who spent thirty-three years directly involved in that exciting profession. The book begins with a series of vignettes in the period of the mid-1950s when the U.S. Navy introduced swept wing, jet-powered fighters into the aircraft carrier navy, flying from straight-deck carriers whose flight decks were made of teak wood. The thread of stories follows the author's career in chronological sequence, in various venues throughout the Navy. There are accounts from his first carrier deployment to the western Pacific, followed by events as a weapons delivery instructor at the predecessor to TOPGUN in El Centro, California. Some of his experiences as a Navy pilot are recorded in a section about Patuxent River, Maryland, the Navy's test center. Additional episodes include an unforgettable wing-walking flight. flying Japanese Zeros in the movie TORA!TORA!TORA! and the author's subsequent tour of duty in Pentagon conducting proficiency flights from our nation's capital. There are also accounts of combat missions over Vietnam and the author's experiences in both wing commander jobs, flying the F-4 Phantom II and the F-14 Tomcat. The last story is about his two flights, as a fifty-two year old Admiral, in the controversial F-20 Tigershark. These vignettes combine humor, hair-raising excitement and tragedy. Rear Admiral Paul T. Gillcrist, a U.S. Navy fighter pilot, served also as a test pilot and weapons delivery instructor, and actively flew from sixteen aircraft carriers for over twenty-seven years. The author writes with authority as a former fighter squadron commanding officer who recorded 167 combat missions over Vietnam flying the F-8 Crusader. Subsequently, he commanded a carrier air wing and finally served, the rank of Rear Admiral, as the wing commander for all pacific Fleet fighter squadrons. His pilot's logbook includes over 6,000 hours, in seventy-one different types of aircraft from 1952 to 1981. He retired in 1985 as Assistant Deputy Chief of Naval Operations(air Warfare). He is also the author of TOMCAT!The Grumman F-14 Story, and CRUSADER!

Ophuls is a giant, an architect of the modern world: a Resistance hero and best-selling author, brilliant economist and clandestine US intelligence official. But it is as Ambassador to India that the seeds of his demise are planted, thanks to another of his great roles irresistible lover. Visiting the Kashmiri village of Pachigam, Ophuls lures an impossibly beautiful dancer, the ambitious (and willing) Boonyi Kaul, away from her husband, and installs her as his mistress in Delhi. But their affair cannot be kept secret, and when Boonyi returns home, disgraced and obese, it seems that all she has waiting for her is the inevitable revenge of her husband: Noman Sher Noman, Shalimar the Clown.

Knowingly or not, he elevateda group of women to extraordinary heights and changed the way a nation was governed. Six Wives is a masterful work of history that intimately examines the rituals of diplomacy, marriage, pregnancy, and religion that were part of daily life for women at the Tudor Court. Weaving new facts and fresh interpretations into a spellbinding account of the emotional drama surrounding Henry's six marriages, David Starkey reveals the central role that the queens played in determining policy. With an equally keen eye for romantic and political intrigue, he brilliantly recaptures the story of Henry's wives and the England they ruled.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FAwtlwEACAAJ&dq=Six+Wives:+The+Queens+of+Henry+VIII&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stories of the Modern South: Revised Edition","description":"Some of the greatest storytellers of our time chronicle twentieth-century southern life.

In Race and the Politics of Deception, Christopher Mele unpacks America s history of dealing with racial problems through the inequitable use of public space. Mele focuses on Chester, Pennsylvania a small city comprised of primarily low-income, black residents, roughly twenty miles south of Philadelphia. Like many cities throughout the United States, Chester is experiencing post-industrial decline. A development plan touted as a way to  save  the city, proposes to turn one section into a desirable waterfront destination, while leaving the rest of the struggling residents in fractured communities. Dividing the city into spaces of tourism and consumption versus the everyday spaces of low-income residents, Mele argues, segregates the community by creating a racialized divide. While these development plans are described as socially inclusive and economically revitalizing, Mele asserts that political leaders and real estate developers intentionally exclude certain types of people most often, low-income people of color. Race and the Politics of Deception provides a revealing look at how our ever-changing landscape is being strategically divided along lines of class and race.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xAl3DQAAQBAJ&dq=Racial+Politics+in+American+Cities+(3rd+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Whitetail: Fundamentals and Fine Points for the Hunter","description":"A detailed study of deerhunting includes hunting lore, rules for pursuit, and an analysis of the habits of the prey","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bkKetAEACAAJ&dq=Whitetail:+Fundamentals+and+Fine+Points+for+the+Hunter&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Through Tibet to Everest, (The kingfisher library)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=t7tFngEACAAJ&dq=Through+Tibet+to+Everest,+(The+kingfisher+library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pat The Money: Babybuster's First book","description":"Published more than 50 years ago, the original Pat the Bunny has sold millions of copies en route to its reign as one of the best-selling children's books ever.

The benefits of restrictive diets like paleo and keto have been touted for more than a decade, but as renowned gastroenterologist Dr. Will Bulsiewicz, or \\"Dr. B,\\" illuminates in this groundbreaking book, the explosion of studies on the microbiome makes it abundantly clear that elimination diets are in fact hazardous to our health. What studies clearly now show--and what Dr. B preaches with his patients--is that gut health is the key to boosting our metabolism, balancing our hormones, and taming the inflammation that causes a host of diseases. And the scientifically proven way to fuel our guts is with dietary fiber from an abundant variety of colorful plants. Forget about the fiber your grandmother used to take--the cutting-edge science on fiber is incredibly exciting. As Dr. B explains, fiber energizes our gut microbes to create powerhouse postbiotics called short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that are essential to our health. SCFAs are scientifically proven to promote weight loss, repair leaky gut, strengthen the microbiome, optimize the immune system, reduce food sensitivities, lower cholesterol, reverse type 2 diabetes, improve brain function, and even prevent cancer. Restrictive fad diets starve the gut of the critical fiber we need, weaken the microbes, and make our system vulnerable. As a former junk-food junkie, Dr. B knows firsthand the power of fiber to dramatically transform our health. The good news is that our guts can be trained. Fiber-rich, real foods--with fruits, vegetables, whole grains, seeds, nuts, and legumes--start working quickly and maintain your long-term health, promote weight loss, and allow you to thrive and feel great from the inside out. With a 28-day jumpstart program with menus and more than 65 recipes, along with essential advice on food sensitivities, Fiber Fueled offers the blueprint to start turbocharging your gut for lifelong health today.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=P9C7DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Harlem of the West - The San Francisco Fillmore Jazz Era","description":"Examines the San Francisco jazz scene of the 1940s and 1950s, focusing on the Fillmore District, including its restaurants, shops, and nightclubs, and the musical legacy of such performers as Dizzy Gillespie and Lionel Hampton.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CmXozgOGN3wC&dq=Harlem+of+the+West+-+The+San+Francisco+Fillmore+Jazz+Era&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Starlight Rider","description":"Young Hugh Tracy's spread straddled the best and nearest water supply in the territory, and greedy Tade Shadrow wanted it.

Born Chawa Zloczewer into a Jewish family in Poland, Adams emigrated to the United States in 1912. The young woman befriended anarchists, sold radical publications, took a new name, and ran lesbian-and-gay-friendly speakeasies in Chicago and New York. Then, in 1925, Adams risked all to write and publish a book titled Lesbian Love. In a repressive era, long before today's gay liberation movement, when American women had just gained the right to vote, Adams's bold activism caught the attention of the young J. Edgar Hoover and the US Bureau of Investigation, leading to her surveillance and arrest. In a case that pitted immigration officials, the New York City police, and a biased informer against her, Adams was convicted of publishing an obscene book and of attempted sex with a policewoman sent to entrap her. Adams was jailed and then deported back to Europe, and ultimately murdered by Nazis in Auschwitz. In Sex Rebel: The Daring Life and Deadly Times of Eve Adams, acclaimed historian Jonathan Ned Katz has recovered the extraordinary story of an early, daring activist. Drawing on startling evidence, carefully distinguishing fact from fiction, Katz presents the first biography of Adams, and the publisher reprints the long-lost text of Adams's rare, unique book Lesbian Love.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OAb3DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Danny and Life on Bluff Point - Book 5: My Horse Sally","description":"The sixth in a series of historical novels for children, Danny and Life on Bluff Point: The Conflict finds the Lee family engaged in a social conflict that will test their values.

And for good reason: The answer is important! Who we are - or who we think we are - drives our actions and shapes our relationships. While we are asking the right questions about identity, the world is busy feeding us the wrong answers: We are our political party, job title, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity - and the list goes on. But until we know why we were created, by whom, and for what purpose, we can never be truly satisfied. In Who Am I, Lord?, author and speaker Joe Heschmeyer tackles the question of identity by asking two even more important questions: Who is Jesus? Who does he say you are? Only when we understand who Christ really is can he show us who we are. Our identity in Christ opens us to the promises he has made us and leads us to the freedom to be who we were created to be. Who Am I, Lord? will answer the question of your identity in a way that will transform your life.

This book provides a valuable support to students of the dance as they learn to expand the joy and freedom they experience as they consciously execute these simple movements. Gently, steadily, those who dance regularly discover the ability of the PanEuRhythmy to transform their lives. \\"Dance of the Soul\\" provides a lovely and treasured introduction to a spiritual expression that is a most powerful way of preparing ourselves and blessing our world as we enter a new millennium.

Sicily,  said Goethe,  is the key to everything.  It is the largest island in the Mediterranean, the stepping-stone between Europe and Africa, the link between the Latin West and the Greek East. Sicily s strategic location has tempted Roman emperors, French princes, and Spanish kings. The subsequent struggles to conquer and keep it have played crucial roles in the rise and fall of the world s most powerful dynasties. Yet Sicily has often been little more than a footnote in books about other empires. John Julius Norwich s engrossing narrative is the first to knit together all of the colorful strands of Sicilian history into a single comprehensive study. Here is a vivid, erudite, page-turning chronicle of an island and the remarkable kings, queens, and tyrants who fought to rule it. From its beginnings as a Greek city-state to its emergence as a multicultural trading hub during the Crusades, from the rebellion against Italian unification to the rise of the Mafia, the story of Sicily is rich with extraordinary moments and dramatic characters. Writing with his customary deftness and humor, Norwich outlines the surprising influence Sicily has had on world history the Romans  fascination with Greek civilization dates back to their sack of Sicily and tells the story of one of the world s most kaleidoscopic cultures in a galvanizing, contemporary way. This volume has been a long time coming Norwich began to explore Sicily s colorful history during his first visit to the island in the early 1960s. The dean of popular historians leads his readers through the millennia with the steady narrative hand of a master teacher or the world s most learned tour guide. Like the island itself, Sicily is a book brimming with bold flavors that begs to be revisited again and again. Praise for Sicily  Suavely readable . . . The very model of a popular historian, [Norwich] writes to give pleasure to the common reader. And what pleasure it is.  The Wall Street Journal  Entertaining on every page . . . There is something ancient and sorrowful in Sicily,  some dark, brooding quality,  just as captivating as its spellbinding history or its beautiful and varied landscapes, from beaches to lemon groves, pine forests to volcanoes. . . . The most amiable and freewheeling of guides, Norwich will always find time for the amusing anecdote.  The Sunday Times  Utterly engrossing . . . written with passion about the art and architecture of this magical island, filled with gossipy tidbits and sweeping historical theories.  The Daily Beast  Dazzling . . . Norwich is an elegantly graceful and entertaining storyteller.  Richmond Times-Dispatch  Charming . . . richly nuanced history relayed with enormous fondness.  Kirkus Reviews  A brisk and always-lively tour.  Open Letters Monthly  Norwich is deeply in love with Sicily.

No other work shows like this the actual ground on which the battles were fought and about which so many words continue to be written. The vast battlescapes are interspersed with poignant individual photographs and the recollections of the soldiers caught in the action.The last time most of the panoramas were viewed - in the trenches - they were marked TOP-SECRET and destined for the eyes of the commanding officer only. Taken at huge personal risk by specialist photographers during the war, the panoramas reveal what no other photographs can - the view beyond the trench parapet - and a great deal more. Each panorama offers a view of up to 160 degrees, so sharply focused that the individual figures of a waiting sniper or a soldier picking lice from his shirt can be made out.

Yet Sibley's history reveals universal tensions about the duality of the nineteenth century frontiersman who is at once an accommodating trade partner of the Indian/European/Metis worlds and the conquering government official of the ever-expanding West. Rhoda Gilman has spent over thirty years examining Sibley--through hints and fragments of stories that Sibley himself left in articles, an unfinished autobiography, and scores of family letters--and uncovers in this perceptive and balanced biography the complexities of a man who embodied these clashing extremes. As Gilman writes in her preface, On the broader stage of national history Sibley's life spanned nineteenth-century America. Rooted in the political and social establishment of the old Northwest Territory, he witnessed the colonizing of a continent and its people, the closing of the frontier, the agony of civil war, and the explosive birth of an urban, industrial society. He was keenly conscious of what he conceived to be the nation?s destiny, and he identified closely with it. An heir to the Indian policy of Lewis Cass, who had managed to dispossess the Great Lakes tribes without war, Sibley belonged to the generation that was left to pay the price of that betrayal in blood and shame. And unlike Cass, he had personal ties to the Dakota people that placed him in a deeply ambiguous position. Gilman sets the controversial but altogether human Sibley against the tapestry of trade, politics, frontier expansion, and intercultural relations in the Upper Mississippi valley, and reminds us that throughout his life Sibley was poised to become a national figure but always chose to remain in the place he loved and had helped to name \\"Minnesota.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ROTYf9G8tEcC&dq=Henry+Hastings+Sibley:+Divided+Heart&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Blue - Nosed Witch","description":"Trick or treating is a new game for a real little witch.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lKEZm7XFEXEC&dq=The+Blue+-+Nosed+Witch&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Men and The Girls","description":"The book breaks all the rules about treating alcoholism.

As the first historical study of how masculinity and, particularly, homosexuality were understood in Mexico in the national era, this book not only provides \\"queer readings\\" of major canonical texts of the period but also uncovers a variety of unknown texts from queer Mexican history.

The summit of Dryden's dramatic art, All for Love (1677) is a spectacle of passion as felt, feared, and disputed in the suspicious years following the English Civil War. Due to its dramatic compression and elegance, All for Love is one of the most enduring plays of the Restoration repertory. It was so successful that in the eighteenth century Dryden's tragedy drove Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra from the stage. The play depicts the catastrophic passion of Cleopatra and Marc Antony, who could not be conquered but by love.

Inspired by his own decision to abandon his family and career in order to establish himself as a professional writer, Anderson explores the guilts, routines, desires, and disappointments driving the lives of many Americans in the early-twentieth century. Although he is known today for his story collection Winesburg, Ohio, a pioneering work of Modernist fiction admired for its plainspoken language and psychological detail, Anderson s Many Marriages is a masterpiece in its own right.  There was a man named Webster lived in a town of twenty-five thousand people in the state of Wisconsin. He had a wife named Mary and a daughter named Jane and he was himself a fairly prosperous manufacturer of washing machines. [...] [A]t odd moments, when he was on a train going some place or perhaps on Sunday afternoons in the summer when he went alone to the deserted office of the factory and sat for several hours looking out through a window and along a railroad track, he gave way to dreams.  On an otherwise average day in his office at an Ohio washing machine factory, John Webster finds himself dreaming. He contemplates an affair with his young secretary, hears a number of voices in his head, and watches an angelic woman drift down the river on a raft beneath the afternoon sun. When he returns home after work, he struggles to look his wife and daughter in the face, feeling deep in his heart he will have to leave them soon. Despite spending his whole life in service of the mundane building his business, supporting his family, securing his finances Webster knows he can no longer live an impassionate life. He knows he must reinvent himself from scratch. With a beautifully designed cover and professionally typeset manuscript, this edition of Sherwood Anderson s Many Marriages is a classic of American literature reimagined for modern readers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tLg8EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE CONFESSION AND TRUE ACCOUNTS OF THE CRAZY CLAN","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=M2vIwAEACAAJ&dq=THE+CONFESSION+AND+TRUE+ACCOUNTS+OF+THE+CRAZY+CLAN&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Heritage Of Persia","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TtltAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Heritage+Of+Persia&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bed of Grass","description":"In this Americana romance from the New York Timesbestselling author, a single mother returns to her Maryland hometown, and a lost love.

The book includes new science in addition to previously published material, reflecting Hite's three decades of work probing the roots of human identity through questionnaires and theory. For the first time Hite formalizes her thinking on male adolescence, that boys feel tortured by the new social role they are forced to assume at puberty requiring a show of superiority toward females. In new detail Hite advances her understanding that sex is political, linking the expectation on women to achieve orgasm through coitus with broader patterns of oppression. Hite discusses new research on female adolescence, challenging the \\"virgin\\" hymen concept, and documenting that sexual awakening often precedes puberty. Hite also argues that pornography misrepresents male sexuality (not to mention female sexuality), depicting it as singular and silly instead of \\"full of intriguing, nuanced behavior involving the entire body, not just the penis.\\" The authoritative collection of her work, The Shere Hite Reader challenges the reader to a new way of seeing.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=b32mvCYhpf0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"HONOR THY FATHER","description":"\\"Brilliant . . .

But there is another homestead in this same barony of Desmond, of which and of its owner--as being its owner--I will say a word. Hap House was also the property of a Fitzgerald. It had originally been built by an old Sir Simon Fitzgerald, for the use and behoof of a second son, and the present owner of it was the grandson of that man for whom it had been built. And old Sir Simon had given his offspring not only a house--he had endowed the house with a comfortable little slice of land, either cut from the large patrimonial loaf, or else, as was more probable, collected together and separately baked for this younger branch of the family.

The account of modernism presented here challenges the vaunted principle of \\"vision itself.\\" And it is a very different story than we have ever read, not only because its insurgent plot and characters rise from below the calm surface of the known and law-like field of modernist painting, but because the voice is unlike anything we have heard before. Just as the artists of the optical unconscious assaulted the idea of autonomy and visual mastery, Rosalind Krauss abandons the historian's voice of objective detachment and forges a new style of writing in this book: art history that insinuates diary and art theory, and that has the gait and tone of fiction. The Optical Unconscious will be deeply vexing to modernism's standard-bearers, and to readers who have accepted the foundational principles on which their aesthetic is based. Krauss also gives us the story that Alfred Barr, Meyer Shapiro, and Clement Greenberg repressed, the story of a small, disparate group of artists who defied modernism's most cherished self-descriptions, giving rise to an unruly, disruptive force that persistently haunted the field of modernism from the 1920s to the 1950s and continues to disrupt it today. In order to understand why modernism had to repress the optical unconscious, Krauss eavesdrops on Roger Fry in the salons of Bloomsbury, and spies on the toddler John Ruskin as he amuses himself with the patterns of a rug; we find her in the living room of Clement Greenberg as he complains about \\"smart Jewish girls with their typewriters\\" in the 1960s, and in colloquy with Michael Fried about Frank Stella's love of baseball. Along the way, there are also narrative encounters with Freud, Jacques Lacan, Georges Bataille, Roger Caillois, Gilles Deleuze, and Jean-Fran?ois Lyotard. To embody this optical unconscious, Krauss turns to the pages of Max Ernst's collage novels, to Marcel Duchamp's hypnotic Rotoreliefs, to Eva Hesse's luminous sculptures, and to Cy Twombly's, Andy Warhol's, and Robert Morris's scandalous decoding of Jackson Pollock's drip pictures as \\"Anti-Form.\\" These artists introduced a new set of values into the field of twentieth-century art, offering ready-made images of obsessional fantasy in place of modernism's intentionality and unexamined compulsions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5JUwRiuOGigC&dq=Picasso:+At+Notre+Dame+de+Vie+(Her+Intimate+secrets+of+a+studio)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Alfred Stieglitz: Camera Work","description":"L'ensemble des reproductions des 50 num ros de la revue l gendaire Camera Work.

Betty A. DeBerg's groundbreaking study fills that important gap, analyzing the roots and character of fundamentalism in light of rapid changes and severe disruptions in gender-role ideology and actual social behavior in America between 1880 and 1930. Unlike interpreters such as George Marsden -- who has seen the contemporary Religious Right's concerns over feminism, abortion, and the breakdown of the family as recent developments -- DeBerg convincingly argues that these concerns were central in the \\"first wave of American fundamentalism.\\" - Back cover.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bJkRgooQLV0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Imani in Young Love & Deception","description":"Five teenagers--Imani, Bhriana, Tyler, Fatima, and Steven--are drawn together by love and lies as they face such problems of contemporary life as sexually trnsmitted diseases, alcoholism, pregnancy, and divorce.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0dCNcCKYfxUC&dq=Imani+in+Young+Love&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rock, Gem, and Mineral Collecting Sites in Western North Carolina","description":"This volume contains 53 of the best sites in the North Carolina area with detailed maps and GPS coordinates.

While describing the rise of Chinese nationalism and the accompanying discourse on Chinese national identity, it focuses on the national identity question and its impact on democratization. The text argues that Chinese nationalism is not monolithic and that popular Chinese nationalism attempts to exclude the role of the party-state in defining national identity. Most importantly, it has the potential to demand democratic reform and push for democratization in China. Nevertheless, the alliance between nationalism and democracy will expedient. Chinese nationalism, whether official or popular, comes into conflict with democracy when it confronts the national identity/boundary problem. They clash with each other where territoriality is involved. The Chinese nationalist solution to the problem is logically and inherently opposed to the contemporary trend towards democracy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=43-YDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary on Historical Principles.

This book will answer two basic questions: First, what is the extent of the significant research resources you will you miss if you confine your research entirely, or even primarily, to sources available on the open Internet? Second, if you are trying to get a reasonably good overview of the literature on a particular topic, rather than just \\"something quickly\\" on it, what are the several alternative methods of subject searching--which are not available on the Web--that are usually much more efficient for that purpose than typing keywords into a blank search box, with the results displayed by relevance-ranking computer algorithms? This book shows researchers how to do comprehensive research on any topic. It explains the variety of search mechanisms available, so that the researcher can have the reasonable confidence that s/he has not overlooked something important. This includes not just lists of resources, but discussions of the ways to search within them: how to find the best search terms, how to combine the terms, and how to make the databases (and other sources) show relevant material even when you don't know how to specify the best search terms in advance. The book's overall structuring by nine methods of searching that are applicable in any subject area, rather than by subjects or by types of literature, is unique among guides to research. Also unique is the range and variety of concrete examples of what to do--and of what not to do. The book is not \\"about\\" the Internet: it is about the best alternatives to the Internet--the sources that are not on the open Web to begin with, that can be found only through research libraries and that are more than ever necessary for any kind of substantive scholarly research. More than any other research guide available, this book directly addresses and provides solutions to the serious problems outlined in recent studies documenting the profound lack of research skills possessed by today's \\"digital natives.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lUZnBgAAQBAJ&dq=The+Oxford+Guide+to+Library+Research&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"PzKpfw V Ausf A, D & G: Panzer v Panther (Tanks in Detail)","description":"The story of one of the most famous combat vehicles of the 20th century, the German Panzerkampfwagen V \\"Panther\\" medium tank, would not have started without the confrontation of the Wehrmacht with the Soviet T-34. Following the alarming reports that began to be sent to Berlin from the fighting on the Eastern Front by Panzerwaffe units, the decision was made to build a completely new tank.

In Hindekker House, an aspiring journalist gets his big break. But, contrary to the typical genre of his tabloid employer, he works diligently to dispel a small town's larger than life urban legend. The reader soon realizes that what's going on in the house isn't the only mystery to be solved. What begins as a flirtatious male versus female challenge, with titillating and embarrassing stakes, migrates into a series of mean-spirited and baffling episodes. Incidents that seem like nothing more than depraved acts take on a new perspective when the reader begins to suspect there is a hidden purpose behind the madness. The unfolding mystery surrounding a young woman's harsh, sometimes startling, treatment of a man she barely knows overshadows the inexplicable events that have occurred in the now abandoned Hindekker House.

Thomas S. Burns marshals an abundance of archeological and literary evidence, as well as three decades of study and experience, to bring forth an unusually far-sighted and wide-ranging account of the relations between Romans and non-Romans along the frontiers of western Europe from the last years of the Republic into late antiquity. Looking at a 500-year time span beginning with early encounters between barbarians and Romans around 100 B.C. and ending with the spread of barbarian settlement in the western Empire around A.D. 400, Burns removes the barbarians from their narrow niche as invaders and conquerors and places them in the broader context of neighbors, (sometimes bitter) friends, and settlers. His nuanced history subtly shows how Rome's relations with the barbarians and vice versa slowly but inexorably evolved from general ignorance, hostility, and suspicion toward tolerance, synergy, and integration. What he describes is, in fact, a drawn-out period of acculturation, characterized more by continuity than by change and conflict and leading to the creation of a new Romano-barbarian hybrid society and culture that anticipated the values and traditions of medieval civilization.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lRsAEAAAQBAJ&dq=Rome+and+the+Barbarians,+100+B.C.-A.D.+400+(Ancient+Society+and+History)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Disciplinary Discourses: Social Interactions in Academic Writing","description":"Why do engineers \\"report\\" while philosophers \\"argue\\" and biologists \\"describe\\"? In the Michigan Classics Edition of Disciplinary Discourses: Social Interactions in AcademicWriting, Ken Hyland examines the relationships between the cultures of academic communities and their unique discourses. Drawing on discourse analysis, corpus linguistics, and the voices of professional insiders, Ken Hyland explores how academics use language to organize their professional lives, carry out intellectual tasks, and reach agreement on what will count as knowledge. In addition, Disciplinary Discourses presents a useful framework for understanding the interactions between writers and their readers in published academic writing. From this framework, Hyland provides practical teaching suggestions and points out opportunities for further research within the subject area. As issues of linguistic and rhetorical expression of disciplinary conventions are becoming more central to teachers, students, and researchers, the careful analysis and straightforward style of Disciplinary Discourses make it a remarkable asset. The Michigan Classics Edition features a new preface by the author and a new foreword by John M.

This Lynch is an idealistic conservative on a reformer's mission. Lynch promotes a return to the values inherent in a mythological America, but he indulges in a voyeuristic pleasure which he simultaneously condemns. Like Jeffrey peeking through the slats of Dorothy's closet in Blue Velvet, the viewer of Lynch's work is a rationalist plagued by his dreams; intrigued and repulsed, fascinated and judgmental, he both craves and resists cultural assimilation. Works presented include all features from Eraserhead to Mulholland Drive, shorts such as The Amputee and The Grandmother, and contributions to television such as Hotel Room and, of course, Twin Peaks. This study develops an idea of Lynch's politics, analyzes his work, and explores Lynch's paradox of condemning an immoral world through disturbing images and concepts, and touches on such points as the identifiable figure of evil in his works as well as the archetypes of the nymphet, well-meaning traditionalist, and struggling ethicist. Also included are a history of moralistic criticism in American literature and a review of existing Lynch criticism within this context.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UmxZ5icLnMoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Treasures","description":"The Pixar Treasures is a scrapbook of instinct and inspiration, experiences readers can touch, and visions that exist only in the imagination.

The last of Disney s golden age artists, including animators Eric Larson, Milt Kahl, Frank Thomas, and Ollie Johnston mentored the young dreamers, and as Pixar later developed, their work would draw heavily from this direct connection with Walt Disney s  Nine Old Men.  The tale continues with Pixar's foray into computer animation, and the resulting success of Toy Story. With chapters on A Bug's Life; Monsters, Inc.; Finding Nemo; The Incredibles; Cars; Ratatouille; and WALL*E, Hauser's narrative covers the struggles, growth, and successes of an incredible animation studio.

These are the letters Caleb Milne wrote to his mother while in the American Field Service. In May of 1943, he, with a small group of American Field Service men, responded to a call for volunteers to help the French. These Fighting French, under General Leclerc, had joined General Montgomery's 8th Army after that epic march from Lake Chad in Central Africa to Tunisia. Early the morning of May 11th, Caleb Milne was giving aid to a wounded Legionnaire when he was struck by a mortar shell. His wounds proved fatal and he died around 4:30 that afternoon. These letters, though very personal, are published with the thought that their message might reach beyond one mother. As Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings has said in her introduction:  This collection of his letters seems to me of permanent value, far beyond their satisfying of our avidity for news of the working of the minds of men who are fighting, for us, our battle. They reveal a rare soul, who passes on to us his own sensitive perceptions of the beauty and glory of living; and they are written in the style of true Belles-Lettres.  In tribute to Caleb Milne, who wrote to him on the meaning of music to a soldier, Deems Taylor, noted author and composer, said:  This, to me, is one of the most deeply felt and profoundly moving communications that the war has yet inspired. It is one of the war's major tragedies that young men capable of such vision, self-abnegation, and compassion could not be spared to help shape the peace that, God willing, will be as nearly permanent as men of good will can make it.

In The Art of Editing, Tim Groenland shows that the critical tendency to overlook the activities of editors and to focus on the solitary author figure neglects important elements of how literary works are acquired, developed and disseminated. Focusing on selected works of fiction by Raymond Carver and David Foster Wallace, authors who represent stylistic touchstones for US fiction of recent decades, Groenland presents two case studies of editorial collaboration. Carver's early stories were integral to the emergence of the Minimalist movement in the 1980s, while Wallace's novels marked a generational shift towards a more expansive, maximal mode of narrative. The role of their respective editors, however, is often overlooked. Gordon Lish's part in shaping the form of Carver's early stories remains under-explored; analyses of Wallace's fiction, meanwhile, tend to minimise Michael Pietsch's role from the creation of Infinite Jest during the mid-1990s until the present day. Drawing on extensive archival research as well as interviews with editors and collaborators, Groenland illuminates the complex and often conflicting forms of agency involved in the genesis of these influential works. The energies and tensions of the editing process emerge as essential factors in the creation of fictions more commonly understood within the paradigm of solitary authorship. The mediating role of the editor is, Groenland argues, inseparable from the development, form, and reception of these works.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PJoyEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"There Are No Ghosts in the Soviet Union: A Novella and Five Stories","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qE_oAAAACAAJ&dq=There+Are+No+Ghosts+in+the+Soviet+Union:+A+Novella+and+Five+Stories&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hell and Back: Reflections On Writers and Writing From Dante to Rushdie","description":"The author of the New York Times Notable Book Italian Neighbors shares his insights on classic and modern literature.

After years of abuse, Samson had evolved into a hateful and hated, maladjusted beast until the day he found his way to a rural Illinois farm, an ill-equipped owner, and one last chance. Mitch Bornstein's task was to tame the violent beast whose best defense had become offense. He had twenty years of experience fixing unfixable horses, but Samson would be his greatest challenge. Through the pair's many struggles and countless battles, Samson would teach Mitch about the true power of hope, friendship, redemption and the inspiring mettle of the forever wild and free American mustang. Last Chance Mustang explains Samson's violent and antisocial behavior while addressing the remedial techniques employed to remedy these issues. The art of working with damaged horses is demystified. Though his story is sad, the reader is asked to respect Samson not pity him. He has good and bad days, and he has a dark side. Like all of us, Samson is far from perfect. And his saga will move the reader to both tears and laughter. Part history lesson, part training manual, and part animal narrative, Samson's is a story that all readers will be able to relate to: a story of survival, of trust, and ultimately, finding love.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0UbABQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Mormon prophet","description":"Bonded-leather with over 70 breathtaking images and gift box 50% discount.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bjsVAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Mormon+prophet&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Courage of the Mountain Man (The Last Mountain Man)","description":"Despite the warnings of ranchers, Smoke Jensen and his trail herders head north out of Colorado, taking 3,500 head of cattle into the gunfire of Clint Black, the fiercely competitive and power-hungry rancher whose land they must cross.

Smiles of recognition turn into grins of enthusiasm as more people discover them and dream about making their own private retreats or family play spaces. And it's nice to remind ourselves that treehouses are built into the oldest and most forgiving, living things on earth. Also, history records treehouses as being built as deliberate follies, as challenges for arboreal designers, for merrymaking, and for keeping the spirit of fairy tales alive. But treehouses can also be social places. We will visit many that were built to entertain, to hang out with friends, or as guest houses. Trees come in all types. Master treehouse builders Peter and Judy Nelson, with David Larkin, have embarked on yet another treehouse-discovery expedition across America, this time adding the investigation of backyard playhouses to their agenda. Now, in The Treehouse Book, they reveal their findings, illustrated and described in the most complete volume yet. From casual treeshacks made from discarded lumber to multitiered feats of fancy, they found shelters representing myriad builders--interesting characters ranging from childhood fanatics grown up, to weekend carpenters, to those who want their grandkids to have the best clubhouse on the block. Detailed how-to information, including plans and drawings, is woven with behind-the-scenes tales of each structure's occupants and stunning interior and exterior photographic exploration.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hz-ooyr_czMC&dq=The+Treehouse+Book&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hellborn","description":"First UK hardback edition.

Ruth Cracknell Three of Ruth Park's best loved books  Missus, The Harp in the South and Poor Man's Orange  are brought together in this volume, tracing the saga of the Darcy family over thirty years. The story has its beginnings in the awkward courtship of dreamily innocent Margaret Kilker and unwilling hero Hugh Darcy in the dusty country towns of rural Australia. After their marriage, the couple moves to Sydney and raises a family amid the brothels, grog shops and run-down boarding houses of inner-city Surry Hills, where money is scarce and life is not easy. Here their daughter Roie grows up all too quickly, while younger daughter Dolour tries to make sense of a world in which loss and love go hand in hand. Filled with beautifully drawn characters that will make you laugh as much as cry, Ruth Park's Australian classics take you from the barren landscapes of the outback to the colourful slums of Sydney with convincing depth, careful detail and great heart.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UjXggTWZwsgC&dq=The+Harp+In+The+South&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Raff, the jungle bird: The story of our talking mynah","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AvXCMwEACAAJ&dq=Raff,+the+jungle+bird:+The+story+of+our+talking+mynah&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ancient Skins, Parchment and Leathers (Studies in archaeological science)","description":"INTRODUCTION TO THE TEXT OF THE NEW TESTAMENT is a shortened 358 pages of Andrews 644 pages FROM SPOKEN WORDS TO SACRED TEXTS without losing the value of content.

Then, Andrews will cover the ancient version, the era of the printed text, and the arrival of the critical text. After that, the reader will be given a lengthy chapter on examples of how the textual scholar determines the correct reading by his looking at the internal and external evidence. Finally, and most importantly, the reader will find out the truth about the supposed 400,000 textual errors within the Greek New Testament manuscripts. The last chapter will deal with the collation and classification of manuscripts.

Winner of an Award of Excellence in the 2003 Chicago Book Clinic! What is real? What is truth? What can we know? What should we believe? What should we do and why? Is there a God? Can we know him? Do Christian doctrines make sense? Can we believe in God in the face of evil? These are fundamental questions that any thinking person wants answers to. These are questions that philosophy addresses. And the answers we give to these kinds of questions serve as the the foundation stones for consrtucting any kind of worldview. In Philosophical Foundations for a Christian Worldview J.P. Moreland and William Lane Craig offer a comprehensive introduction to philosophy from a Christian perspective. In their broad sweep they seek to introduce readers to the principal subdisciplines of philosophy, including epistemology, metaphysics, philosophy of science, ethics and philosophy of religion. They do so with characteristic clarity and incisiveness. Arguments are clearly outlined, and rival theories are presented with fairness and accuracy. Philosophy, they contend, aids Christians in the tasks of apologetics, polemics and systematic theology. It reflects our having been made in the image of God, helps us to extend biblical teaching into areas not expressly addressed in Scripture, facilitates the spiritual discipline of study, enhances the boldness and self-image of the Christian community, and is requisite to the essential task of integrating faith and learning. Here is a lively and thorough introduction to philosophy for all who want to know reality.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_KZVMQAACAAJ&dq=Foundations&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Applying Educational Research: A Practical Guide for Teachers","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oPrCQgAACAAJ&dq=Applying+Educational+Research:+A+Practical+Guide+for+Teachers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In Memory Of Hawks & Other Stories Of Alaska","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eEbdMgEACAAJ&dq=In+Memory+Of+Hawks&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Flim and Flam & the big cheese","description":"A professional magician exposes mystics, mediums, psychic surgeons, and others who claim to possess supernatural or paranormal powers, demonstrating how their feats are little more than well-planned tricks that any competent magician can duplicate","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UHoQAQAAIAAJ&dq=Flim+and+Flam&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Golden Yoke: The Legal Cosmology Of Buddhist Tibet","description":"The \\"golden yoke\\" of Buddhist Tibet was the last medieval legal system still in existence in the middle of the twentieth century. This book reconstructs that system as a series of layered narratives from the memories of people who participated in the daily operation of law in the houses and courtyards the offices and courts of Tibet prior to 1959. The practice of law in this unique legal world, which lacked most of our familiar sign posts, ranged from the fantastic use of oracles in the search for evidence to the more mundane presentation of cases in court. Buddhism and law, two topics rarely intertwined in Western consciousness, are at the center of this work. The Tibetan legal system was based on Buddhist philosophy and reflected Buddhist thought in legal practice and decision making. For Tibetans, law is a cosmology, a kaleidoscopic patterning of relations which is constantly changing, recycling, and re-forming even as it integrates the universe and the individual into a timeless mandalic whole. The Golden Yoke causes us to rethink American legal culture. It argues that in the United States, legal matters are segregated into a separate space with rigidly defined categories. The legal cosmology of Buddhist Tibet brings into question both this autonomous framework and most of the presumptions we have about the very nature of law from precedent and res judicata to rule formation and closure.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FaoiMQAACAAJ&dq=The+Golden+Yoke:+The+Legal+Cosmology+Of+Buddhist+Tibet&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Under the Sky (Learn to Read Read to Learn Fun & Fantasy)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Fluke Family Fortune: Book One in the Saga of Maynerd Dumsted","description":"First in the Fluke Family series, Fluke Family Fortune sets the stage for the comical misadventures of Maynerd Fluke Dumsted.

Clark comes this provocative study of the origins of modern art in the painting of Parisian life by Edouard Manet and his followers. The Paris of the 1860s and 1870s was a brand-new city, recently adorned with boulevards, caf s, parks, Great Exhibitions, and suburban pleasure grounds the birthplace of the habits of commerce and leisure that we ourselves know as \\"modern life.\\" A new kind of culture quickly developed in this remade metropolis, sights and spectacles avidly appropriated by a new kind of \\"consumer\\": clerks and shopgirls, neither working class nor bourgeois, inventing their own social position in a system profoundly altered by their very existence. Emancipated and rootless, these men and women flocked to the bars and nightclubs of Paris, went boating on the Seine at Argenteuil, strolled the island of La Grande-Jatte enacting a charade of community that was to be captured and scrutinized by Manet, Degas, and Seurat. It is Clark's cogently argued (and profusely illustrated) thesis that modern art emerged from these painters' attempts to represent this new city and its inhabitants. Concentrating on three of Manet's greatest works and Seurat's masterpiece, Clark traces the appearance and development of the artists' favorite themes and subjects, and the technical innovations that they employed to depict a way of life which, under its liberated, pleasure-seeking surface, was often awkward and anxious. Through their paintings, Manet and the Impressionists ask us, and force us to ask ourselves: Is the freedom offered by modernity a myth? Is modern life heroic or monotonous, glittering or tawdry, spectacular or dull? The Painting of Modern Life illuminates for us the ways, both forceful and subtle, in which Manet and his followers raised these questions and doubts, which are as valid for our time as for the age they portrayed.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YZcnDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How Computer Programming Works (Technology in Action Series)","description":"This unique book uses full color illustrations to help readers understand the principles behind all computer programming.

Standing alongside Norman Mailer s The Naked and the Dead and James Jones s From Here to Eternity, The Young Lions is one of the most powerful American novels to tackle the Second World War. Ambitious in its scope and robust in its prose, Irwin Shaw s work is also deeply humanistic, presenting the reality of war as seen through the eyes of ordinary soldiers on both sides. The story follows the individual dramas and ultimately intertwined destinies of Christian Diestl, a Nazi sergeant; Noah Ackerman, a Jewish American infantryman; and Michael Whitacre, an idealistic urbanite from the New York theatrical world. Diestl first appears as a dashing ski instructor in Austria, mouthing his loyalty to Nazi ideals. As the war progresses, Diestl s character continues to erode as he descends into savagery. Ackerman must endure domestic anti-Semitism and beatings in boot camp before proving himself in the European theater. Eventually, as part of the liberating army, he comes face-to-face with the unimaginable horrors of the death camps. Whitacre, trading cocktail parties for Molotov cocktails, confronts the barbarism of war, and in fighting simply to survive, finds his own capacity for heroism. Shaw s sweeping narrative is at once vivid, exciting, and brutally realistic as well as poignant in its portrayal of the moral devastation and institutional insanity of war. Penned by a master storyteller at the height of his craft, The Young Lions stands the test of time as a classic novel of war and the human experience. This ebook features an illustrated biography of Irwin Shaw including rare images and never-before-seen documents from the author s estate.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=baJMV9qRvoQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Advanced Therapy of Inflammatory Bowel Disease","description":"Rev. ed. of: Advanced therapy of inflammatory bowel disease / [edited by] Theodore M.

Certain of these largely inborn behavioral style differences, which are not abnormal in themselves, may lead to clinical problems by predisposing children to abrasive, incompatible relationships with caregivers.In this book, William B. Carey and Sean C.

These management strategies were assembled from their own extensive clinical experience and that of others. They take the professional psychologist, physician, nurse, teacher, day care worker, and social worker through all the stages of a child's life to show how the effects of temperament play out in infancy, the preschool years, middle childhood, and adolescence.Richly illustrated with detailed case examples, this outstanding book brings theory and practice to life and shows how all who work with children can improve their care by understanding these important differences.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wF1gtAEACAAJ&dq=Coping+With+Children%27s+Temperament:+A+Guide+For+Professionals&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"There's a boy in here","description":"Judy Barron chronicles her son's battle with autism, discussing how she and the other members of the family learned to deal with his outbursts and special challenges.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Lafe3_b-KjIC&dq=There%27s+a+boy+in+here&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Word Histories and Mysteries: From Abracadabra to Zeus (American Heritage Dictionaries)","description":"Did you know that cats are related etymologically to caterpillars?

A raw, unpeopled wilderness stretching as far as the eye can see. These are the settings we associate with our most famous books about nature. But Gavin Van Horn isn t most nature writers. He lives and works not in some perfectly remote cabin in the woods but in a city a big city. And that city has offered him something even more valuable than solitude: a window onto the surprising attractiveness of cities to animals. What was once in his mind essentially a nature-free blank slate turns out to actually be a bustling place where millions of wild things roam. He came to realize that our own paths are crisscrossed by the tracks and flyways of endangered black-crowned night herons, Cooper s hawks, brown bats, coyotes, opossums, white-tailed deer, and many others who thread their lives ably through our own. With The Way of Coyote, Gavin Van Horn reveals the stupendous diversity of species that can flourish in urban landscapes like Chicago. That isn t to say city living is without its challenges. Chicago has been altered dramatically over a relatively short timespan its soils covered by concrete, its wetlands drained and refilled, its river diverted and made to flow in the opposite direction. The stories in The Way of Coyote occasionally lament lost abundance, but they also point toward incredible adaptability and resilience, such as that displayed by beavers plying the waters of human-constructed canals or peregrine falcons raising their young atop towering skyscrapers. Van Horn populates his stories with a remarkable range of urban wildlife and probes the philosophical and religious dimensions of what it means to coexist, drawing frequently from the wisdom of three unconventional guides wildlife ecologist Aldo Leopold, Taoist philosopher Lao Tzu, and the North American trickster figure Coyote. Ultimately, Van Horn sees vast potential for a more vibrant collective of ecological citizens as we take our cues from landscapes past and present. Part urban nature travelogue, part philosophical reflection on the role wildlife can play in waking us to a shared sense of place and fate, The Way of Coyote is a deeply personal journey that questions how we might best reconcile our own needs with the needs of other creatures in our shared urban habitats.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1g5uDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Way+of+the+Coyote&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"MCSE Windows 2000 Core Four Exam Cram Pack (Exam: 70-210, 70-215, 70-216, 70-217)","description":"The MCSE Windows 2000 Core Four LabSim Pack is the most economical and realistic method of preparation for your core four MCSE exams.

Stacey Abrams  In sharing my story, it is my hope that a new generation will be inspired by Run to actively participate in the democratic process and help build a more perfect Union here in America.  Congressman John Lewis The sequel to the #1 New York Times bestselling graphic novel series March the continuation of the life story of John Lewis and the struggles seen across the United States after the Selma voting rights campaign. To John Lewis, the civil rights movement came to an end with the signing of the Voting Rights Act in 1965. But that was after more than five years as one of the preeminent figures of the movement, leading sitin protests and fighting segregation on interstate busways as an original Freedom Rider. It was after becoming chairman of SNCC (the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee) and being the youngest speaker at the March on Washington. It was after helping organize the Mississippi Freedom Summer and the ensuing delegate challenge at the 1964 Democratic National Convention. And after coleading the march from Selma to Montgomery on what became known as  Bloody Sunday.  All too often, the depiction of history ends with a great victory. But John Lewis knew that victories are just the beginning. In Run: Book One, John Lewis and longtime collaborator Andrew Aydin reteam with Nate Powell the awardwinning illustrator of the March trilogy and are joined by L. Fury making an astonishing graphic novel debut to tell this often overlooked chapter of civil rights history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KzpKDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A mind that found itself;: An autobiography,","description":"I am not telling the story of my life just to write a book.

Beginning with The Childlike Life of the Black Tarantula in 1973, Kathy Acker set out on a brilliant journey toward the boundaries of modern fiction that has made her one of the most celebrated novelists of her generation.

In Childlike Life she steps into the biography of a Mississippi murderess who falls in love with a famous lawyer. In I Dreamt I Was A Nymphomaniac she takes a man capable of deceiving both sexes as her lover in a dreamy odyssey through the labyrinth of her desires. In The Adult Life Toulouse Lautrec is a woman starved for love and sex.

Unable to communicate, the deaf and mute teenager was labeled  feeble minded  and sentenced by a judge to the nightmarish jumble of the Lincoln State School and Colony in Jacksonville. He remained in the Illinois mental health care system for over thirty years and died at the Sharon Oaks Nursing Home in Peoria on November 28, 1993. Deaf, mute, and later blind, the young black man survived institutionalized hell: beatings, hunger, overcrowding, and the dehumanizing treatment that characterized state institutions through the 1950s. In spite of his environment, he made friends, took on responsibilities, and developed a sense of humor. People who knew him found him remarkable. Award-winning journalist Dave Bakke reconstructs the life of John Doe No. 24 through research into a half-century of the state mental health system, personal interviews with people who knew him at various points during his life, and sixteen black-and-white illustrations. After reading a story about John Doe in the New York Times, acclaimed singer-songwriter Mary Chapin Carpenter wrote and recorded  John Doe No. 24  and purchased a headstone for his unmarked grave. She contributes a foreword to this book. As death approached for the man known only as John Doe No. 24, his one-time nurse Donna Romine reflected sadly on his mystery.  Ah, well,  she said,  God knows his name.

Most research on storytelling in management practice derives from practitioner experience, but little is known about the specific dynamics behind storytelling as a tool for managerial communication. This book derives from one of the first research studies into storytelling in management practice, which sought to evaluate the assumed, but not necessarily proven, effectiveness of storytelling as a management tool. Building on existing theories of narrative and storytelling in organizations, the book explores how managers use storytelling in their daily practice, revealing that it can be employed both, purposively - like a tool, and perceptively - spontaneously and intuitively. The book explains that storytelling has different functions in management practice at different levels of the organization, such as: Creating direction for the organization Translating strategic messages into operational ones and supporting the professional development of staff Shaping the organization s social fabric through the sharing of personal stories Aided by a wealth of interviews and case studies, Storytelling in Management Practice reveals an analysis of the dynamic relationship between story, storyteller, audience and organizational context. As such, it will be useful for students and researchers working across a variety of sub-disciplines, including: leadership, organizational behaviour and business communication.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=P9o7OHVnVKgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pentimento: A book of portraits","description":"In this widely praised follow-up to her National Book Award-winning first volume of memoirs, An Unfinished Woman, the legendary playwright Lillian Hellman looks back at some of the people who, wittingly or unwittingly, exerted profound influence on her development as a woman and a writer.

Vallandigham and the Civil War (North's Civil War Series, 8)","description":"Every American war has brought conflict over the extent to which national security will permit protesters to exercise their constitutional guarantee of freedom of expression. The most famous case was that of Clement L. Vallandigham, the passionate critic of Lincoln's Civil War policies and one of the most controversial figure in the nation's history. In the great crisis of his time, he insisted that no circumstance, even war, could deprive a citizen of his right to oppose government policy freely and openly. The consequence was a furor which shook the nation's legislative halls and filled the press with vituperation. The ultimate fate for Vallandigham was arrest, imprisonment, and exile. The burning issues raised by his case remain largely unresolved today. Mr. Klement follows the tragic irony of Vallandigham's career and reassesses the man and history's judgment of him.

The number of viewers who routinely watch the nightly news in Russia matches the number of Americans who tune in to the Super Bowl, thus making TV coverage the prized asset for which political leaders intensely--and sometimes violently--compete. In this revised and expanded edition of Changing Channels, Ellen Mickiewicz provides many fascinating insights, describing the knowing ways in which ordinary Russians watch the news, skeptically analyze information, and develop strategies for dealing with news bias. Covering the period from the state-controlled television broadcasts at the end of the Soviet Union through the attempted coup against Gorbachev, the war in Chechnya, the presidential election of 1996, and the economic collapse of 1998, Mickiewicz draws on firsthand research, public opinion surveys, and many interviews with key players, including Gorbachev himself. By examining the role that television has played in the struggle to create political pluralism in Russia, she reveals how this struggle is both helped and hindered by the barrage of information, advertisements, and media-created personalities that populate the airwaves. Perhaps most significantly, she shows how television has emerged as the sole emblem of legitimate authority and has provided a rare and much-needed connection from one area of this huge, crisis-laden country to the next. This new edition of Changing Channels will be valued by those interested in Russian studies, politics, media and communications, and cultural studies, as well as general readers who desire an up-to-date view of crucial developments in Russia at the end of the twentieth century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aCNQ4oWKAPsC&dq=Changing+Channels:+Television+and+the+Struggle+for+Power+in+Russia&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Scottish Ghost Stories","description":"With its rich folklore and diverse cultural and religious heritage, Scotland has been a notoriously fertile haunting ground for the recording and transmission of ghost stories down the centuries, those of both well-documented lineage and accumulated legend. Inheriting the tradition of Hugh Miller, the nineteenth century folklorist and stonemason (whose own haunted life is the subject of the opening chapter), James Robertson has, where possible, researched the original or oldest written source and visited the site of each story to compile the most comprehensive and authoritative collection of the Scottish supernatural. Some of the stories gathered here are deservedly famous, such as those associated with Glamis Castle or the tale of Major Weir, while others ('The Deil of Littledean' and 'The Drummer of Cortachy') are less familiar or even contemporary accounts related to the author personally - but all are equally intriguing and fascinating reflections of the culture and period to which they belong. Neither a wary sceptic nor a fanatical believer, but an advocate of the validity of individual experience of the strange and unexplainable, James Robertson's Scottish Ghost Stories is an imaginative and chilling recasting of an established Scottish ghost-hunting and story-telling tradition - a homage to the particular mystery and character of a land which continues to produce ghosts whether from den to glen, Highlands to Lowlands, Catholic to Protestant.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VpczAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Sweet Dreams Body Book: A Guide to Diet, Nutrition, and Exercise (A Sweet dreams special)","description":"Discusses the basics of nutrition, provides tips on preparing low-calorie meals, and suggests an exercise program designed for losing weight.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fOW2iXjqHSkC&dq=The+Sweet+Dreams+Body+Book:+A+Guide+to+Diet,+Nutrition,+and+Exercise+(A+Sweet+dreams+special)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"House of a Hundred Windows","description":"Fourteen famous modern paintings reproduced by photogravure are woven by the author's imaginative text into a droll little story about a little cat who lived in a house with a hundred windows.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ysqZGAAACAAJ&dq=House+of+a+Hundred+Windows&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Elements of Music: Concepts and Applications, Vol. 2","description":"The Elements of Music, Concepts and Applications, Volume 2, is part of a comprehensive learning program for 2-year music theory courses.

Along the way, she forges a new history of Italian opera, from the court pieces of the early seventeenth century to the public stages of Venice more than fifty years later. Wilbourne considers a series of case studies structured around the most important and widely explored operas of the period: Monteverdi s lost L Arianna, as well as his Il Ritorno d Ulisse and L incoronazione di Poppea; Mazzochi and Marazzoli s L Egisto, ovvero Chi soffre speri; and Cavalli s L Ormindo and L Artemisia. As she demonstrates, the sound-in-performance aspect of commedia dell arte theater specifically, the use of dialect and verbal play produced an audience that was accustomed to listening to sonic content rather than simply the literal meaning of spoken words. This, Wilbourne suggests, shaped the musical vocabularies of early opera and facilitated a musicalization of Italian theater. Highlighting productive ties between the two worlds, from the audiences and venues to the actors and singers, this work brilliantly shows how the sound of commedia performance ultimately underwrote the success of opera as a genre.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oapSDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The chronicle of the Cid","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NV8JAAAAQAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Our Gang: v. 1","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=B6znAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"TUDOR AND STUART BRITAIN 1471-1714","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TU9nAAAAMAAJ&dq=TUDOR+AND+STUART+BRITAIN+1471-1714&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Song of Celestine : Inspired by the Celestine Prophecy","description":"A boy completes a quest by following the insights about life he discovers around him.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uR00PQAACAAJ&dq=The+Song+of+Celestine+:+Inspired+by+the+Celestine+Prophecy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Finding Home: Buying the House That's Right for You","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KJ74swEACAAJ&dq=Finding+Home:+Buying+the+House+That%27s+Right+for+You&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"New Moon (Berkley Sensation)","description":"When werewolf Logan Marshall is rescued by an extraordinary creature, a beautiful shapeshifter from another dimension, he becomes ensnared in her seductive trap as he helps her save herself--and Earth--from the wrath of her greatest enemy.

A powerful call for conservation, and an exciting bird adventure  (The Boston Globe). What is it about the ivory-billed woodpecker? Why does this ghost of the southern swamps arouse such an obsessive level of passion in its devotees, who range from respected researchers to the flakiest Loch Ness monster fanatics and Elvis chasers? Since the early twentieth century, scientists have been trying their best to prove that the ivory-bill is extinct. But every time they think they've finally closed the door, the bird makes an unexpected appearance. To unravel the mystery, author Tim Gallagher heads south, deep into the eerie swamps and bayous of the vast Mississippi Delta, searching for people who claim to have seen this rarest of birds and following up sometimes more than thirty years after the fact on their sightings. What follows is his own Eureka moment with his buddy Bobby Harrison, a true son of the South from Alabama. A huge woodpecker flies in front of their canoe, and they both cry out,  Ivory-bill!  This sighting the first time since 1944 that two qualified observers positively identify an ivory-billed woodpecker in the United States quickly leads to the largest search ever launched to find a rare bird, as researchers fan out across the bayou, hoping to document the existence of this most iconic of birds.

The weak son and the hot daughter-in-law are in residence, being \\"between jobs.\\" Big Mama's absent, though---she died some time ago, and the judge is now adding his fianc e to the mix. That would be Miss Kristin LaGarde, an impossibly lovely, and possibly innocent, young lady who seems hopelessly in love with the old coot. Talba dredges up lots of interesting material; such as that someone was accidentally electrocuted at the marina and that the judge is in bed with certain bail bondsmen. She finds evidence of bribes and kickbacks. He's dirty all right. When the story breaks and the scandal deepens, Judge Champagne winds up dead. And, to her surprise, Talba is asked to investigate. Did politics kill the judge? Or was it his own family?

During his sixteen years in the majors, he played with such baseball luminaries as Ty Cobb (who once called Sisler  the nearest thing to a perfect ballplayer ), Babe Ruth, and Rogers Hornsby. He was considered by these stars of the sport to be their equal, and Branch Rickey, one of baseball s foremost innovators and talent scouts, once said that in 1922 Sisler was  the greatest player that ever lived.  During his illustrious career he was a .340 hitter, twice achieving the rare feat of hitting more than .400. His 257 hits in 1920 is still the record for the  modern  era. Considered by many to be one of the game s most skillful first basemen, he was the first at his position to be inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame. Yet unlike many of his peers who became household names, Sisler has faded from baseball s collective consciousness. Now in The Sizzler, this  legendary player without a legend  gets the treatment he deserves. Rick Huhn presents the story of one of baseball s least appreciated players and studies why his status became so diminished. Huhn argues that the answer lies somewhere amid the tenor of Sisler s times, his own character and demeanor, the kinds of individuals who are chosen as our sports heroes, and the complex definition of fame itself. In a society obsessed with exposing the underbellies of its heroes, Sisler s lack of a dark side may explain why less has been written about him than others. Although Sisler was a shy, serious sort who often shunned publicity, his story is filled with its own share of controversy and drama, from a lengthy struggle among major-league moguls for his contractual rights a battle that helped change the structure of organized baseball forever to a job-threatening eye disorder he developed during the peak of his career and popularity. By including excerpts from Sisler s unpublished memoir, as well as references to the national and international events that took place during his heyday, Huhn reveals the full picture of this family man who overcame great obstacles, stood on high principles, and left his mark on a game he affected in a positive way for fifty-eight years.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Bgqf8L3RMhYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Corporate Warrior: A Novel Based on the Life of Lee Iacocca","description":"Martin Iannelli had risen from poor Italian immigrant roots to become president of Cole Motors.

It redresses the lack of scholarship on the symbiotic relationship between nation and culture, especially in Arab studies, by presenting both descriptive and prescriptive models of how a nation can be \\"read\\" through literary productions. Elise Salem provides valuable close readings of many Lebanese literary texts written in Arabic, including lesser-known fiction, popular culture narratives, and plays written and produced during the Lebanese civil war and postwar period. Using this framework, Salem examines the construction of nationalist mythology in Lebanon and illustrates how nationalist and regional politics influence cultural productions. Rereading Gibran Khalil Gibran, for example, with the idea of nation in mind reveals that his works are replete with formative ideas on Lebanese identity. Besides analyzing an extensive body of literature from the 20th century, Salem also draws from cultural productions, especially the popular Rahbani and Fayruz musicals that proved to be central to Lebanese consciousness. This pioneering attempt to propel the study of Lebanese nationalism beyond the confines of ideology and political parties sharpens our understanding of this evolving nation, from its early inception and development to its demise and current reconstruction.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CFNjQgAACAAJ&dq=Constructing+Lebanon:+A+Century+of+Literary+Narratives&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Primate Behavioral Ecology (2nd Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=u4pjAAAACAAJ&dq=Primate+Behavioral+Ecology+(2nd+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"ANSI Common LISP","description":"Teaching users new and more powerful ways of thinking about programs, this two-in-one text contains a tutorial--full of examples--that explains all the essential concepts of Lisp programming, plus an up-to-date summary of ANSI Common Lisp.

A decade later, despite having been an avowed opponent of the death penalty, Edison threw his laboratory resources and reputation behind the creation of a very different sort of device--the electric chair. Deftly exploring this startling chapter in American history, Edison & the Electric Chair delivers both a vivid portrait of a nation on the cusp of modernity and a provocative new examination of Edison himself. Edison championed the electric chair for reasons that remain controversial to this day. Was Edison genuinely concerned about the suffering of the condemned? Was he waging a campaign to smear his rival George Westinghouse's alternating current and boost his own system? Or was he warning the public of real dangers posed by the high-voltage alternating wires that looped above hundreds of America's streets? Plumbing the fascinating history of electricity, Mark Essig explores America's love of technology and its fascination with violent death, capturing an era when the public was mesmerized and terrified by an invisible force that produced blazing light, powered streetcars, carried telephone conversations--and killed.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mAwVz2-CeX8C&dq=Electric+Chair+Cookbook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Vibration and shock isolation","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CrU8AAAAIAAJ&dq=Vibration+and+shock+isolation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Community and Organization in the New Left 1962-1968: The Great Refusal","description":"Did New Left activists have an opportunity to start a revolution that they simply could not bring off? Was their rejection of conventional forms of political organization a fatal flaw or were the apparent weaknesses of the movement -- the lack of central authority, the distrust of politics -- actually hidden strengths? Wini Breines traces the evolution of the New Left movement through the Free Speech Movement, Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), and SDS's community organization projects. For Breines, the movement's goal of participatory decision-making, even when it was not achieved, made up for its failure to take practical and direct action. By the late 1960s, antiwar activism contributed to the decline of the New Left, as the movement was flooded with new participants who did not share the founding generation's political experiences or values. Originally published in 1982, Wini Breines's classic work now includes a new preface in which she reassesses, and for the most part affirms, her initial views of the movement. She argues that the movement remains effective in the midst of radical changes in activist movements. Breines also summarizes and evaluates the new and growing scholarship on the 1960s. Her provocative analysis of the New Left remains important today.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MxOjN_enNzMC&dq=Community+and+Organization+in+the+New+Left+1962-1968:+The+Great+Refusal&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Netherworld (World of Darkness Vampire)","description":"Based on the runaway bestselling roleplaying game by the same name, this chilling fantasy novel is set against the backdrop of a vicious territory war between two vampire clans.

Missionaries From Communist China","description":"As Isobel Kuhn states in the introduction, the purpose of this book is not to simply tell another story of the trials that Christians and missionaries faced under communism in China. Its true purpose is to describe God's provision for His children that allows them to \\"put forth green leaves when all others around are dried up and dying from the drought.\\" This book tells the tale of Arthur Mathews and his young family, who were missionaries with China Inland Mission in the 1950s. In 1951, China Inland Mission called for an evacuation of all its missionaries in China due to the oppression of the communist leaders there. Two years later, Arthur Mathews finally made it out to Hong Kong, after enduring torture and starvation. Yet his faith remained strong. What gave Mathews such strong faith? What enabled him and his wife to endure what they went through? Isobel Kuhn tells a compelling tale, based on Mathews' own letters, about the Source of his strength: God and God alone. God continually showed Himself faithful to Arthur and Wilda Mathews. Though Arthur and Wilda were unable to do the work they felt called to do, God showed that through their hardships He was more than enough for his children. The enduring faith of the Mathews family was a legacy of incalculable worth to the native Chinese church. As Kuhn asks, \\"What more potent message could God have given these people? No wonder He deliberately sealed the lips of His servants, confined their hands and their feet, and then poured His life through them that the Chinese church might see and might desire ... Was God wrong to do this? In the farthest, most inland part of that great land was God unfair to ask two corns of wheat to die in this world's comforts that others might see for two long years (not just two days: God gave them a good stretch of testing time) how He is sufficient for all these things? He sent them to serve by life and so sealed their lips. It was a much more potent message.\\" God is the true source of life, and God will keep His children even to the end. He kept Arthur and Wilda Mathews, and He will keep you too. This story is an incredible reminder of the truth of God's sustenance and life. - Publisher.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qjogPQAACAAJ&dq=Green+Leaf+in+Drought-Time%3B+the+Story+of+the+Escape+of+the+Last+C.I.M.+Missionaries+From+Communist+China&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Seven Steps to Nighttime Dryness: A Practical Guide for Parents of Children with Bedwetting","description":"Seven Steps to Nighttime Dryness, Second Edition, provides the newest updated information and tips to help your child get to nighttime dryness.

The book on the one hand contrasts general traits of Eastern, Buddhist thought and Western, Greek thought. However, in doing so it focuses on influential philosophers and theologians who manifest particular instances of wider issues. The result is a careful examination of basic questions that offers both broad implications and concrete specificity in its approach. The book itself is an instance of East-West dialogue. Independently of each other both authors had previously engaged in serious cross-cultural studies. The Japanese Inagaki had researched Western science and philosophy, then written in Japanese comparative studies of Japanese thought. The North American Jennings had researched Japanese theology. They brought these backgrounds together, dialoguing with each other until the present study emerged. Several creative Japanese thinkers, as well as important Westerners, are taken up. The study follows the lead of many Eastern impulses, but it also critically utilizes Western methods. Contemporary thinking on religious plurality is carefully examined. This new study is a must for those interested in philosophy and theology in general, and East-West interaction in particular.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AzWvJ8xHbMwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Malaria and malarial diseases (Wood's library of standard medical authors)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Px26AAAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Problems and materials on secured transactions","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Chicken Out: The Third Letty Campbell Mystery (Letty Campbell Mysteries)","description":"Like other fictional characters, female sleuths may live in the past or the future.

They live in urban, suburban, and rural areas, as do the female heroines in the books they read.

In White Nights the apparent idyll of the dreamer's romantic fantasies disguises profound loneliness and estrangement from 'living life'. Despite his sentimental friendship with Nastenka, his final withdrawal into the world of the imagination anticipates the retreat into the 'underground' of many of Dostoevsky's later intellectual heroes. A Gentle Creature and The Dream of a Ridiculous Man show how such withdrawal from reality can end in spiritual desolation and moral indifference and how, in Dostoevsky's view, the tragedy of the alienated individual can be resolved only by the rediscovery of a sense of compassion and responsibility towards fellow human beings. This new translation captures the power and lyricism of Dostoevsky's writing, while the introduction examines the stories in relation to one another and to his novels. ABOUT THE SERIES: For over 100 years Oxford World's Classics has made available the widest range of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, helpful notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ov_swubidnAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Home Office Planner","description":"She wants a cozy writing nook.

By midsummer 1945, Japan had long since lost the war in the Pacific. The people were not told the truth, and neither was the emperor. Japanese generals, admirals, and statesmen knew, but only a handful of leaders were willing to accept defeat. Most were bent on fighting the Allies until the last Japanese soldier died and the last city burned to the ground. Exhaustively researched and vividly told, The Fall of Japan masterfully chronicles the dramatic events that brought an end to the Pacific War and forced a once-mighty military nation to surrender unconditionally. From the ferocious fighting on Okinawa to the all-but-impossible mission to drop the 2nd atom bomb, and from Franklin D. Roosevelt's White House to the Tokyo bunker where tearful Japanese leaders first told the emperor the truth, William Craig captures the pivotal events of the war with spellbinding authority. The Fall of Japan brings to life both celebrated and lesser-known historical figures, including Admiral Takijiro Onishi, the brash commander who drew up the Yamamoto plan for the attack on Pearl Harbor and inspired the death cult of kamikaze pilots., This astonishing account ranks alongside Cornelius Ryan's The Longest Day and John Toland's The Rising Sun as a masterpiece of World War II history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nyHuswEACAAJ&dq=The+fall+of+Japan&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Birthday Room","description":"\\"Two of the things Benjamin Hunter received for his twelfth birthday took him completely by surprise: A room and a letter.

In Japan, however, mining women witnessed no significant changes in working practices over this period. The availability of the cheap and abundant labor of these women allowed the captains of the coal industry in Japan to avoid expensive investments in new machinery and sophisticated mining methods;, instead, they continued to intensely exploit workers and markets intensively, making substantial profits without the burdens of extensive mechanization. This unique book explores the lives of the thousands of women who labored underground in Japan s coal mines in the years 1868 to 1930. It examines their working lives, their family lives, their aspirations, achievements and disappointments. Drawing heavily on interview material with the miners themselves, W. Donald Burton combines translations of their stories with features of Japanese society at the time and coal mining technology. In doing so, he presents a complex account of the women s lives, as well as providing a keen insight intoon gender relations and the industrial and labor history of Japan. Coal Mining Women in Japan will be welcomed by students and scholars of Japanese history, gender studies and industrial history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_GivBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In Harmony with Nature: Painting Techniques for the New Age","description":"Step-by-step instructions teach would-be painters all the techniques necessary to create evocative paintings inspired by nature","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dL9WAAAAYAAJ&dq=In+Harmony+with+Nature:+Painting+Techniques+for+the+New+Age&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sociologists, Economists, and Democracy (Midway Reprint)","description":"\\"Rationalist theories of political behavior have recently risen in status to that of a new or, more accurately, rediscovered paradigm in the systematic study of politics.

The Meno sees an older but ever ironic Socrates humbling a proud young aristocrat as they search for a clear understanding of what it is to be a good man, and setting out the startling idea that all human learning may be the recovery of knowledge already possessed by our immortal souls.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5Uvfd2dixgMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"School Crime and Juvenile Justice","description":"School Crime and Juvenile Justice, Second Edition, examines the nature, extent, and causes of school crime and disruptive behavior, offering a comprehensive overview of this significant and growing problem.

William Hulbert, the owner of Chicago's National Association team, believed that a league run efficiently with honest competition would survive and flourish. Hulbert, relying on his pragmatic philosophy of \\"molasses now, vinegar later\\" and working with his prize recruit Albert Spalding, founded the National League in 1876. That inaugural season of the National League is chronicled in this heavily documented work. The league fell far short of Hulbert's dreams in its first season, but he stuck to his belief that integrity would win out in the end. He not only prohibited Sunday baseball and the sale and consumption of alcohol within the league's ballparks, but ousted two teams--New York and Philadelphia--from the league because they failed to meet their obligation to finish out the season. Despite the setbacks, scandals, and considerable opposition, all of which are thoroughly covered here, the National League survived its first year.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kUTWjHzAiwkC&dq=The+League+that+Lasted:+1876+and+the+Founding+of+the+National+League+of+Profession+Baseball+Clubs&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Daughter of the Shaman","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Quillworker: A Cheyenne Legend (Native American Legends)","description":"A Cheyenne legend explaining the origins of the stars.

Stereotypes of hillbillies and rednecks repeatedly appear in representations of the region, but few, if any, of its many heroes, visionaries, or innovators are ever referenced. Make no mistake, they are legion: from Anne Royall, America's first female muckraker, to Sequoyah, a Cherokee mountaineer who invented the first syllabary in modern times, and international divas Nina Simone and Bessie Smith, as well as writers Cormac McCarthy, Edward Abbey, and Nobel Laureate Pearl S. Buck, Appalachia has contributed mightily to American culture   and politics. Not only did eastern Tennessee boast the country's first antislavery newspaper, Appalachians also established the first District of Washington as a bold counterpoint to British rule. With humor, intelligence, and clarity, Jeff Biggers reminds us how Appalachians have defined and shaped the United States we know today.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LNsREAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The View from the Grass Roots","description":"\\"Confidently recommended reading, The View from the Grass Roots is filled from cover to cover with keen insights, profound thoughts, and a deep and diverse understanding of the human condition.\\" -Midwest Book Review \\"[Rummo is] uniquely qualified . . .

At the end of the 1990s, the discussion of many observers, we among them, focused on the rise of the \\"cyberconsumer\\" and the emergence of \\"Internet marketing.\\" At the extreme, the image of this cyberconsumer was humorously caricatured in a series of Sprint commercials introducing its wireless web, in which people hunched over their computers in dark rooms were invited at long last to step out into the sunlit world. The business model designed for the cyberconsumer was the \\"pure play\\" Internet firm, either a separate dot-com or a stand-alone division of a larger company. But the cyberconsumer was largely a myth. Consumers didn't behave anything like we thought they would. Today, we are entering the age of the centaur. Consumers act across multiple channels. They combine timeless human needs and behaviors with new online activities. They are like the centaur of Greek mythology--half human and half horse running with the rapid feet of new technology, yet carrying the same ancient and unpredictable human heart. This consumer is a combination of traditional and cyber, rational and emotional, wired and physical. This consumer is not either/or, but both. The authors came to this center from opposite directions. Jerry Wind was an early champion of digital marketing, highlighting the revolutionary changes of the Internet on consumer behavior, marketing and business strategy. He urged executives to consider the potential of this new technology to transform their businesses. Vijay Mahajan pointed out that not everything had changed, and that many aspects of consumer behavior and marketing remained the same. He urged executives to consider the enduring human characteristics that would continue to shape marketing and business strategy. As we discussed the issue from these two viewpoints, working on a series of projects that led to this book, we came to the conclusion that we were both right: the reality was the hybrid consumer. This is not to suggest that there are three separate segments (traditional, cyberconsumer and centaur). The reality is convergence. The entire market is becoming centaurs, either directly or indirectly (even if someone is not online, their behavior will still be affected by new technologies, channels and products, and service offerings). This is why we focus so much on the centaur. The centaurs, in turn, are heterogeneous, so there will be many segments among these hybrid consumers. Even the most tech savvy of U.S. consumers the 18 to 25 year olds of Generation Y are not strictly cyberconsumers. A recent survey of more than 600 Gen-Y respondents (51 percent of whom had made online purchases in the past year) found that nearly 40 percent learned about the product online, but bought at a physical store, whereas only 9.3 percent began and ended their search online. When asked where they would prefer to shop, nearly three-quarters chose a store rather than online. Across the spectrum, consumers are combining various channels and approaches, searching online to buy offline, searching offline to buy online and everything in between. Charles Schwab found that while about 90 percent of all trades are handled online, 60-70 percent of new accounts are set up in branch offices. People want to be able to see whom they are working with when they turn over their money. Benefits of Convergence The power of hybrid models can be seen in the success of Tesco, which raced past pioneers such as Peapod and Webvan to become the largest online grocer in the world. Tesco, using its century-old platform of retail stores in the U.K. as the launching pad for its online service, created a profitable online business that was handling 70,000 orders per week by mid 2001 and had racked up more than $400 million in sales the year before. Tesco could set up its online grocery business for a fraction of the investment of Webvan because it was able to build off its existing infrastructure. Tesco has moved into the U.S. market, purchasing a 35 percent investment in Safeway's online grocery service in June 2001, and announcing plans for expansion into South Korea. The power and profit of the hybrid model can also be seen in the success of Staples.com, which expected to grow online revenues to $1 billion in 2001, nearly 10 percent of company sales. Even more significant, Staples found that the addition of the new channel is not cannibalistic, but synergistic. Overall, customers who shop in the store and catalog spend twice as much as those who shop in the store alone, and customers that shop using the store, catalog, and online channels spend an average of $2,500, nearly four times as much as store shoppers. The results achieved by Staples and other firms offer a sense of the potential return on investment from meeting the centaur. Convergence strategies offer a variety of opportunities for generating new revenues, reducing costs and creating valuable options for the future. Changing Mind Sets There is emerging evidence of the immediate benefits of convergence strategies, if investments are made strategically, but these short-term gains are not the only opportunity. Our focus is to look at the opportunities, both short- and long-term, created by the emergence of the hybrid consumer and how companies can capitalize on these opportunities. The last category may be the most important: the options that convergence strategies create for the future. This book takes a broader view of the strategic impact of the centaur for marketing and business strategy, and the architecture of the organization. If you believe, as we do, that the centaur is the future of our markets, then the ability to succeed in the future depends on understanding and \\"running with\\" the centaur. Failure to understand these changes creates the risk of significant lost opportunities. What can the integration of the offline marketplace and the online marketspace do for consumers that neither can do alone? What business principles will guide the integration? How is marketing changing? How do these shifts affect short-term and long-term profitability and growth? What Is Converging Convergence, as we discuss it here, means more than the fusion of different technologies (television, computers, wireless, PDAs) or the combination of channels (such as Tesco's or Staple's bricks-and-clicks model). We focus on a more basic convergence within the consumer the new possibilities created by the technology and the enduring behaviors of human beings. This convergence will shape how the Internet and other new technologies unfold, and the opportunities created for companies. What can consumers do with the technology that they could not do in the past? When will they continue to do things in the way they always have? Although most of the focus in this book is on business-to-consumer interactions, many of the insights apply equally to business-to-business strategy. The line between B2B and B2C is already blurring. In an environment in which Sun Microsystems is selling products on eBay, is this B2B or B2C? In an environment in which a customer may soon be able to click an order button for an automobile and set in motion a global supply chain to deliver that car, where does B2C end and B2B begin? Lessons from the Dot-Coms This book examines the practices of a variety of companies, but we must stress at the outset that these firms are not held up as ultimate models. They all have something to teach us, but many of the successful companies of a year or two ago are now fighting for their lives. And some companies that were all but written off are back in force. We suspect the same unpredictable dynamic will be seen in the future. This is a particularly dangerous time to engage in benchmarking or to search for excellence. It is not a time for simple recipes. Instead, it is far more important to gain a deeper understanding of how consumers are changing and how they are remaining the same. The actions of these hybrid consumers will shape the way technology is adopted and, ultimately, the future of your markets. We should take a balanced view of dot-com failures. Mark Twain once said, \\"We should be careful to get out of an experience only the wisdom that is in it.\\" Twain gives the example of a cat who sits on a hot stove, and learns not to sit on a hot stove again but also won't sit on a cold stove. The failures of the first wave of dot-coms offer many lessons about what to do, and what not to do, but we need to be careful in taking lessons from them. Although some of the companies that failed had weak business models, some actually had brilliant marketing strategies and business models. The failure of the business is not necessarily an indictment of the idea. Some may have arrived slightly ahead of their time. Some may have suffered from poor execution. It may be that the time is now right for these ideas to flourish. During the Internet bubble, we have engaged in one of the most extensive, investor-financed experiments in new business models and paradigms. There has been an explosion of experimentation. Although many of these experiments proved to be unprofitable, many new ideas were developed and tested. Incumbent companies and startups that are still alive can benefit greatly from the acceleration of knowledge from this dot-com \\"school of hard knocks.\\" Pick through the wreckage and look carefully at what happened. Then take away the lessons that you can use. The Implications of the Centaur In this book, we offer insights to top executives and key organizational change agents on the characteristics and behavior of these hybrid centaurs and how we need to reshape our marketing and business strategy to meet them. The book explores different intersections between the consumer, technology and company and their implications for marketing and business strategy and organizational design. We examine the emergence of the centaur, and the marketing, business and organizational challenges and opportunities created. Part I offers a portrait of this centaur, what has changed and what remains the same. We also discuss how the focus on the customer has often been lost in the emphasis on technology. These centaurs are complex beings, with a love-hate relationship with the technology, buying books from Amazon.com one day and relaxing in an armchair sipping cappuccino at Barnes & Noble the next. Part II explores issues at the intersection between the consumer and technology. We consider five key issues at the core of addressing these new hybrid consumers customerization, communities, channel options, new competitive value propositions, and choice tools. Although these issues have been discussed in the context of the cyberconsumer, they are quite different from the perspective of the centaur. Sometimes consumers want customerization (customized products and services as well as customized marketing), but other times they want to pull standard products off the shelf and receive mass marketing messages. Consumers are members of both physical and virtual communities. The hybrid consumers want to be able in the words of Fidelity to \\"call, click, or visit.\\" They are redefining the traditional sources of value, buying products by auction or fixed price or name-your-own price depending on their mood and purchase situation, creating a new value equation. Finally, the Internet offers powerful tools to find information, make decisions, and manage one's life. These tools empower consumers, changing the way they interact with the company. How can you create convergence strategies to address these interrelated issues? Part III examines the impact of the centaur on marketing and business strategies. As the consumer connects much more directly to companies, marketing has a deeper role to play. Marketing creates new opportunities for growth and rethinking the company's offering, pricing and market boundaries. The centaur has also transformed the traditional 4 Ps of marketing, along with strategies for segmentation, positioning, customer relationships, branding, and marketing research. As these changes send shockwaves through the organization, another type of convergence is called for in organizational design. Part IV explores some of the fundamental transformations established organizations need to undergo to meet the centaur. To navigate the whitewater rapids of convergence and change, organizations need new organizational architectures. They need to change their architectures, creating a broader \\"c-change\\" to facilitate convergence across the organization and its ecosystem. The overall objective is to suggest a new consumer-centric mental model through which to examine the entire business. The kind of shift we are talking about is what Bill Gates describes in the transformation of Microsoft's original mission of \\"a PC on every desk\\" to its current mission to \\"empower people through great software, any time, any place and on any device.\\" The focus is on the convergence of technology and consumer needs. This book is designed to be an interactive experience. Each chapter begins with a dialogue representing different viewpoints on convergence. Callouts highlight key convergence questions that you can use to challenge yourself and to assess your company's progress. Finally, the close of every chapter offers an \\"action memo,\\" a set of illustrative hands-on experiments for exploring and applying convergence strategies. We have found the only way to master these new technologies and strategies is to actually experience them and apply them to your own business. These \\"action memos\\" are not intended to be exhaustive or to summarize key themes of the chapter, but represent a starting point for your own experiments. We encourage you to share those experiments with us, and other readers, at the Convergence Marketing Forum (convergencemarketingforum.com). The Relentless March of the Centaur As Internet penetration increases and new technologies emerge we are seeing a relentless march of these new hybrid centaurs. We cannot judge the potential of the Internet and other technologies by their current primitive level of development. John Hagel, author of Net Gain and Net Worth, says if we compare the Internet to a ballgame, we are still waiting for the national anthem to finish. Michael Nelson, Director of Internet Technology and Strategy at IBM, estimated in 2000 that we were maybe 3 percent of the way into the Internet revolution. He also points out that increased speed of connection, which has been a central focus of attention in the evolution of the Internet, is only a small part of the power of the emerging online world. In addition to raw speed, the fact that the Internet will be always on, everywhere, natural, intelligent, easy, and trusted, will deepen the role of the Internet in our lives. Nelson compares the development of the Internet to the early days of the electric grid. \\"The Internet right now is at the light bulb stage,\\" Nelson said. \\"The light bulb is very useful, but it is only one of thousands of uses of electricity. Similarly, when the next-generation Internet is fully deployed, we will use it in thousands of different ways, many of which we can't even imagine now. It will just be part of everyday life like electricity or plumbing is today. We'll know we've achieved this when we stop talking about 'going on the Internet.' When you blow dry your hair, you don't talk about 'going on' the electric grid.\\" There will be naysayers who will use the limitations of the current state of technology as a reason for inaction. Customization is often neither cheap nor simple. Early interfaces with online sites were clunky at best and many home connections remain slow. Throughout this book, we look at the current and future potential of technology and explore how the consumer will interact with it. We won't waste your time giving you a repair manual for a Model T, but instead explore how motor vehicles (particularly newer, more reliable versions) create opportunities for activities such as commerce and family vacations by car. While we must be realistic, we cannot become too mired in the past when the future is so rapidly emerging. Children of Centaurs: In the Forests of the North It is clear that we are just getting started with the Internet, and we are even earlier on the learning curve for the new wireless consumers beginning to emerge. Even as businesses are scurrying to absorb the revolution of the Internet, teenagers in Europe and Asia are already shaping the next revolution in mobile communication and commerce. This revolution will play out differently in different parts of the world, and it will probably play out differently than we expect, unless we truly understand the new hybrid consumer. It poses new convergence challenges, but raises the same timeless questions: How will consumers interact with the technology? Again, this interaction between people and technology will not always be as businesses anticipated. Helsinki teenager Lauri Taehtinen, speaking on a panel of Finnish teenagers at the Wharton Fellows in e-Business Program, said that when he goes out on a Friday night, he doesn't make plans anymore. Instead the 19-year-old goes downtown and starts sending short messages on his mobile phone, pinging his friends to see who's out there. They connect by cell phone and then decide where they want to go for the evening. While companies are excited about developing mobile information services that might help customers identify night clubs or order fast food, Taehtinen and his peers are more interested in connection. In an environment in which virtually every teenager carries a mobile phone (Finnish market penetration of 78 percent means almost every citizen above the age of 10 carries at least one mobile phone), the mobile conversation is continuous and ubiquitous. Among U.K. teens, short messages outnumber phone conversations three to one, and the parallel phenomenon of instant messaging is one of the most popular applications of teenagers on the PC in the United States and other parts of the world. The very fact that short messages (SMS) are the top application of mobile phones in Finland is, at first, a surprising thing. The handsets, designed for voice, are not friendly to the process of messaging. Users tap out their 160-word messages on numeric keyboards through complex, rapid-fire keystrokes, smart systems, and creative workarounds. With users paying a charge to send each message on most systems, it would seem unlikely that SMS would be a central part of the mobile phone business. But these young centaurs want to communicate, and they don't let the technology get in their way. It was only in the interaction between consumers and technology that that power of short messages became apparent. Just as email has been the killer application of the Internet, mobile technology is being bent to the human desire to communicate and connect. \\"People don't want to be entertained,\\" Taehtinen bluntly states. \\"They don't want information. If you go into Internet cafes, you see people are not reading the news; they are all sending email or chatting online. They are willing to pay for social interaction. People want to belong to something.\\" Enduring Lessons While communications and information technology may be ephemeral and uncertain, there are at least two enduring lessons: The first is that the new technologies, as much as their proponents may want them to, do not replace the old. They live side by side, and they converge. The second is that people are complex, retaining the same enduring human needs even as they adapt to new technologies and behaviors. These may seem like fairly obvious, even simplistic, statements. But they have been overlooked more often than recognized in the mad rush to adopt new technology. These realities have fundamental implications for marketing and business strategy. What they mean is that there needs to be a convergence of the old technology and the new to create a portfolio of technologies and channels. The storefront and catalog don't go away when you add the Internet. And, even more important, there is an interaction between humans and technology that changes both. There is a convergence of old consumer behaviors and new behaviors that affects the trajectory of technology, the strategies for marketing and, ultimately, the design of the business. More Human The wonderful thing about our interactions with machines is not in the ways machines can be made to behave in more human ways, but in the way these interactions make it easier for us to see what distinguishes us as humans. The more we move to machine-mediated interactions, the more we see the fundamental and enduring behaviors that are at the core of marketing and business strategy. It is this interaction between man and machine that is changing us, transforming the practice of marketing and our organizations. In this book, we examine how we need to transform our thinking about the nature of these emerging consumers. We explore how to reach these centaurs and establish long-lasting relationships with them. We look at the ways that they remain the same and the ways that they are fundamentally different in their expectations and behaviors. And we consider how they have irrevocably changed and continue to change the theory and practice of marketing, and the design of our organizations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QoSNQgAACAAJ&dq=Convergence+Marketing:+Strategies+for+Reaching+the+New+Hybrid+Consumer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Strong's Exhaustive Concordance with Greek and Hebrew Dictionary","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5iWiZwEACAAJ&dq=Strong%27s+Exhaustive+Concordance+with+Greek+and+Hebrew+Dictionary&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Moon Handbooks Brazil","description":"Each guide contains not only detailed information on the best transportation, accommodation, restaurant, and sightseeing options but also custom maps and fascinating sidebars--all the tools travelers need to make their own choices and create a travel strategy that is theirs alone.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zo2yAAAAIAAJ&dq=Moon+Handbooks+Brazil&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Zen Dictionary","description":"A helpful A-to-Z guide to the terms, central concepts, and history of Zen Buddhism by the acclaimed scholar and author of Concentration.

In 1914 Henry Ford and naturalist John Burroughs visited Thomas Edison in Florida and toured the Everglades. The following year Ford, Edison, and tire maker Harvey Firestone joined together on a summer camping trip and decided to call themselves the Vagabonds. They would continue their summer road trips until 1925, when they announced that their fame made it too difficult for them to carry on. Although the Vagabonds traveled with an entourage of chefs, butlers, and others, this elite fraternity also had a serious purpose: to examine the conditions of America s roadways and improve the practicality of automobile travel. Cars were unreliable and the roads were even worse. But newspaper coverage of these trips was extensive, and as cars and roads improved, the summer trip by automobile soon became a desired element of American life. The Vagabonds is  a portrait of America s burgeoning love affair with the automobile  (NPR) but it also sheds light on the important relationship between the older Edison and the younger Ford, who once worked for the famous inventor. The road trips made the automobile ubiquitous and magnified Ford s reputation, even as Edison s diminished. The automobile would transform the American landscape, the American economy, and the American way of life and Guinn brings this seminal moment in history to vivid life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wjkEEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Vagabonds&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Rich Young Man: Saint Anthony of Padua","description":"St. Anthony of Padua has been a friend to millions of Catholics asking his help to recover lost objects. But few seem to know much about his remarkable life. The son of a knight in the court of Portugal's king, he renounced his heritage of wealth and power to become a Franciscan priest. In the years to come, he earned international fame as a preacher, reformer, miracle worker, champion of the poor, and Doctor of the Church. A generation ago, the American Catholic novelist John Edward Beahn presented Anthony's life and legends in a biographical novel, A Rich Young Man: A Novel Based on the Life of St. Anthony of Padua, published in 1953. This imaginative re-telling of the saint s story, based on historical records and traditions, now comes to life again in the TAN Legend series of biographical fiction. The tale unfolds in the epic setting of medieval Europe of the thirteenth century. Monarchs, courtiers, churchmen, knights, nobles and serfs maneuver like chess pieces in an elaborate game of alliances and conflicts between Church and state, Christian and Muslim, Catholic and heretic. Anthony's story takes us from North Africa where divine providence saved the young friar from his mistaken zeal for martyrdom to Italy and France, where his extraordinary gifts and heroic passion for God blazed a path to the rescue and conversion of countless souls. This TAN Legend edition of A Rich Young Man: A Novel Based on the Life of St. Anthony of Padua paints a rich, fascinating portrait of an astonishing saint who turned the medieval Christian world upside down.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_gQrnwEACAAJ&dq=A+Rich+Young+Man:+Saint+Anthony+of+Padua&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Will and Me","description":"Shakespeare has always been a big part of the author's life.

It begins with the outrage of evangelical parents at what they perceive to be the anti-Christian curriculums of public schools. Sparked by religious zeal and working with the well-oiled machinery of the Christian Coalition, Evangelical Christians are affecting schools and American politics. Bordering the region of the religious right is the shadowy world of conservative think tanks that buy intellectuals to sell a school reform agenda of free market competition between public, private, and for-profit schools to the public and politicians. The Republican Party is strongly affected by the demands of the religious right and the powerful influence of the conservative think tanks. The author explains that the educational programs of George Bush's presidency reflected the plans of conservatives, while the Christian Coalition dominated the 1996 National Republican Platform. Bill Clinton and the New Democrats broadened the appeal of the Democratic Party to middle class voters by promising to increase chances to attend college and to provide lifelong opportunities to upgrade job skills. Education -- the New Democrats proclaim -- is the answer for growing inequality in wealth, insecurity of employment in a world of corporate restructuring, and competition in a global marketplace. The book continues in the splintered arena of the leftist politics. Overwhelmed by New Democrats and the political right, Jesse Jackson clings to the hope of fulfilling the liberal-educational agenda of the War on Poverty. Also feeling under siege by attacks from anti-abortionists and the political right, the National Organization for Women continues its objective of ensuring that women have an equal opportunity for admissions to schools and participation in school programs, and that school materials are free of gender bias and give women positive role models. Gaining support from progressives who are dissatisfied with Republicans and Democrats, the Green Party offers a unique educational agenda of democratic control and ideological diversity. The story concludes with the cultural politics of Indiocentricity and Afrocentricity. From the religious right to the New Democrats, politicians are condemning attempts to change the cultural foundation of U.S. schools.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Rr6eAAAAMAAJ&dq=Political+Agendas+for+Education:+From+the+Christian+Coalition+to+the+Green+Party&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"London (Lonely Planet)","description":"Lonely Planet London is your passport to the most relevant, up-to-date advice on what to see and skip, and what hidden discoveries await you.

Radiation Nation tells the story of what happened that day and in the months and years that followed, as local residents tried to make sense of the emergency. The near-meltdown occurred at a pivotal moment when the New Deal coalition was unraveling, trust in government was eroding, conservatives were consolidating their power, and the political left was becoming marginalized. Using the accident to explore this turning point, Natasha Zaretsky provides a fresh interpretation of the era by disclosing how atomic and ecological imaginaries shaped the conservative ascendancy. Drawing on the testimony of the men and women who lived in the shadow of the reactor, Radiation Nation shows that the region's citizens, especially its mothers, grew convinced that they had sustained radiological injuries that threatened their reproductive futures. Taking inspiration from the antiwar, environmental, and feminist movements, women at Three Mile Island crafted a homegrown ecological politics that wove together concerns over radiological threats to the body, the struggle over abortion and reproductive rights, and eroding trust in authority. This politics was shaped above all by what Zaretsky calls \\"biotic nationalism,\\" a new body-centered nationalism that imagined the nation as a living, mortal being and portrayed sickened Americans as evidence of betrayal. The first cultural history of the accident, Radiation Nation reveals the surprising ecological dimensions of post-Vietnam conservatism while showing how growing anxieties surrounding bodily illness infused the political realignment of the 1970s in ways that blurred any easy distinction between left and right.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wO07DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Enchantments of Love: Amorous and Exemplary Novels","description":"Five men and five women entertain their hostess with stories exploring some aspect of enchantment or love between a handsome gallant and a lovely lady.

How did he come to be? Master of Mystery: The Rise of The Shadow delves into the murky origins of perhaps the most significant media creation of all time. Between 1930 and 1954, The Shadow was a dominant figure in American popular culture. A multi-media sensation, he emerged from the creative cauldron of the earliest days of radio drama, and soon migrated to magazines, comic books, film and eventually paperback books. Only Superman and Batman, who were created a few years later, rivaled The Shadow in global public recognition. A century later, this enigmatic personality and his famous mantra, \\"Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men? The Shadow knows!\\" remains recognizable to new generations born long after his remarkable reign. Popular culture historian and novelist Will Murray explores radio's first superstar and talks to the writers and artists who took a nebulous radio personality and brought him to blazing life in the pages of more than 300 classic pulp novels. Packed with revelations, Master of Mystery reveals how The Shadow inspired the creation of Batman in 1939! Including rare interviews with Walter B. Gibson, Theodore Tinsley, John L.

And after thirteen years of failed attempts, he nailed it. It had never been done before. Growing up in Sierra Mesa, California, Tony was a hyperactive demon child with an I44 IQ. He threw tantrums, terrorized the nanny until she quit, exploded with rage whenever he lost a game; this was a kid who was expelled from preschool. When his brother, Steve, gave him a blue plastic hand-me-down skateboard and his father built a skate ramp in the driveway, Tony finally found his outlet--while skating, he could be as hard on himself as he was on everyone around him. But it wasn't an easy ride to the top of the skating game. Fellow skaters mocked his skating style and dubbed him a circus skater. He was so skinny he had to wear elbow pads on his knees, and so light he had to ollie just to catch air off a ramp. He was so desperate to be accepted by young skating legends like Steve Caballero, Mike McGill, and Christian Hosoi that he ate gum from between Steve's toes. But a few years of determination and hard work paid off in multiple professional wins, and the skaters who once had mocked him were now trying to learn his tricks. Tony had created a new style of skating. In Hawk Tony goes behind the scenes of competitions, demos, and movies and shares the less glamorous demands of being a skateboarder--from skating on Italian TV wearing see-through plastic shorts to doing a demo in Brazil after throwing up for five days straight from food poisoning. He's dealt with teammates who lit themselves and other subjects on fire, driving down a freeway as the dashboard of their van burned. He's gone through the unpredictable ride of the skateboard industry during which, in the span of a few years, his annual income shrank to what he had made in a single month and then rebounded into seven figures. But Tony's greatest difficulty was dealing with the loss of his number one fan and supporter--his dad, Frank Hawk. With brutal honesty, Tony recalls the stories of love, loss, bad hairdos, embarrassing '80s clothes, and his determination that had shaped his life. As he takes a look back at his experiences with the skateboarding legends of the '70s, '80s, and '90s, including Stacy Peralta, Eddie Elguera, Lance Mountain, Mark Gonzalez, Bob Burnquist, and Colin Mckay, he tells the real history of skateboarding--and also what the future has in store for the sport and for him.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=P1j3pMqmnRYC&dq=Hawk+-+Occupation+-+Skateboarder&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Rebirth of the Habsburg Army: Friedrich Beck and the Rise of the General Staff (Contributions in Military Studies)","description":"Friedrich Beck was the single most important figure in the transformation of the inept Habsburg military into the modern military state that would wage World War I.

After firmly establishing the general staff as an institution, Beck led war planning to counter threats from Russia, Italy, and the Balkans; and spearheaded a vast rebuilding of the rail network. While his rise to power marked a return to the favorite system of military administration of the early Franz Joseph period, Beck proved himself a man with real military ability that revolutionized an army.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sY9Pn3urkQ4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Time Maps: Collective Memory and the Social Shape of the Past","description":"The pioneering sociologist and author of The Seven Day Circle continues his analysis of time with this fascinating look at history as social construct. Who were the first people to inhabit North America? Does the West Bank belong to the Arabs or the Jews? Why are racists so obsessed with origins? Is a seventh cousin still a cousin? Why do some societies name their children after dead ancestors? As Eviatar Zerubavel demonstrates in Time Maps, we cannot answer burning questions such as these without a deeper understanding of how we envision the past. In a pioneering attempt to map the structure of collective memory, Zerubavel considers the cognitive patterns we use to organize the past and the social grammar of conflicting interpretations of history. Drawing on fascinating examples that range from Hiroshima to the Holocaust, and from ancient Egypt to the former Yugoslavia, Zerubavel shows how we construct historical origins; how we tie discontinuous events together into stories; how we link families and entire nations through genealogies; and how we separate distinct historical periods from one another through watersheds, such as the invention of fire or the fall of the Berlin Wall. \\"Time Maps extends beyond all of the old clich s about linear, circular, and spiral patterns of historical process and provides us with models of the actual legends used to map history brilliant and elegant.\\"-Hayden White, University of California, Santa Cruz","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZYfp0Tq0pBkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"DCC Made Easy: Digital Command Control for Your Model Railroad (Model Railroader Books)","description":"Explains Digital Command Control in a concise and straightforward way.

Castia?s new book continues the tradition of combining science fact with just the right dose of fiction. Part novel, part science a\\" wholly informative and entertaining. In the fall of 1933 the newly founded Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, welcomed its first faculty member, Albert Einstein. With this superstar on the roster, the Institute was able to attract many more of the greatest scholars, scientists, and poets from around the world. It was to be an intellectual haven, a place where the most brilliant minds on the planet, sheltered from the outside worlda?s cares and calamities, could study and collaborate and devote their time to the pure and exclusive pursuit of knowledge. For many of them, it was the a?one, true, platonic heaven.a Over the years, key figures at the Institute began to question the limits to what science could tell us about the world, pondering the universal secrets it might unlock. Could science be the ultimate source of truth; or are there intrinsic limits, built into the very fabric of the universe, to what we can learn? In the late 1940a?s and early 1950a?s, this important question was being asked and pondered upon by some of the Institutea?s deepest thinkers. Enter the dramatis personae to illuminate the science and the philosophy of the time. Mathematical logician Kurt Godel was the unacknowledged Grant Exalted Ruler of this platonic estate a\\" but he was a ruler without a scepter as he awaited the inexplicably indefinite postponement of his promotion to full, tenured professor. Also in residence was his colleague, the Hungarian-American polymath, John van Neumann, developer of game theory, the axiomatic foundations of quantum mechanics, and the digital computer a\\" stymied by the Institutea?s refusal to sanction his bold proposal to actually build a computer. One of Godela?s closest friends figures large in this story: Albert Einstein, by common consensus the greatest physicist the 20th century had ever known. And, of course, the director the Institute, J. Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb, must by necessity be key to any story that focuses in on this time and place. Author Casti elegantly sets the stage and then masterfully directs this impressive cast of charactersa\\"with able assists by many a?minor-charactera icons like T. S. Eliot, Wolfgang Pauli, Freeman Dyson, and David Bohm, to tell a story of science, history, and ideas. As we watch events unfold (some of which are documented fact while others are creatively imagined fiction), we are witness to the discussions and deliberations of this august groupa| privy to wide-ranging conversations on thinking machines, quantum logic, biology as physics, weather forecasting, the structure of economic systems, the distinction between mathematics and natural science, the structure of the universe, and the powers of the human mind a\\" all centered around the question of the limits to scientific knowledge. Imaginatively conceived and artfully executed, The One True Platonic Heaven is an accessible and intriguing presentation of some of the deepest scientific and philosophical ideas of the 20th century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yFnJ0Wpm3NwC&dq=The+One+True+Platonic+Heaven:+A+Scientific+Fiction+of+the+Limits+of+Knowledge&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Teach yourself Hardanger embroidery","description":"Even beginning stitchers can learn this intricate-looking embroidery technique with our wonderful how-to guide.

His leadership and his assassination, followed by the brutal suppression of the movement and its followers, sparked the civil war, or La Violencia, and the violent political process that continues throughout Colombia today. Using previously unexamined letters by Gaitan and his followers, W. John Green chronicles the rise of Gaitanismo and the reasons for its initial success and ultimate failure. Grounded in the rich correspondence between Gaitan and his supporters, interviews, and the vibrant Gaitanista press, this work focuses on the dynamics of popular political mobilization. It delves into the movement's left-Liberal ideological roots and examines the Gaitanistas' obsession with democracy and social justice. Green provides an insightful portrait of Gaitan as a labor lawyer, deeply connected to the pueblo, who was more the symbol for the movement than the cause. He illuminates the connection between Gaitanismo/La Violencia and the continuing popular violence in Colombia, the distinctions between populism in Latin America and European fascism, Gaitanismo's development into a multi-class movement that superseded gender, race, and regionalism, and the maintenance of Colombia's long-standing formal democracy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LmSVQgAACAAJ&dq=Gaitanismo,+Left+Liberalism,+and+Popular+Mobilization+in+Colombia&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Best of the Britcoms: From Fawlty Towers to Absolutely Fabulous","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5hGsAQAACAAJ&dq=Best+of+the+Britcoms:+From+Fawlty+Towers+to+Absolutely+Fabulous&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Old Families of Salisbury and Amesbury Massachusetts","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Glossary of Geology, Third Edition","description":"This third edition of the Glossary of Geology contains approximately 37,000 terms, or 1,000 more than the second edition, as well as 650 emendations and corrections.

Through the worst years of the Great Depression as many as five thousand laborers toiled twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, to erect the huge structure that would harness the Colorado River and transform the American West. Construction of the giant dam was a triumph of human ingenuity, yet the full story of this monumental endeavor has never been told. Now, in an engrossing, fast-paced narrative, Joseph E. Stevens recounts the gripping saga of Hoover Dam. Drawing on a wealth of material, including manuscript collections, government documents, contemporary newspaper and magazine accounts, and personal interviews and correspondence with men and women who were involved with the construction, he brings the Hoover Dam adventure to life. Described here in dramatic detail are the deadly hazards the work crews faced as they hacked and blasted the dam s foundation out of solid rock; the bitter political battles and violent labor unrest that threatened to shut the job down; the deprivation and grinding hardship endured by the workers  families; the dam builders  gambling, drinking, and whoring sprees in nearby Las Vegas; and the stirring triumphs and searing moments of terror as the massive concrete wedge rose inexorably from the canyon floor. Here, too, is an unforgettable cast of characters: Henry Kaiser, Warren Bechtel, and Harry Morrison, the ambitious, headstrong construction executives who gambled fortune and fame on the Hoover Dam contract; Frank Crowe, the brilliant, obsessed field engineer who relentlessly drove the work force to finish the dam two and a half years ahead of schedule; Sims Ely, the irascible, teetotaling eccentric who ruled Boulder City, the straightlaced company town created for the dam workers by the federal government; and many more men and women whose courage and sacrifice, greed and frailty, made the dam s construction a great human, as well as technological, adventure.

The of the sixteenth century was marked by the Inquisition and Counter-Reformation, a background of ideological cold war against which, despite all odds and at great cost to their creators, brilliant feats of art and science were achieved. No artist captured the dark, violent spirit of the time better than Caravaggio, variously known as Marisi, Moriggia, Merigi, and sometimes, simply M. As art critic Robert Hughes has said, \\"There was art before him and art after him, and they were not the same.\\"Caravaggio threw out Renaissance dogma to paint with dazzling originality and fierce vitality, qualities that are echoed in Robb's prose. As with Caravaggio's art, M arrests and susps time to reveal what the author calls \\"the theater of the partly seen.\\" Caravaggio's wild persona leaps through these pages like quicksilver; in Robb's skilled hands, he is an immensely attractive character with an astonishing connection to the glories and brutalities of life.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2c6VBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Yogi Bear: PLAYTIME IN JELLYSTONE PARK. Hanna-Barbera Authorized Edition.","description":"\\"A true natural genius of comic art.\\"   Mort Walker, creator of Beetle Bailey Starting in 1948, Walt Kelly's newspaper-based comic strip Pogo lampooned sociopolitical issues from the Red Scare to the environmental movement. A gifted cartoonist who began his career at Walt Disney Studios, Kelly explored the virtues and follies of human nature with a lively cast of Okefenokee Swamp critters. Kind-hearted Pogo Possum headed the crew, which included intellectual Howland Owl; exuberant Albert Alligator; poetic mud turtle Churchy LaFemme; romantic hound dog Beauregard Bugleboy; and other impish personalities. Even readers too young to appreciate the strip's satirical elements were charmed by the eccentric creatures and their offbeat wordplay. This compilation features comics from the election year of 1952, during which Pogo's neighbors encouraged the reluctant possum to run for president. Their rallying cry, \\"I Go Pogo,\\" parodied Dwight D. Eisenhower's \\"I Like Ike\\" slogan and provided real-life fans with a write-in candidate. Kelly's sly humor and flair for creative language replete with malapropisms and nonsense verse   retain their imaginative verve for comics enthusiasts of the twenty-first century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sC-oDwAAQBAJ&dq=Yogi+Bear:+PLAYTIME+IN+JELLYSTONE+PARK.+Hanna-Barbera+Authorized+Edition.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Magneto Ignition System","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=F0PSxP_wB5oC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"ULTRATERRANIUM: THE PAINTINGS OF BRUCE PENNINGTON.","description":"From early, now classic, book jackets to recent private paintings this volume collects together for the first time the very best of Pennington's work.

The female moth broadcasts sex pheromones to attract a mate, while a soldier ant deploys an alarm pheromone to call for help. The carbon dioxide on a mammal's breath beckons hungry ticks and mosquitoes, while a flower's fragrance speaks to the honey bee. Indeed, much of the communication that occurs within and between various species of organisms is done not by sight, sound, or touch, but with chemicals. From mating to parenting, foraging to self-defense, plant and animal activities are accomplished largely by the secretion or exchange of organic chemicals. The fascinating and fast-developing science that encompasses these diverse phenomena is introduced here, by William Agosta, in a series of remarkable stories absolutely accessible to the general reader yet revelatory to chemists and biologists. Among Agosta's characters are the organisms that steal, counterfeit, or interpret the chemical signals of other species for their own ends. We learn of seeds that mimic ant odors to facilitate their own dispersion and flies that follow the scent of truffles to lay their eggs. We read about pit vipers that react in terror when their flicking tongues detect a king snake, and slave-making ants incapable of finding their own food. And we meet ice-age people who ate birch fungus to relieve whipworms and early human hunters who used the urine of wolves to maneuver deer to favorable sites. Agosta also chronicles the rapid development of the applied science that makes use of chemical ecology. As researchers deepen our understanding of the biological world, they are making economically significant discoveries (such as enzymes that remain stable in extreme heat), finding ways to reduce our reliance on manufactured pesticides, identifying new uses for traditional medicines, and developing sophisticated new pharmaceuticals effective in treating malaria and several cancers. On the horizon are antiviral agents derived from the chemical defenses of marine species. From the exploits of flies to the high-stakes effort to cure human disease, Agosta's tour of chemical ecology grants any reader entrance to the invisible realm where chemistry determines life and death.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Q0tR0dbm-WQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Charmed Garden","description":"The Charmed Garden is a great introduction to herb gardening.

After an introductory survey of traditional and more recent approaches in social psychology to the study of prejudice, a new 'sociocognitive' theory is sketched. This theory explains how cognitive representations and strategies of ethnic prejudice depend on their social functions within intergroup relations. It is also shown how ethnic prejudice is communicated in society through everyday talk among majority members. The major part of the book systematically analyzes the various dimensions of prejudiced conversations, such as topical structures, storytelling, argumentation, local semantic strategies, style and rhetoric, and more specific conversational properties. It is shown that such an explicit discourse analysis may reveal underlying cognitive representations and strategic uses of prejudice. Moreover, it appeared that many aspects of prejudiced talk are geared towards the overall strategic goals of adequate self-expression and positive self-presentation. This book is interdisciplinary in nature and should be of interest to linguists, discourse analysts, cognitive and social psychologists, sociologists, and all those interested in ethnic stereotypes, prejudice, and racism.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wCXdhI3NKlAC&dq=Prejudice+in+Discourse:+An+analysis+of+ethnic+prejudice+in+cognition+and+conversation+(Pragmatics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Monarchs of the Nile.","description":"A concise account of the lives and times of some of the more significant occupants of the Egyptian throne","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Jsq0AHsC-YMC&dq=Monarchs+of+the+Nile.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Good Moon Rising","description":"Two teenage girls find unexpected love and confront homophobia in this Lambda Literary Awardwinning novel from the author of Annie on My Mind.

Simpson provides an original and broad overview of the evolving serial killer genre in the two media most responsible for its popularity: literature and cinema of the 1980s and 1990s. The fictional serial killer, with a motiveless, highly individualized modus operandi, is the latest manifestation of the multiple murderers and homicidal maniacs that haunt American literature and, particularly, visual media such as cinema and television. Simpson theorizes that the serial killer genre results from a combination of earlier genre depictions of multiple murderers, inherited Gothic storytelling conventions, and threatening folkloric figures reworked over the years into a contemporary mythology of violence. Updated and repackaged for mass consumption, the Gothic villains, the monsters, the vampires, and the werewolves of the past have evolved into the fictional serial killer, who clearly reflects American cultural anxieties at the start of the twenty-first century. Citing numerous sources, Simpson argues that serial killers  recent popularity as genre monsters owes much to their pliability to any number of authorial ideological agendas from both the left and the right ends of the political spectrum. Serial killers in fiction are a kind of debased and traumatized visionary, whose murders privately and publicly re-empower them with a pseudo-divine aura in the contemporary political moment. The current fascination with serial killer narratives can thus be explained as the latest manifestation of the ongoing human fascination with tales of gruesome murders and mythic villains finding a receptive audience in a nation galvanized by the increasingly apocalyptic tension between the extremist philosophies of both the New Right and the anti-New Right. Faced with a blizzard of works of varying quality dealing with the serial killer, Simpson has ruled out the catalog approach in this study in favor of in-depth an analysis of the best American work in the genre. He has chosen novels and films that have at least some degree of public name-recognition or notoriety, including Red Dragon and The Silence of the Lambs by Thomas Harris, Manhunter directed by Michael Mann, Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer directed by John McNaughton, Seven directed by David Fincher, Natural Born Killers directed by Oliver Stone, Zombie by Joyce Carol Oates, and American Psycho by Bret Easton Ellis.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=A3jK8xoAhk0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ray Johnson: How Sad I Am Today...","description":"A comprehensive look at the work of Ray Johnson, the seminal American collage artist whose innovative oeuvre has been ignored by the self-referential mainstream art press.

Wherein lies the fascination with sleep? I am convinced that it is the necessity for sleep. No one has failed to experience the overpowering urge to fall asleep after a disturbed night's sleep or after sleep was curtailed or deprived, especially when our daily activities impose restrictions on motor activity. The demand ofour body and brain to sleep challenges our understanding ofwhy this is the case, and which are the benefits ofa night ofprofound sleep. Also in animals prolongation of waking consistently increases their attempts to fall asleep. It has been stated that sleep is more necessary to animals than even food! The need for sleep and some insight into the consequences of the preceding daily waking activities on subsequent sleep was wonderfully formulated by Shakespeare in Othello: Not poppy nor mandragora, Nor all the drowsy syrups ofthe world, Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep Which thou owed'st yesterday It is interesting that the most powerful single intervention which invariably influences sleep in a positive and predictable manner is the prolongation of waking. The activities which people or animals engage in during the wakefulness episode are secondary in the magnitude oftheir effects on sleep.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RS79mQEACAAJ&dq=Sleep:+Physiology,+Investigations+and+Medicine&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Why Movements Succeed or Fail","description":"Wyoming became the first American state to adopt female suffrage in 1869--a time when no country permitted women to vote. When the last Swiss canton enfranchised women in 1990, few countries barred women from the polls. Why did pro-suffrage activists in the United States and Switzerland have such varying success? Comparing suffrage campaigns in forty-eight American states and twenty-five Swiss cantons, Lee Ann Banaszak argues that movement tactics, beliefs, and values are critical in understanding why political movements succeed or fail. The Swiss suffrage movement's beliefs in consensus politics and local autonomy and their reliance on government parties for information limited their tactical choices--often in surprising ways. In comparison, the American suffrage movement, with its alliances to the abolition, temperance, and progressive movements, overcame beliefs in local autonomy and engaged in a wider array of confrontational tactics in the struggle for the vote. Drawing on interviews with sixty Swiss suffrage activists, detailed legislative histories, census materials, and original archival materials from both countries, Banaszak blends qualitative historical inquiry with informative statistical analyses of state and cantonal level data. The book expands our understanding of the role of political opportunities and how they interact with the beliefs and values of movements and the societies they seek to change.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jA52Fdb_V5sC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The death of a wombat","description":"Picture fiction for older readers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FmsxAAAACAAJ&dq=The+death+of+a+wombat&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Battle of the Bulge in Luxembourg: The Southern Flank - Dec. 1944 - Jan. 1945 Vol.I The Germans (The Germans , Vol 1)","description":"In December 1944, just as World War II appeared to be winding down, Hitler shocked the world with a powerful German counteroffensive that cracked the center of the American front. The attack came through the Ardennes, the hilly and forested area in eastern Belgium and Luxembourg that the Allies had considered a ?quiet? sector. Instead, for the second time in the war, the Germans used it as a stealthy avenue of approach for their panzers. Much of U.S. First Army was overrun, and thousands of prisoners were taken as the Germans forged a 50-mile ?bulge? into the Allied front. But in one small town, Bastogne, American paratroopers, together with remnants of tank units, offered dogged resistance. Meanwhile the rest of Eisenhower?s ?broad front? strategy came to a halt as Patton, from the south, and Hodges, from the north, converged on the enemy incursion. Yet it would take an epic, six-week-long winter battle, the bloodiest in the history of the U.S. Army, before the Germans were finally pushed back. Christer Bergstr?m has interviewed veterans, gone through huge amounts of archive material, and performed on-the-spot research in the area. The result is a large amount of previously unpublished material and new findings, including reevaluations of tank and personnel casualties and the most accurate picture yet of what really transpired. The Ardennes Offensive has often been described from the American point of view; however, this balanced book devotes equal attention to the perspectives of both sides. With nearly 400 photos, numerous maps, and 32 superb color profiles of combat vehicles and aircraft, it provides perhaps the most comprehensive look at the battle yet published.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LfhDBgAAQBAJ&dq=The+Battle+of+the+Bulge+in+Luxembourg:+The+Southern+Flank+-+Dec.+1944+-+Jan.+1945+Vol.I+The+Germans+(The+Germans+,+Vol+1)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Holbein,","description":"Forty-four of Holbein's finest portrait drawings, created while he worked as court painter to Henry VIII, including Sir Thomas More, Jane Seymour, the Prince of Wales, Anne Boleyn, and dozens more.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mWinCgAAQBAJ&dq=Holbein,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Unsung Heroes: Ohioans in the White House : A Modern Appraisal","description":"In the half century between Reconstruction and the Roaring Twenties, swven of the ten men in the White House were Ohioans, presiding over theindustrialization of America and its emergence as a world power.

Miraculously preserved on clay tablets dating back as much as four thousand years, the poem of Gilgamesh, king of Uruk, is the world's oldest epic, predating Homer by many centuries. The story tells of Gilgamesh's adventures with the wild man Enkidu, and of his arduous journey to the ends of the earth in quest of the Babylonian Noah and the secret of immortality. Alongside its themes of family, friendship and the duties of kings, The Epic of Gilgamesh is, above all, about mankind's eternal struggle with the fear of death. The Babylonian version has been known for over a century, but linguists are still deciphering new fragments in Akkadian and Sumerian. Andrew George's gripping translation brilliantly combines these into a fluid narrative and will long rank as the definitive English Gilgamesh.

And what could I say? They were wonderful.\\" From the very beginning of Sergio Troncoso's celebrated story \\"Angie Luna,\\" we know we are in the hands of a gifted storyteller. Born of Mexican immigrants, raised in El Paso, and now living in New York City, Troncoso has a rare knack for celebrating life. Writing in a straightforward, light-handed style reminiscent of Grace Paley and Raymond Carver, he spins charming tales that reflect his experiences in two worlds. Troncoso's El Paso is a normal town where common people who happen to be Mexican eat, sleep, fall in love, and undergo epiphanies just like everyone else. His tales are coming-of-age stories from the Mexican-American border, stories of the working class, stories of those coping with the trials of growing old in a rapidly changing society. He also explores New York with vignettes of life in the big city, capturing its loneliness and danger. Beginning with Troncoso's widely acclaimed story \\"Angie Luna,\\" the tale of a feverish love affair in which a young man rediscovers his Mexican heritage and learns how much love can hurt, these stories delve into the many dimensions of the human condition. We watch boys playing a game that begins innocently but takes a dangerous turn. We see an old Anglo woman befriending her Mexican gardener because both are lonely. We witness a man terrorized in his New York apartment, taking solace in memories of lost love. Two new stories will be welcomed by Troncoso's readers. \\"My Life in the City\\" relates a transplanted Texan's yearning for companionship in New York, while \\"The Last Tortilla\\" returns to the Southwest to explore family strains after a mother's death and the secret behind that death. Each reflects an insight about the human heart that has already established the author's work in literary circles. Troncoso sets aside the polemics about social discomfort sometimes found in contemporary Chicano writing and focuses instead on the moral and intellectual lives of his characters. The twelve stories gathered here form a richly textured tapestry that adds to our understanding of what it is to be human.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7N5JBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Many Lives of Marilyn Monroe","description":"An investigation into the debates surrounding Monroe's life evaluates her numerous roles from sex symbol and innocent to crafty manipulator and dumb blonde, drawing on a wide range of published sources to consider the plausibility of numerous disputed facts while considering how her life reflected shifting cultural attitudes.

The churches featured, which span over a hundred years of history, embody the indomitable religious spirit of their builders. Anchors of Faith is more than just a pictorial encyclopedia, however. The author's descriptions and photos provide detailed information about both the architecture of these houses of worship and the related history, from the founding of these institutions to their current state. Among the jewels featured in Anchors of Faith, Dickson traces the Presbyterian Church of Union Church, Mississippi all the way back to its Gaelic-speaking Scottish Presbyterian immigrants from North Carolina. The author tells the story of the modest start of the East Hill Baptist Church Chapel in Tallahassee, whose congregation formed itself by meeting in one another's houses due to World War II. The distinctive details of the unusual \\"house of cards\\"-like facade of Hatchechubbee United Methodist Church in Hatchechubbee, Alabama, and the Carpenter Gothic style of St. Luke's Episcopal Church in Merritt Island, Florida reveal the architectural uniqueness of some Southern places of worship. From Greek Revival to Victorian Gothic, Dickson helps add to the understanding of religious faith in the rural South through the architecture and history of its many surviving wooden churches.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=abRjDwAAQBAJ&dq=Wooden+Churches&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Wonder of Elephants (Animal Wonders)","description":"Text and photographs introduce these creatures who are the world's largest land animals.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QN8HAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Wonder+of+Elephants+(Animal+Wonders)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The challenge of modern art;","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yFyBngEACAAJ&dq=The+challenge+of+modern+art%3B&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Motorcycle Design & Technology: How and Why","description":"An essential and compelling exploration of the design, history, and culture of the motorcycle - an icon of the machine age Motorcycles are ubiquitous in the world's streets and cities, evolving over decades in engineering and design to meet individual transportation needs.

Drawing on her experiences as a mother and as a proponent of Rudolf Steiner's Waldorf system of education, author Heidi Britz-Crecelius emphasizes the different qualities of play that may extend through more than one phase of childhood. She focuses on natural materials and recommends specific games, toys, and art supplies that further the mobility of the mind and the powers of expression without the burden that premature schooling can place on children. In Children at Play, the author also reminds us that the human being, though bound by laws of space and time and tied to the earth, stems from eternity and belongs to a much larger community; the child's innermost being is directly related to the all-embracing world of spirit.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3TnVpQrpwWUC&dq=Children+at+Play:+Using+Waldorf+Principles+to+Foster+Childhood+Development&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Companion to Analysis: A Second First and First Second Course in Analysis (Graduate Studies in Mathematics)","description":"This book not only provides a lot of solid information about real analysis, it also answers those questions which students want to ask but cannot figure how to formulate.

By keeping his own engagement with the material continually in view, he invites the reader to a similarly high level of involvement.

One of America's leading foreign policy thinkers, Walter Russell Mead, argues that these diverse, conflicting impulses have in fact been the key to the U.S.'s success in the world. In a sweeping new synthesis, Mead uncovers four distinct historical patterns in foreign policy, each exemplified by a towering figure from our past. Wilsonians are moral missionaries, making the world safe for democracy by creating international watchdogs like the U.N. Hamiltonians likewise support international engagement, but their goal is to open foreign markets and expand the economy. Populist Jacksonians support a strong military, one that should be used rarely, but then with overwhelming force to bring the enemy to its knees. Jeffersonians, concerned primarily with liberty at home, are suspicious of both big military and large-scale international projects. A striking new vision of America's place in the world, Special Providence transcends stale debates about realists vs. idealists and hawks vs. doves to provide a revolutionary, nuanced, historically-grounded view of American foreign policy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TmlDcE0BBrsC&dq=A+Special+Providence&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thinking for a Living: How to Get Better Performances And Results from Knowledge Workers","description":"Knowledge workers create the innovations and strategies that keep their firms competitive and the economy healthy. Yet, companies continue to manage this new breed of employee with techniques designed for the Industrial Age. As this critical sector of the workforce continues to increase in size and importance, that's a mistake that could cost companies their future. Thomas Davenport argues that knowledge workers are vastly different from other types of workers in their motivations, attitudes, and need for autonomy--and, so, they require different management techniques to improve their performance and productivity. Based on extensive research involving over 100 companies and more than 600 knowledge workers, Thinking for a Living provides rich insights into how knowledge workers think, how they accomplish tasks, and what motivates them to excel. Davenport identifies four major categories of knowledge workers and presents a unique framework for matching specific types of workers with the management strategies that yield the greatest performance. Written by the field's premier thought leader, Thinking for a Living reveals how to maximize the brain power that fuels organizational success. Thomas Davenport holds the President's Chair in Information Technology and Management at Babson College. He is director of research for Babson Executive Education; an Accenture Fellow; and author, co-author, or editor of nine books, including Working Knowledge: How Organizations Manage What They Know (HBS Press, 1997).","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rpCEnGAGmRsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shakespeare's Othello, the Moor of Venice (Lettered on cover: Annotated English classics)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=u8E5AQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dr. Spock's Baby and Child Care: 8th Edition","description":"OVER 50 MILLION COPIES IN PRINT!

Abandoned as a child, Tungdil the blacksmith labors contentedly in the land of Ionandar, the only dwarf in a kingdom of men.

Sent out into the world to deliver a message and reacquaint himself with his people, the young foundling finds himself thrust into a battle for which he has not been trained. Not only his own safety, but the life of every man, woman and child in Girdlegard depends upon his ability to embrace his heritage.

What she witnessed was a crisis of leadership rooted in a misunderstanding of what leading is all about. Not content to simply offer an opinion-opinions come cheap-she embarked on an eight-year research project to document the reasons for the rapid collapse of a global giant. That collapse, she shows us, began with one critical succession error and was compounded by a chronic failure to understand the importance of personality in the leadership equation. One wrong person at the helm turned a dream into a nightmare. In The Drama of Leadership, Patricia Pitcher shares her findings and, in the process, explodes a number of popular myths about leadership, including the one that leadership and vision are qualities that can be taught in management seminars. She refutes the common belief that leaders are in short supply and proves that the corporate talent pool abounds with potential leaders whose talents either go unrecognized or are tragically undervalued. And she explains why, at a time when vision, innovation, humanity, and passion are so desperately needed, so many companies cast in leadership roles people who possess none of these qualities, and who distrust anyone who does. But who are the good and bad leaders, and how do you identify them? In answer to this question, Patricia Pitcher identifies three types of leaders: Artists, who are people-oriented, open-minded, intuitive, and visionary; Craftsmen, to whom the adjectives \\"humane,\\" \\"dedicated,\\" and \\"wise\\" best apply; and Technocrats - brilliant and well-schooled in the latest theory, they are detail-oriented, rigid, methodical, self-centered, and, when left in control, pose a serious threat to corporate competitiveness. The power struggles between these types are dramas being played out in companies everywhere. Whether the story has a happy or an unhappy ending depends entirely upon which type gets top billing. The author also offers her wise recommendations on what companies can do to protect themselves against a technocratic hegemony and how to cultivate the talents of Artists and Craftsmen. She also tells you how to determine what type of leader you are and how to interact with other types to achieve both personal and corporate success. The Drama of Leadership is an articulate, insightful, passionate appeal to develop the kind of leaders and organizations that can take us into the twenty-first century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-hBD21mJwV8C&dq=The+Drama+Of+Leadership&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Encyclopedia of Chinese and U.S. Patent Herbal Medicines","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Mcg0-1fvzOgC&dq=Encyclopedia+of+Chinese+and+U.S.+Patent+Herbal+Medicines&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Man Who Dreamt of Lobsters: Stories","description":"Nine stories of Ireland and the Irish journey beyond the sentimental myths to explore the grimmer realities of Irish life, in a collection that includes \\"The Meat Eaters\\" and \\"The Butcher's Daughter\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=w3taAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Man+Who+Dreamt+of+Lobsters:+Stories&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Power of Strategic Thinking: Lock In Markets, Lock Out Competitors","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Echo of the Soul: the sacredness of the human body","description":"Contending that many of our contemporary negative preoccupations with physical appearance, image, and sexuality derive from the denial of the notion that we were created in God's image, the author uses Old Testament Wisdom literature to show that the human body, like creation, is actually the dwelling place of God, explaining that ancient texts challenge modern assumptions about love, beauty, and sexuality.

Unger presents neglected historical evidence showing that the reforms implemented from 1946 to 1959 were both necessary and moderate. Although the United States Education Mission of 1946 recommended that the Japanese give serious consideration to the introduction of alphabetic writing, key American officials in the Civil Information and Education Section of GHQ/SCAP delayed and effectively killed action on this recommendation. Japanese advocates of romanization nevertheless managed to obtain CI&E approval for an experiment in elementary schools to test the hypothesis that schoolchildren could make faster progress if spared the necessity of studying Chinese characters as part of non-language courses such as arithmetic. Though not conclusive, the experiment's results supported the hypothesis and suggested the need for more and better testing. Yet work was brought to a halt a year ahead of schedule; the Ministry of Education was ordered to prepare a report that misrepresented the goal of the experiment and claimed it proved nothing. The whole episode dropped from official and scholarly view--until the publication of this book.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ScHa7N2_0HkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Siege of Charleston, 1861-1865","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Falar Ler Escrever Portugues Text (Portuguese Edition)","description":"Barron s 501 Portuguese Verbs teaches you how to use the 501 most common and useful Portuguese verbs.

Through a methodology of intertextual and interlingual close-reading, this study provides evidence of the extent to which Shakespeare influenced Marx and to which Marxism has Shakespearean roots. As a child, Marx was home-schooled in Ludwig von Westphalen's little academy, as it were, which was Shakespeare- and literary-focused. The group included von Westphalen's daughter, who later became Marx's wife, Jenny. The influence of Shakespeare in Marx's writings shows up as early as his school essays and love letters. He modelled his early journalism partly on ideas and rhetoric found in Shakespeare's plays. Each turn in the development of Marx's thought - from Romantic to Left Hegelian and then to Communist - is achieved in part through his use of literature, especially Shakespeare. Marx's mature texts on history, politics and economics - including the famous first volume of Das Kapital - are laden with Shakespearean allusions and quotations. Marx's engagement with Shakespeare resulted in the development of a framework of characters and imagery he used to stand for and anchor the different concepts in his political critique. Marx's prose style uses a conceit in which politics are depicted as performative. Later, the Marx family - Marx, Jenny and their children - was a central figure in the late-nineteenth-century revival of Shakespeare on the London stage, and in the growth of academic Shakespeare scholarship. Through providing evidence for a formative role of Shakespeare in the development of Marxism, the present study suggests a formative role for literature in the history of ideas.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rlqOzgEACAAJ&dq=Marx+and+Marxism+(An+Impact+Book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Campaigning With Grant","description":"Originally printed in 1897, this work provides an eyewitness account to two military efforts which lead to the defeat of the Confederacy--the breaking of the siege at Chatanooga, and the battle at Appomattox.

Between working, housecleaning, and parenting, how do we carve out a minute for ourselves? How can we give ourselves to our spouses and children in the conditions we find ourselves in? Gina Bria writes,  This is how: by being present not in every moment [we re tired enough!] but in key daily activities such as play, spiritual discussions, tender physical attention, and little daily rituals that can see us through the pace of life today to a strong, coherent, lived family life.  With a warm, compassionate tone, anthropologist, nutritionist, and public speaker Gina Bria provides ideas for creating families that withstand the pressures of modern society. The key is creating a personal family culture around the domestic rituals associated with family, such as making your home your true haven from the outside world, really understanding how to play with your children and in your marriage, caring for each others  bodies (young and old!) and finding a spiritual path to travel together. In essence, Gina Bria shows us how to assign meaning to everyday tasks, which builds a family that withstands conformity, rejection and conflict.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ovweLRHEt-MC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pocket PC, Handheld PC Developer's Guide with Microsoft Embedded Visual Basic","description":"CD-ROM contains: Microsoft eMbedded Visual Basic -- Microsoft eMbedded Visual C++ tools -- Microsoft Pocket PC SDK -- Microsoft HPC 2000 SDK.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=O3j9Tovr6MsC&dq=Pocket+PC,+Handheld+PC+Developer%27s+Guide+with+Microsoft+Embedded+Visual+Basic&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"little tiger","description":"After playtime, Little Tiger has to pick up all his toys.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=N8tQAgAAQBAJ&dq=little+tiger&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"LDS Reference Encyclopedia Volume 2","description":"Joseph Smith's life was devoted to inspiring people to come to Christ.

Within that frame the analysis of memory serves the purpose of clarifying the problem. Matter and Memory was written in reaction to the book The Maladies of Memory by Th odule Ribot, which appeared in 1881. Ribot claimed that the findings of brain science proved that memory is lodged within a particular part of the nervous system; localized within the brain and thus being of a material nature. Bergson was opposed to this reduction of spirit to matter. Defending a clear anti-reductionist position, he considered memory to be of a deeply spiritual nature, the brain serving the need of orienting present action by inserting relevant memories. The brain thus being of a practical nature, certain lesions tend to perturb this practical function, but without erasing memory as such. The memories are, instead, simply not 'incarnated', and cannot serve their purpose.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3_2JxAEACAAJ&dq=Matter+and+memory&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Quiet Room: Poetry of Zen Master Jakushitsu","description":"Quiet Room is a collection of Zen poetry by 14th century Zen master Jakushitsu widely considered to be one of the finest poets of the genre.

The recent disaster of the Space Shuttle Columbia was a sad but certain reminder that space travel is an extraordinarily dangerous occupation. Oddly enough, it often takes a tragic accident to remind us that we still have a presence in space. In the decades between triumph and tragedy we tend to ignore the fact that there have been scores of space pioneers who have risked their lives to explore our solar system. Indeed, the International Space Station is sometimes referred to as ??Alpha,? a moniker that implies that it is our first real permanent presence in space. But this notion is frowned upon by the Russians ?\\" and for good reason. Prior to the construction of the controversial International Space Station, a host of daring Russian cosmonauts, and a smaller number of intrepid American astronauts, were living in space for months, some of them for over a year. In this definitive account of man??s quest to become citizens of the cosmos, noted space historian Robert Zimmerman reveals the great global gamesmanship between Russian and American political leaders that drove us to the stars. Beaten to the Moon by their Cold War enemies, the Russians were intent on being first to the planets. They believed that manned space stations held the greatest promise for reaching other worlds and worked feverishly to build a viable space station program ?\\" one that would dwarf American efforts and allow the Russians to claim the vast territories of space as their own. Although unthinkable at the time, the ponderously bureaucratic Soviet Union actually managed to overtake the United States in the space station race. Leveraging their propaganda machine and tyrannical politics to launch a series of daring, dangerous, and scientifically brilliant space exploits, their efforts not only put them far ahead of NASA, they also helped to reshape their own society, transforming it from dictatorship to democracy. At the same time, the American space program at NASA was also evolving, but not necessarily for the better. In fact, the two programs were slowly but inexorably trading places. Drawing on his vast store of knowledge about space travel, as well as hundreds of interviews with cosmonauts, astronauts, and scientists, Zimmerman has superbly captured the excitement and suspense of our recent space-traveling past. For space and history enthusiasts alike, Leaving Earth describes a rich heritage of adventure, exploration, research, and discovery.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aZ3QwAEACAAJ&dq=Leaving+Earth:+Space+Stations,+Rival+Superpowers,+and+the+Quest+for+Interplanetary+Travel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"All Aboard for Glacier: The Great Northern Railway and Glacier National Park","description":"Glacier National Park and the Great Northern Railway became synonymous in the early 20th century.

The ten chapters deal with various aspects of the question, and the voices of a variety of authors - both female and male - are heard. The study opens with an enquiry into violence against women, including in texts by male writers (Hartmann von Aue, Gottfried von Stra?burg, Wolfram von Eschenbach) which indeed describe instances of violence, but adopt an extremely critical stance towards them. It then proceeds to show how women were able to develop an independent identity in various genres and could present themselves as authorities in the public eye. Mystic texts by Hildegard of Bingen, Marie de France and Margery Kempe, the medieval conduct poem known as Die Winsbeckin, the Devout Books of Sisters composed in convents in South-West Germany, but also quasi-historical documents such as the memoirs of Helene Kottaner or Anna Weckerin's cookery book, demonstrate that far more women were in the public gaze than had hitherto been assumed and that they possessed the self-confidence to establish their positions with their intellectual and their literary achievements.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OPSu6UQ_YyIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Toward a Democratic China: The Intellectual Autobiography of Yan Jiaqi","description":"During the 1980s, as director of the Political Science Institute at the Chinese Academy of Social Science - China's most prestigious think-tank - Yan Jiaqi proposed many of the political reforms undertaken by the Chinese government, including term limitations for high-level officials, separation of party and state, and creation of a civil service system.

Its international controlling body, FIFA, boasts more members than the United Nations. Bill Murray traces the growth of what during pre-industrial times was called \\"the simplest game\\" through its codification in the nineteenth century to the 1994 World Cup, held for the first time in the United States. Murray weaves the sport's growth into the culture and politics of the countries where it has been taken up, analyzing its reputation as a game that has seen more riots and on-field brawls than all other types of football combined. He vividly illustrates how soccer has become the world's most popular sport, one that has resisted the interference of politicians, dictators, and profiteers and - more recently - the demands of television, through which it has spread to virtually every corner of the globe. The World's Game will be entertaining and enlightening to anyone from the most avid, knowledgeable fan to those who merely hope to learn a little about the sport.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CRkIAcCB_0EC&dq=The+World%27s+Game:+A+History+of+Soccer+(Illinois+History+of+Sports)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Imperial Legend: The Mysterious Disappearance of Tsar Alexander I","description":"Thoroughly researched and utterly riveting, a revelatory work details the death of one of Russia's greatest emeperors, Alezander I, which lead to much speculation that he actually staged his death to cover a devastating secret, and suggests that Feodor Kuzmich, a holy man who wandered through Russia doing good works, and Alexander were one and the same person. 15,000 first printing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sNAVhSBtlxkC&dq=Imperial+Legend:+The+Mysterious+Disappearance+of+Tsar+Alexander+I&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Awaken the Olympian Within: Stories from America's Greatest Olympic Motivators","description":"Without exception, the athletes who contributed these chapters have addressed groups, large and small, in their collective mission to share the power and relevance of their Olympic experiences.

Historian and former soldier Chris Bray tells the sweeping story of military justice from the earliest days of the republic to contemporary arguments over using military courts to try foreign terrorists or soldiers accused of sexual assault. Stretching from the American Revolution to 9/11, Court-Martial recounts the stories of famous American court-martials, including those involving President Andrew Jackson, General William Tecumseh Sherman, Lieutenant Jackie Robinson, and Private Eddie Slovik. Bray explores how encounters of freed slaves with the military justice system during the Civil War anticipated the civil rights movement, and he explains how the Uniform Code of Military Justice came about after World War II. With a great eye for narrative, Bray hones in on the human elements of these stories, from Revolutionary-era militiamen demanding the right to participate in political speech as citizens, to black soldiers risking their lives during the Civil War to demand fair pay, to the struggles over the court-martial of Lieutenant William Calley and the events of My Lai during the Vietnam War. Throughout, Bray presents readers with these unvarnished voices and his own perceptive commentary. Military justice may be separate from civilian justice, but it is thoroughly entwined with American society. As Bray reminds us, the history of American military justice is inextricably the history of America, and Court-Martial powerfully documents the many ways that the separate justice system of the armed forces has served as a proxy for America s ongoing arguments over equality, privacy, discrimination, security, and liberty.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cRiZCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Titanic: Death of the Dream Ship (American Disasters)","description":"This original and  meticulously researched retelling of history s most infamous voyage  (Denise Kiernan, New York Times bestselling author) uses the sinking of the Titanic as a prism through which to examine the end of the Edwardian era and the seismic shift modernity brought to the Western world.  While there are many Titanic books, this is one readers will consider a favorite  (Voyage). In April 1912, six notable people were among those privileged to experience the height of luxury first class passage on  the ship of dreams,  the RMS Titanic: Lucy Leslie, Countess of Rothes; son of the British Empire Tommy Andrews; American captain of industry John Thayer and his son Jack; Jewish-American immigrant Ida Straus; and American model and movie star Dorothy Gibson. Within a week of setting sail, they were all caught up in the horrifying disaster of the Titanic s sinking, one of the biggest news stories of the century. Today, we can see their stories and the Titanic s voyage as the beginning of the end of the established hierarchy of the Edwardian era. Writing in his signature elegant prose and using previously unpublished sources, deck plans, journal entries, and surviving artifacts, Gareth Russell peers through the portholes of these first-class travelers to immerse us in a time of unprecedented change in British and American history. Through their intertwining lives, he examines social, technological, political, and economic forces such as the nuances of the British class system, the explosion of competition in the shipping trade, the birth of the movie industry, the Irish Home Rule Crisis, and the Jewish-American immigrant experience while also recounting their intimate stories of bravery, tragedy, and selflessness. Lavishly illustrated with color and black and white photographs, this is  a beautiful requiem  (The Wall Street Journal) in which  readers get the story of this particular floating Tower of Babel in riveting detail, and with all the wider context they could want  (Christian Science Monitor).","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2l0BEAAAQBAJ&dq=Titanic:+Death+of+the+Dream+Ship+(American+Disasters)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Garland Companion to Vladimir Nabokov (Garland Reference Library of the Humanities)","description":"First published in 1995.

In the shamanic worldview of Tibet, the five elements of earth, water, fire, air, and space are accessed through the raw powers of nature and through non-physical beings associated with the natural world. The Tibetan tantric view recognizes the elements as five kinds of energy in the body and balances them with a program of yogic movements, breathing exercises, and visualizations. In Dzogchen teachings, the elements are understood to be the radiance of being, and are accessed through pure awareness. Healing with Form, Energy, and Light offers the reader healing meditations and yogic practices on each of these levels. Tenzin Rinpoche's purpose is to strengthen our connection to the sacred aspect of the natural world and to present a guide that explains why certain practices are necessary and in what situations practices are effective or a hindrance.
