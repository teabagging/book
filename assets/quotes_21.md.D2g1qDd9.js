Great read!"},{"Title":"PAVILION OF WOMEN","review":"Pearl S. Buck's novel tells the story of the Wu family in pre-communist China. Nobel and respected, they have lived for generations in the same tradition. Madame Wu is the mistress of this household, her whole life spent fulfilling the duties of her sex - ministering to her husband, bearing sons, dealing with servants, maintaining a smooth order in the house. But she is intelligent and deeply emotional, and has felt caged by an existence where everyone else come first.So on her fortieth birthday, Madame Wu decides to \\"retire\\" from her duties, to find time for herself. She arranges matters in the house like pieces on a chess board - procuring a concubine for her husband, and marrying off her children, hoping they will no longer demand her attention. But her retreat brings only emptiness, until a foreign priest enters the house to tutor her son.What follows is not a typical \\"forbidden love\\" story. Instead, \\"Pavillion of Women\\" uses the plot to explore themes of identity, self-love and what our connections with other people really mean. Madame Wu finds that freedom doesn't mean running away from duty. It involves learning to love herself first, setting her spirit free. It is then that she is able to return to her duties with a new sense of content.The conflict between responsibility to the group and personal freedom is played out in the family, as a microcosm of China as a whole at the time. But the issues here transcend time and culture - most of us will be able to relate to them. The book is beautifully written, and I recommend it if you want a story that makes you think."},{"Title":"PAVILION OF WOMEN","review":"I love and treasure this book immeasurably. Every time I find a copy at a used book sale, I buy it and send it to my one of my women friends. Women everywhere should read this spectacular, beautifully written story of the independent, sassy Madame Wu. I thought Ms. Buck could never top \\"The Good Earth\\" but this one did it for me. I won't give a book report, just my humble opinion that this book should be on the reading list of every woman on earth....even my 20-something daughters loved the story."},{"Title":"PAVILION OF WOMEN","review":"After reading and thoroughly enjoying her novel, \\"Pavilion of Women\\" (written in 1948), it was not difficult for me to understand why Pearl S. Buck earned the Nobel Peace Prize for Literature in 1938. As a natural storyteller, Buck allows one to enter the heart and mind of her main character, the beautiful and accomplished Madame Wu, so fully and painlessly by using simple explanations that seem so effortlessly illumined that they transcend the cultural differences of a mid 20th century China and allow this magnificent multi-dimensional creation to speak as a fully flesh and blood universal woman.As the title suggests, the plot revolves around the day to day happenstances of the oppressed \`pavilion of women' that provides a wealthy Chinese gentleman's \`happiness' in the form of siring future generations and keeping him pleasured as befits his rank as lord and master. Madame Wu, the one and only wife, on the day of her fortieth birthday decides quite calculatingly to acquire a concubine for this husband whom she has never loved, allowing her to rid herself within the complicated etiquette of the Chinese upper class of the burden of servicing her husband conjugally. As the mother of four sons, in her eyes and in the eyes of society, she fulfilled her duty as a wife. Fully knowing that she will continue to oversee the management of all who live under her domain, she nevertheless anticipates her retirement with relish, planning to read and self-educate herself within the confines of her father-in-law's well-stocked library. As a mother and mother-in-law, she must tactfully and eloquently steer her sons and daughters-in-law towards a rich and satisfying future in a newer less understood world while still buttressing the Chinese family infrastructure to continue what she herself withholds as traditionally correct.As China plummets towards modern thinking and communism, Madame Wu discovers that she must make concessions. Thinking to arrange the marriage of her broader-minded third son, she hires an unconventional Italian priest, Brother Andre, to teach languages and the known sciences to better endow her Fengmo with the intellectual assets he now needs to captivate a more progressive bride.Instead, the self-disciplined Madame Wu finds that she is mesmerized by the foreigner's gentle persuasiveness. With him she explores the idea of the soul and its ever pressing quest for freedom and realizes that throughout her life thus far she played the role of a wise albeit voyeuristic manipulator rather than that of thinking and feeling woman. Her gentle yet intense spiritual love for Andre reinforces Madame Wu's innate strength and enables her to make free, wise and joyous decisions that bring a warm happiness to the inhabitants under her domain.Bottom line: While the storyline moves along nicely, what makes \\"Pavilion of Women\\" an absolute pleasure to read is the clarity of Madame Wu's portrait that Buck allows us to form first from the inner workings of Madame Wu's mind and then from the soaring aspirations of her soul as it communes with that of Brother Andre. Buck's language flows from one \`pavilion' event to the next; her style is relaxed and easy to read, the development of Madame Wu's identity both believable and beautiful. Highly recommended for its ability to entertain and depict an alien culture.Diana F. Von Behren\\"reneofc\\""},{"Title":"PAVILION OF WOMEN","review":"This is a strange love story.

It's the story of Madame Wu, beautiful and intelligent, who decides on her 40th birthday that her physical duty to her husband is over and, against his will, finds him a concubine. She is as deep as he is shallow, a good wife and mother, who prides herself on having raised four sons and married off the three oldest, but she doesn't realize she has never loved her husband, until she meets her real soulmate in the person of Brother Andre, a renegade Catholic priest whom she engages to teach her son foreign languages. Madame Wu also becomes Brother Andre's pupil and learns more from him than he ever set out to teach; what Brother Andre gives Madame Wu is the priceless gift of self-knowledge. Madame Wu has been the heart and soul of her large household, totally in control in her quiet way, but she realizes that running her large household is one thing; running her family's lives is something else again, and the best thing she can do for them is help them be who they were meant to be.

Once I picked it up, I couldn't put it down till I was finished with this book. It is a very moving and thoughtful book ~~ opening my eyes to something else that I would have never thought of reading.This book is about Madame Wu, who decided to retire from married life at the age of 40. She suggested a concubine for her husband as she believes very strongly that his needs need to be met ~~ just not by her. Her excuse is that she didn't want to bear any more children, but that is just a public excuse, one she offered to everyone who asked. The truth is, she didn't love her husband and wanted to retire from that part of her marriage. Needless to say, it unsettled the entire family ~~ even the concubine was unsettled. It reverberated throughout the entire book till the very end, when everyone seems to have moved onto their own problems.This is a book on a busy wealthy Chinese family. It is about traditions and ideas, non-traditions, love and finding purpose in life. It is about family relationships between father, son, mother, son, mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, friendships, and even between mistress and servant.Madame Wu never thought she'd find peace and happiness till one of her sons' instructors came along. He was a Jesuit priest and they struck up a friendship based on conversations (which she remembered after his death). He literally changed her life and thought process. From being a woman who always did what she was told, she was liberated to being a free-thinking woman who strove to find peace in her soul.It is a book that I would recommend to all readers ~~ and it is definitely a book for a book club to discuss!

She instead decides she will obtain a concubine for her husband and simply...retire, so to speak, and just do what is necessary to keep the household running. Yet, is life ever that easy?Madame Wu is a character that is easy to admire: self-contained and self-reliant, she is organized and intelligent and is skilled at managing both the household and the accounts. She is also socially skilled at handling the individuals in her household. There seems to be nothing lacking in this woman. She moves the individuals in her life around like pieces on a chessboard - but she lacks the emotional sense most individuals have.This story is one in which Madame Wu must somehow find herself after 40 years of living on this earth, if it isn't too late. And, as a reader, Madame Wu's journey is one of fascination. As she learns things about herself, faces things she had never considered before, the reader is almost compelled to look at themselves and ask: \\"Am I all that I can be?\\"Admittedly, Pearl S Buck is one of my favorite authors. I've not yet read anything of hers that I haven't liked, and this is no exception.

This novel begins when Madame Wu decides to get her husband a concubine on her 40th birthday and thus free herself from duty. Madame Wu (M. Wu), the novel's protagonist, is a woman that has been bound by duty for many years, and has striven for perfection in all of her life's choices. In choosing a concubine for her husband, she intends to free herself from her duty to her husband, and yet continue the rest of her familial responsibilities.As the novel progresses, the reader discovers that in order to allow her husband to flourish, Madame Wu, a wiser and more intelligent person than her husband, has given up pursuit of her own pleasures in order to build up the esteem of her husband and create a thriving home for the entire family. After all, as Old Gentleman, M. Wu's father-in-law, once said, \\"Intelligence, more than poverty and riches, divides human beings and makes them friends or enemies.\\" M. Wu's intelligence in a threat to her husband, and so she must abandon it. In choosing a concubine for her husband, thus horrifying both her friends and family, M. Wu's trapped spirit sees only freedom within its grasp.However, once the concubine, dubbed \\"Ch'iuming\\" by M. Wu, enters their life, things get complicated. Even Mr. Wu cannot understand why his wife, formally so loving, has now become so \\"monstrous cold.\\" From unrequited loves, to forbidden loves, to unequal marriages--Pavilion of Women is not quite a love story, and more of a literary exposition on the pursuit of perfection and the costs of selfish-love over unselfish-love.In an effort to marry off one of her sons, M. Wu asks a foreign tutor, named Brother Andre, to tutor her son in English and make him more \\"eligible\\" for the woman she has chosen for him. M. Wu is manipulative in nearly all that she does, flattering to obtain her own means, but there is instilled in the reader a sense of sympathy for the woman who had no choice in her marriage, and is making the most out of the duties handed to her. With Bother Andre, however, M. Wu finds a kindred spirit that she never expected to find in the priest-without-a-church. Brother Andre, a man who refuses to acknowledge one true religion, and believes that all gods are \\"God,\\" is still a man of great worth. He believes that \\"religion is better without money\\" and refuses M. Wu's payment for tutoring her son. Brother Andre traverses the city and takes in abandoned girls, teaching them with his vast wisdom in languages, astronomy, etc., and, at the age of 16, finds them husbands.When M. Wu's son leaves the house, his marriage to the woman of M. Wu's choice all but crumbling, M. Wu soon enlists Brother Andre to tutor her son's wife, in hopes that it will improve their relationship. But the son's wife is no scholar. Soon, M. Wu becomes Brother Andre's best student, and from that point in the novel, M. Wu becomes a much more sympathetic character, changing so that even her servants do not recognize her.Pavilion of Women was a book that I fully intended to dislike, having read The Good Earth by Pearl S. Buck prior to this, and not having liked it. However, by a third of the way through, I had to know how M. Wu's story would end. It is not action packed, but slow moving and thought provoking, so if you're looking for a quick read or an action-packed thriller, look elsewhere. If you want to meditate on some interesting thoughts and characters, pick up Pavilion of Women and enjoy a luxurious read through Chinese culture and history, where the characters are richly described and become well known to you."},{"Title":"PAVILION OF WOMEN","review":"Pearl S.

Yet I would even venture to say that the advice that this priest gives Madame Wu might even....change you!"},{"Title":"PAVILION OF WOMEN","review":"This novel begins in the world of the classic Chinese novel--it could be The Dream of the Red Chamber or a Judge Dee tale. All is beautiful, precise, elegant, traditional ... But soon Madame Wu realizes that the traditional ways are not working anymore. She tries to use tradition to satisfy Western, feminist cravings to find deeper meaning for her life. Understanding and then loving a Western man, Madame Wu suddenly sees her life and family in an entirely new way. The novel is poetic, philosophical, and yet personal. As Madame Wu and the world politics of the 40s change forever the Wu family, the mind of the reader is changed as well."},{"Title":"PAVILION OF WOMEN","review":"The ancient ways of China and the structure of their family living together under the authority of Madame Wu is absolutely fascinating to me. I can see how the Chinese ancient organization of the family that existed for thousands of years helps the family members understand where they belong within the unit. It also shows that learning is lifelong. We need our elders, scholars without the burden of blood family, and each age group in our human family to contribute to the richness of life.Through Madame Wu's thirst for knowledge we see that even those who have lived long still have to much to learn to be open and able to love."},{"Title":"PAVILION OF WOMEN","review":"Pavilion of Women provokes thought about the nature of women's roles, not only in China, where the novel is set, but also in the world in general. The juxtaposition of ideas from the West and East is exposed through the characters of Madame Wu, a woman newly turned 40, who has decided to end the physical aspect of her relationship with her husband, Brother Andre, an unorthodox, but very intensely committed priest, and Little Sister Hsia, a foil for Brother Andre, offering a more traditional Christianity. Timeless questions about the nature of relationships between women and men, parent and child, and privileged and poor are explored. I found passages so moving and thought-provoking that I saved them in a journal for further contemplation. This is a good book for women--and men! I would also recommend it for my high school-age daughters in order that their consciousness of their roles as women be raised. The issues raised in this book are not limited only to China of the early twentieth century; they are timeless."},{"Title":"PAVILION OF WOMEN","review":"The story is the typical Chinese setting: wife brings in a concubine for husband.

She is so adept at taking the reader right into a foreign world and making it understandable. One begins to see how we are all really the same underneath our outward appearances and social customs. In this book, wealtlhy Madame Wu changes the course of her entire family's lives because of her strong desires to ultimately satisfy self. At first, her actions appear to be somewhat self-sacrificing in a certain way. Some readers may find her attitudes and actions quite modern, but there are far-reaching consequences to those actions and one wonders how selfless those actions really are in the end. I found the surprise turn in Madame Wu's relationship/feelings for the exiled priest to be a bit far-fetched for a wealthy Chinese woman of her time, but life can take odd twists and turns. To me this book is a moral tale of actions and consequences. I do not belive she or her family were better off in the end in spite of her taking over the care of the priest's orphans. Very interesting reading...food for thought."},{"Title":"PAVILION OF WOMEN","review":"The final sentence of the book, &quot;she knew she was immortal&quot;, describes a women's journey from domination to submission. Madame Wu, a wealthy landowner's wife in pre-war China is in control of her family's destiny. She decides at the age of 40 to retire from being her husband's lover and instead 'buys' him a young concubine so she can spend the rest of her life seeking her own pursuits of the spirit. Instead she finds that all under her own 'control' is falling apart until she meet's her son's tutor, Brother Andre who begins to teach her about life and the immortal decisions she is making. At first she is skeptical but soon she begins to notice that his words and ideas breathe new life into what she begins to understand is her soul.Instead of 'controlling' her family's happiness she begins to understand that happiness comes from setting the soul free so it can truly be itself. In doing that she understands her own immortality and achieves a peace she never thought attainable.Pearl Buck weaves a story of a beautiful, dutiful woman who in the world's view has everything but learns to give it up so she may find the happiness that all souls seek, freedom to be who God intended."},{"Title":"PAVILION OF WOMEN","review":"This is an awesome and thought provoking novel by Pearl Buck.

I found it fascinating to gain insight from my armchair, culture and traditions from China. I loved the characters and the style it was written.

I find Pearl Buck to be an author that really holds my attention, and write about complex characters that I don't really always like, but in the end, because of the author's writing and vision, I come to see them as really complex human beings.This book, in particular, I think is really spiritual. I really wish that I had a book group to discuss this book with. At the beginning, I didn't really care for or understand the main character, Madame Wu. She decides after her 40th birthday party, that her husband can have a concubine and that she can turn inward. In the beginning, this is really quite a difficult concept for me, but in a way, it's also very liberating. It's a form of birth control for her, and also a way to keep her husband satisfied. In the end, Pearl Buck, as an author, really shows this woman to be very multidimensional, and I feel, quite spiritual and not so superficial as I think she starts out to be.In the background, there are daughter in laws who are more liberated than Madam Wu, and the chafe at the idea of a concubine. They are too modern for that and would not stand for having a concubine in the house. Some of this is quite historical fand relates gently to the communist revolution. Also it is showing generational differences and lack of understanding between generations. In the end, Madame Wu, I feel , is far more liberated than her daughter in laws, no matter how modern they are.There is also a DVD of this story, and I think the DVD cover is on the book cover that I read. If it shows a white man in an embrace with a Chinese woman, as if they were about to kiss, I want to warn you that this Hollywood image is not really the book at all. And in fact, that picture does not occur in the book either. Really, that image is an abomination of the book.I do know, by reading Pearl Buck, why she is a Nobel prize winner in writing. For me, it's this. She helps you to see characters (people) that you might really hate or disagree with in real life as real, very multifacted people. And though I might not always come to agree or fully care about her characteres, through her writing, I will learn to understand and respect them more than I would have if I had not read the book.

It is not a book for girls, or even young women. It is a book for women. Women who have been married a long time. They alone, I think, would understand, sympathize and identify with the actions of the main character, Madame Wu, who, on her 40th b'day, arranges for her husband to take a &quot;little wife&quot;,and the consquences of this action on the family. I know the premise sounds simple but this book explores the very deep waters of the human heart.

After reading this book, I sometimes find myself thinking, \\"How would Madame Wu act in this situation?\\" This is a book I'd want to give to any of my female friends as they reach the age of 40 - it conveys so beautifully how, as we age and know ourselves better, still there are discoveries to be made and surprises to be experienced."},{"Title":"PAVILION OF WOMEN","review":"The movie was good but it doesn't follow the book and the book is much better."},{"Title":"PAVILION OF WOMEN","review":"while there is the occasional comment or description that seems outdated to today's reader, the overall glimpse into 'private' life in China is remarkable. It is obvious the author lived there and knew the society she wrote about, at least as well as a non-Chinese person--who would always be an outsider to some extent--could possibly know that society. I was mesmerized--really, really enjoyed it. It rings true in every way that matters--and is surprisingly progressive in terms of a woman deciding to forge her own life within the context provided by the traditional culutre. Very interesting how she learns to live that life and learns from that life."},{"Title":"PAVILION OF WOMEN","review":"If anyone wonders how revolutions happen, this book is a good place to start. Through the Wu family, feudal lords in rural China, we see inside a house of power and privilege based solely on inheritance where generations of Wus have presided over lands and servants. A home where most of the women lie idle all day while wet nurses feed and care for their children (while their own go hungry, living hours away from their mothers); servants draw baths, comb hair, and serve tea; and cooks prepare and serve every meal. The men occasionally look over the fields or the markets, but aside from a few overlord sorts of duties, they primarily focus on making sure their wives are obedient and their every pleasure is met. But alas, Buck begins to show the tide of change that comes to China, and we see this change through the Wu family as Madame Wu reaches forty, and her own children grow up and marry. Madame Wu balances delicately on the tightrope that connects past with present. She holds to tradition while inching toward a different view for the future. She begins this journey on her fortieth birthday when she decides she has spent enough time in her husband's bedroom, serving his needs. She decides to bring a concubine into the house for him so that she can take up residence in her own rooms, space all her own where she can think and read and, eventually, befriend her third son's \\"foreign\\" (aka Western) tutor. I suppose we could call the novel a multi-generation soap opera, but Buck manages to keep it real enough that we're captured rather than annoyed by the characters. Madame Wu manages her family with grace and wisdom and patience. In many ways, my life has nothing in common with hers-and yet, it does. I want tradition, but I welcome new ideas; I want a strong marriage but also my independence; I want respect and authority within my home, but I want my children to follow their own passions. I want Madame Wu's qualities, but not her life. At times, though, she does seems a bit superhuman, a bit too perfect. Though she occasionally admits to mistakes, she seems to have no flaws.Through the Wu family, we see the eventual break-up of the traditional feudal system and the traditional family of several generations under one roof. The youngest son chooses to become a farmer, wanting life in the outdoors rather than in books and inside the family walls. The third son chooses to serve the peasant people by building schools to help educate them. The second son wants further learning and education that he can only receive in a city, so he heads to Shanghai. Only the eldest son clings to the life in which he was raised, a life with his subservient wife, a life where he tells his brother, \\"I think first of our family, not of strangers and common folk,\\" a life where he feels it is not necessary to have hospitals for the poor because there are too many people already and \\"why should so many live?\\" Buck probably didn't realize that in this character she created a 2012 Republican politician. And who says a story about 1940's pre-revolutionary China has little to do with 21st century America? We seem to be fighting similar battles."},{"Title":"PAVILION OF WOMEN","review":"The book arrived in a reasonable amount of time and in great condition. I haven't read it yet - it was purchased to be read for a book club. Since it's by Pearl Buck I'm sure it's good."},{"Title":"PAVILION OF WOMEN","review":"Madame Wu's decision is a difficult one to make, yet she makes it without hesitation. On her fortieth birthday, a new woman is to enter the house of Wu as the concubine of her own husband. Unwilling because of hi love for her, he nevertheless has to accept his wife's wish. Not even the distress her own children feel prevent her from carrying out her plan. Although criticised by everyone, Madame Wu won't change her mind: hers is a deliberate decision. Yet, her own sons and daughters-in-law do not understand why she would want to preserve this old tradition. Everybody feels Madame Wu's beauty and intelligence perfectly justify her husband's affection. The decision of taking a concubine coming from her is highly stupefying and distressing, as no wife would tamely accept her husband taking a second wife, let alone forcing him into doing it. Throughout the book, the reader experiences a mixed feeling of impotence, admiration and anger. Impotence towards habits and traditions that seem impossible to change. Admiration for a woman who is capable of bearing such a situation. Anger for her unwillingness to change it. The reader is led to wonder why should a woman want to perpetuate well-rooted traditions, when these are totally against her sex. And this is exactly what the younger generation cannot understand either. The discovery the reader makes towards the end of the book is overwhelming: Madame Wu has never loved her husband. The concubine she is forcing in his bed is thus nothing but a means of conquering a freedom she has never been allowed to have as a devote wife. The discovery of the love she feels for the dead clergyman Andr&eacute; reassures her on her resolution and partly explains Madame Wu's reject of occidental habits. A cold, conscious, determined woman. A woman representing the triumph of the mind over passion. The control of the feelings matched to the more truthful and purest love for a man."},{"Title":"The President as Architect : Franklin D. Roosevelt's Top Cottage","review":"Being a lover of all things Roosevelt, I was thrilled to discover that not only is FDR's Top Cottage in Hyde Park open to the public, but that there is now even a book on this fascinating structure. FDR built Top Cottage as an answer to Eleanor's Val-Kill cottage, as a hideaway from the craziness of his mother's \\"big house\\" and as a place to retire. Sara Roosevelt was very opposed to this project and is rumored to have made FDR promise he would never spend the night there as long as she was alive. He apparently honored this commitment and never slept there overnight, even though she predeceased him by three years.This house is fascinating for several reasons. First, it was designed by Roosevelt himself, with some help from architect Henry Toombs. This is perhaps the first house designed by a president since Jefferson's Poplar Forrest. It also has a barrier-free design for a wheelchair bound inividual--something unheard of in the 1930's. And with the exception of the Little White House is Warm Springs, Georgia, it was entirely his to decorate as he saw fit. Mother and wife had no influence here. FDR was able to use Top Cottage to escape, to entertain friends, and to even host royal dignitaries and important guests. Unfortunately, we know that he never lived out his dream to retire there.When I ordered this book, based on the price and the description, I expected something of a coffee table-type book. In this regard, it is less than I expected. When the house was purchased in 1997 and before restoration took place, a \\"historic structure report\\" was completed. This report is the basis for the book. There are many photographs and drawings, although many are just variations on floor plans. All the photos are black and white. There are several interior pictures from the FDR years, but not nearly enough. One chapter details every room--walls, ceilings, baseboards, appliances, etc. Another lists everything that needed to be done to each and every room. This doesn't exactly make for riveting reading. The few interior pictures after the restoration show only empty rooms, and the reader is left wondering whether the cottage has been furnished or not.Still, there is much information to be gleamed from this book for readers who are fascinated by the Roosevelt's. The story of the planning and construction of this dwelling is very informative, as well as how the cottage was used once constructed. This book also details the history of the cottage from the time of FDR's death until it was purchased for historic purposes in 1997. The author also goes into great depth about all the work that had to be done to restore the cottage to vintage FDR. While any Roosevelt fan will enjoy this book, it is a little rough going for a novice. Also, I thought the ... price tag a little steep. So while I did enjoy the book for what it was, it ended up being not quite what I expected."},{"Title":"The President as Architect : Franklin D.

However, he knows his meager pension will not cover the expense of him and his wife Lily living on the tropical island of Ko Samui.A bitter Jack becomes approachable to bribery and information technology executive Emslie Warnaby offers the bait. In exchange for stealing a file the police sized during an arrest, Emslie will provide two plane tickets to Ko Samui and the deed to a hotel on the island. However, Jack's efforts to beat the clock imposed on him by Emslie fail even as the cop keeps raising his criminal activity.THE BAD DETECTIVE shows why H.R.F. Keating deserves the life time achievement award he has received. The story line centers on Jack's efforts to retrieve the file. However, on a deeper level Mr. Keating provides an interesting financial parity between the crooks and the cops.

Not just neglecting his job, either.When he applies himself to solving a problem, he NEVER has a plan, options, or an exit strategy. (Sound familiar?) This continually suprises him.He's always a hair-trigger away from violence - will he blow? - no, the only violence he commits is off-stage. Nor does he ever learn from his mistakes and improve. \\"Victories\\" gained by luck are claimed; inevitable \\"defeats\\" are rationalized away.

Z-z-z-z-z. Oh, sorry, I must have dozed off there for a moment. Which shouldn't happen while recounting crime fiction, right?Though Stallworthy's horizons have been circumscribed by his doctor as the story (such as it is) peters out, one can only shrug So what? Can there really be any sense of irony or loss when the good Sgt. has done so little detecting in the story-- whose unintriguing plot focuses (repetitively) on the mechanics of retrieving a document-- and hasn't noticeably developed as an individual either?To judge by his awards and output, Keating *must* be better than this, one thinks-- though it'll be hard to convince me to pony up [more money] to find out.

Judging by the description on the back I thought it would be much more exciting and worthwhile than I felt it ended up.I certainly can appreciate the point the story was trying to get across, about how life used to be in the south for blacks.

Set in rural Georgia in the 1940's, the tale is rich with eccentric characters who &quot;guaren-damn-tee&quot; to provoke empassioned feelings. The dialogue is sharp. The plot trenchant. Humor, racial tension, and suspense drive this story along like a raft on a ever-winding river. Each twist and turn swirls the story into unexpected surprises, and rafts the reader over waterfalls of human frailities and outlandish behaviors.Terry Kay style is a blend of Mark Twain and William Faulkner; his writing is that clever, that diverse, that colorful. I applaud his masterful abilities, and encourage all lovers of southern fiction to pick up this vivid, delightful, insightful page turning tale. This is most definitely a MUST READ!!"},{"Title":"The Runaway","review":"Impossible as it might seem, Terry Kay's The Runaway outshines all his previous efforts! Kay is a brilliant writer, gifted with that rare ability to say a great deal with few words. And he just keeps getting better! Many present-day authors have achieved acclaim and popularity for their plots. But few of them can equal Kay in character development and writing style. Kay's prose flows like a beautiful melody. His characters exude a vitality and genuineness that only a person of keen insight into human nature can perceive and a Master of Words can aptly portray. I grew up in 1950's Atlanta and was delighted by the &quot;southernisms&quot; that peppered the story throughout - they really took me back! And lastly, I would like to thank Mr. Kay for his message that not all white Southerners in the 1940's were racists - that there were Southerners who despised prejudice and unkindness toward any human being. Hats off to Mr. Kay for a compelling story, well told."},{"Title":"The Runaway","review":"Terry Kay has written a lovely, thought-provoking book on the slow changes in attitudes toward black/white relations shortly after WWII in the deep south. I felt as though I were there with the characters as the plot unfolds. The characters are driven by their beliefs and their experiences growing up black or white in the south and one is reminded of how in many ways this era still haunts us today. The plot twists keep you turning the pages to find out the solution to the mystery and the images that are portrayed on paper bring to life the south in ways reminiscent of Mark Twain. A great absorbing read that will keep you thinking long after the last page is turned."},{"Title":"The Runaway","review":"To really appreciate Terry Kay's \\"The Runaway\\" you need to have lived in that time and place -- Georgia, 1949. I did, and I know that Kay has painted it perfectly. I knew those people, remember them well. Before reading the book, I'd read a generally positive review in an Atlanta newspaper, but one that said the book was \\"overpopulated with stereotypes.\\" What I found was a true portrait of people and place. Like all Southern towns of that period, conformity was enforced at least by social code, if not by law; it would be hard to write a truthful story and not have characters who seem stereotyped. It was a stereotypical period when change required daring, and the soldiers returning from war came home to fill the bill. They'd taken on a sense of purpose: defending human liberty and dignity. Terry Kay tells us that these are the forgotten heroes, the Southern ex-soldiers who stood up and said to their neighbors, straighten up and play right. They faced as much danger, if not more, than when they'd faced the German Nazis, just by saying, \\"Why don't you leave him alone? What did he do to you?\\" I said that to three white men one night, when they were picking on a young black man, and I barely escaped with my life. Of course, that was in 1963, and it was a far more dangerous thing to do in 1949, Kay's scenario in The Runaway. It was men like Sheriff Frank Rucker who led the way, who showed us how to speak up for another man's dignity, even when it wasn't safe. Kay's people may be fictional, but they had counterparts in real life. Stereotypes? Hardly.Of course, Terry Kay's writing is moving, nearly ethereal in places, as usual. I was also impressed with how many phrases he was able to use from the dialect of the time: \\"naked as a jaybird,\\" \\"a fart in a windstorm.\\" He's a master. So we can forgive him the line on page 381: \\"Getting out of his car, Hugh walked over to Fuller.\\" Even the greats are allowed one of those now and then."},{"Title":"The Runaway","review":"From the first page, Terry Kay catches the cadence of the South.

Many factoids abound. The author clearly read virtually all of the worldwide press on the band. And his enthuusiasm for the subject shines through on every page. Anyone who has ever read interviews with R.E.M. knows that they are a good read. J.M.

I rate this book a 20 out of 10, and a long adventure that you will enjoy."},{"Title":"The Lions of Tsavo : Exploring the Legacy of Africa's Notorious Man-Eaters","review":"The book is filled with informative scientific hypothesis' about the man eaters. I found it to be very good reading until the the chapter when the author started bashing the hunters he had quoted through out the book. Throughout the world hunters are usually amoung the first to call for conservation of a species, not the enemy of conservation. Over all I would say the book is educational and worth reading just skip chapter 9 if you are a hunter."},{"Title":"The Lions of Tsavo : Exploring the Legacy of Africa's Notorious Man-Eaters","review":"Bruce Patterson's brilliant new book shines a much-needed scientific light on the lions of Tsavo. First made infamous by Colonel John Patterson (no relation to the author of this book), after he wrote \\"The Man-eaters of Tsavo\\" almost a century ago, and then re-introduced to modern audiences when the movie \\"The Ghost and the Darkness\\" came out in 1996, the lions of the barren East African region have been much speculated on. Their unusual physical characteristics and habits, including a reputed inclination to prey on men with greater frequency than other lions, have added to the interest about them.Unfortunately, and somewhat surprisingly, little is known about the Tsavo lions. Are they a separate species from the lions found elsewhere in Africa or a subspecies? How does their social behavior differ from that of other lions? Why are the male lions of Tsavo typically maneless? Was the trait selected by evolution for some reason or determined by the tough physical environment of Tsavo?Bruce Patterson, a naturalist with extensive experience studying these beasts, informs the debate on them to such a degree that even where he does not provide definitive answers to these questions about the lions - and he sometimes does -- he provides the definitive framework for understanding them. He approaches the creature from every angle. He has studied them in the field. He has worked on them in the laboratory. And he has extensively read both the scientific and popular literature on the lions.Despite his impressive scholarship, Patterson is not afraid to tell the reader when he doesn't know something. He often writes that some area on the lions needs further study. I also appreciated how he took seriously what any source (white hunters, local tribesmen, etc.) had to say about the lions. Patterson does not snobbishly discount what a source says just because it was not written by a fellow scientist. He makes note of it in his ledger and considers it in the context of other information on the subject.This is a delightful book. If you have any interest in lions in particular or big cats in general, you will find it fascinating and informative."},{"Title":"The Lions of Tsavo : Exploring the Legacy of Africa's Notorious Man-Eaters","review":"For all of us with a passion for the big African cats, this book is a must read. The author, B.D.Patterson, combines his years of field research with an obvious love of the African continent to produce a scientific yet readable and ultimately fascinating review of lion behavior, biology, and evolution.Starting with an historical review of \`man-eater lion' stories Dr. Patterson clarifies facts and debunks myths. He provides a comprehensive review of related factors - from dentition to drought - from game scarcity to human burial practices. No stone is left unturned as he investigates aggressive behavior where the territories of human and lion overlap (and there is aggressive behavior on both sides of this equation!!). He continues his analysis with a succinct review of the latest biological and evolutionary information of the Panthera genus, covering the latest findings in DNA studies, historical range analysis, behavioral studies, and much more. Finally, he concludes the book with a review of conservation efforts in the Tsavo region and plea for continued assistance for this increasingly endangered species.Readers who are tired of the dumbed-down approach many authors follow in order to cater to the broadest audience possible will be presently surprised by this book. It is thoughtful and intelligent throughout - readable and enjoyable - give it a try."},{"Title":"The Lions of Tsavo : Exploring the Legacy of Africa's Notorious Man-Eaters","review":"This book is very thorough in its investigation of the Tsavo lions and man-eating lions in general, as can be observed from the table of contents:Chapter 1 The Reign of Terror: The Lions of the Tsavo AttackChapter 2 The Terror Continues: Man Eating Lions TodayChapter 3 Killing Behavior and Man Eating HabitsChapter 4 Why Do Lions Kills PeopleChapter 5 Lion Biology: Evolution and Geographic DistributionChapter 6 Hunting and Social BehaviorChapter 7 The Lion's Mane: Geographic and Individual VariationChapter 8 Why the Lions of Tsavo are ManelessChapter 9 Conservation and Tsavo National ParksIt takes a subject that has been imbued with a sense of mystery and horror and lays it out in very scientific terms. However, it tends to read like a collection of academic papers. If you are looking for a nice read, I'd recommend you choose another book. However, if you truly want to learn about the lions of Tsavo, this book is invaluable."},{"Title":"The Lions of Tsavo : Exploring the Legacy of Africa's Notorious Man-Eaters","review":"If this book is the writing for a doctoral thesis it is a pretty good one. The book (aka thesis) is not the writing reminiscing of Earnest Hemmingway, Earnest K. Gann or Peter Hathaway Capstick and is in no way attempting to do so.What I have derived from reading this book (theses) is to what great extremes someone will go to proving a point.

That was proven with the 1996 film based on the notorious killers . But the story left us asking questions. Why did the Tsavo man-eaters kill 135 people? Why did they turn to human prey? What turns any lion or lions to kill man and what are Tsavo's maneless lions? Why are they maneless and are they still hungry for human flesh? I believe that the author Dr. Bruce D.

I first read his works in the classic collection of Colorado western slope poetry titled &quot;Geography of Hope.&quot; Ever since, I have hoped for a full-length collection. It has finally arrived and what a collection it is. Todd lives among the incomparable landscape of the Colorado Rockies near Gunnison, Colorado. He writes in a manner that chronicles and respects the geographical region while at the same time his verse is so powerful that he transcends region and speaks to the heart regardless of where you live. His pose &quot;The Doyleville Schoolhouse&quot; is one of my favorites. His reminiscences of the old schoolhouse and it's importance to the farmers and ranchers is a reminder that &quot;Some traditions run deeper than concrete.&quot; In fact, &quot;the where can sometimes tell us who we are.&quot; The poem titled &quot;Passages&quot; will give the reader a flavor for his observations of the land he calls home: &quot;These back-road passages still guide the lost wanderers, No matter the distance of the journey called home.&quot; The book contains forty-one poems dealing with the weather, friends, animals, family, tragedy, humor, the land and a host of other subjects related to &quot;...the country here-abouts...&quot; that portrays the reality of a landscape that will speak to the reader where ever they reside.

Aptly researched and presented in plain terms along with color illustrations stylistically reminiscent of ancient egyptian art, Mummies, Pyramids, And Pharaohs is as educational as it is enthralling. A highly recommended nonfiction book to whet young minds' curiosity about world history, Mummies, Pyramids, And Pharaohs would make a popular addition to any school or community library system collection."},{"Title":"Mummies, Pyramids, and Pharaohs: A Book About Ancient Egypt","review":"\\"Mummies, Pyramids, and Pharaohs\\" is what writer-artist Gail Gibbons uses to get young readers to take a look at this book about Ancient Egypt, but she gets beyond the main attractions to provide a nice little introduction to this ancient civilization. The idea is for young readers to travel back in time to when one of the world's first civilizations began five thousand years ago along the banks of the Nile River. For three thousands of those years the pharaohs ruled over Egypt, and each was believed to be Horus, the son of Ra, the great sun god.Gibbons looks at the \\"Black Land\\" of fertile soil around the Nile, the life of the Pharaohs, the organization of ancient Egyptian society, and families lived back then. Appearance mattered to people, farmers depended on water from the Nile, and craftspeople had plenty of gold and copper to work with to make beautiful objects. Sections are devoted to picture writing, medicinal healing (and magic), feasts and celebrations. Gibbons looks at the primary beliefs of Egyptian religion and the basic process of mummification (without going into detail on how the body's organs were removed, which is the icky part). This gets us to the pyramids, which remain the most obvious symbol of ancient Egypt we can see today, and young readers come full circle to the museums around the world where mummies and other artifacts are on exhibit.The final page of the book looks at some Ancient Egypt Discoveries and covers a bunch of interesting facts, such as more than 80 pyramids have been discovered in Egypt and the priest in charge of making a mummy wore the mask of a jackal symbolizing Anubis the god of the dead. The illustrations for this book are done in watercolors and are certainly kid friendly, which should make them easy for young readers to imitate. The result is a nice introductory overview of life in ancient Egypt that tells young readers about the people, daily activities, beliefs and customs that we have learned about from the artifacts they left behind."},{"Title":"Mummies, Pyramids, and Pharaohs: A Book About Ancient Egypt","review":"This book was great for my kids 8 and 6 .

Far from being a comprehensive work on Japanese weapons, the weapons covered are extremely limited. Cunningham seems to have only covered weapons contained in 'the author's personal collection'. There's a few lines about this and that, but no detail at all about anything.I found this book very much an 'outsider's' look at Japan, giving small pieces of information on Japanese history and culture. As a long-time resident of Japan and martial arts practitioner, however, I found the book rather shallow and lacking insider's insight. I had trouble understanding why some of the sections, such as the recounting of the well-known story of the 47 Ronin had anything to do with 'secret weapons of jujutsu'. Some of the illustrations also puzzled me, not seeming relevant to the text.My conclusion; If you know nothing about Japan and its martial history, maybe it's an interesting read. If you know a little already, there's nothing new here."},{"Title":"Secret Weapons of Jujutsu","review":"I was looking for a book that has information on the Tessen, Iron Fan.

We also practiced a few techniques with this weapon. As a life time student of the martial arts of Judo, Jujitsu, Karate and Kobudo, I found this book very informative and interesting. Granted, the author did not go into great detail on some of these weapons; nevertheless, this is a book for anyone who has an interest in the many weapons that are part of some jujitsu combat systems. The nine chapters cover a lot of educational material on numerous Jujitsu weapons. It is clear the author has done a lot of hard research on this text.

A princess waits years in a tower to be rescued by her true love. Edith Nesbit has written a collection of fabulous and adventurous tales of brave and daring young heroes facing up to the big bad dragon and saving the day.She gives fun names, teriffic descriptions and adventures kids will love.They are short stories that have stood the test of time over 100 years later.There are tales of upside lands where elephants are the size of guinea pigs, and rabbits are as big as dinosaurs,where fantastic animals come alive right from the pages of books, of magical lands, young Kings and princesses, and of inquisitive, and sometimes mischievous children who travel far and wide to face their fears.There are 8 short stories in all, and they include, \\"The Book of Beasts\\",\\"Uncle James, or the Purple Stranger\\", \\"The Deliverers of Their Country\\",\\"The Ice Dragon, or Do as You are Told\\", \\"The Island Of the Nine Whirlpools\\", \\"The Dragon Tamers\\",\\"The Fiery Dragon, or the Heart of Stone and the Heart of Gold\\", \\"Kind Little Edmund, or the Caves and the Cockatrice\\".I feel these stories and the reading level, are geared towards a little bit older child, maybe 8-12, as some of the stories are quite fantastic and may be even be a little scary for the young child. I think these stories would be great to read aloud together, and passed down from generation to generation. My only reason for going 4 stars for this 1987 Watermill Classic edition, is that although it is Complete and Unabridged, it does not include the illustrations that the editor's review talks about. They are probably referring the the re-issues of 1992 and 1997 by Troll Communications, which are both sold here.. So you may want to check with the outside sellers to see if the illustrations are included in the edition they are selling.These are magical stories that would be enjoyed by a boy or girl, and with 8 separate stories, may be more motivational and enjoyable for those that aren't too keen on reading.Enter the fantastic world of Edith Nesbit with your kids and enjoy.....Laurieyoung readers may also enjoy:The Big Book of Dinosaurs: A Natural History of the Prehistoric WorldGHOSTBUSTERS II (Yearling)Side By Side: poems to read together(very young readers or read together)Frankenstein (Great Illustrated Classics)see my reviews for details of these books"},{"Title":"Book of Dragons","review":"Be warned that the $5.99 paperback edition with the purple and black moonlit dragon cover is NOT illustrated, despite the Amazon description.

Nesbit's time was prior to the modern fantasy lore era, these stories still pack an awesome punch of good dragon stories.Through her nostalgic style of writing, she gives us a variety of dragons, good and evil, a variety of wondrous settings, and all types of personalities of the fabled beasts.This is a fairy-tale necessity for all dragon lovers."},{"Title":"Book of Dragons","review":"The standard edition of this book appears to have illustrations, but the economy publication dispenses with that expense.

I figured that, even though these are stories for kids, I would still enjoy them, just like I enjoy many fairy tales and folklore books. I was wrong however, because after the first two stories, which were decent, the book went downhill fast. The stories were bland, quite honestly, boring. I don't see how these stories could be enjoyable for any age, they are too long and boring for young kids to read, they are too kiddish for young adults, and they have no flavor for adults at all. I know many people like this book, but I am not one of them. Sorry...2 stars"},{"Title":"Book of Dragons","review":"To whoever looks, they will notice that there is nothing about the book.

It is not a picture book which disappointed them but I knew that going in. For me, it was the awful old style wording that was so far off anything a 5 year old would appreciate. They lost interest very fast. I had to keep reading ahead and change the wording to try and make it understandable for them. I wish I hadn't wasted my money on this book and certainly would never recommend it."},{"Title":"infinitebook: From Web to Page","review":"I could tell right away that I was going to love this book. Only ten pages into it, I had already experienced several out-loud moments. \\"Ha ha,\\" \\"wow,\\" \\"cool,\\" and \\"holy crap!\\" are just a few of the reactions I had. The rest was equally enjoyable. Lawrence puts it all out on the table, dealing with many universally human topics: love, sex, hate, trust, lies, honesty, admiration, failure, rebuilding oneself, sweet revenge, the need to be loved, the need for acceptance, the need to be alone, hating the past, hating the present, hating the future, mourning the past, accepting the present, and optimistically looking forward to the future. It's all there and more. Revealing intimate pieces of himself throughout the book, Lawrence entices the reader further and further in. Whether you find the pieces to be interesting, wonderful, appalling, intelligent, or a slew of other adjectives, ALL of them are captivating. While at first you may be analyzing the piece at hand, or thinking about the author and what you think you might know of him, what eventually happens is that you end up analyzing yourself. As each of the pieces resonated within me, I was invariably drawn to one of four conclusions: 1) I am like the character in this piece; 2) I want to be like the character in this piece; 3) I definitely do not want to be like the character in this piece (but wonder if I am); or, 4) I am not sure if I should be like this character...there are benefits, but they may not be worth the risk. After that, I usually ended up thinking about how and why I reached that conclusion. Whatever the result, the fact that Lawrence had me constantly analyzing myself with regards to each piece means that he did his job and he did it well. I absolutely recommend this book as you will definitely enjoy it and learn more about yourself in the process."},{"Title":"Hannibal's March in History","review":"The exact route taken by Hannibal in his march from Spain to Italy in 218BC has always been a mystery. Even the Romans only a generation or so after the Second Punic War were unsure themselves which Alpine pass he came over to attack them. The pass by which he crossed the Alps is still unknown today and there are as many opinions as there are possible passes. Proctor reviews most of the leading opinions, past and present, on Hannibal's route. Then using only the works of the two surviving contemporary historians, Livy and Polybius, he outlines the most likely course and timetable for Hannibal's route. For anyone wishing to follow in Hannibal's footsteps - as I did in 1982 - Proctor is the best and only realistic guide."},{"Title":"Folk tales every child should know","review":"What do you think this book may cost"},{"Title":"Reeds Vol 7: Advanced Electrotechnology (Reed's Marine Engineering) (v. 7)","review":"I found this book well written and easy to understand. Unfortunately it is quite outdated in it's material. It has subjects as Magnetic Amplifiers, Rotary Exciters like G.E.'s Amplidyne, it refers to the SCR as a new device and ac motors becoming of age in ships. This book was probably excellent material for the shipboard engineer back in the 1940's but ceretainly not now. I've been in the marine/shipboard business now for 50 years and I loved this book as I enjoy reading all technical material new and old. I wouldn't recommend this book though for those who want to advance their careers but for those who want to know what the old days were like."},{"Title":"Till We Meet Again","review":"It is too bad that Lesley Pearse's books are not over here in bookstores that frequently. She is perhaps, the best author I have ever read before out of all the books I've reviewed here. She writes with more depth and meaning than any other author I've known.In this saga, Till We Meet Again, is written about two women who were best friends as young girls. Their lives parallel one anothers in that they both grew up in VERY dysfunctional homes.For Beth Powell, it was her hateful father who beat on her mother and the kids as they grew up, and they all lived in fear of him.For Susan Wright, it was a life of servitude to first her mother, and then her father. Her brother Martin hated her terribly, and when their father passed away, her dad left the family wealth to Martin, and not her, after all of her slavery. Susan became a very very angry person, especially moreso after getting losing her little daughter to meningitis when no doctor cared enough to care for her promptly. It was at that point when she turned to killing people as a way of fighting back. And for a long time, she wasn't caught until she shot the doctor and secretary at the clinic who she felt responsible for her daughter's death. At that point she was caught, and kept in jail.Beth Powell, who had become a lawyer crossed paths with Susan again 29 years later, and was going to act as her defense lawyer. Their friendship endured, even though the evidence Susan is getting stronger.As the story moves on, Susan reveals more shocking facts about her past, as does Beth. And there will be a happy ending for only one of them."},{"Title":"Till We Meet Again","review":"I love all her books and this one was no exception. Very well written with a great storyline.

With poignancy and warmth, the author creates believable characters who adhere to their own truths, not necessarily the expectations of the reader.The personable, unnamed speaker in this first person narrative is a writer trying to create the story of a man \\"caught in a back-and-forth motion over the Wall, like a soccer goalie in an instant replay, always taking the same dive to miss the same ball.\\" Virtually all the Berliners we meet here--from both East and West--are in the same situation as the unfortunate goalie, as they, too, go back and forth, repeatedly mistaking the moves of people from the other \\"side,\\" misinterpreting signals, and often, in their ignorance, failing to \\"get it.\\"The author provides an amazingly complete, though somewhat sanitized, picture of the Wall-jumpers--not those poor souls who were brutally machine-gunned by Wall guards, but people like the speaker who come and go across the Wall with relative impunity because they do not call attention to themselves. And Schneider is quick to point out that most of the East Berliners are fairly satisfied with their lives, which are depicted with much warmth, as families and friends spend a great deal of time with each other, undistracted by the responsibilities of \\"freedom.\\"The fascinating philosophical discussions and personal revelations that occur among friends from both sides may sweep away your preconceptions about life in Berlin, as they did mine, and you may find yourself reevaluating your thinking about society and politics in general, and about Germany, in particular. Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"The Wall Jumper: A Berlin Story","review":"Ian McEwan acknowledges in the introduction \\"at a glance The Wall Jumper appears to be reportage rather than fiction.\\" Published in 1982, seven years befopre the wall came down, this novella has little plot and character interaction but it deftly highlights the obvious and also the subtle differences between West and East Berliners. The reportage of various famous wall jumper incidents over the years is blended in with the impact each German state's influence has on its citizens. The narrator is a West Berliner who regularly visits East Berlin and writes about the meetings he has with various citizens. The narrator's encounters with Robert a former East Berliner now living disenchantedly in West Berlin highlight their different 'eyes' and conclusions in which they perceive the same events. An interesting aside Schneider reminds us that the US had boycotted the Moscow Olympics because of Russia's occupation of Afghanistan. This book is not for those big on plot and characterisation but it is a very revealing account on the influence the state has over the individual and the way we perceive things."},{"Title":"The Wall Jumper: A Berlin Story","review":"Great piece of fiction read almost like mini-biographies of diverse, often eccentric personalities- true to the hysteria with which German describes themselves and the state of two-countries divided by the wall prior to its fall in the early 90s. I found myself laughing out loud at the poignant observations, as well as prejudices coming from both sides- It is a book about people, about societies to which they are bound. It is about the human person always wanting to trespass, to go beyond, to peek into their own curiosity."},{"Title":"The Parasite","review":"Written by history and science professor Michel Serres, and expertly translated from the original French by professor of French Lawrence R. Schehr (no simple feat, as Serres often expressed himself in unusual styles and multilingual puns), The Parasite is an eyebrow-raising treatise that compares how human relations are frequently identical to the relationship between a parasite and the host body. Serres does not decry this situation as universally deleterious; to the contrary, he points out that by being vocal pests, small groups can raise their collective power to influence public dialogue, engendering the diversity and complexity vital to vibrant human thought and culture. \\"The position of a parasite is to be between. That is why it must be said to be a being or a relation. But the attribute of the parasite... is its specificity. It is not just anything that troubles a passing message. It is not just anyone who is invited to someone's table. A given larva develops only in a certain organism and is carried only by a certain vector.\\" Originally published in 1982, this re-release of a classic philosophical text is highly recommended especially for college library philosophy shelves and scholarly reading lists."},{"Title":"The Parasite","review":"Serres the polymath strikes again, with an extensive and detailed examination of the history of the concept of parasitism in history, philosophy, science and literature. The discussion of the literary parasite is especially useful for Anglo-American readers that might not be familiar with the concept. Try to find this at a good university library, or order it online if you can."},{"Title":"The Parasite","review":"This treasured book stands as a profound meditation on human existence in relation to the world, the manifold scales at which power operates, shading from literal to allegorical, then to economic to revolutionary, and yet all seemingly one vibrating phenomenon, that of host to parasite. Prepare yourself for an enlightening exposition of this theme, go ahead and try to prepare--this book will still blow your mind. I've never been able to escape the force of his argument yet. This is one of the books that changed the way I look at the world."},{"Title":"The Parasite","review":"Serres' work is remarkably fresh and reading it has a true aesthetic quality, aside from the invaluable outlook on human relationships. Having acquired the book to develop further critical arguments for our policy debate program, I found myself evaluating his thoughts in my role as a professional risk manager. Serres provides much to consider in relationships, especially when one attempts to evaluate underlying behaviors and incentives. Several chapters would provide excellent material for graduate management coursework on ethics."},{"Title":"Microsoft Office XP: Introductory Concepts and Techniques","review":"This is a great textbook!

It's no use if you don't know how well you did.

Whydoes not somebody even give Dr. Stallings some competition. I ama believer of the competition. No competition, no better products.I guess it might be that many CS professors, especially those highlyqualified (say at top 10) are busy at writing proposal rather thanspending time on an undergraduate textbook. If that conjecture istrue, it might be a shame for the whole CS academia. Those big NSFor DARPA grants receivers should ask themselves, what have Idone for my students? remember most students never havechance to read your grant proposal and most undergraduatessimply do not have time to even read your research paperspublished in journals or monographs."},{"Title":"Wireless Communications & Networks","review":"I've had numerous experiences with William Stallings networking books, and all of them are bad.My personal opinion is that he is that though it seems like he knows a lot (though I doubt it), he's not able to get that knowledge across to his readers. There are few examples and the post topic questions have little or no bearing on the subject matter of the chapters.Every one I knew in my networking classes and computer science classes felt the same way about this author. I'm sure there are other better books out there - don't know why lousy prof. seem torequire this for classes"},{"Title":"Wireless Communications & Networks","review":"If there is one word by which I would have to describe this book, it would be: &quot;complete&quot;. The author assumes that the reader has nothing but very basic mathematic and scientific training and takes him all the way from first principles in those disciplines to the details of cellular networks, wireless LANs and Bluetooth to mention three of the latter chapters. The ample usage of illustrations, review questions and www-references position this as a high-quality textbook.Then again, if you are an experienced engineer, looking to solve a concrete problem for the wireless system you are presently sitting in front of, you will find that Stallings' book, because of its breadth of treatment, does not reach the necessary depth. In that case: read one of the many references for further study that the author offers."},{"Title":"Wireless Communications & Networks","review":"First of all, this is a high quality book. Hardcover and fine paper makes it a pleasure to handle. The chapters are well organized into four parts, from Technical Background to Wireless Lans. Beware however, that this is a quite theoretical book. If you are looking for a fast approach to WLAN technologies, perhaps you should try simpler books like O'REILLY's 'Wireless Community Networks'.Nevertheless, it is an ideal textbook for academic purposes. I am using it as a reference for undergraduate courses. Chapters related to Signal Encoding and Spread Spectrum are really well written, and 802.11 and Bluetooth fundamentals are fully explained.Even if several parts of the book are taken (with little or none modifications) from other Stallings' books, the book is still worth to have since this fact makes it a completely self-contained reference."},{"Title":"Wireless Communications & Networks","review":"Very suitable for beginners and intermediates. Easy to understand the sentences and main points but I think it would be much better if there is a solution guide for selected question at the end of the book."},{"Title":"Wireless Communications & Networks","review":"Clear, well-organized, and good level of detail. I was frustrated that so many data networking books do not adequately cover wireless, and this does that perfectly. There is even a website with PowerPoint presentations and pdf files of images from the text."},{"Title":"Wireless Communications & Networks","review":"Chapter one dives right into signal theory and does a terrible job of it. Waveforms and formula's abound with absolutly no description of what the formula's signify. The text references figure's of waveforms and formulas stating that at F3 blah blah blah and there is no F3 depicted on the diagram. I haven't read beyond that chapter because I'm only using the book for a class and need the end of chapter questions, which I then google for the information. This book is total garbage."},{"Title":"Wireless Communications & Networks","review":"This is the worst book I've ever used or read. I had to use three chapters of this book in one of my grad classes for the master of network and communication management, but I was very disappointed about the level of his writing and the more interesting thing is that the author seems to use copy and paste a lot from other documents, one of the chapters that I partially read was about the Bluetooth but I preferred to download the 802.15 standards from the IEEE web site and use it instead of using the book because it is concise and well organized not like the book which presents the material like a crosswords, what I found is that most of the material in that chapter was just a copy and paste from the IEEE standards without any explanation or added knowledge. Another interesting example is about the SIP and SDP; I needed to do a research for VOIP class specifically on SDP, therefore I searched some sites such as Cisco web site and the IETF RFCs and I found an article written by Stallings on Cisco web site and I compared it to RFC3261, guess what!! He copied most of the definitions and examples, even some of the diagrams from the RFC or other documents!!the links to Stallings article and to RFC3261 will not appear because Amazon remove them but the reader can search cisco web site and IETF and compare the two documents to judge."},{"Title":"Wireless Communications & Networks","review":"I have read some of Stallings' other books and was very impressed (for example,Cryptography and Network Security: Principles and Practice (5th Edition), which is one of my go-to references for general cryptography/security information). However, I found his Wireless Communications & Networks book to be somewhat disappointing. The more \\"electrical engineering\\" aspects of wireless communications are there, but they are not as insightful and inspiring as could be. It seems that Stallings does not write as authoritatively about those aspects of wireless communications as he does about more \\"computer science\\" aspects (Stallings is well known for his broad contributions to computer science education, in the form of his books on various topics in computer science).I might have given it 2 stars, because I had high expectations for anything coming from Stallings, but taking a step back (and setting aside those expectations, so I could consider the book on its own merits and compare it objectively with other books on similar topics), I give it 3 stars. The Stallings teaching style is certainly there; it's just that there are better books out there on this topic by authors who are more familiar with wireless, and especially the electrical engineering aspects."},{"Title":"Wireless Communications & Networks","review":"I followed it in my undergraduate studies. It is an okay book, not anything exceptional, just average. I found Mobile Communications by Jochen Schiller better than this book. However with respect to contents it covers much more, particulalry on wireless communications stuff. Actually it should not be compared to Schiller's book because the two are covering relatively different contents. As the title of this book suggests: \\"Wireless Communicstions and Networks\\", much of the stuff it covers belong to wireless communications rather than wireless networks e.g., transmission fundamantals, antennas and propagation, signal and encoding techniques.Many topics are actually belong to the introductory computer networks books but have been included here again, such as the introduction of TCP, IP, in chapter 4, which is, believe me, written in very dry style. Even interesting things look boring if presented this way.Particulalry the chapters I found relatively well written are Chapter 5 \\"Antennas and Propagation\\" and Chapter 10 \\"Cellular Wireless Networks\\". However the contents on the cellular wireless networks are too limited. The networks technologies have been merely touched here. In contrast Schiller's book describes GSM, GPRS, UMTS/WCDMA, etc in a lot more detailed and interesting way. I did not follow WLAN chapters of this book since I consulted Schiller's book for it therefore I cannot say much about it.Also sometimes it feels that too much math have been included, the writing style is not very interesting."},{"Title":"Wireless Communications & Networks","review":"I do not like it for the following reasons:-It touches the subjects and does not go deep into it.-It does not have examples.-The very few examples in the chapters are not clear. You have to decipher it.-Some of the end of the chapter problems talks about things not covered.-It is not an easy read. You have to read a paragraph several time to figure it out.-I do not recommend it.-On second thought, I should have given it 1 star but it seems I can not change that."},{"Title":"Wireless Communications & Networks","review":"This textbook arrive right on time, in new condition, and was priced right for me. My only complaint is that it feels more like an operating manual rather than a textbook. So much to learn in this field, the course required this and an additional 2 books because no one author could put it all in one book. Glad to have this in my reference library, however."},{"Title":"Center Street","review":"A great read! Being raised in Hudson, N.Y. It was nice to read a mystery about my home town from an author who was raised here as well. The story kept bringing back the little stories i was told by my Parents and Grandparents as to how Huson was back in 1950's.It was really a hopping place with Diamond Street, that was full of hustlers, number runners, []and you name it, it was there. Although fictional- this was a great look back in time, it was great to read about the local places mentioned. Wise has weaved a sassy mystery about this little Hudson River town full of secrets.

It brings to mind a Dean Koontz novel, Dark Rivers of the Heart, but saturated with a twisting and turning conspiracy that sucks you in keeps you in an anxious state of suspense. A pragmatic fictional story that forces you stop and consider the world around you and question the fine-line ethics associated with our society's technological advancements--not many novelists can evoke this type of thinking in a reader."},{"Title":"The Oval Web","review":"Wow! What an incredible read, right up with the ranks of Tom Clancy, but with tecno descriptions more easy to follow for the average reader or non-computer expert. This is the type of book that is difficult to put down or to leave to casual intermittent reading. A classic example of &quot;fiction&quot; being more close to reality than the average person might like to think. It is a fitting sequal to Orwellean 1984. A must read for the trusting embracers of the computer age."},{"Title":"They played in Calvary's drama","review":"Fr. Christopher Rengers wrote this little book about the saints and sinners at Calvary and it's perfect for Lent. Fr. Rengers looks at all the characters involved from Herod the sensualist, the Judas the thief, to Peter who was fiery and loud mouthed at the Last Supper but was driven by fear and stress to deny our Lord when things got scary, to Pilate who just wanted to save his career, to Caiaphus, who understood nothing and compares them to us and how we respond to Jesus today. It's very good and if you can find it They played in Calvary's drama is definitely worth buying."},{"Title":"Living At The Summit: A Novel Approach To An Exceptional Life","review":"Living at the Summit is immediately engaging and compels you to read on. I was sure that the good guys would win and even then, I needed to follow the ominous twists and turns. The Five Life Priorities are appropriately depicted by the main characters. They gave me a new perspective of the changes that I am now able to seriously look at in my life. Thanks for the insight on how to forge past our greatest challenges and live life to the fullest ."},{"Title":"Living At The Summit: A Novel Approach To An Exceptional Life","review":"I was recommended to read this book by a friend. I have to say that I was very disappointed. You'll learn that the five 'Life Priorities' are Spiritual, Physical, Relationships, Mental, and Financial. And you will get a list of recommended reading (from best-selling authors) for each Priority. With that equipment, you are supposed to get started setting personal goals for each priority and to manage your goal attainment on a long term basis.But let's not forget the plot of the book, which is supposed to motivate you to do this. Five individuals, depicting the five Life Priorities, go through an ordeal in a Latin American country. There they come across the teacher who teaches them about the priorities, and gives them individual reading recommendations along with his wish to impose himself on them as their mentor and spiritual leader. The teaching consists of poorly understood left/right brain theory interpreted to explain more than it can account for, along with references to many likewise superficially digested theories. After the traumatic ordeal, this teaching is supposed to set the five characters free to explore life's possibilities.If you haven't thought about setting goals for yourself, or prioritizing between different goals and activities, and if you haven't been inquiring much into life's wonders, then this book might be of some value to you. If you are happy with scratching the surface of things rather than getting to the core of the subject, that is.There are many good books about spiritual, physical, relationship, mental, and financial issues, if you want to learn or improve in those areas. This is not one of them.It's sad that there's a market for a book like this."},{"Title":"Living At The Summit: A Novel Approach To An Exceptional Life","review":"This is a unique book that helps one take an honest look at their developmental pathways. Yes, the novel could appear somewhat &quot;cheesy&quot; to some, but one may need to get rid of the self-righteous attitudes that afflict so many people in this world to be able to synthesize this material into practical application. It is a great story that keeps you reading until the end...not unlike many &quot;cheesy&quot; Hollywood stories that people pay many dollars to watch at the movie theaters. It is just as entertaining, but with much more there for those who wish to see it. When is the movie coming out? Thanks Dr. Hill!"},{"Title":"Living At The Summit: A Novel Approach To An Exceptional Life","review":"I enjoyed this fast-paced novel that takes the reader on a trip around the world and through intrigue.

I read this book in one sitting and could not put it down! A real nail-biter! Appropriate and entertaining for teens to seniors. Everyone can identify themselves in at least one, if not several, of the characters in the story, so it teaches in a personal way. Definitely to be read - and studied - more than once, with a bibliography included for further study, if one desires. This is a MUST READ for anyone interested in breaking out of a life of mediocrity. Kudos to Dr. Tom Hill!"},{"Title":"Living At The Summit: A Novel Approach To An Exceptional Life","review":"I have read many many self-help and personal development books. After reading &quot;Living at the Summit&quot; I would have to say this book ranks in the top five books I have read, based on its ability to help me change my life. This is a book that you do not read just once. You read it over and over and gain more insight every time that you do. It propelled me to take action in my life in a way other books could not. The &quot;novel&quot; format was offbeat and had me wondering for a long time when the story was going to &quot;getting around to helping me&quot;. Needless to say, it did. You find yourself associating some of your personal traits with those of each of the characters in the story. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is searching for a better life, a better path to follow. In addition, your study is not complete until you follow this up with the &quot;Living at the Summit--a Life Plan&quot; which is your workbook for putting your life in order, just as the characters in the story did. If after reading this review, you have more questions, I would be happy to hear from you. My e-mail address is: jackiemj00@aol.com.

It is somehow less threatening to initially explore new ideas in regard to fictional characters' lives, as opposed to jumping into weighty analyses of ourselves before we can appreciate the benefits of how all the parts of the plan fit together.

But when I finished the last page, I knew there were long-term benefits that would stay with me long after I closed the book. For creatively woven into the structure of the story and within each of the main characters' lives is page after page of life-changing information, thus offering me ways to improve all areas of my life. Dr. Tom Hill did his homework and selflessly presents the answers so his reader can have the tools necessary to create a better life. Living at the Summit is a life-changing book, one I will come back to again and again."},{"Title":"The Assassins","review":"Exellent book on the generational conflict of the hippie-era. It's a story about the coldblooded killing of a hippie, a murder that confronts both sides of the community in an army-base-city in New Mexico: The so-called free-minded, well-drugged hippies opposing everything the old system has to offer, and the cynical conservative army-people. It's a hillarious, yet serious, story that perfectly describes the absurdities of an american period, the generational conflict - and, most of all, the very loss of true human feeling in a time full of systems and ideologies. If you like Heller and Vonnegut, read this book, if you don't, read it anyway...."},{"Title":"The Assassins","review":"It begins with a murder, but it does not end there. The Assassins is the dramatic story of two murders, but it is more - much more. It is the story of a murderous way of life that threatens us all. It is an unforgettable reading experience. The Pittsburg Press calls it a suspenseful taught novel that seers the emotions. The Saturday Review says \\"A powerful and disturbing novel with personality\\"."},{"Title":"The Assassins","review":"While I was around during the \\"hippie\\" era I was not a part of the genre. I do remember the constant friction between the war protestors and the military or establishment folks. The characters are very believable and generally react as you would expect. I guess the disturbing part of the story is how everyone expected the eventual trial decision. Even more how Sergeant Morales wanted the reward for the almost staged attack on himself. The story got me thinking a lot about the early 70s. I suppose being a young adult at the time gave me more appreciation for the twists and turns developed by Mr. Kazan."},{"Title":"The Assassins","review":"I thought there was going to more action with this book based on the title. That was not the case; there is more of an overall story that takes the full length of the book to develop. The story is put together very well and the characters are great.

If you like the pace and style of his movies, then you will like this book."},{"Title":"The Assassins","review":"It's difficult to express just how bad this book is.

And then it only gets worse."},{"Title":"Men like gods : a novel,","review":"If all you've read of Wells is The Invisible Man, The Time Machine, The War of the Worlds, and The Island of Dr. Moreau, you're not getting the full story. This novel--writen some twenty-five years after the aforementioned works--shows the author's more philosophical side; there's less of the straight SF romance aspect to it; it's also, in my estimation, a considerably more gripping read.In short, it's about a group of people who are inadvertantly drawn into an alternate dimension, which turns out to be a paradisiacal version of Earth thousands of years in ahead of contemporary society. There's some action involved, but it's more a book of moral philosophy than anything else, as it explores issues of what humanity should be and be striving for. I liked it a lot, and you should try to find a copy and read it."},{"Title":"Men like gods : a novel,","review":"Almost everyone knows of H. G. Wells' other works like The Time Machine, but this book, never as popular and certainly mentally deeper, is really the way to get a look into this renowned author's mind.As another has mentioned, this isn't so much a high science romance but rather a story that incorporates social philosophy. It is a social philosophy almost entirely 180 degrees out from my own. And just to get it out and over with, yes; there are a lot of misconceptions regarding evolution, biology and science. To enjoy the story, it is necessary to make the same exceptions for those misconceptions as we happily make for errors regarding electricity while reading Frankenstein.Our main character is what we would refer to as a typical middle class working stiff. He suffers the same discontentment that many today do with children growing up not exactly the way we would wish for them, a spouse that is less than exciting after all these years, a boss he doesn't respect and a job he detests going to. Sound familiar? An impromptu holiday winds up quickly as an accidental push into a sort of parallel dimension with all the others who traveled the road near the same time. Their cars simply wind up in a new place after a bit of a jolt.In this new place, the people are all perfectly formed, beautiful, supremely intelligent and telepathic. The story, which I won't ruin further by detailing, revolves around the inevitable clash of the \\"modern\\" human in a place that has eschewed all the things we consider worthwhile and made themselves infinitly superior. Needless to say, our hero develops the appropriate appreciation and awe and eventually returns home a different man. Should I detail further, I will certainly ruin the action that isn't at all sparse in the story.I'll admit that I was very surprised by the book. I had pictured the author in different ways, as far as his ideas and opinions, but never like this. This is the socialist and communist dream made manifest. Of course, the problem with that delves down into our deepest pre-history and evolution but he couldn't know that. As primates who \\"collected\\" as our evolutionary advantage, we can no more leave behind the desire for personal property and the safety of objects than our need for oxygen to fuel our bodily processes. It is part and parcel of who we are.The largely unspoken, but occassionally obvious use of eugenics and denial of parentage to achieve these aims is a bit frightening and may be difficult for modern sensibilities, but it was an openly discussed topic during that era and should be considered in that light.Reading this book is a great idea for anyone who has an interest in H. G. Wells and his marvelous works because it does help to round out his viewpoints in other works. It's also a less P.C. work that allows a reader to pause and think of their own opinions as the story moves along and various philosophical points are brought to light by the action."},{"Title":"Men like gods : a novel,","review":"You end up in a new world - because of magic or hypnosis or some kind of accident. You learn about the native lifestyle and come back to your normal world, wiser, with knowledge to help all mankind.Boring, seen in a hundred other books. But this is slightly different. Slightly more realistic than even some of Mr. Wells' own versions of utopia.Because in this one the Earthlings bring illness and evil ideas to Eden. Yes, the flawed Earthlings bring death and destruction to Utopia and what are the goodie-goodie natives going to do about it?I also love how Wells hints at the fact that while the people of utopia are well meaning and nice, they do seem to treat the Earthlings as lower creatures. After all they ARE Superior. By the end of the book, in fact, only the flawed or the very young show any interest in the main character from Earth. They have moved beyond us, to the point where even some of the ideas they have do not translate, and they see us as early examples of flawed humans. Like we may look at a pet ape.Unlike his work,A Modern Utopia (Forgotten Books), this just feels more realistic and, sometimes, even has a touch of humor. This is just how people would act if they were dropped into a utopia. Sad to say I feel this hits our soul and ideals, or lack of them, right on the nose.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Men like gods : a novel,","review":"Truly a rare find, this book gives us a deeper insight into the life and times of the author, H.G. Wells. It does so indirectly, though, for it is not a book about his life as it was or about his world as he saw it but rather a book about how certain characters respond to encountering a civilization other than their own. The characters were written by Wells in a way that reflects certain attitudes and moral values of his time. As such their feelings, their actions, their strengths and their foibles are commentary not only on their own society but on modern humanity as a whole.Another reviewer on this board has given this book a poor rating, seemingly because the utopian ideal depicted in the book is not possible nor scientifically logical. While that is certainly the case, is \\"The Time Machine\\" any less enjoyable becuase temporal physics doesn't work the way Wells writes it as working? Is \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" any less enjoyable because there are no such things as elves?When reading this book I would not suggest that you look upon it as a plan for building a utopian future. It is fantasy and not a guide to world-building. Instead, look at the idea of perfection Wells puts forth... look at the things he sees lacking in his own society and wishes somehow could magically become part of it. Look on this work not as a treatise on how to make the the world perfect, but rather as an author's delving into the reality of the human condition and his hopes and fears of what that condition could become... not through evolution but through the power of the mind to change who we are.If you read it in that light, I think you will find it both enlightening and enjoyable to read."},{"Title":"Men like gods : a novel,","review":"This novel, set in 1921 and published in 1923 is in a subgenre you don't see much now -- utopian science fiction. Yes, I did say \`utopian.' You may be more familiar with this subgenre's ugly brother, dystopian science fiction. The latter has more shock value so it gets more attention, but I prefer the older, wiser sibling.The essential difference between utopian and dystopian fiction that I see is their different perceptions of humanity. Although both begin with the premise that the human race has problems, utopian fiction posits that, in the course of time, mankind will solve them. Dystopian fiction, on the other hand, posits that humanity, if it is lucky, might survive.I don't read fiction to be shocked. I can get that from the news. I read fiction to be entertained. Occasionally I come across novels that also present a new thought or uncommon perspective, and I consider these welcome bonuses. \`Men Like Gods' provides all of these.The protagonist, Mr. Barnstaple (no first name) is stressed and in desperate need of a holiday. The way he contrives to get away unaccompanied by wife of children, is humorous and charming, in an understated British way, as are his musings on the events of the time. He succeeds in escaping by himself in his little yellow car with no specific destination in mind but ends up much farther away than he could have imagined. A scientific experiment in an alternate dimension goes awry, and Barnstaple and a few others on the road that day find themselves in a strange land with clean air, tame animals, and beautiful people who enjoy unparalleled personal freedom. He's obviously not in England anymore. The rest of the novel explores how he and his fellow Earthlings react to this strange utopia and how the Utopians react to them.Considering this book was written almost a century ago, and making certain allowances for that, one thing that struck me was how relevant it remains. There are passages about droughts, famines, and fighting going on around the world that sound almost as if they could be referring to today. This description of economic concerns especially caught my attention:\`... The great masses of population that had been blundered into existence, swayed by damaged and decaying traditions and amenable to the crudest suggestions, were the natural prey and support of every adventurer with a mind blatant enough and a conception of success coarse enough to appeal to them. The economic system, clumsily and convulsively reconstructed to meet the new conditions of mechanical production and distribution, became more and more a cruel and impudent exploitation of the multitudinous congestion of the common man by the predatory acquisitive few. That all too common common man was hustled through misery and subjection from his cradle to his grave; he was cajoled and lied to, he was bought, sold and dominated by an impudent minority, bolder and no doubt more energetic, but in all other respects no more intelligent than himself.'The economic system he speaks of is, essentially, the one we still have; one in which common people simply trying to survive can be economically used and abused by those with wealth, power, and low morals. Although, on the bright side, we do have laws and regulations in place now to mitigate the worst examples of such things.Then there was this about the media of the time:\`...newspapers had ceased to be impartial vehicles of news; they omitted, they mutilated, they misstated. They were no better than propaganda rags.'This claim especially seems appropriate to some of today's media outlets.What you won't see in this novel is a description of how the civilization in this alternate universe got from something like early Twentieth Century Earth to a free and peaceful utopia, although the process is said to have taken three thousand years. The point is that people not unlike us were able to overcome things like superstition, prejudice, selfish ambition, and violence. They were able to work together to build a better society in which each individual is free to think, act, and explore the mysteries of the world as they wish.I won't say the utopia presented here is exactly one that I would imagine or hope for, but it does seem attractive and maybe even possible. The ideas the novel presents are certainly worth thinking about, in any case, and the story is enjoyable in its own right. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Men like gods : a novel,","review":"Men Like Gods by H. G. Wells.

This one has a SF aspect to it, but it is primarily a work of social philosophy. British travelers are accidently transported into another dimension, where human beings live a life of productive labor, sociability (no one is too introspective), lack of private property, and almost complete nudity. According to Wells, this is paradise, and people here are not much different from Gods. It turns out that in this dimension, civilization had taken almost exactly the same course as it did on our Earth. The differences are superficial. Then at some point during the industrial age, a great transformation began to take place. Over the course of a hundred or so generations, private property in all but personal things was abolished, there were no more sexual preditors, and people have become open with strangers in their thoughts and actions. They have also become much taller, stronger, much more beautiful and intelligent.This utopia relies on the Lamarckian misconception of biological evolution, where acquired improvements are transmitted to the next generation, culminating in a generation of God-like human beings. It also relies on the misconception that private property is at the root of societal evils and that people would want to get rid of it for good."},{"Title":"Biographies of words and the home of The Aryas (His: Collected works of the Right Hon)","review":"The book is simple and direct in its format and writing, yet it touches upon some of the most poignant themes in Nouvel's architecture, such as Light, Colour, Grids and Details, as well as an outlook towards the future of architecture. Instead of a boring chronology of the works these become the main chapters of the book, and take on several buildings that are representative of these essential themes. The squarish format of the book with full page colour pictures, details and architectural plans, make it both pleasent to read and entertaining to simply flip through.A few interviews or writings of Nouvel could surely have been added, for the more academic minded; but basically the book is an inescapable artefact in understanding the passion, simplicity and beauty of Nouvel's architecture."},{"Title":"Biographies of words and the home of The Aryas (His: Collected works of the Right Hon)","review":"Jean Nouvel is a very important person not only for French architecture,but also for Europian architecture.This book explains succesfully why he is so important.The price of the book is not much because of its quality.But more drawings are expected. more drawings."},{"Title":"Four Little Kittens","review":"I love being able to find out of print books through the used book dealers listed on Amazon.

From analog to digital to programmable to software defined and now to intelligent (cognitive) radio design we are feeling the future changes as to how people might use the radio technologies in the next 25 years. By studing this book from Fette one can easily guess where radio technologies will be heading. This book, and \\"Cognitive Radio Architecture\\" by J. Mitola, have come almost at the same time. While this book provides a general and more technological overview of various aspects of Cognitive radio, the book by J. Mitola gives specific architectural overview of the future radio. I feel both the books are must for those interested in studying and researching in the field of Radio Design both for commercial and military applications. My conclusion is that for Fifth Generation Cellular Radio these are the books to start with. Complimented by the research Articles (e.g. IEEE papaers) one can correctly find the way to radio development. I first congratulate Joseph Mitola for providing the lead in Software Defined/Cognitive radio concepts, and then appreciate the writer Fette for providing an excellent description of Cognitive radio with provision of connection to Software Defoined radio.I am prticularly interested in Learning Strategies which modify the knowledgebase for making good decision to provide desired QoS in mobile communication systems (environment).My congratualtions to both J.

They befriended humanity, some of whom could 'hear' and understand their mindspeech, and some Ka'ats settled on Earth. After many years and wars in which the humans who could communicate with them were killed, the Ka'ats had to abandon Earth in the face of human persecution, stranding some of their own kind in the process.Upon their cautious, secret re-exploration of Earth in the present, the Ka'ats, alarmed at a human political situation that might lead to nuclear war, began systematically evacuating as many of their people as they could - all the cats whose mindspeech was clear enough to understand the rescue summons. But in the process, two Ka'at scouts - Mer and Tiro - found two human children, Elly Mae and Jim, who had enough innate ability at mindspeech to be capable of full partnership with the Ka'ats, and the scouts adopted the children, insisting that they, too, be rescued. (Both kids were orphaned, one very recently, and without family, so this was OK with them.)In the other volumes of the series, we've seen some of the trouble that the kids have had adjusting to life on Zimmorah, but, of course, the cats were able to settle down happily with no problems, right?Wrong. The Elders are alarmed that some cats form a distinct subculture among their people: hunters with a taste for sport in a world where hunting is culturally unthinkable, who refuse to completely abandon the uncivilized ways they needed to survive on Earth. Having had a terrifying reminder, while reconnoitering Earth, of the dangers of factions coming into conflict, the Elders now propose an experiment: that some of the Earth cats should join an expedition to re-establish contact with a long-lost Ka'at colony on another world, where dangerous situations may make their survival skills valuable.Mer, Elly Mae, Jim, and Tiro accompany the expedition as well, to find a world on which the plant and insect life no longer quite matches their records; the insects are now of gigantic size! (Many of the insects are unimaginatively similar to familiar insects on Earth, making it relatively simple for the explorers to identify dangerous ones and think of ways to cope, at least at first).The surviving descendants of the Ka'at colony, when found, need help.

Finding your way around the constellations is a daunting task for beginners. Enter the star finder. The proper term is planisphere. It's a chart of the night sky. It is adjustable for date and time so that you can locate the major star formations and it is quite useful. I use mine frequently. The one thing I'd fault it for is that it needs better instructions. However, you can find extensive instructions on the web.Now, let me tell you something that very few people know and that I only learned the hard way. Planispheres are constructed for specific latitudes. This one covers a band from 20 to 30 degrees north latitude. It is useful in Florida where I live as well as Texas. It would be of limited use for someone in oh, say Virginia and none at all in Massachusetts. There you would need a planisphere for 30 to 40 degrees north latitude. It is a very important distinction. So, if you decide to buy one, first find out the latitude where you live (you can find it on the Wikipedia page for your home state), then order the specific one for that latitude.

The Berg's state that it is information that can stand alone, but since it is a detailed explanation of the deeper meanings of God's law, it is really necessary to have a background in that law. It would be wise to read the five books of the Torah first, although they have notes in the text referring to the appropriate texts of the law the Zohar section is discussing.Most Christians will take exception to much of what the Zohar has to teach, but that is because of their own misunderstanding of the law and the ultimate sacrifice it required. Once there is an adequate background in the law and its spiritual meaning (Romans 7:14), the Zohar will begin to take on a great deal of meaning for the Christian, and his eyes will be opened in ways, and to truths that cannot be found in church teaching, and may not easily be discovered from the Bible. &quot;He who has ears, let him hear,&quot; Matt. 13:9. &quot;For I tell you the truth, many prophets and righteous men longed to see what you see, but did not see it, and to hear what you hear, but did not hear it,&quot; Matt 13:17."},{"Title":"English Zohar, 22 volume set","review":"The Zohar is more than 2000 years old, but until very recently it was kept almost entirely hidden from the world, withheld out of fear that its power would be misused.

Wallis Budge produced his volume Egyptian Language: Easy Lessons in Egyptian Hieroglyphics with Sign List &quot;to form an easy introduction to the study of the Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions.&quot; Budge's Egyptian Language provides a introductory overview of how the hieroglyphic system relates to major categories of Egyptian grammar. Budge's presentation can be grasped by most seventh graders. The hieroglyphic type fonts used through out the work are excellent and a great aid to the total novice. The grammatical aspects are richly illustrated with interesting samples of text passages taken from ancient Egyptian sources. If the reader pays careful attention to the material Budge presents she may be delighted at to find she has acquired some ability to cope with the reading passages provided at the end of the text.Egyptology has made great progress over the last century, yet Budge's Egyptian Language still provides a great bang-for-the-buck for untrained readers who are interested in ancient Egyptian writing. It is an interesting example of turn-of-the-century scholarship trying to extend itself to the general public. And I think even nine decades later, the interested public can still benefit from it today."},{"Title":"Egyptian Language: Easy Lessons in Egyptian Hieroglyphics","review":"I found this book very well written. The author goes through the history of hieroglyphics. He then teaches the reader to read almost any hieroglyphic script.

Boy, was I wrong.It's a very bad sign when a language text doesn't even touch upon the verb until chapter IX, only then to tell the stubborn reader who made it that far that &quot;in the limits of this little book it is impossible to set before the reader examples of the use of the various parts of the verb, and to illustrate the forms of it which have been identified with the Infinitive and Imperative moods and with participial forms.&quot;A paradigm of verb endings is provided (surprisingly enough), but it uses a different verb to illustrate each ending, and is rather buried in the text. The concepts are tricky, and very little is done to clarify them (for instance, citing examples of potential similarities with Hebrew doesn't help me). I like the fact that there are excerpts from actual texts to practice on, but since I never actually managed to acquire any skills, I couldn't exactly practice on the sentences provided.I sincerely hope that students who are interested in learning ancient Egyptian by themselves won't waste their time with this book as I did."},{"Title":"Egyptian Language: Easy Lessons in Egyptian Hieroglyphics","review":"I am an Egyptologist who teaches an online course in Egyptian hieroglyphs to the general public. While this book is widely available, don't let that fool you into thinking it is at all reliable.

If Egyptologists had any say over it, the book would be banned, as it is completely outdated and wasn't even considered a good book when it was first published nearly 100 years ago. When I first started studying Egyptian myself, my instructor started off the class by writing \\"Budge\\" on the board and enclosing it in a circle with a slash through it. That's how bad this book is. In my courses, students use and like James Allen's book on Middle Egyptian. It's recently published so it is up to date, and is written in a way that makes Egyptian comprehensible to the modern reader. It's infinitely better than Budge."},{"Title":"Egyptian Language: Easy Lessons in Egyptian Hieroglyphics","review":"This book may have some remaining marginal utility for people who just want to learn to write their name in hieroglyphics.However, if your interest in the Egyptian language runs deeper than that, you will want to pass this one by. Budge uses a system of transliteration that is no longer the standard, and now only found in reprints of books by Budge himself. If you learn it, you will have to unlearn it later on. His presentation of the grammar is also obsolete and incomplete.More serious students would be better served by Gardiner's -Egyptian Grammar-, or Allen's -Introduction to Middle Egyptian-, or even Mercer's similarly priced paperbacks."},{"Title":"Egyptian Language: Easy Lessons in Egyptian Hieroglyphics","review":"The best part of this book is the beginning, where Budge traces the history of the Egyptian language and then its decipherment. All of these chapters are very interesting and informative. If you want to get a good picture of what the state of Egyptology was in the 1930's, then this is not a bad book for that, although the historical information is rather abbreviated compared to an actual history book.Which isn't surprising, given that this book's main purpose was allegedly to teach the ancient Egyptian language. Unfortunately, the field wasn't thoroughly developed when Budge wrote this book, so any new student would be better off reading a newer work. And, while I can't speak for others, I found the information poorly organized and impossible to learn from."},{"Title":"Egyptian Language: Easy Lessons in Egyptian Hieroglyphics","review":"Sorry this book is not for the serious student.

He is so biblical, so percise, and so careful in expositing word by word, verse by verse that you'll find charismatics, arminians, cavinists, fundamentalists, and even Christian liberals nodding their heads at the clear truths in these books.

The Church of Christ needs a renewal of Bible Exposition; passage upon passage and through entire books of the written Word of God. The Dr. masterfully builds upon the great truths contained in this letter. 2. Truth transforms as a person begins with their mind being taught these Great Truths. These truths (as all truth) set free and transform the total person as it is applied by the Spirit. Truth changes ones character, ones social context, and arms him/her for spiritual conflict. 3. The postional truths of who we are in Christ(as individuals and as a church),develop \\"Spirit-Filled\\" churches. I know that this term has been hijacked by certain segments of the Evangelical Church. But this Exposition of Ephesians demonstrates that being Spirit-Filled has to do with transformation not only in worship but in those places where everyone sees our Christianity. (our marriages, family relationships, and work) Being Spirit-Filled means that you really are different and these vitally areas are changed. Those are the evidences of being \\"Spirit-Filled.\\" 4. The Church is where the wisdom of God is demonstrated to the Spiritual forces of this world System. (3:10-12) Christ has conquered these forces through His death and resurrection (1:20-22) Now we can stand (individually and as the Church) against those forces and move steadily to the victory He has won. (6:10-20) Lloyd Jones warns us against seeing our spiritual warfare in merely human terms (a reak problem with those influenced by liberal theology) but in spiritual ones. He also warns against taking on God's enemy, the Devil, in a Cavalier manner (a problem all too prevelant among many extremeist in Charismatic movement)But to stand and learn what it means to arm oneself for conflict.These volumns are not for those who want quick,easy, pleasing to the ears messages. These are faithful, thourough expositions of the passages. He takes on the tough passages and concepts of this epistle. This reading speaks to todays consumer oriented, and consumer pleasing \\"Bible Lite\\" mentality that is destroying Western Evangelicalism.

The chapters in this book might be spoken of by some as 'sermons.' They are addressed to believers, assuming the readiness of the readers or listeners to be exhorted and instructed. Yet they were not prepared or presented in a context of congregational worship. They lack some of those elements of illustration and rhetoric that normally have a place in the sermon...

To be fair, Wilson collected a huge database of names to be included in this volume and it serves a purpose. It is a good starting point for someone to look up people and their work. Not enough descriptions of what people do unfortunately. At least the names are highlighted and indexed so you can quickly go through it and pick up names. It is a name book...and a good stroke to many people's egos, including Wilson's who doesn't omit himself and the &quot;I...once upon a time&quot; reference to himself and his greatness. Being that there is nothing else like it out there, it is a good addition to one's reference shelf. But don't rely on it to measure greatness and don't hold your breath for super-exciting theory you haven't read before. Quite an undertaking, and with omissions which at least Wilson admits to.

I'm interested in computer art but Information Arts shows that is just the top of the iceberg -- artists dancing in zero gravity, learning how to change the patterns on butterfly wings, reclaiming toxic waste dumps, planting chips in their body, making radioactive sculptures, breeding artificial life.... You really begin to get a glimpse of what kind of art is coming down the road.I appreciated the systematic way the book dealt with all these topics. There are chapters on art exploring biology, particle physics, space art, mathematical art, artificial life, etc. The author seemed to work hard to find artists from all over the world coming at it from different points of view. Also each section also offers a review of relevant theory, and seemed very fair in its attempt to offer a full range of opinions.There are two kinds of artist sections in the book - multipage sections with an image and samples of the artists' writing, and shorter sections of a few lines. I wish there were more details on the less described artists but then the book would have been bigger than its already huge 1000 pages. Also, I wish the images were color.

Throughout the book, the main focus is upon Voltaire's sociopolitical and intellectual development, and how he translated these ideas into his poems, plays, letters, philosophical and political writings, not to mention how these ideas were subsequently brought into practice and converted into action, since Voltaire was very much a social activist avant-la-lettre. Thus the book is not so much a biography (for such one should consult Theodore Besterman's &quot;Voltaire&quot;), but is invaluable as to thoroughy understand what Voltaire stood for, why he acted as he did, and how he came to develop his ideas as he did. Though mr. Gay may admire Voltaire, the book is by no means prejudiced, but rather open-minded and fair in its judgements. The fact that this book was intended as a scholarly contribution to the debate on Voltaire has not made it any more difficult to read. Again, as with prof. Gay's brilliant &quot;The Enlightenment, an interpretation&quot;, it is very entertaining and a joy to read.

Right now, I use \\"The Basic Practice of Statistics\\" by David Moore. Therefore, when I looked at this book, it was being compared to the Moore book as well as to what I want to cover in the class.The coverage of this book is barely adequate for my needs although the order of presentation is well within my desires. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is not covered, which I consider to be a serious omission. The presentation style is appropriate for the level of student that I have in my classes, I would rank it right in the middle of what is acceptable in terms of level of difficulty. The demonstrations are generally clear, although at times a bit too concise. In my opinion it would have been better if there had been more examples worked in a step by step manner. My students need that at least once for each problem type.If you are looking for a book where the exercises are real-world, then this book is just right for you. The problems that appear at the ends of the sections are nearly always based on a plausible scenario that someone could face. While this is good, it would have been better if there were at least a few problems where only the numbers are given.

At first, I was a little intimidated by the thought of doing yoga (I also have no burning desire to stand on my head or anything like that), but the yoga in this book is easy, uncomplicated, and very well laid out for someone who has been in pain for a long time with IC (14 years in my case). There are a lot of hand drawn illustrations (as opposed to some of the more colorful yoga books with photos I've seen, but never bought) which get theidea of each exercise across very well.I like this book and really do feel more relaxed and less stressed after I do one of their exercise sessions.

Written in everyday speech, it is simple enough for the layperson yet thorough enough for practitioners. It gives eight weeks of exercises and poses, with tips for those with IC. Also listed are certain poses to avoid, \\"Yoga for a bad day\\", and tips on the IC diet and ideas to keep patient's flares to a minimum.I tried some of these poses and felt more relaxed and calm throughout the day. There are simple illustrations to show you how to do the poses and where to press for the acupressure. At 165 pages it gives you plenty of options and tons of guides to help you on what path you should take to decrease your chronic pain. The author reports that 90% of their students have a decrease in their symptoms following the program. That is fabulous for us IC patients!There is the tip to do the lessons right before bed as the yoga tends to decrease your night urinary frequency. What great news that is for us as well!. You don't need alot of space, a maximum of 3 feet by 6 feet is recommended.There is also no equipment to buy.The All Info About Interstitial Cystitis website (http://cystitis.allinfoabout.com) Highly recommends this book for anyone with Interstitial Cystitis as a way to manage their symptoms and chronic pain."},{"Title":"Cystitis: A Time to Heal with Yoga & Accupressure, An Eight Week Exercise Program with Special Information on Interstitial Cystitis & Urethral Syndrome","review":"I recommend seeing a physical therapist about your pelvic floor, if it is already damaged (you have IC, pelvic floor pain, pudendal neuralgia..) then you will need physical therapy treatments and doing these poses alone won't heal you.

The problem is not so much the illustrations (which are great), but that with a sometimes small illustration sitting in a sea of words, the child is forced to only look at the frightening graphic for a long time (such as the giant -- a fanged cyclops -- from Jack and the Beanstalk crashing to earth while holding a spiked club). We've since read some of the nursery rhymes, but wanted to read some classics, like Snow White, Jack and the Beanstalk, Goldilocks, etc. Last night, I read Tom Thumb to my son. It features King Arthur, Queen Mab (the fairy queen) and Merlin, so the magical qualities (I thought) should delight him. Within moments, Tom is baked in a pudding, nearly eaten by a cow, grabbed by a bird, swallowed by a giant, vomited into the sea and eaten by a fish (twice), released by King Arthur's cook, knighted, picked up and returned by the Fairy Queen to Arthur (but drops from the wind into Arthur's wine and is sentenced to death for treason), tossed in a river, chased by a cat, falls out of grace with a new queen, sentenced to death again, escapes on a butterfly but is trapped in a mousetrap, and is finally killed by a spider.My son said, \\"Never. Read. That. Again.\\"My biggest beef comes from Random House's use of \\"Children's Treasury\\" in the title, where \\"The Random House Treasury of Fairy Tales, Nursery Rhymes, & Nonsense Verse\\" would have been spot on. As a collection of classics, the book is great. Well organized, well illustrated, and pretty complete. Now, I love the wicked cruelty bits (such as that found in the Brothers Grimm) just as much as the magical bits when the stories can be viewed as allegory or metaphor, but this book is now moved into my home office, and I will be searching for the \\"sanitized\\" re-tellings of the classics. Later, my son can learn the true stories, but for now, as he continues to learn about story structure, a happy ending (even when it's not the true version) means more to me than the faithful reproduction of 16th and 17th century works."},{"Title":"The Random House Children's Treasury: Fairy Tales, Nursery Rhymes & Nonsense Verse","review":"My father used to read this book in a prior version to me more than 30 years ago.

It's important to note most of thetherapies discussed are not offered by standard veterinarian care. I particularlylike the incorporation for bodywork techniques, such as, cranialsacral andmyofascial release which offer more effective healing than traditional massage.And if you want an alternative to injecting your horse with medication there is anexcellent section covering iontophoresis.

One day, right?)Left to myself I would read primarily fiction - my favorites are Lee Smith and Sharyn McCrumb, Ron Rash and Appalachian authors in general.But as an English major in college I feel an obligation to keep up my reading of classic literature.Actually, it's less an obligation and more a simple desire to keep my mind working in some other direction than diapers and Cheerios and the easiest way to clean my filthy oven.So, I like to play this game.I require myself to read one work of classic lit. to every two modern fiction pieces I read.Recently I picked up John Steinbeck's The Red Pony.I chose it for three reasons.1. It was written by Steinbeck and I couldn't believe I had made it through college and six years of teaching high school English without ever cracking open any of his fiction works besides Of Mice and Men - and maybe I read Grapes of Wrath but I really cannot remember.2. I really enjoyed his true-life road trip escapades in his non-fiction Travels With Charley.3. It was on my shelf already.Well.If this was Steinbeck's only work of fiction, I feel pretty confident he would not hold a secure place in school textbooks today.I don't know to whom this book would appeal - because it is bizarre. It drags on and it's only one hundred pages. There is no sense of redemption in any of the characters and no traits worth imitating or even the converse - worth really learning from.Seriously, the most interesting part of this novel was the uber-odd statement by Billy Buck, a ranch hand, about being half-horse. \\"My ma died when I was born, and being my old man was a government packer in the mountains, and no cows around most of the time, why he just gave me mostly mare's milk.\\"What?I know I was raised on a dairy farm and not a horse farm, but how do you exactly acquire milk from a horse?I laughed at that exchange, but not because it was supposed to be funny.And the red pony?I don't want to ruin it for you if you are holding your own copy in your hands right at this very instance, but uh, the red pony is out of the novel before the forty-page mark.Frankly, I am not sure why this little novel was even published.I assume it is because when Steinbeck wrote it he was already so well-established that his publisher just said, \\"Sure, John. Whatever you want. A novel called The Red Pony that is not at all about a red pony? Sounds fine.\\""},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"I had to read this book for school and in my opion the book is not in any way enjoyable or outstanding. It is supposed to be about a young boy maturing but the few changes that happen to him in extent of about two years are subtle and unimportant. He does learn about death although through the red pony (why is that the title of the book when the pony is only mention in the first two chapters then forgotten?). This book merely sleeps along drifting slowly and clumsily between chapters. It would have been much better if it went more into depth of the little boy's parents' and grandfather's history. Why Gitano, the old man who lived in an adobe house near the farm, went into the mountains is not told leaving you to make up your own conclusion. The only part of the book that stands out is the grandfather's speech at the very end of the book about westering and how the times have changed."},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"It takes palce in California.Its a bit of tear-jerker but the author makes the scenes appear with really good detail.A young kid lives on a ranch, then years pass and he loves the pony he saw.As a young boy he trains to ride the horse.The emotional part is when the pony gets sick.In the story Jodi is a settle boy but as is down days.So jodi and his pony are like best friends and are there for each other.I would recomend to people who like the western type of books with animals from ranches."},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"The Red Pony was an okay book.

Is there a point to it? What is the plot of this story? The whole book was titled, &quot;The Red Pony,&quot; but the pony deceased in the very first chapter! How can John Steinbeck, a renowned and intelligent writer, write such a bad book? I decided to give it two stars because it had a little bit of a point to it, but not much. In the first chapter, the red pony dies and the characters are introduced. In the second chapter, Gitano comes into the story, and says he was born there, and he is never mentioned again. The third chapter is about Jody receiving Nellie and then she dies because of the colt she bears, and is never mentioned again. At the conclusion of the book, Jody's grandfather comes to visit and basically the only thing that happens is that he drinks lemonade with Jody and tells him stories of the Native-Americans and wagon trains. The ending line is Mrs. Tiflin saying,&quot;Here, I'll reach the sqeezer down to you.&quot; What kind of an ending is that? I would have picked an ending like, &quot; Although the red pony is dead, her spirit lives on in us forever.&quot; Anything is better than a lousy dialogue like that.

I am not sure on exact page, because i found more use for the book as a fire starter.The only reason i didn't stop reading was because it was required for school.

I had to read the book for a summer reading assignment which also had a lot of written work attached to it, if I didn't have to read the book and I just picked it up for pleasure I would have stopped after the first chapter. The book was four or five different stories that were never finished. The only thing that tied them all together was one boy, Jody Tiflin. The book in my opinion had no point. I knew it was a book about a boy becoming a man but the kid was only 10, I thought that his age was very unrealistic. In my opinion your are still a kid untill you are at least 13.

Why should every novel be a princess pretty tale? If that is what you need, keep pretending and don't ever read some of the most poignantly beautiful reflections of what it is like to be a 10 year old boy growing up on a farm!This is a sensitive, time realistic story of what it would be like to live on a farm back in the days when you had to know practical therapy for your stock animals. These people respected their animals and knew that it was important to know emergency procedures, and knew how to do them to try and save their stock. Sometimes it worked, sometimes, it did not. It is this down side that focuses on Jody, the 10 year old son, that gets to own a pony who becomes ill with &quot;strangles&quot; a disease that shuts off his airway. The stockhand pulls no stops to save his life, and Jody chooses to stay by his beloved pony's side. The event is pivotal. As all events that revolve around life and death, this is the basis of which the story continues to move.I do not find the story to be distasteful at all. I find it to be full of life and love. For those that can not get through the saddness of the pony dying, I feel sad that you missed some very relevant, affirming representations of the real meaning of life and love."},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"I really like this book.It deals with real people and some of the everyday life problems.My favorite part was when Jody got Gabilen.I think the saddest part according to me is when Gabilen died .There was a part when John Seinbeck could have added something to make the book more interesting .That was at the beginning,beause Jody's parents could have made him work for it or save up for it ."},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"My opinion This is definitely one of my favorite books.This book is a great book for older people.It doesn't hold anything back.It tells you everything you need to know about..the hard times and the good times.

A great many of the reviewers obviously did not have the maturity or intellect to appreciate this work. Talk about casting pearls before swine!This is one of those great stories that shows - not tells - both the beauty and the pain of life. Young Jody is overjoyed with his red pony, and does all he can and should to care for it. But it dies anyway. And this is tragic, but must be accepted. People can not control the world around them. Death happens. But life goes on.The Red Pony is a complex portrait of life in a particular time and place. It is not maudlin, it is not sanitized, it does no blatant moralizing. It simply brings us to a vivid and straightforward view of the hardships and beauties of life.This is a story no one could forget."},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"The book is very intresting and exiciting.

How could my curriculum have bypassed an author with an incredible ability to draw his reader into stories with such fluidity and ease?The Red Pony is a short novel broken into four parts centering on a young boy named Jody. Each part could be a stand alone short story, but collectively they tell the struggle of a boy maturing into adulthood on a farm in California during the Depression. On the surface the Red Pony is an example of one boys move from adolescence towards adulthood. Underneath, however, is Steinbeck's further examination of man's sense of belonging and purpose in the world. The depth and vastness of the world is dependent upon each character's understanding and his purpose in it.It is Steinbeck's descriptions of nature that adds such a rich dimension to this story by having the characters views of the farm, mountains, animals....change with the mood of the story. I was absolutely lost in the beautiful descriptions of the farm and countryside that made up Carl and Billy Buck's world, and felt Jody's desire to expand that horizon into the mountains and beyond.There seemed to be so much going on for such a short story that I felt full after reading it."},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"In this short hart breaking story a young boy gets a special gift. This little red pony is all Jody, the main character, cares about. One day he lets the pony out and it starts to rain and the pony got very ill. Jody does all he can to save the pony but can't. Later on one of the mares on Jody's farm is pregnant. His father promised him the colt of Nelly. This story was a very sad and hart breaking one but it was a really good story that was hard to put down. I recommend this to anyone who likes sad animal stories."},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"In the story,&quot; The Red Pony&quot; which was written by John Steinbeck was written in four different stories. These stories consisted of parts. The main character of the book is a boy named Jody Tiflin. He is a boy who lives on a ranch with his family. Also another main characteris a man named Billy Buck who works on the ranch. Billy is a very kind person who teaches Jody many things about all of the horses.Throughout the four difernent stories Jody learns to do many things with horses including watching them progress and watching them go through various difficult things. He also learnes various leasons about how his father treats outsiders and even his own family. Thoughout the story Jody and Billy gain trust and lose it, they become very close though trust.When I was reading this book I had mixed reactions toward it. In certian parts of the book there was alot of action while in other parts it was very slow. But overall the book was very entertaining and gave me a good idea of what a boy has to do to take care of a horse, alot of work and determination.In conclusion, I strongly suggest you go out and read this book, it has a very strong theme and plot. I really enjoyed reading this book and I encourage you to go out a reed this book."},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"I don't understand why some of the reviewers dislike this book. Or rather, I do understand. A reader has to concentrate, think, and feel to appreciate Steinbeck (or any other good work of fiction). If doing that makes you queasy, maybe you should read Dean Koontz or Tom Clancy or John Grisham -- candied popcorn for the mind. THE RED PONY reaches deep into the human experience and is as much a classic today -- when the farms are gone, or starving for rain -- as it was 60 years ago. The characters are unforgettable, and the setting is profoundly evocative."},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"I like The Red Pony because it kept me on the edge of my seat. It had a lot of unexpected twists and turns. It makes you feel like what is happening in the book is really happening to you. Even though the book is very sad, it is very interesting because of all the events that happen in a row. It is full of details that make it seem so realistic. Anyone that likes books that are full of emotion and intensity should really read this book. That is why I really liked the book, and why I would recommend it to others."},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"I liked this story because it is about the lessons Jody Tiflin learns and the hardships he endures.In every chapter somthing terrible happens. As a result, Jody learns a lesson. I especially liked the way the author made mini stories instead of a whole book. I recomend this book because it might help you learn a lesson.I also think this book will live on for quite a while."},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"The Red Pony is an interesting book because there are four short stories. although the book can be sad it gives you an idea of life on the ranch for a teenage boy maturing.

I read probably 75% of his books in tenth grade and thought most of them were 5 stars and a few were 4 stars. I just read this one after my daughter tackled it for her 11th grade reading assignment. Overall it deals very well with the evolutionary process people (hopefully) go through as they mature. It is not a novel per se, but a collection of short stories. The first story is one of living with regret and loss of abject trust in adults. Two lessons everyone needs to learn, though many folks would prefer to delay the learning. Another horse story deals with the theme of loss again, but this time in terms of the price you pay for keeping a promise and how that is often as bad as having the promise broken. The other two stories focus on older citizens and how they deal with the end of their time on this planet. One is a man longing for a connection with his youth, the other mourning the loss of the pioneer spirit in the country he grew up in.I can see how folks who grow up in an era where it appears &quot;meat grows between styrofoam and saran wrap&quot; would have trouble with some of the more graphic portayals in this collection of stories. However, having to face up to realities is part the process of growing up. It would be interesting to see how some of the folks who pan this book now feel about it in another 20 years..."},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"This book is a classic Steinbeck tale about a boy who wants a pony more than anything and a father who has difficulty showing his love for his son. Many of us can relate to that. Steinbeck takes us into the boy's heart and shows us everyday people struggling to understand each other. He shows the risks parents will take to show a child their love. Steinbeck, as always, paints a vivid and accurate picture of a period of American life."},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"THIS BOOK IS SO BAD AND VIOLENT.

It was so bad that some one probably became so depressed by reading it that they killed themselves. And that's not because it was sad because it wasn't. I'm sorry to say, but this book fails at failing and no, that's not a double negative. It was just horrid. Every time the book got interesting the story changed. Stienback had the right ideas he just ruined them.For example, the ending. Please don't skip this paragraph thinking it will ruin the book because what is there to ruin? Anyway lets take a deeper look into the waste of time that is the red pony. Here are the last two paragraphs of the book.Jody ran into the kitchen where his mother was wiping the last of the breakfast dishes. \\"Can I have lemon to make a lemonade for grandfather?\\"His mother mimicked -\\"and another lemon to make a lemonade for you.\\"\\"No ma'am, I don't want one.\\"\\" Jody! You're sick!\\" Then she stopped suddenly. \\"Take a lemon out of the cooler,\\" she said softly. \\"Here I'll reach the squeezer down to you.Yup, that was the ending. I mean who says, \\" to make a lemonade.\\"It amazes me how bad it was. Just imagine a hundred pages of this sort of stuff. And why on earth would you make an ending the stupid and that pointless. And here is a short sentence from the beginning of the book.\\"Billy cleared each nostril by holding down its mate and blowing fiercely,\\" I mean seriously what went wrong is the poor writers childhood.In my opinion if you're even on this web page you should get off the computer, sit down, and rethink you life.

Add the fact that the story starts off with \\"Billy Buck ate breakfast. Jody looked under the table at his shoes\\" and other stupid remarks like so, and this book is the most boring I've ever seen! At remarkably jacked-up prices (probably because so few people buy this except students of school districts, who are probably bribed), who would want to spend money on this?Save your money.

First, the plot. The plot in this story skips around a bit. When I finished the book, I had no idea what the theme was, I didn't get it until I read the prologue (which I read after I read the story). The theme of the story is not very evident which is why I had to read the intro.Second, the title threw me off. This book is really not about the pony even though the it is a major part of the plot. I feel that the ending should have at least mentioned something to do with the pony to really tie the story together. My point being that it is very hard to find the theme (which is not about life and death contrary to what many people believe).Personally, I like long books that really develop on plot and characters such as The Wayward Bus or Lord of the Rings. My advise is to ignore the title when reading because it is a real downer to find out that the pony isn't really what the book is about. All in all, it is a good book to read, I feel that you should read it but, the plot is definately not superficial and is hard to find."},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"This book is good for teens beacuse it teaches you the responsibility you need to raise animals and the work you might have to go through in life and the tradgies you go through!"},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"I think this book was very realistic, but very boring and I think the only good part in it was when Jody strangled the vultures, which was quite exciting."},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"My interpretation of this offbeat story is a bit different than most, I suspect. I saw it as the story of a boy being completely set up for failure in life by his father. Jody's dad, a stern traditionalist who believes that showing compassion to either people or animals will merely make them \\"soft,\\" sets up a couple of opportunities for Jody to take on the responsibility for an animal. The problem is, both situations backfire badly, and the father apparently doesn't bother to help his son through it -- to help him learn from it, put it in perspective, whatever. He also criticizes the boy relentlessly. The result: With each episode, Jody actually seems to regress in maturity and become more withdrawn and impotently angry. I labeled my review \\"chilling\\" because when the story was over, I couldn't help imagining what kind of adulthood Jody might be headed for. (The passages in which Jody abuses animals are especially disturbing. I have no idea whether Steinbeck knew this, but animal abuse by children is a predictor for violent criminal behavior later in life, up to and including serial murder.)So: While not exactly a \\"fun\\" read, I would rate this as a dark, brooding, effective slice of life that skates close to the horror genre in its implications. I would recommend getting the version with John Seelye's thoughtful introduction, which certainly helped me make sense of the story."},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"This is one of the most powerful, well written books in print.

The first part- &quot;The Gift&quot;- relates Jody's experience in bringing up a pony, a gift from his father. He finds the hot-tempered horse, which he names Gabilan, a challenge and carefully follows the management instruction of Billy Buck, his father's ranch assistant. Unfortunately, the pony catches severe cold aften it was drenched in a downpour.In spite of Billy Buck's expertise on horses, Gabilan dies. The second part- &quot;The Great Mountains&quot;- relates Jody's encounter with Gitano an old man from the mountains. The man has come back to live and die in the ranch since he was born there but Jody's father is not interested in making any deal with him. Gitano later disappears to the mountains with Old Easter, an old horse. In the third part-&quot;The Promise&quot;- Jody's father hatches a plan to replace the deceased pony, and Jody is actively involved in the process. He takes Nelly, one of their mares to a nearby ranch for mating with a stallion. She becomes pregnant later and Jody waits impatiently for her to throw the colt. Again, hard luck follows him as the horse develops complications.Billy Buck rips her open and extracts the colt. We are not told the fate of Nelly. In part four - &quot;The Leader of the People&quot; - we learn about the sour relationship between Jody's father and grandfather. The old man is despised because he tells endless stories about horses and 'westering'. During an unwelcome visit to the ranch, it dawns on the old man that the time has come for a change. He gradually shifts the theme from horses to &quot;There's no place to go&quot; and tries to plant it in Jody's head as the boy clings to him.This book is not only instructive but entertaining, although parts 2 and 3 do not seem to fit in precisely.One has to look beyond the letters to identify the underlying message. For one thing, Jody's father wants him to know the way of horses. He raises horses and witnesses tragedies. Apparently, he does not enjoy the fruit of his labor, but he learns to grow up in the midst of insurmountable problems."},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"The short story &quot;The Red Pony&quot; had a good storyline in it.

It became one of my favorite stories and later I sought out the entire book. Steinbeck has since become one of my favorite authors. His colorful descriptions captured my young mind and his symbolism and metaphorical writing kept my adolescent and adult mind interested. As a teacher, I shared &quot;The Gift&quot; with my third graders, as an oral reading. They could not wait until the next day to hear more, and they had the most vivid pictures of the characters and scenes in their minds. In my humble opinion, this book is a &quot;must read&quot;, more than once."},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"No one has ever been able to put so much Symbolism into 100 pages than John Steinbeck. Jody's trek through the perils of maturity takes him through the feelings of others, and learning that he is not the center of attention.

Symbolism at its best."},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"I have read several of John Steinbeck's short novels and he is one of few authors that possesses the intelligence to cram more meaning and sybolism into less than 100 pages than your feeble minds can comprehend.

There are several scenes that are graphic, violent, and disturbing, and the book is perhaps best read with the perspective of an adult."},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"Even though the book &quot;The Red Pony&quot;, by John Stienbeck, was one of the saddest books I have ever read I would recommend it because the plot has many interesting turns and the theme is very emotional. &quot;The Red Pony&quot; was about a young boy, Jody, and his family who live on a ranch. The book consists of four short stories, each of which involves Jody learning a lesson of life. It is so tragic because in every story, something dies. In &quot;The Gift&quot; and &quot;The Promise&quot;, two horses die, in &quot;The Great Mountains&quot; it is implied that Gitano committed suicide, and in &quot;The Leader of the People&quot; a part of Grandfather dies when he realizes that Westering has passed. When he realizes this, his whole motivation is gone, so a part of him is missing, or dead. My favorite story in &quot;The Red Pony&quot; was &quot;The Promise&quot;, because I enjoyed the way Jody would imagine things about what he was doing on the way home from school, and about what the new colt would be like. Over all, I found this book very enjoyable, even though it was so melancholy."},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"John Steinbeck's The Red Pony is a deceptively simple \\"young reader's\\" book that blossoms into full life meaning when examined as an artfully presented novella. The brief 100-page work reads like a four-paneled painting which, viewed from the proper perspective, should be appreciated for what it truly is--a remarkable rendition of realism in 20th century American literature.What to expect from the book: Expect four loosely connected short stories or vignettes, not a tightly woven epic plot. Expect crisp, articulate prose, without the extravagant detail, depth of characterization and flowing drama afforded by a longer work. Expect to experience thought-provoking, coming-of-age events in a young Salinas ranch boy's life, not the entertaining action of a Hollywood thriller. Also, expect to have to dig a little to understand the author's message, not to be spoonfed the theme of this unique work.Here's my view of the thematic \\"glue\\" holding the individual stories together:1. Boy learns about death: In \\"The Gift,\\" 10-year old Jody learns through the sudden sickness, suffering and gruesome, buzzard-pecked death of his beloved red pony, Gabilan, that even \\"happy\\" gifts can result in sadness and loss, despite the best efforts of well-intentioned adults.2. Boy views consequences of the ways of man: In \\"The Great Mountains,\\" Jody sees how compassion has its economic and cultural limitations, when father refuses to honor the old paisano, Gitano's, request to live out his remaining years on the ranch where he was born. Consequence: Gitano disappears into the lonesome mountains towards the west, riding father's decrepit horse and ominously carrying only a sharp-bladed rapier.3. Through loss comes hope: Against a gloomy backdrop of loss, \\"The Promise\\" builds hope but culminates in the harsh choice between life of birthing mare and her breech-positioned colt. The bittersweet outcome, death of the mare to save her colt, is difficult to accept but does offer at least a glimmer of optimism.4. Despite life's trials and tribulations, its fullness arises from having a sense of purpose: The final story, \\"The Leader of the People,\\" mentions neither the loss of Jody's red pony nor his presumed raising of the newborn colt. Instead, the connection to the other stories and unifying message of the novella can be found, in my opinion, within the final, almost trivial event: \\"Grandfather was about to refuse, and then he saw Jody's face,\\" which led him to accept Jody's offer to make him a glass of lemonade. Importantly, through the simple act of accepting Jody's offer, Grandfather nourishes the boy's sense of purpose. Although Grandfather's own life purpose has withered since that unforgettable year decades ago when he led a group of settlers out west, the boy's life lies ahead with plenty of potential for a purposeful future.In sum, out of death, and love, springs life's potential: When life has a purpose, however big or small--from caring for a pony to returning to one's birthplace to die, from being a leader of the people to making lemonade for a loved one--we not only live but thrive. The Red Pony is a sensitive affirmation of life--recommended reading for anyone willing to experience a little darkness before seeing light."},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"I read some of these reviews and could not believe how unrealistic some of these people are. Why should every novel be a princess pretty tale? If that is what you need, keep pretending and don't ever read some of the most poignantly beautiful reflections of what it is like to be a 10 year old boy growing up on a farm!This is a sensitive, time realistic story of what it would be like to live on a farm back in the days when you had to know practical therapy for your stock animals. These people respected their animals and knew that it was important to know emergency procedures, and knew how to do them to try and save their stock. Sometimes it worked, sometimes, it did not. It is this down side that focuses on Jody, the 10 year old son, that gets to own a pony who becomes ill with &quot;strangles&quot; a disease that shuts off his airway. The stockhand pulls no stops to save his life, and Jody chooses to stay by his beloved pony's side. The event is pivotal. As all events that revolve around life and death, this is the basis of which the story continues to move.I do not find the story to be distasteful at all. I find it to be full of life and love. For those that can not get through the saddness of the pony dying, I feel sad that you missed some very relevant, affirming representations of the real meaning of life and love."},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"I read this book aloud to my children; ages 10 and 12. It was fascinating in its detail. The language and style are observant, forceful, unadorned. California ranch life in the depression is drawn as spare - a tenuous, unforgiving existence without frills.The characters are pithy, pragmatic, responsible. They stand in contrast to the people of the late 90's like the book's black cypress differs from an artificial Christmas tree. The end of the book leaves you wondering; trying to sort out what Steinbeck wanted us to understand. I enjoyed it. Enough that at midnight, before the week begins on Monday, I am trying to answer those questions for myself."},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"John Steinbeck's &quot;The Red Pony&quot; is a group of four interconnected stories: &quot;The Gift,&quot; &quot;The Great Mountains,&quot; &quot;The Promise,&quot; and &quot;The Leader of the People.&quot; Each story focuses on Jody Tiflin, a 10-year old boy growing up on a ranch on the west coast of the United States. The other main characters are Jody's parents and the ranch hand Billy Buck. Also frequently appearing are the ranch dogs, Doubletree Mutt and Smasher.&quot;The Red Pony&quot; is not a novel, so readers expecting the cohesion and unity of a novel will be disappointed. The book should, in my opinion, be evaluated for what it is. And once you appreciate its own peculiar structure, you may, as I did, acknowledge &quot;The Red Pony&quot; as a powerful and beautiful work of art.Steinbeck masterfully captures the cycles of life, death, and renewal in the lives of both his human and animal characters. He creates vivid, often visceral scenes, that are written in a quietly powerful language. There are moving moments of joy, horror, and heartbreak. &quot;The Red Pony&quot; is a significant achievement by one of America's enduring literary giants."},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"What surprises me about the negative reviews of The Red Pony -- the proportion of which astonished me -- is why the readers who so terribly disliked the book (I see all four parts as &quot;the book&quot;) persevered with it.Sure, Carl Tiflin would be criticized by many, many products of Generation X, plus the one before it, whatever it's special identity. His austere nature and harsh ways of interacting with his wife and Jody (especially Jody) were not uncommon during a time when grubbing a living took every waking minute -- which is the timeline of this fine story. But the conflict Steinbeck expertly wove into the story was a critical part of it; it was not a bit contrived. We noted that Jody didn't hate his lot in life as a consequence of stern discipline, the complete absence of tender and caring outpourings from his father. Indeed, the discipline was present when the father was not: Jody caught himself pointing his .22 rifle at a forbidden target and reminded himself that ammunition would not be forthcoming for yet another year if his father had been there to see that act. Jody did, after all, have a .22 rifle -- a prior gift from his father, one with enormous meaning and carrying with it indelible notions of responsibility.Billy Buck, a masterful Steinbeck stroke of characterization, was the buffer that absorbed some of the abrasiveness handed down by father to son, at other times dulling its cutting edge, and at still others obliquely giving the boy a means of rationalizing over it -- it isn't personal, Jody, just your father's way. It was clear that Jody was well aware of the latter, too.His inability to embrace the boy with outward expressions of fatherly love was otherwise expressed by Carl in the gift of the .22, even burdened as it was by a year of abstinence from using it, and then by the gift of the red pony -- which also came with a price: warnings of the consequences that would come if the pony interfered with Jody's chores or school. Giving with one hand and threatening to take back with the other was not an uncommon form of conditional generousity during those tough times, and it's not to be despised now.Carl's outspoken intolerance of Jody's maternal grandfather's despondency over his obsolescence was Steinbeck's means of revealing to us that Carl Tiflin did, actually, have a thread of feelings down deep, demonstrated by his remorse after discovering that Grandfather had overheard Carl trashing him and his ideas of &quot;westering.&quot;For all his faults, Carl Tiflin was an honorable, responsible, hardworking man. Those are the recollections Jody the man would have of his father, with never a thought of the qualities other observers disliked.Too many fathers today don't have the stuff for stern discipline, or discipline to any degree, even though it's more essential today than it was in Jody's time. So we have novels about wild and courageously untameable teens despising and defying their parents, fictional characters who are mirrors of too many of their contemporaries, just as Jody was likely akin to many of his.Maybe I earned a good measure of empathy for Carl -- and for Jody's uncritical acceptance of his stern ways. My own father, also a stern disciplinarian, was incapable of showing affection. Once, on no particular occasion where a gift was called for (and I got precious few when they were called for), he presented me with a fine cap pistol, a top-of-the-line model that made me the envy of my friends, few of whom were as poor as we were. But the presentation was made with grave warnings that it might have to serve as my Christmas present, admonitions against breaking it,leaving it out in the weather, and with a mitigating &quot;reason&quot; for the gift: It was a tool with which I could scare crows out of the maize field, blackbirds from the tomato patch.Somehow, even then, I saw through his gravity and appreciated, truly appreciated, the cap pistol as an exceedingly generous gift. The power of that gift and my gratitude for it, as unworthy as I was often reminded that I was, is demonstrated by my vivid recollection of the act over a half-century later.Steinbeck would have failed miserably with a story in which Carl Tiflin was an effusively loving father, eager to obtain frequent hugs and insincere expressions of &quot;love&quot; from Jody. He could have welcomed Grandfather into the Tiflin home with open arms. He could have shown some realization that old Gitano at least had some use for the equally useless ancient horse he soon planned to shoot (instead of his rationalizing over the benefit of saving pasture grass). But what kind of story would that have been? Not a Steinbeck, but a touchy-feely piece of crap with a good shot at best-seller status today.Obviously, many contemporary readers don't like The Red Pony. But the vast majority of us who appreciate literature do. A sure sign of the story's worth is that it's still around after all these years. And it'll be around when most of what's written today will be long forgotten.Doug Briggs"},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"I read this book after studying Of Mice and Men for mt English Literature GCSE, and immediately feel in love with this warm, simple novella. It tells the story of Jody, a young boy growing up on an isolated ranch. During the narrative, he has to endure the gamut of emotions - from death through to love and responcibility and respect. The negative responce by most readers (ironically American!) made me quite angry. I can appreciate the widly held criticism of Steinbeck, that &quot;nothing much happens&quot; and the ending is usually predictable, but for me, one of the most beautiful and perceptive aspects of his writing is what isn't said - the subtle implications in the text invites you to dissect and analyse his ides for yourself. This involvement may not be for some people, but, personally, it fully enriches my reading experience. Also, Steinbeck would argue that he isn't writing a novella of suspence, but one about characters. So if you want to think for yourself while revisiting an un-tainted, un-quaint view of childhood, then try this. You never know - it may just grow on you!"},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"While there are other, greater works by Steinbeck, this one combines his disarmingly simple prose style with a number of concepts from his work in the 30s and early 40s. Mainly, the strange and ultimately destructive drive of humans in industrial society (as shown in the 4th story). The rest is a fascinating portrait of a boy's coming-of-age and alienation from his father. maybe people are tired of coming-of-age stories. but that doesn't mean Steinbeck's version isn't well-done."},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"This is considered one of Steinbeck's finest works.The story of young Jody and his life on the family ranch is one in which he meets many tough, harsh realities and learns how to deal with them. The reader might expect something simple and easy here but that is not what is given. Steinbeck's descriptions of character and landscape of life- situation are complex, original and interesting. He gives a picture of a tough, pioneering American world. And in fact the ethic behind the book seems light - years away from much of what we see in our world today.For among the values Jody has to learn are patience, and persistence, and humility before those older and wiser than himself. He understands that there are people who know much more than him and whom he learns from. He shows respect to them. He too in the way he cares for the Red Pony, shows a devotion and enthusiasm which are admirable.He is forced to meet challenges from nature and the world which most young people today do not know anything of.This is an admirable work in which much can be learned from."},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"Here's the thing: I understand that most of you have to read this for school, and that at your age, you're more put out by having to do something than by the book itself. Exloding helicopters do not good literature make. This is a beautiful piece of work about coming of age, of experiencing true love for something other than yourself, losing that love, and dealing with the harshness of that loss. Jody's not put up as some kind of perfect kid, but the book is written to help you recognize his feelings and maybe learn from him. One more thing: unless you're a genius, or have a master's degree in literature, you really can't say anything is a bad example of literature. You just don't know enough to make that claim."},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"HI...I KNOW YOU WERENT LOOKING FOR THIS ,BUT I NEED TO READ THE (RED PONY) ON AOL...DO YOU KNOW WHERE I COULD READ THE BOOK ON AOL?"},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"A one in a lifetime exhilerating boo"},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"I think the red pony is a good book to read because it relates to evry day life.

Honestly, all I remembered was - a little boy, a \\"red pony\\" and a sad story.Jody Tiflin is only 10 year's old when his father surprises him with a pony which he names Giliban. Jody develops a bond and a sense of responsibility with Giliban and then something happens to the pony, which leaves Jody with feelings of sadness, anger and even rage. Jody's trust in Billy Buck, the horse trainer is tested as Billy lead the boy to believe the horse would be okay. Jody takes his anger out by injuring small animals -- this was very hard to read.Believing another colt for Jody might be the answer that will help heal, Jody gets to witness the birthing process, but yet another tragedy occurs, and although the colt survives, Jody seems to have no interest in it.It's a story that reflects life's early heartaches that are experienced by many young, vulnerable children.John Steinbeck's The Red Pony is an incredibly sad coming of age story. It's the kind of story that will leave readers who are looking for a happy ending disappointed, but in classic Steinbeck style it's though provoking and easy to understand why it is a staple in many school curriculum.

The Red Pony is powerfully written stylistically as well. It is a great book"},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"One of my favorite books as a child, I have never forgotten the feelings it stirred in me, deep down, beneath the surface. All of the childhood events most of us experienced as we grew up are there for us to emotionalize with if we are still children when we first read it - or to remember with a new wonder born of nostalgia as we look back on it from the high hill of our adult life, our childhood lying far below in the serene valley we have long since wandered away from and can never return to except through reviving the memory.Steinbeck is noted for his stark moments of insight, and a major one is revealed in the little boy Jody's father through his thoughtless treatment of the aging grandfather, who has really nothing more to live for than looking back into his past. It would be a small thing to allow him to continue to share those priceless - albeit repetitive - memories with his family, especially Jody, who dotes on the grandfather and loves hearing the tales of the old days; but the father, perhaps through overwork or worry in the daily routine of ranch life, has no patience with the old man. One day, he makes his feelings known before he realizes he is being overheard; he is immediately contrite: but heartless words can never be recalled - they are as sharp as razors, as deadly as any form of harsh weaponry, perhaps more so because flesh may heal, but the psyche is forever.The book reads like a mini-series of Masterpiece Theatre. It is broken out into segments, each representing a chapter in the life of the ranch family, centering around the personality of the little boy, Jody. There is much tragedy wending its way throughout, but it is tempered by the sensitive moments described continually- of feeding chickens and playing with dogs, of hot summer days walking home from school on a dusty country road lined with brush, the silence broken only by the sound of birds. It is the excitement and anticipation of birth and anguish of death of a beloved colt - the tenuous world of the animal being held dear by the heart of a child as the world wise adult attempts to make it understood to that child in the best way they can. It is the old Mexican who wearily returns to the place of his birth only to find rejection by strangers rather than the last safe haven he seeks; never to find the solace of old, dear and familiar surroundings to comfort him as his life ends, because too much has changed. In a fitting twist, old Gitano accepts his fate and fades into the hills to die, after \\"appropriating\\" an ancient ranch horse who has seen the end of his useful life too. Together, we know they will be good to one another for as long as it lasts. It is felt and visualized as the pages turn - and I encourage anyone with children to bring it back to them."},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"The Red Pony is a touching story about a boy who learns to care for a pony then loses it.At first I had thought it was a kids story because I had gotten the book from my grandmothers house and it was written inside the cover that it was given to my aunt when she was only ten.

His style of writing is immensely realistic, and yet neither dry nor familiarly journalistic. The stories covered here are only loosely related to each other, and each one of them can be read independently of the others. They center around typical aspects of rural life - taking care of a sick pony, witnessing the birth of a farm animal, dealing with a stranger who intends to stay on the farm without being welcome to do so, and the sudden visit of a relative.Despite their rural setting, the underlying themes that Steinbeck explores are eminently relatable: learning for the first time about life and death, poignantly realizing that adults, despite their best intentions, are not always correct in their predictions, and having the epiphany that most interpersonal relations are not as straightforward and smooth as one might have previously thought. These are universal themes, and aside from the elegant writing style, are the main reason why this book has endured over the ages and become a classic."},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"THE RED PONY is a beautiful and simple classic by John Steinbeck, the great American novelist whose heart always goes out to the oppressed, the misfits, and the distressed.This story is about a young boy, but it provides reading pleasure for adults as well. It is composed of four distinct parts. Part I, \\"The Gift,\\" is the story of Jody and his horse Gabilan. Jody's father is a harsh man, who has difficulty communicating with the boy. In characteristic Steinbeck fashion, the story is filled with tragedy and suffering.Part II, \\"The Great Mountains,\\" relates another episode in the maturation process of Jody. He has an encounter with a old Mexican man passing through his father's farm. Jody is brooding and coming of age. There is an event in this part that takes on special significance for him. The story is rich with symbolism involving nature and animals.Part III, \\"The Promise,\\" is a story of the way a farm boy learned a lesson about reproductive biology. Again there is poignant tragedy.Part IV,\\"The Leader of the People,\\" is a separate story only loosely connected in plot to the other parts, but well-connected in the character development of Jody.When I read THE RED PONY, I found myself despising and pitying Jody's father at the same time. The reader sees the father the way Jody sees him. What really happens in the novella is the emotional and moral maturation of a ten-year-od boy.One of the greatest traits of Steibeck's writing is the way he makes every word carry its way and every turn of the plot count."},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"The Red Pony is a famous book written by John Steinbeck.

Students in the city will probably have a hard time relating but that is the best thing in a novel where it will take you places and times that you don't normally get an experience in."},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"I picked up this little novel last week for a quick read because, \\"it was a thin book and Steinbeck is a good writer\\". Boy was I stupid.My read of The Red Pony reminded me that Steinbeck was one of the greatest novelists of any age, and this small book is a multi-layered treat with so many layers of implication that I am tempted to begin an immediate re-read.The setting is an early 20th century Salinas Valley small ranch. This world is seen through the eyes of the young boy, Jody. The book is comprised of four loosely interlocking stories. It is a feast of observations of nature and people. Both the very good and beautiful, and at times the heart-wrenchingly difficult (nature AND people).Don't count on all \\"feel-good endings\\" here. Rather bittersweet, but one of those books that can make you a wiser person for having read it.Recommended without qulaification."},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"Jody and his family live on a farm where Jody helps take care of the chickens, cows and other things. His father decides that he is old enough to take care of his own horse, and gets him a red pony named Gabilan. After months of taking care of the pony and becoming attached to it, Gabilan becomes ill, and the emotional impact of that effects everything about Jody's view of life and how he deals with loss.I decided to read this because this book, like many of Steinbeck's other books, was mention in the young adult book Steinbeck's Ghost by Lewis Buzbee. I had never read anything by him before, but knew the basics about some of his big ones (East of Eden, Of Mice and Men, and Grapes of Wrath).The Red Pony was very different from any book I have read. A little less than half way through, the pony is no longer in the story and basically we see how Jody deals with his emotions after losing the pony. Then some random life events come into the story, and I am not sure what their point was, except maybe that life goes on.I did enjoy this book because it was different and I didn't know what to expect. I would be interested in reading more Steinbeck because I still don't understand his greatness or what makes his books classics."},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"This short book is comprised of several stories that take place during the formative years of a boy named Jody who is seen growing up on a farm in the countryside close to Salinas, California.A keen observer of human psychology and an even better writer of it, author John Steinbeck can construct complex and life-like characters from a very small number of incidents in someone's life. His style of writing is immensely realistic, and yet neither dry nor familiarly journalistic. The stories covered here are only loosely related to each other, and each one of them can be read independently of the others. They center around typical aspects of rural life - taking care of a sick pony, witnessing the birth of a farm animal, dealing with a stranger who intends to stay on the farm without being welcome to do so, and the sudden visit of a relative.Despite their rural setting, the underlying themes that Steinbeck explores are eminently relatable: learning for the first time about life and death, poignantly realizing that adults, despite their best intentions, are not always correct in their predictions, and having the epiphany that most interpersonal relations are not as straightforward and smooth as one might have previously thought. These are universal themes, and aside from the elegant writing style, are the main reason why this book has endured over the ages and become a classic."},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"For much of my life, I have, despite the enthusiasm for Steinbeck by best friend/hero, avoided reading him, largely because of the negative experience of being forced to read The Pearl in seventh grade. This collection of stories, which all follow a boy on a farm near Salinas, California, were my first foray into his writing as an adult.And it only reinforces my sense that my best friend/hero has good taste. The first story starts off slightly funky: Steinbeck sometimes uses this nonparallel sentence structure that made me stop repeatedly to check for grammatical errors. But then once the story kicks off in earnest such thoughts quickly fall by the wayside.Many of the reviews of this book are insistently negative. Their unifying themes are that (a) being forced to read Steinbeck in school sucks [amen!] and (b) the stories aren't happy/are too gross/are just generally unpleasant. My reaction to point \`b' is that if you're in the mood for escapism, then you probably shouldn't be reading realist fiction.What I especially admire about these stories is their insistence on thwarting conventional expectations. The endings feel right even if not always happy. Realism is lethally boring when it goes wrong (or even when it is simply average), but when it works, like here, you're left with this sense of, \\"Yes, this guy understands life.\\" That's both intensely pleasurable and empowering.And at less than a hundred pages, this book is certainly worth the risk. Even if you dislike it, you won't be out much time. (But I'd say that this is one to get from the library: it's pretty pricey for its slimness.)And the introduction does a good job of putting the story collection into context (both in terms of Steinbeck's own life and American fiction), so if you like the book, it's worth reading afterward. It has the obligatory spoilers, but only a little more than the reviews here.It's also an interesting experiment to read this back to back with Laura Ingalls Wilder's Farmer Boy. The contrast -- and it's pretty much all contrast despite the similarities of the subject matter -- makes the characteristics of each book stand out more sharply.-----------------------------Month later: I just discovered that there's no reason to buy this: these stories are all included in a larger collection of Steinbeck fiction called _The Long Valley_. There are two weak stories but on average, the other stories are slightly better than The Red Pony series. And it's three times as long and only costs 50 percent more."},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"Jody is a young boy whose father buys him a horse.

If you read this, I tell you, you will experience boredom...The novel is a badly written story, and what's worse, it is not always about a red pony, Gabilan, who only makes a appearance in the first chapter, and, shocking, he dies. The book is divided into three chapters, each containing a different story. The first is about a red pony, the second is about a dumb old man, and third, oh jeez! It's about a horse, again!And what's even worse it that this deals with characters dying, because it deals with the seriousness of life and death, and throughout the book, you'll find stories concerning that! First, Gabilan dies (previously, he gets a shocking surgery,his troat gets cut in order to remove some poison), next, the old man wants to die in the place of his birth, and then a horse named Nellie gets pregnant (a surgery is performed).Ta-da! That's the story of the Red Pony, and it isn't even a good one...it is about life and death, but is poorly done...please do NOT read this book, or else you'll suffer hours of boredom!!

An opinion of the book is that the authorneeds to add more action to the book, like Jody meets someone and theypush him around and he has to go to the emergency room because the badfriends hurt him.

The discontinuity is very apparent since Steinbeck (re-)introduces the characters in each chapter. Only in one of the stories we have a red pony, and it's a rather sad story. Don't expect grandeous scenes of a boy riding a horse. 'The Red Pony' concentrates on the usual John Steinbeck theme: the hard life of peasant farmers in 1930s California. He has done much better in 'The Grapes of Wrath', 'East of Eden', and 'The Pearl'.Since the collection of stories comprising of 'The Red Pony' is still less than one hundred pages my book also contains a twenty page short-story by Steinbeck entitled 'Junius Maltby'. Actually this story, about a father and son being impoverished and not realizing until others educate them of it, is nicely done ... very much on the calibre one expects from Steinbeck.Bottom line: certainly not among the better works of John Steinbeck. Not recommended."},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"The Red Pony, notwithstanding ninety pages, ends at a third of the way, and the rest of the novella is basically nothing. The momentum is pretty much dead after the pony dies, and I am like, \\"Now what?\\" Wait a minute...why is this called The Red Pony? That's what I thought the novella was supposed to be all about. All I get is a glimpse of a kid who is a soon-to-be serial killer based on his anger among animals that he comes contact with. Really, who cares about an old man who repeats himself over and over? And who cares about the old paisano that demanded to live in Tiflin's house just because he was born on the land? Honestly, where is the plot? Where is the novella going? Sheesh, I am presented with four disjointed chapters. Why can't John just focus on the first thirty pages and expand it because that was already a winner? I just wanted to get entrapped by the typical Steinbeck language. The Red Pony is quite a lazily written book. All John did was paint pictures of the natural surroundings, throw in useless details about physical features of the characters, and offer useless moments such as where Jody makes inferences from the sound of the boots and then looks down to make sure they are...*gasp* boots! And as always, John never disappoints me...he once again mentions the word of his native town Salinas because, of course, it sounds pretty and brings the Steinbeck flavor to his novella. There is a great loss of growth or depth among the characters when time is suspended and passed on. Kids from Jody's school show up to see the red pony, and then they are forever gone. There is no developing relationship between them and Jody whatsoever afterwards. Whenever Jody and Billy Buck are getting together, there is a feeling that they just met each other for the first time each time. Of horses, Billy Buck sure likes to bash their heads and carve them up, doesn't he? All in all, The Red Pony didn't require much of an effort. Come on...I expected more from the man who actually wrote The Grapes of Wrath and Tortilla Flat. Whatever you do, don't get suckered into the description at the front of the book, \\"The moving and beautiful story of a boy, a sorrel colt and the sun-drenched California earth\\" or at the back of the book, \\"The Red Pony is the story of a boy who dreamed great dreams, of the sorrel colt that was the focus of those...\\"After The Red Pony ended, I was introduced to a random short story called Junius Maltby. My sole question at the end of the story was: \\"So?\\""},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"I read the book THE RED PONY, by John Stienbeck. It's a classic fiction novel. The book explaied about a young boy who grew up and fell in love with this pony and how he over comes a very tradgic loss.A great part is when the father brought home this beautiful red pony. The author used gret detail on the description of the pony. The young boy treated the pony very well and also trained him.I would definetly have to saythat this was a very adventurous book beacause it took you to different places.Another favortie part of mine was when the boy had trained it and trained it so he could ride the pony. But when Thanksgiving came around the pony had become sick . The boy could no longer ride the pony because he was to weak.The boy wanted to do all he could to help it feel better.The rancher on the farm did all he could to help the pony.(HE used to be a rider himself) So he knew how to help the pony. The boy trusted him to help his pony. He slept with him in the barn,ate with him brought him his food and kept him warm.There is just one thing I dont like about the book. The author jumped around alot. HE would go fromthe way something felt to how something looked. I would have liked it better to have known more on the emotions instead of the characteristics.All aroumd though I'm gald that the boy was happy in the end.I would recomend this book to anyone who likes to know about growing up and hard times.Oh also for those people who like to read."},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"This book was very boring. It's hard to understand the plot of life and death and doesn't go into much detail or develop the characters. The book skips around and does not make the chapters connect.

But if you're looking for something that grips you and actually makes want to read farther than chapter one, then read something else like Richard Wright's Native Son.

I found it slightly boring but I can tolerate that. But Jody! He is so mean! Taking salamanders and horned toads and dumping them in his lunch pail and letting them die without water! That's fun??? (I notice little things) And the family! Carl Tiflin is a pretty mean person, too. The only interesting story out of all four chapters is 'The Gift.' Jody is reminiscient of the boy in My Friend Flicka, just a meaner version. In fact, 'The Gift' reminded me of My Friend Flicka. The boy there grows up with a sick horse, too. Two of the other stories didn't make much sense. Jody was just a tiny bit nicer in those. I know this book is supposed to be sixty feet deep, but the theme was very covered up and unoriginal.

The character did not have to fight within himself, he did not have to worry about nature devastating him, and he had no important conflict with any one. i would not recommend this to anyone. afterall, the only thing this book has going for it, is that it is short, so the torture does not last too long."},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"Like so many of Steinbeck's other novels, The Red Pony is full of vivid imagery, raw emotion, and touching themes. However, unlike many of Steinbeck's other works, I found the Red pony to be a very unsatisfying novel. It has wonderful character and plot development, but it dosn't take us anywhere. We are introduced to the Pony, but it dies. Nothing is accomplished by its death. Each chapter of the story finishes like this. The reader is given very little completion at the end of eachc hapter and less at the end of the book. over all, the style was good, the plot development was good, the themes were powerful, but there was nothing to bring it together in the end. Of Mice & Men and The Pearl are both much more enjoyable novellas by Steinbeck."},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"This book is so full of symbols, metaphores, and comparisen to the real world that those who interpret this book as that of sadness and depression will be lost in those feelings. It is true that the pony dies (something quite on the forbidden track as an educational book considering that it should be something leading to a bit more benificial conclusion) and the book mainly talks about how the boy suffers from this loss. But is this all that Steinbeck tells? Isn't telling of a suffering the best way to tell the story of overcoming one? The ending is critiqued mainly because it doesn't tell the reader of how it all ends. Is it a happy ending (than didn't Steinbeck over do a bit on the suffering?) or is it a sad ending? The ending is for us to choose. Unlike other books where the &quot;happily lived ever after&quot; rings in your mind echoing in a hollow way, Steinbeck makes the reader ponder over it. He never says everybody becomes happy because growing out of a childhood(which is the progress this story tells) is not a happy ending... is never! a happy ending in this harsh world. But in the last secene, Steinbeck implies a success, a success of overcoming the loss of the pony and the success of growing out of childhood. After the last lines are read, after the book is closed on someone's lap, it will make them think furiously.. is this a tragic story, or is it a triumphant one. And then they will see a bit of themselves in this story.. and ask: have i succeeded."},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"I loved the book The Red Pony.

Well, if you want all that unrealistic (...), go read Harry Potter for the 20th time. Steinbeck is not talking about California last year, or even last decade. This is a different time, where people weren't so \\"civilized\\" (...). Myself, I prefer \\"over-descriptive\\" language when it helps put me in a time and place that no longer exists. Who else writes about nature and setting better than Steinbeck? I read the \\"Red Pony\\" when I was 12 and \\"The Leader of the People\\" was what inspired me to higher literature and writing. I guess it didn't have all the \\"action\\" of a pokemon cartoon, or a comic book. In real life people don't fly and always win. People and animals die. One day someone you know will die. How will you write about it? People do have \\"angst\\" and (...) things do happen still, to people of all ages. Eventually one must set their feet on the ground and look around and realize that life is most beautiful when you can acknowledge the negative. It is only then is the positive worthwhile and of any weight or value. What (...) are our kids reading nowadays?"},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"I hated The Red Pony when I had to read it for school when I was a kid. But that was also true of some other books that I later came to love (such as Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter) and I have since enjoyed some (though not many) of Steinbeck's other books (particularly Of Mice and Men and East of Eden), so I decided to give it another chance.Now I *loathe* it.My major complaint when I was younger was that the story was disconnected---what happens in one chapter seems to have little or no bearing on the others, or even contradicts them. The eponymous red pony is gone after the first chapter; another pony is born at the end of the third, but makes no appearance in the fourth. It turns out that this is because this isn't really so much a novel as a collection of short stories, which were originally published separately though they feature the same characters.But there is a deeper, thematic, unity to these stories, and that is what I detest about them now. They are all about death. Not just any natural death, either, but particularly horrible deaths. And this is in the context of stories about a young boy on the cusp of manhood; according to Steinbeck, growing up is largely (if not entirely) about learning about death. For Steinbeck, death defines life.Only the fourth story doesn't contain a gleeful depiction of a disgusting death. It centers on a visit from the boy's grandfather, much to the chagrin of the boy's father, who hates his father-in-law's visits because of the old man's tiresomely repeated stories. This is the basis for what could be an amusing story or even a meaningful one, but it is itself incredibly tedious---though it does almost manage to convey an interesting meaning when the boy's grandfather tells him, \\"I tell those stories, but they're not what I want to tell. I only know how I want people to feel when I tell them.\\" But what he goes on to say isn't nearly as profound or interesting as Steinbeck apparently intended it to be, and even if it were it probably wouldn't be enough to redeem the rest of this worthless book. Even Frank Muller's narration of this audio edition couldn't much improve it.Not that death isn't a part of life...but there is more to life than death. But you wouldn't know it by reading The Red Pony."},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"This book is rated poorly only by foolish children bored in English class, who lack even the slightest shred of taste in literature, spending their time fawning over teenage vampires in the Twilight novels or reading whatever drivel hack author Dan Brown has spewed lately."},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"I liked this book because I thought it was about a red pony, but I was wrong.

Jody's grandfather, after being chewed out by Jody's father, is sitting on the porch when he notices a hawk sitting on a dead branch. He realizes that this is what his life is like: stopped. Sorry, there is no money. I just wanted to get your attention. Ha-ha."},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"I've read a lot of John Steinbeck's great literature, but \\"The Red Pony\\" is a little different than any of his other work.The four stories in this novel focus on a young farm boy named Jody. He lives with his parents and his older brother named Billy. On days, his brother goes with his father to do some field work, while he stays home doing household chores and behaving just like any carefree adolescent boy.He has a deep relationship with a red pony named Gabilan who he has no trouble socializing with. But when an vicious rainstorm come, the two are bought in a wave of emotions and throughout these four stories, Jody's personality changes as well as the boy he is.The novel is definitely not as memorable or groundbreaking as \\"East of Eden\\" and \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\", but \\"TRP\\" is still something that Steinbeck readers should discover and others can take their chance. It starts off well and throughout the novel, it goes a little bumpy. But it's a nice tale of a growing farmboy and shows us the theme of grief and death in a small novel.Final Verdict: A less memorable tale from Steinbeck that still has heart and spirit."},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"The TITULAR CHARACTER, the red pony DIES 40 pages in!!!! It's basically the same depressing Steinbeck style of writing, but this is the worst I have ever read from him."},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"I'll admit that I have sort of been of two minds on The Red Pony.You see, I was often pretty bored reading it. Not quite all of it, I guess. There were some really striking moments, such as the startling image at ending of the opening story and the gentle humor of the final story. But for long stretches, the storytelling was dry and predictable. It was a short book, so such long stretches were a bit of a problem. I can see why so many high school students have considered this a tedious read over the years.My first impression of The Red Pony, however, wasn't the end of my reading experience. I finished the book one night, and during the next couple of days, I was driving alone for long stretches. And the book really stuck with me. Evidently, it hadn't been boring enough for me to forget it. As I reflected back on the stories, I was struck by the subtle wisdom of the book. How many books so well depict the longings and fears and frustrations of childhood? And, of course, it's not just about childhood. It works as a meaningful adult fable about how to live this strange existence when we're vaguely aware of our approaching deaths and don't know quite what to do until we get there. What does it mean to live lives in which dignity and meaning and hope are present? The Red Pony, it seems to me, takes some steps toward answering those questions.So, ultimately, I do find it to be a worthwhile book, even though I doubt I'll be reading it again any time soon. It's not Steinbeck's finest; he was still working things out. But I'm glad I read it."},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"I read this book in the summer after 7th grade (I'm 21 now) after having read The Pearl in school that year. The Pearl is by far Steinbeck's worst work--a terrible introduction to his material. As you can imagine, I dreaded reading The Red Pony. And I hated it while I read it.After I finished it, however, something clicked. The Red Pony is important because it's about growing up. It's about each and every one of us at that age. It's about coming face-to-face with reality, hardships, while at the same time wishing we were still young enough to pretend. It's about that point in your life when you're too old for the Kiddie Coaster but too young for the rides at Six Flags.As someone who can't understand why anyone would want to rush through youth and grow up faster than they're supposed to, I can deeply sympathize with this book. This book was important when I was at that age, and is even more important today, where ten year old girls try to dress and act like twenty year old supermodels and singers.This book is about the insecurity felt at the ages of 10-13; you know you have to grow up, it's inevitable, but how do you do it? When do you start to do it? And why do it sooner than you have to? Why are all your friends in such a big rush to do it?That is precisely why this book is given to children."},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"A word of warning to those who would read this book: this book (along with almost every other book Steinbeck has written) is not to be taken lightly. It holds nothing back, and some sections are downright disgusting. All this aside, I give you my review.I am an avid reader in the 10th grade, I enjoy reading classic novels more than almost anything else. Such books as 1984, Animal Farm, A Clockwork Orange, Of Mice and Men, To Kill a Mockingbird, The Rainbow, Things Fall Apart and Night are my favorites. This book, is downright gorgeous. The words flow together so perfectly that it reads like poetry. Even without the deep meaning of the simple story, it is a fantastic book to read.The Red Pony follows a young boy who lives on a farm before cars and industrialization. This boy is amazingly disciplined and follows the rule of his father(a man who abhors weakness) and is given a red pony as a gift from his father. The boy immediatly falls in love with the horse and feels immense pride in the beast. Unfortunatly, the horse falls very ill due to the mistake of a friend, and eventually dies a particularly gruesome death.This is the background, but the real story begins hear. Now the book chronicals the boy's life after dealing with the loss of someone so near to him, and his struggle to find a way to cope with it. This is a great book to read with an educated friend so you can discuss the true beauty and meaning of Steinbeck's genius.One final tip for reading this book: Try to find an older copy of the book. I read one that was made a long ago, the texture of the fibers in the paper and the leather binding makes the book so much more enjoyable to read, because it really is an aesthetic book, bringing a warmth across your body as you delve into the amazing word choice and sentence structure."},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"As I read through the list of reviews, I was surprised to find so many people who were so adamently against this work. The general trend seemed to be that they were forced to read it for school. Perhaps there is a connection. I did not have to read it for school, I read it on my own as a lover of Steinbeck and I was happily surprised after reading all of these reviews. It's very short, an extremely quick read. It doesn't drudge on and there are some very interesting themes. It is one of Steinbeck's important works and it should not be cast aside simply on account of the protagonist's name or the fact that it is read in schools. If you want a fast read by Steinbeck, pick up this book and decide for yourself. Perhaps if you are not under such pressure to read it, you might actually enjoy it."},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"As a piece of literature, for an older reader, 30 years later I can admit it has merit.The problem is that because it's a \\"classic\\", it tends to be on school reading lists. And because the title is \\"The Red Pony,\\" naturally teachers (or parents, or students themselves) recommend it to readers interested in horses. This happens especially because there are few if any animal books on the standard \\"great books\\" lists.For a student of 16 or 17, this might be fine.I read it at the age of 9.For a 9 year old, this story is too graphic, too traumatic, too nasty for its nuance or lessons to be appreciated. It left me angry and in tears, especially horrible as some cruel joke that the only way an animal-oriented book could be on the reading list was to have the pony die a terrible death and then for the boy to have to watch the pony's eyes plucked out and eaten by vultures. As my revenge I absolutely refused to touch another Steinbeck book for 20 years.Don't let this happen to your kids. Introduce them to Steinbeck via one of his other works, and wait on this one until they are older."},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"This is Steinbeck's ninth novel or more accurately a novella. The writing is exceptional and it must be ranked among his best, but it is short and cannot be compared with his best known novel \\"Grapes of Wrath.\\" It is almost as good as his other famous novella \\"Of Mice and Men,\\" which was his first novel. However, \\"The Red Pony\\" lacks a cohesive story so some might not like it. I have read most of his works including the present, which is an interesting and a must read for Steinbeck fans. It has interesting prose and good drama, and it is very well written. I would rank it just below \\"Cannery Row\\" and \\"The Moon is Down.\\" It is better than \\"The Pearl\\" or \\"Tortilla Flat\\" in my opinion - based on the writing.It is set in northern and rural California and it is about a young boy living on a farm. It describes his relationship with his father, the hired hand, and his mother. The plot centers on various animals and the boy including a red pony.John Steinbeck (1902 - 1968) was among the best known American writers of the 20th century. He won the 1962 Nobel Prize for literature. His 1939 Pulitzer Prize winning novel, \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" has over ten million copies in print.Steinbeck was born in rural California, went to Stanford, and spent most of his life in California. He has been associated with the plight of farm workers and others. His books have been very popular and many were made into movies and stage productions. He won an Academy Award nomination for best story in 1944.I have read a number of his novels and am still surprised with the quality of his work - especially his short stories and short novels. The present work is short and probably ranks among the middle of his 17 novels and novellas. Readers will appreciate the clarity of the prose even if the plot is not strong.It is not a heavy read and takes one evenings to read. I liked the book and give it a positive recommendation, and it would be high on my list of Steinbeck novels.As a suggestion, do not buy the book alone, but rather would buy it as part of a collection such as Steinbeck's book: \\"The Short Novels of John Steinbeck,\\" from Viking Press in 1953, and updated versions of that book."},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"The Red Pony starts out with a boy named Jody. Jody loves horses so his dad Billy Buck bought him a horse at an auction. The horse's name is Gabilan. Jody trains Gabilan and Gabilan starts to like Jody. One day Gabilan gets through the gates of the barn during a storm and gets sick. If you want to find out what happens next you have to read this book. The author of this book is John Steinbeck. Some of the characters in this book are Jody, Billy Buck, Gabilan, and more.The message of this story is to always fight for what you love. I think this because Jody always in the story fought for what he loved. Also the tone of this story is sad, and a little bit happy.The author did a very good job with the details. The reason why he did the details good is because he describes how people talk. John stienbeck als did a good job with bringing new characters into the story, like when a native american goes to Jody's house.This book is a very good book. It is very suspesful in the beginning of it, but toward the end of it starts to get boring. If you like sad boks then you should read this bookByNick of Pacifica"},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"I was shocked to see that the majority of these reviews on one of the most moving and thought-provoking classics were negative! This is a book about a boy growing to maturity, not about some red pony! To those who say we've too many books with this theme (and there are a lot of you), I say take a good look at this book, maybe get some help from someone on a higher intellectual level, and you'll realize that it's never been done more beautifully. John Steinbeck is a genius, and if you cannot learn something from one of his books, you've got the problem."},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"I first picked up this book as a child, thinking it would be another great horse story. Although it does have merit as a novel, this is not a book for a child, especially one who loves horses. The death of the pony is horrific and traumatic and thinking about the book still gives me a very unpleasant feeling, even 20 years later. This book is not in the same category as other 'sad' children's books - The Yearling, Old Yeller, Black Gold - which made me cry (a lot!) but I still enjoyed. Please, don't give this book to your horse-mad child."},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"The Red Pony is an episodic novella. Young Jody Tiflin lives on a farm in the Salinas Valley of California with his father, named Carl, his mother, their hired hand Billy Buck, and his dogs, Doubletree Mutt and Smasher, along with cats, horses, and other animals. In the main story, Jody's father gives him a red pony which he names Gabilan after the nearby mountains. He forges a special bond with the hot-tempered horse, tending and training it in anticipation of the day he can ride. But when Gabilan falls ill, will the pony survive? And what will Jody do? It was made into a 1949 motion picture of the same name starring Myrna Loy, Robert Mitchum, and child actor Peter Miles, with music composed by Aaron Copland.The four chapters were originally published as short stories in magazines from 1933 to 1937. The first chapter, \\"The Gift,\\" first appeared in the Nov., 1933, issue of North American Review. The second chapter, \\"The Great Mountains,\\" about Gitano, an old man who comes to die at the Tiflin ranch, first appeared in the Dec., 1933, issue of North American Review. The fourth chapter, \\"The Leader of the People,\\" about Mrs. Tiflin's father, who has a history of crossing the Oregon Trail and enjoys telling stories about his experiences, first appeared in the Aug., 1936, issue of Argosy. And the third chapter, \\"The Promise,\\" about Jody's receiving another promised colt, first appeared in the Oct., 1937, issue of Harper's Monthly. They were put together as a book in either 1937 or 1945. Some editions of the book also include a short story titled \\"Junius Maltby,\\" taken from one of Steinbeck's earlier works, The Pastures of Heaven, but this is omitted in the edition published by Penguin Books. I had read Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men in high school and did not like it. I have seen portions of the movie version of his The Grapes of Wrath and did not care for it either. Yet a lot of folks said that The Red Pony is different.Perhaps it is, but only in degree, not in kind. It still has that \\"life's a bummer, then you die\\" sort of pessimism characteristic of Steinbeck. We did this as a family read aloud and did not mind the death and disappointment because these things are part of life. What was absent, however, was any feeling of comfort or hope for the future. The reaction of rock musician Eric Clapton is interesting. He complained that \\"the book just made me want to commit suicide. The Red Pony, I could not believe this book. It broke my heart, and I thought there is no happy ending to anything.\\" After doing some research to see why an author would write about a story like this, Clapton criticized those types of authors by saying that they are \\"alcoholic, damaged people with a poisoned viewpoint on life\\" and added that \\"as much as it was incredibly exciting and death-defying to read, it was not necessarily very good for the growth of one's spirit.\\" I never thought that I'd agree with a rock star! In addition, there are references to drinking brandy and Jody's lying. In one scene, Jody is upset and shows a very cruel streak toward animals. Also the \\"h\\" and \\"d\\" words are used occasionally, once by Jody himself and another time with the name of \\"God\\" before the \\"d,\\" and the name of Jesus Christ is used a couple of times as an exclamation, so I had some editing to do. It is an interesting story, but I cannot say that I was overly fond of it."},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"Do they really assign this in school as much as it appears from the comments I'm reading here? \\"The Red Pony\\" is short, and written in a style readily grasped by bright adolescents, but like so much of Steinbeck, it's so dire that it seems a form of abuse shoving it into young minds.Not that I'm a hater. No, I found \\"The Red Pony\\" to be a vivid and bracing account of growing up on a California ranch just a decade or so after the closing of the American frontier. John Steinbeck sets you down in the Salinas Valley so firmly you can hear the water running down the sagebrush line to the mossy tub which young Jody, the boy at the center of things here, drinks from in idle moments of contemplation.Being there is one thing. Wanting to be there is another. Steinbeck published this in 1933, early in a career devoted to expressing life's harshest truths, and \\"The Red Pony\\" serves as a valid calling card that way. Nothing that happens in \\"The Red Pony\\" can be said to be pleasant, from the whiffletree hanging from a branch that is used to slaughter pigs to the fate of small creatures little Jody is able to get his hands on when in a foul mood. Steinbeck draws a lot of power from his accounts of the natural world, but in his hands it's always a raw, mean thing.The story is limited in other ways, too. The novel presents few characters besides Jody. His father is a gruff type, thoughtful enough to buy his son a pony but snorting \\"I don't like trick horses\\" when Jody begins to train the animal. Mother is quiet, shortly reminding Jody of his chores but often capable of kindness.There's only one ranch hand on this ranch, Billy Buck, a thoughtful, hard-working man who seems to do most of Jody's raising and also handles the horses on the ranch, with mixed results. He seems the conduit for Steinbeck's take on life.At one point in the book, Jody's planning to kill some mice in a haystack. \\"I'll bet they're fat,\\" he says. \\"I'll bet they don't know what's going to happen to them today.\\"\\"No, nor you either, nor me, nor anyone,\\" Billy answers.There's also an old wandering paisano and a windy grandfather, who make extended separate cameos in sections that serve as reprieves from the harshest sections of Steinbeck's narrative only in that the focus is thankfully off horses.Small a cast as that is, Steinbeck doesn't exact weave them together masterfully. Told in four chapters, the book works more as a collection of four short stories, each of which present another of life's hard truths brought home to young Jody. You have to work harder than Steinbeck did in order to connect them. It's a major failing; one expects more cohesiveness in a book this small.Yet saying this is a bad book simply because it is short or confused or unpleasant is not right. Unlike other Steinbeck books I can name (\\"The Pearl\\"), the moments of tragedy have a real lived-in feeling to them, and a sensibility that belies their apparent randomness. Looking at Jody, one sees the development of a mindset that had its expression in the body of Steinbeck's work, a corpus that commands enduring respect.I just wouldn't force it on a young person. Let them pick it up or not on their own. Otherwise you'll just get a lot more hostile one-star reviews on Amazon.com."},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"This book is so full of symbols, metaphores, and comparisen to the real world that those who interpret this book as that of sadness and depression will be lost in those feelings. It is true that the pony dies (something quite on the forbidden track as an educational book considering that it should be something leading to a bit more benificial conclusion) and the book mainly talks about how the boy suffers from this loss. But is this all that Steinbeck tells? Isn't telling of a suffering the best way to tell the story of overcoming one? The ending is critiqued mainly because it doesn't tell the reader of how it all ends. Is it a happy ending (than didn't Steinbeck over do a bit on the suffering?) or is it a sad ending? The ending is for us to choose. Unlike other books where the &quot;happily lived ever after&quot; rings in your mind echoing in a hollow way, Steinbeck makes the reader ponder over it. He never says everybody becomes happy because growing out of a childhood(which is the progress this story tells) is not a happy ending... is never! a happy ending in this harsh world. But in the last secene, Steinbeck implies a success, a success of overcoming the loss of the pony and the success of growing out of childhood. After the last lines are read, after the book is closed on someone's lap, it will make them think furiously.. is this a tragic story, or is it a triumphant one. And then they will see a bit of themselves in this story.. and ask: have i succeeded."},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"In the story,&quot; The Red Pony&quot; which was written by John Steinbeck was written in four different stories. These stories consisted of parts. The main character of the book is a boy named Jody Tiflin. He is a boy who lives on a ranch with his family. Also another main characteris a man named Billy Buck who works on the ranch. Billy is a very kind person who teaches Jody many things about all of the horses.Throughout the four difernent stories Jody learns to do many things with horses including watching them progress and watching them go through various difficult things. He also learnes various leasons about how his father treats outsiders and even his own family. Thoughout the story Jody and Billy gain trust and lose it, they become very close though trust.When I was reading this book I had mixed reactions toward it. In certian parts of the book there was alot of action while in other parts it was very slow. But overall the book was very entertaining and gave me a good idea of what a boy has to do to take care of a horse, alot of work and determination.In conclusion, I strongly suggest you go out and read this book, it has a very strong theme and plot. I really enjoyed reading this book and I encourage you to go out a reed this book."},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"The Red Pony I thought was one of Steinbeck's better books. The book was an easy enjoyable read, and one filled with great meaning and symbolism. There is great detail in this story about the horse's sickness, which frankly made me sick, and that is the only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5. Otherwise it is an excellent book, coming from an excellent author. Give it a read."},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"I had to read this in school as a kid. The actual writing talent here is great but the subject matter is really depressing. I think a good story should have a nice balance of good/bad events. Steinbeck has none of that in this book. The Red Pony is just one dark cloud of doom throghout the entire book. Things go from bad to worse as the little boy's dreams are shattered. Some parts of it are also needlessly gross and bloody and I must admit that as a kid I was a little emotionally scarred from it! The book goes ubruptly to a totally different and unrelated story. As an adult I know it's meant to serve as some sort of metaphor but I still don't like this book and think it's a pointless read unless you want to be depressed or have a thing for tragic stories. I know it's supposed to be a classic, the problem is I don't know WHY! Some readers say \\"this is a great book for readers of all ages\\" but I would have to disagree! I don't think this is a kids book. I don't think kids should be forced to read this at school and I don't think I would ever read it again."},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"Ok... First of all I rate this book 4.5 stars but rounding up it is 5 stars so thats what I will put.I did love this book, but it did have some flaws at the end.

I did like Of Mice and Men a bit better then This but they are both good, Read both they both get a 2 thumbs up and 5 stars..sorry this review doesn't give you much info and it may not seem hlpful and I agree it sucks but I just encourage you to read this book and after you read my reeview read the others they are much better then mine..

I know that in life you have to deal with death and loss but the boy in this book went through way to much death. It is Highly unlikely that anyone will have so many trajic events so close together. I know that Mr. Stienbecks mother was dieing when he wrote this book but that would give him all the more reason to write a cheery book without death and depression! I know that many love this book but being a horse enthusiest and rider for 20 years I find the treatment of the ponies in this book cruel and unlikely. If a horse has strangles you should put it out of it's misery especially if it has progressed to the stage that it can not breath through it's nostrils and must depend on a hole in it's throat. That is why I despise this book."},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"This book is not worth the paper it's printed on. The climax of the story, if you call it a climax, happens around the middle of the first chapter. And guess what happens in the rest of the book? Nothing, just imagry, metaphors, and wierd stuff that makes you think &quot; why do I care?&quot; Since Steinbeck's mother died around the time, all it was about was death, death, and imagery of death, and the deathes make you think &quot; gook riddence!&quot; Don't buy this book. It's aweful beyond words."},{"Title":"Red Pony Hb (New Windmill)","review":"I read this book recently and really, it must be one of those books that the intellectuals (college professors and such) study to turn what is actually not that great of a book into a \\"study of inner human character\\" or whatnot. I guess it must be a fairly good example of that, but as a book? It sucks.Let me go over the chapters here. There are four of them; \\"The Gift,\\" \\"The Great Mountains,\\" \\"The Promise,\\" and \\"The Leader of the People.\\" The first one is the only one actually featuring a red pony. It's not much of a story. Boy gets pony, boy cares for pony, boy leaves pony out in rain, pony dies. Cue sadness. The second chapter is about a Mexican that tries to leech off the ranch because he was \\"born there.\\" Riight. The third chapter is about Jody (the main character) caring for a mare named Nellie. That's actually about it. And then the fourth chapter is about Jody's grandfather visiting and telling stories about going out west. Then Jody's father gets angry at him, and... again that's about it.I recommend an book with an actual plot.

The accuracy and depth of the historical reconstruction give a keen insight into the times of italian Renaissance, providing an extraordinary and original portrait of the great genius and his lonely wanderings through late 15th century Italy. The insight the author manages to give on the artistic and scientific thought of Leonardo are unique, and rival any scientific text.

The how and why of Savonorola is fascinating. Leonardo is given as an example of self-containment in a world of contradictions and abasements.

There's a tree right outside my window. It looks like a tree, seen one seen all of them. But Ansel Adams didn't just see a tree.Sure he saw a tree. But he also saw its shape, the texture of its bark, it's setting, perhaps the brook flowing by, or the mist or the clouds, maybe the mountain in the background. And the timing. This picture has the sun directly behind the trunk of the tree so it's almost just an outline. That picture was taken at dawn so the light would be just so, and the mist not quite gone. This grove of trees are all tall and straight, that single Jeffrey Pine growing out of the rocks in Yosemite is twisted and deformed by the wind.You know what to expect of an Ansel Adams book.

Born in 1937 in Canada and raised in a mainline protestant denomination, he converted to evangelicalism of the Reformed Baptist variety. In his early works (1967-1971) he defended biblical inerrancy against attempts to limit the Bible's truthfulness to spiritual matters. By the mid-1970s (if not earlier) Pinnock's views started evolving. He embraced Arminianism and the Charismatic movement. In 1984 he published THE SCRIPTURE PRINCIPLE, in which he rejected the strict view of inerrancy he had previously advocated. By 1992 he was advocating annihilationism (the belief that the impenitent will be destroyed rather than condemned to eternal punishment). Not content with these changes he turned his attention to the doctrine of God, contributing an important essay to the 1994 collection THE OPENNESS OF GOD. There Pinnock advocated \\"open theism.\\" Open theism (also called free-will theism) rejects the classical conception of God in favor of something roughly between process theism and classical theism. Although Pinnock has always considered himself an evangelical, some haven't hesitated in calling the \\"later Pinnock\\" a heretic. In 2002 some members of the Evangelical Theological Society sought to expel him. After Pinnock \\"clarified\\" his views on inerrancy, the ETS voted to retain him.SET FORTH YOUR CASE is one of Pinnock's first books. The subtitle is \\"studies in Christian apologetics.\\" Pinnock's approach appears to be a combination of John W. Montgomery style \\"evidentialism\\" and Francis Schaeffer style cultural criticism. The chapters are quite short and the ideas are a bit dated. At the same time, it is a good representative of a certain type of \\"rationalistic\\" apologetics that has always been popular. It's quite comprehensive as well, with interesting discussions of biblical inspiration, contemporary literature, and the cultural milieu of the sixties.Pinnock has written another book of apologetics, A CASE FOR FAITH (also published as REASON ENOUGH) which represents the \\"mid-Pinnock\\" approach, which is more \\"person centered.\\""},{"Title":"Stray Dog Story: An Adventure in Ten Scenes","review":"I produced and directed the Los Angeles Premiere of this play in 1998 and it ran for 14 weeks instead of the original six. A big hit.It is a poignant look at how humans treat each other and how we are kinder to dogs than we are to humans.It concerns John who wishes his dog Buddy were a human being because Buddy would make the perfect lover. Poof! The Fairy Dog Mother makes it so.But when John gets murdered--Buddy the dog is left to fend for himself as a gay man in New York City. It is a funny black comedy by Robert Chesley who also wrote the very successful Jerker. This play, as we found out in its Los Angeles run is an undiscovered classic.David Goldyn"},{"Title":"Stray Dog Story: An Adventure in Ten Scenes","review":"\\"Stray Dog Story\\" starts Robert Chesley's career as a mature playwright. Subtitled \\"An Adventure in Ten Scenes,\\" it develops as a series of picaresque episodes on New York's mean streets. Characters flood the play, with actors double-cast in the ten scenes. Four characters, however, provide continuity: Buddy, a dog transformed into a man at the wish of his master; Jon, killed immediately thereafter by gaybashers who leave Buddy unable to fend for himself; Brett, an upwardly-mobile gay man who picks Buddy up, tries and then fails to help him; and a Bag Lady, who appears in several scenes and shows Buddy kindness on Christmas Eve, just before his death, at which point he reunites with the spirit of Jon. Other characters include a \\"Fairy Dog Mother\\" who transforms Buddy into a man; a thief who steals Jon's money before Buddy realizes he will go hungry without it; Tom, a gay activist at a public protest who first befriends Buddy, then turns against him when Buddy howls like a dog; and Dondi, a transvestite prostitute who tries to help Buddy until policemen assault and arrest her. It is no surprise to see gaybashers, policemen and a thief victimize Buddy; however, it is hard to watch Brett abandoning Buddy on the street, and a gay rights demonstrator kicking Buddy as the group marches off. Chesley's skeptical view of supposed community comes clear in such acts of betrayal. In the last scene Brett leaves a warm restaurant with his latest trick, while Buddy hides behind garbage cans starving to death. Buddy's reunion with his dead lover is heartbreaking, simultaneously pathetic and beautiful. Buddy carries the soul theme in this play, and the inability of other characters to recognize his soul indicts their humanity while forcing audience members to confront their own capacity to reach out to a person in need."},{"Title":"The Ends of the Earth: A Journey at the Dawn of the Twenty-first Century","review":"I want to express my deeper admiration to this work, that I consider extremely clarifying on the situation of the Third World.

I'm not trying to pushadditional Amazon.com business to you but I really thinkit will be illuminating to read this book together with JimRogers' Investment Biker and V. S.

Kaplan's point that increasingparts of the world will gradually devolve into non-nationstatehood as maps get redrawn and tribal and/or racialantagonisms suppressed by the nation state reappears, is adistubring but nevertheless real one. I recommendInvestment Biker because Kaplan's journey takes placeseveral years after Rogers', and the reader can check forhimself that the devolution has progressed rather thanarrested during the ensuing time. Naipaul's India, on theother hand, with its parallels to Kaplan's portrayal ofPakistan provides a more on-the-spot and intimate surveyof such a devolution happening. The devolution in India,of course, is much more controlled than that in parts ofthe world that Kaplan has written in this book.

Unfortunately, he fell victim to the debunked theories of Malthus and depends on as best very questionable and at worse totally false &quot;scientific facts&quot; from sources such as Cheryl Simon Silver. This work cries out that the human race is too ignorant to learn, adapt, and survive. History has proven otherwise and will continue to do so."},{"Title":"The Ends of the Earth: A Journey at the Dawn of the Twenty-first Century","review":"Kaplan is a good writer and creates a strong sense of fear and concern for the reader. He is an intrepid travel who can weave a fantastic story and enthrall the reader. But his talent for writing can also distract the reader. Between the lines one can see that he is taking liberties with facts and inflating single incidents into general conclusions. For example, he will take comments from street vendors in Cairo and make a vast, general conclusion about the state of the country. He also has a terrible habit of generalizing societies and reverting to now much-maligned 'orientalist'writers to support his case. One of the more embarassing moments in this book is when he discusses 'oriental despotism' and uses texts to talk about the unique nature of 'oriental' totalitarianism and its particularly abusing ways of managing society and oppressing people. This from a man who comes from a culture that slaugheter over 22 million humans in world wars, and a country that dropped atomic bombs on civilian populations, murdered millions in Indochina and other unmentionable acts. Is oriental despotism really that unique? Have we forgotten the colonial empires in Latin America, Congo and the rest of Africa, the slave trade etc. etc.. Can anyone really sit and claim that oriental despotism was more/less despotic that what the Occident demonstrated? Amusing to hear him talk about the unique nature of oriental oppression and totalitarianism. These are old racist ideas in not even new guises. A sensitive read will quickly find these tendencies annoying, but I think that most general readers will actually think that they are benefiting from such writers and books. That is sad, because people like Kaplan, who continue to focus on the small differences rather than the larger commonalities between societies and peoples, will continue to create dialogues in their societies that mislead and scare rather than inform and explain"},{"Title":"Clear the Confederate Way! The Irish in the Army of Northern Virginia","review":"This is bound to be a controversial book, because it says what a lot of today's Americans of Irish descent would like to brush under the rug: That yes, there *were* Irish Confederates, and that they were committed officers and soldiers, passionate in their reasons for fighting for the South.This book puts Irish participation in the Civil War in its proper historic context. At the time, the Irish who lived in the North were the victims of the worst kind of bigotry--they were systematically cut out of employment opportunities and otherwise damaged by a nasty, nativist, &quot;Know Nothing&quot; campaign against immigrants. In the South, many Irish were also near the bottom of the socioeconomic scale, but they were not loathed just for their Irishness, and there they had a chance to better themselves.The book also makes the point that for the Irish on both sides, the war was not about slavery or racial bigotry. Irish Union soldiers weren't abolitionist liberators. Many were swept into the Irish Brigade by the charming harangues of their homeland hero Thomas F. Meagher. Others were simply trying to assimilate into their new country or were fighting because they couldn't get out of it. Irish Confederate soldiers were mostly non-slaveholders who fought *not* to support the peculiar institution but because they believed the mostly agrarian South (like agrarian Ireland at the time) should be self-governed, not dominated by puritanical Northern industrialists (who seemed an awful lot like the puritanical English industrialists).The author convincingly builds these points and then tells the rest of the Confederate Irish story, battle by battle and officer by officer. This book is a thoroughly researched, interesting and well-written work of Civil War scholarship that actually finds something new to say about a much-rehashed war."},{"Title":"Clear the Confederate Way! The Irish in the Army of Northern Virginia","review":"A wonderfully researched and accessable book on a frequently overlooked aspect of the Civil War.This book is especially useful in examining the myths that have arisen around Irish particpation in the war (generally centered around the Union Irish brigade) and puts the role of the sons of Erin into perspective."},{"Title":"Clear the Confederate Way! The Irish in the Army of Northern Virginia","review":"This history of the Irish in the army of Robert E. Lee is valuable, if only because the topic has been so little explored. In fact, the ambiguous loyalties of the Irish during the Civil War were covered up in the past by Irish Americans keen on garnering support for Irish independence by playing up Irish participation in the Union Army.Irish in the South were staunch supporters of the Confederacy, for a variety of reasons. Catholics and Jews were more accepted in the South than the North, probably because their common whiteness was more important than any denominational differences from their Protestant neighbors. The Catholic Church was soft on slavery in general, and prominent bishops and lay Catholics in the South were vocal supporters of the peculiar institution. For example, Supreme Court Justice Roger Taney, author of the loathsome Dred Scott decision, was a good Maryland Catholic. The average Irish labourer, North and South, dreaded the potential competition for low wage jobs that would arise from emancipation. Irish intellectuals, such as the rebel John Mitchel, sympathisized with the South as a weak, agrarian underdog trying to free itself from the domination of a ruthless, capitalistic, imperialistic Yankee/Puritan juggernaut, thereby recasting the war as a variation of the ancient Anglo-Irish struggle. Mitchel also rationalized the institution of slavery as humane, compared to the prevailing feudal system in Ireland which had allowed the starvation of millions.The lot of the Irish soldier in Lee's army was as bad as his Northern counterpart. Confederate officers seem to have been as profligate of the lives of their Irish soldiery as their Northern counterparts, although the grim butchery of the Civil War knew no ethnic boundaries.O'Grady is particularly insightful on the battle of Fredericksburg, debunking the many myths which have arisen regarding the Union Irish Brigade and its less than heroic commander, General Thomas Meagher.Despite its many strengths, O'Grady's book does have serious flaws. The narrative tends to break down into a somewhat dull retelling of the individual careers of Irish Confederates. There are a few odd digressions. Notably, O'Grady gushes at length in praise of the narcoleptic, semi-sane Stonewall Jackson in tones more suited to an infatuated schoolgirl than a dispassionate historian, for no particular reason, except perhaps for Jackson's distant Ulster ancestry."},{"Title":"The Pursuit of the Well-Beloved and The Well-Beloved (Penguin Classics)","review":"This novel, which depicts a young man's lifelong search for the feminine Ideal, represents the latter end of Hardy's literary output, as he was turning to the poetic genre. First appearing in serialized form in the London News in 1892, this story was written between Tess and Jude. By the time it assumed final book form in 1897 it had undergone extensive revision. It is the heart-wrenching story of a passive native of the Isle of the Slingers, just south of London (accessible via a railroad causeway.) The three major sections of the novel are chronologically spaced twenty years apart, featuring the protagonist at 20, 40 and at 60. Young Jocelyn Pierston courts Avice of the Isle, but her delicate refusal to meet him one night on the beach inadvertently precipitates his flight with another young woman, whom he was courteously trying to help in a storm. The plot offers frequent instances of coincidence, bad timing, and poor choices causing inevitable misunderstanding. Fate seems to provide the wrong mate at crucial junctures in his life, and that of the three women he courts. It is almostridiculous and pathetic that Pierson attempts to marry the daughter (and even the granddaughter) of the woman to whom he first spontaneously proposed. There are distinct undercurrents interwoven in THE WELL BELOVED as well: the bond between the sculptor's Hands, striving to recreate in stone the perfection which his Heart desperately seeks in various female forms. There is also the interplay of Rock: the granite island, his artistic medium and his steadfast determination to seek the Ideal Woman for the rest of his days versus Water: Ocean water which tirelessly seeks to reduce the granite to pebbles, salty straits which provide a psychological barrier between islander and mainlander; Well water so crucial to village life; and lastly the Tears of a woman abandoned, guilty of selfishness or wed to a battering husband. This Native often returns to hisisland home, to find surprising changes on the Isle of quarries and masons, yet he is perplexed to discover that some things are timeless. He has achieved artistic recognition as evidenced by being named an Academician, yet he privately is tortured by the Curse (his deepest secret) of his all-consuming quest for the Ideal. The only way Pierston can be freed of 40 years of bondage to heartache is to accept the fact that he has lost all chances of claming an Avice as his bride. Unfortunately this emotional freedom is purchased at the cost of his talent. Will he merely fade into the granite twilight of his native isle, a sadder but wiser old man who recognizes his physical limitations and accepts the ravages of time? A thought-provoking read, lightly based on the author's own situation, concerning the eternal yearnings of the human heart."},{"Title":"The Pursuit of the Well-Beloved and The Well-Beloved (Penguin Classics)","review":"Hardy has essentially written the same story twice here, with a few significant variations in the second version. This makes for a rather peculiar experience, as the reader will encounter identical passages in both versions. Nevertheless, I am haunted by this work and the insights it supplied. It explores the life of a man tormented by desire for an ideal love. Much to his chagrin, the ideal (referred to as the well-beloved) inhabits the bodies of a series of women, and never for long. He lives his life in anguished pursuit. What is truly upsetting is his total reliance on physical attributes, which becomes a source of humiliation as his life progresses. Hardy helped me understand how men approach women in a way no other writer has had the courage to explain. Once again, I am overwhelmed by his brutal honesty and unrelenting power. He will force you to open your eyes."},{"Title":"The Pursuit of the Well-Beloved and The Well-Beloved (Penguin Classics)","review":"The Pursuit of the Well Beloved was a serial published by the prolific pen of England's famed Thomas Hardy (1840-1928). The short serialized novel was published in the London Illustrated News beginning on October 1, 1892. The novel was extensively revised by Hardy. Retitled \\"The Well-Beloved\\" the new novel appeared in 1897. He had completed the much better classic\\"Jude the Obscure\\" in 1895-1896 before finishing this final printed novel. Thereafter, Hardy would return to the lyric poetry which was his first love. Hardy is a great novelist and poet.The Well-Beloved unfolds as a strange story about an architect Jocelyn Pierson who falls in love with Avice Caro. her daughter and granddaughter!Avice I is a country girl living on the Isle of Slingers in the south of England where she and his family have resided for generations. Pierson has become a noted sculptor who returns to his native isle to become reacquainted with Avice with whom he grew up. He leaves Avice I after being attracted to Marcia Bencombe a Junoesque beauty. Avice II weds Pierson only to reveal she has already been married! This marriage is, therefore, bigamous! Avice III loves a French tutor and forsakes marriage to Pierson. Pierson's love stories occur when he 20, 40 and 60 years of age.This is,therefore, a story of one man's quest for the perfect Aphrodite. It is like a romantic quest which is never fulfilled. Hardy alludes to the famous \\"Judgment of Paris\\" by Rubens. Pierson can't make up his mind as to a mate and is incapable of maturely judging which maid is for him. He believed that the spirit of this femme fatale transported itself from one woman to another in the Caro family, (does the name \\"Avice\\" allude to \\" a vice\\" of sexual attraction calling the artist to seek for his perfect muse in the flesh?\\") \\"Caro\\" is the Italian word for \\"dear.\\"This story is unrealistic in the extreme! I much prefer Hardy dealing with more mundane affairs in his mythical Wessex county! His descriptions of wave and stone upon the isle of Portland are well done. Hardy loved and admired women throughout his life. His long marriage to Florence Gifford Hardy was childless and unhappy. The two lived apart in their home in Dorset. His later marriage to Florence Dugdale, a plain, placid and dull younger woman did not keep his eye from wandering to a fetching figure or smiling face. Even in extreme old age he was attracted to the local actress Gertrude Bugler who played \\"Tess\\" in a stage adaption of his classic tragic novel. He also had close but platonic relationships with society lasses and artists such as Florence Henniker.Marcel Proust admired Hardy's idealization of the female. It reminds me of Scotty's fixation on Madeline his lost love reincarnated in the shopgirl Judy in Hitchcock's film classic \\"Vertigo.\\" The novel can be seen as an artist's quest for the unattainable in his life's work. This is a very personal essay into the heart of Thomas Hardy. It is also a good reading of how fickle men are when it comes to wooing and wedding a woman.The book is never sexually explicit but Hardy expresses how the young Pierson reacted when he sat with Marcia Bencomb under a boat as he was in a state of physical arousel! One doesn't read this often in a Victorian novel!Hardy was a genius but this book is for devoted fans and not newcomers to his vision."},{"Title":"The Pursuit of the Well-Beloved and The Well-Beloved (Penguin Classics)","review":"Jude the Obscure is often called Thomas Hardy's last novel, but 1897's The Well-Beloved came two years later. The latter would be significant for this alone, but it has many other points of artistic and historical significance; also, though far from Hardy's best, it is quite good in itself. All fans and critics should read it, not least because it was the last novel one of the world's greatest writers chose to give us and almost his last piece of fiction.The book has an interesting and complex publishing history. Hardy's novel Tess of the D'Urbervilles was rejected by his chosen serial publisher on sexual grounds, and he chose to cancel the contract and submit another serial later. The trouble he continued to have with Tess convinced him that his next novel, Jude the Obscure, would also be rejected, so he put it aside and wrote The Well-Beloved as the serial replacement instead. As this suggests, it appeared at a very important point. It was serialized just as Tess, which catapulted Hardy to worldwide fame and ignited a firestorm of controversy, was published as a novel. Though undeniably lesser, The Well-Beloved indeed shares much with Tess and Jude, not least in thematic terms. All three paint an extremely bleak picture of domestic life, particularly marriage, and otherwise heavily criticize other Victorian society aspects, sexual mores especially. Jude parallels are especially strong; some of The Well-Beloved narrator's marriage critiques were slightly modified and used in Jude, and there are obvious similarities between the books' heroines and their married interactions. All this would make the book invaluable to hard-cores and scholars as a snapshot of Hardy's thought and artistic concerns of the time even if it had no literary merit.The Well-Beloved is also of historical interest for reasons not directly related to Hardy. Most notably, it deals with contemporary concerns and events in a way Hardy had not previously done. A proto-feminist, he had long been concerned with women's issues, and the times were finally beginning to catch up. Modern feminism was beginning in earnest, as many 1890s novels - e.g., Kate Chopin's The Awakening - reflect in various ways. Hardy was of course no exception. He famously said in a contemporary letter that his goal was - I am paraphrasing - to destroy the doll in English fiction in order for England to have any kind of fiction at all. The Well-Beloved is an early attempt, certainly less overt than Tess and Jude but leaning in their direction. The three main female characters are certainly not models of current feminism but stand far above Victorian clich&eacute;s as bold women with independent streaks, individual touches, and some clear merits. Hardy is famous for his heroines, and the book's three Avices are among his most overlooked. His novels had idealized women almost from the start but in a way very different from other Victorian writers, much less the social ideal. This has fascinated feminists and had a profound influence on later writers like D. H. Lawrence and Marcel Proust. The Well-Beloved is the epitome of this tendency. The Avices are not Hardy's strongest, most independent, or most conventionally appealing heroines but are his most idealized. They are almost otherworldly in their attributes and, most importantly, their significance. It is mesmerizing to see how he works them into his narrative, and those interested in his life and thought will appreciate them as a glimpse into the mind of a man far ahead of his time.Though obviously tame by later standards, the book was also astonishingly frank about related sexual issues. In an era when statues were covered and it was not even socially permissible to mention legs or ankles, it referred openly to premarital sex and its consequences, treats marriage with a lightness remarkable even now, and has several instances of cohabitation. This is of great interest as a portrait of an era. Laughable as it now is, many thought the book nothing less than pornographic. One critic infamously accused Hardy of sex mania, saying \\"Mr Hardy has once more afforded a dismayed and disgusted public the depressing spectacle of genius on the down grade.\\" Particularly amusing are the euphemisms Hardy was forced to use; for example, he refers to the actual rural England practice of sex between couples with marriage contingent on pregnancy as the \\"ratification of their betrothal, according to the precedent of their sires and grandsires.\\" There is also a good deal of sexual symbolism; as always with Hardy, Freudians will have a proverbial field day. Yet, also as always with him, these elements never overwhelm the story. Hardy clearly had a didactic purpose by now but was never preachy and very rarely heavy-handed. He makes what he has to say arise naturally - forgetting to do so being a fatal sin that many writers, especially late in their careers, unfortunately commit. Hardy is notable for avoiding it and, here as nearly everywhere, should serve as a model.Related and at least as important is the book's central idea - that a man can have an ideal \\"Well-Beloved,\\" perhaps more spirit than real, that manifests itself in individual women, causing the man to love them with a slavelike passion, but can switch to another woman without warning. It may last for days or years, and there may be long periods between, but the man is as loving and faithful as possible when it is there yet loses all interest as soon as it goes, causing an endless cycle. Many saw this as a mere ploy to exploit the \\"sex mania\\" Victorians seemed obsessed with, and it is now easy to assume Hardy was simply using it as a euphemism for unpopular ideas now considered commonplace. However, this sells him very short as both artist and thinker. It is in many ways the coalescence and culmination of various ideas pursued throughout his career. On one level, as noted, it is the apex of his female idealization. On another, perhaps more subtly, it is another instance of the fatalistic streak that increasingly dominated Hardy's fiction and became even more overt in his poetry. Based on Percy Shelley's \\"One shape of many names,\\" the evil force inhabiting tyrants throughout history that enslaves the masses, it is Hardy's way of dramatizing what he later called \\"Love the Monopolist\\" and is another manifestation of what he eventually termed the \\"Imminent Will\\" - the blind force, slowly gaining consciousness, that rules the universe. Men have no control over The Well-Beloved; they can neither resist it nor make it stay. Some may still say this is a convenient way of skirting moral issues, which Hardy surely realized to his convenience, but he would not have thought in such simplistic terms.As this suggests, the book has a fantastic quality distinctly opposed to Hardy's usual realist/naturalist fiction, and he indeed classed it with his \\"Romances and Fantasies.\\" Other novels in this category - e.g., A Pair of Blue Eyes - have a similar air of unreality, but this is alone in being essentially allegorical. Hardy is famous - or infamous, depending on whom you ask - for complex plotting and exploitation of melodramatic coincidence, but this exceeds all others in being so implausible that it is almost impossible to accept at face value. His denouncers always assume that he lacked the skill to plot without relying on such things and that he uses them for shock value - in short, that he is amateurish. In fact, though, anyone who knows anything about him is well aware that it was very conscious artistically and philosophically - Hardy's way of dramatizing a universe where people are no more significant than any other element and just as much the prey of fate's \\"purblind doomsters.\\" This is especially so here; Hardy had jotted down the Well-Beloved concept several years prior, also exploring it in contemporaneous poems, and thought of the book as a \\"fantastic little tale.\\" Adding to the sense of unreality are light-hearted chapter titles that poke fun at the events and protagonist in a way Hardy never did elsewhere in fiction and rarely in poetry.The Well-Beloved is in fact what no other Hardy novel is - an allegory. Hardy's painstaking attention to realist detail and some of his other characteristics make him an unlikely allegorist, but he succeeds admirably. The subject also ties the book to its era - the artistic ethos, shown by works like Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray to be a hot topic. The book is subtitled \\"A Sketch of A Temperament,\\" and so it is - Hardy's depiction of one kind of artistic temperament, perhaps what he saw as the ideal or even the only one. The sculptor protagonist, Jocelyn Pierston, symbolizes all artists, The Well-Beloved symbolizes his muse, and his attempts to translate them into sculpture symbolize how artists transmute muse into art. All this is fairly obvious; the real interest comes in how Hardy shows the process' effect on everyday life and how the two play off of, and often conflict with, one another. Fantastical as it is, many see the novel as one of Hardy's most autobiographical, and there is much to support this. Those interested in his life and techniques will thus find much to engross them, but the important thing to focus on is his general point. Hardy unfortunately never formally formulated his aesthetic theory to the degree of many other Victorian writers, and this, his most purely aesthetic novel, may be the closest he ever came; fans and critics will want to read it for this alone.Thankfully, though, there is far more. Different as it is from his other works in many ways, there is also much to attract fans. Chief among these is a profound sense of place. Perhaps no one equals Hardy in not only describing settings so realistically that verisimilitude is astonishingly vivid but also in making them an integral part of the story; setting for him is never mere backdrop. Most of the book is set in the Isle of Slingers, which is closely based on the Isle of Portland in Hardy's native Southwest England. Though not usually considered one of Hardy's Wessex novels, this shares many elements with those acclaimed works. The scene is lovingly and painstakingly portrayed, seeming to truly come alive in a way later fiction has rarely even approximated and certainly never equaled. Hardy's trademark pathos is also very present; lack of realism makes it hard to identify with the characters as strongly as in most Hardy works, but they gain our sympathy, and the book takes us on a roller coaster ride of emotions. We also get a good sense of why Hardy was arguably Victorian fiction's suspense master - not his least influential characteristic. His masterly characterization is also on strong display, and the social and artistic commentary gives readers plenty of substantial meat.Yet the novel is clearly below Hardy's top tier. At about 150 pages, it is much shorter than all his novels except Under the Greenwood Tree and The Trumpet-Major, and it lacks the major works' ambition. The latter's epic sweep and full tragic hit are missing, and there is an awkwardness to some of the prose that had been missing since his first few novels. Anyone expecting another Tess or Jude will be disappointed.Hardy clearly knew this and probably would have been the first to admit that he gave the serial relatively little effort. It was written quickly under deadline pressure and interrupted by preparations for the novel publication of Tess; this probably accounts for the length as well as picking up an old idea and the possible heavy autobiographical reliance. Jude was clearly prioritized; Hardy finished it and saw it through novel publication before returning to The Well-Beloved. He revised all his books for novel form, but The Well-Beloved got by far the most numerous and drastic changes - another Tess/Jude connection. Hardy never found a serial publisher willing to print those works as written and was forced to print bowdlerized versions, restoring them only in novel publication. Though immensely popular, both were widely denounced as immoral; the furor became so great that Hardy decided to abandon novels.However, he still had The Well-Beloved to publish in novel form and finally began the task five years after the serial. Hardy bravely refused to compromise his art to public decorum throughout his sixty-year writing career, but the Tess/Jude explosion left him disgusted and cynical. Wishing to avoid further controversy and return to poetry, his real literary love, he thus engaged in an extraordinary act of self-censorship, altering and removing most or all of what he thought might offend. He removed the harshest marriage and monogamy critiques and considerably toned down sexual suggestiveness, for instance moving premarital sex references from dialogue to narration and deleting the mention of Pierston kissing Marcia's underwear when he dries her clothes.Several other significant changes seem unrelated; Hardy likely changed his idea of what the novel should be after finally giving it due attention and seemed to want it more cleanly rounded for final publication. These changes ranged from deleting chapter one - which some speculate Hardy thought gave too much of himself away - to changing name spellings. Yet the extent of the changes is often exaggerated. One often sees the claim that the two versions are practically different novels, and many recent editions have both in full. However, the great majority is identical or nearly so, and the middle section is almost unchanged. True fans and scholars will of course want both, but those wishing to avoid repetition can safely restrict themselves to the serial's first nine and last six chapters. Aside from removing controversy, the changes are of little significance until the latter. As desire to avoid controversy was clearly not the driving force behind this changed final section, it indisputably stands as Hardy's final vision. However, as with the lesser changes made to other works, one can easily debate if this was for the better. The final ending arguably arises more naturally, but the original is clearly more in line with Hardy's tragic vision and determinism. If the third Avice's refusal to marry Pierston in the final version is more believable for her character, so is the latter's attempted suicide in the serial, and Marcia's original return is certainly far more plausible. More importantly, the original ending's dark concatenation of circumstances drives Hardy's bleak message home in a far more biting and grandly sweeping way than the somewhat abrupt and inconclusive final ending. Perhaps he thought it too heavy-handed or wanted to end his fiction career on a more positive note. It would be hard to blame these impulses, but I find the first ending indisputably superior artistically, and I cannot shake the feeling that Hardy begrudgingly compromised his vision in the final for insufficient, if unknown, reasons. At any rate, it is surely true that the final words - his closing statement in and on a quarter century of fiction - were written with not only his past work, and Tess/Jude particularly, in mind but also the future: \\"At present he is sometimes mentioned as \`the late Mr Pierston' by gourd-like young art-critics and journalists; and his productions are alluded to as those of a man not without genius, whose powers were insufficiently recognised in his lifetime.\\"Hardy himself was of course insufficiently appreciated in life, or at least at the time, and it is a testament to his far-seeing vision that he was confident time would mitigate his era's unfair prejudices. His reputation is now higher than ever, and he remains well-read and immensely influential. The Well-Beloved is a minor part of his legacy but an essential one for fans and critics, while its significant differences from his other work also mean those not normally keen on his fiction may well be pleasantly surprised."},{"Title":"Fools","review":"At first I was skeptical of how I would like this play.

I may not know a lot, but I know that, and this misstatement of fact kinda spoiled the fun for me. Charles Panati writes pretty well, and this book would be really interesting...but, for me at least, knowing that what I'm reading is not necessarily fact, but possibly something the author made up, or heard somewhere but didn't bother to confirm, reduces significantly the enjoyment, and the value, of reading the book. I like learning new things, not just listening to someone tell me a story. That's why I eschew the best of fiction in order to read nonfiction. With this obvious error appearing so early in the book, I'm not at all confident that what comes on the following pages will be nonfiction.There are no footnotes (not in the first 20 pages, anyhow), no notes at the end of the chapters or at the end of the book. Mr. Panati does have a section on recommended references, but when he cites facts, he does not cite sources which could be used to confirm those particular facts. Only one review is quoted on the back cover, and that's from Isaac Asimov, who promises astonishment.

This absurd myth is easily disproven by a simple visit to Versailles, where the tour guides will readily show you the toilets of the era (while wondering aloud why so many American tourists have been misinformed). The idea that the sophisticated French elite of the day would relieve themselves in stairwells is also rather absurd on its face. I was amazed to see Panati repeat that hackneyed myth with such earnestness. I would have a hard time believing anything written in a book by someone who seems to state myths as facts.

Kids love it, adults love it... it's just fun to read about how things came to be (did you know \\"Uncle Sam\\" was a Real guy? or that Germans invented shampoo in the 1890's? the brassiere was from Greece 2500 BC? or that high heels were developed over time in France beginning in the 16th century because the King (Louis XIV) was short?!) I guarantee there's something in there that would appeal to anyone you know. I have yet to find someone that can't find something they thought was interesting in this book..."},{"Title":"Panati's Extraordinary Origins of Everyday Things","review":"I've had this book for years and loved it. It's an indispensable source of amazing trivia, and as Issac Asimov (I think) said in one of the book's blurbs, there's at least one jaw-dropping fact per page. Really, everyone should own a copy. Puts things into perspective in an amazing way, whether the subject be toothbrushes, condoms, holidays, nursery rhymes, or potato chips. Along with books like The Straight Dope series, this is tops in its field, and well worth the money spent."},{"Title":"Panati's Extraordinary Origins of Everyday Things","review":"Yes, the book contains the origins of everyday things like hair pins, toilet paper and so on. But it does far more than that. I especially appreciate his thoroughness in explaining the origins of all types of holidays! For example, where do all the customs for each holiday come from, like candles on Christmas trees, kissing under mistletoe, gift giving, what do eggs and bunnies have to do with Easter, St. Patrick's Day, April Fool's Day, and on and on and on. He goes on to explain why holidays were originally banned up until the 19th century in many countries. It also shows how subtly holidays gained acceptance into most religions around the world. I found this book just fascinating, enlightening, and bold. I hope you do, too!"},{"Title":"Panati's Extraordinary Origins of Everyday Things","review":"This book has alot more pages then I expected it also is well organized. The author gave enough information on each subject to satisfy one's curiosity about a subject but not to the point of distraction, just enough to give the reader clarity on the subject matter. I'm not a youngster anymore and I knew some of the answers to the origins of everyday things but there was more in this book that I've never heard before. It doesn't cover just products but superstitions from whatever country they started. I've enjoyed it very much and would recommend it for those curious where some of our ideas and products originated long ago."},{"Title":"Panati's Extraordinary Origins of Everyday Things","review":"Step by step explanation how many of the things from the past came to be. It sits on the bookcase with it's dogged eared pages, ready to be used again and again for what ever information one of the family would like to know. Be it about an everyday items in the house, something heard on the TV, read in the newspaper or a book. This book hasn't missed.

They are specifically designed for understanding and healing one's relationship issues. They are not a divination tool, they are intended for the purpose of healing and insight. The work on the mirror principle (hence the title): the world is a mirror, reflecting back to us faithfully our inner world. The authors observe that in no area of life is this principle more visibly at work than in our personal romantic relationships. And they are right: our intimate partners always reflect back to us the parts of us that still need healing. For many of us, this is why we are in relationships in the first place: to deal with our with our stuff.The cards are very pretty: all on a silvery smooth textured background, with great artwork and packaged in a very appropriately \\"mirror-like\\" shiny silvery box. The cards and their messages are all focused on relationship issues an are very insightful. Great cards to pick up when going through a bad patch with your significant other: they help to bring the real issue into focus, drowning out the inner noise. A good tool for personal growth."},{"Title":"The Mirror Cards: The Relationship Pack","review":"I don't know how to explain it, but these cards somehow are able to accurately address the relationship problem and the changes that I need to make.

I highly recommend them."},{"Title":"The Mirror Cards: The Relationship Pack","review":"These cards are incredible. They offer insight, healing and hope, just to put it mildly!"},{"Title":"The Mirror Cards: The Relationship Pack","review":"I read the intro in the booklet and followed the directions for using the cards.

There is much here to be read several times and pondered upon.The author states his purpose in writing the book is: &quot;To suggest an interpretation of Egyptian metaphysical tradition in harmony with with the teachings set forth in what we call the mysteries.&quot;In the introduction, the author lodges a valid criticism of some academics in the fields of Egyptology and archaeology. He makes a distinction between two types of academics. The first are those who are too close to the to see the trees. They are &quot;materialistic minded men&quot; bent on maintaining their reputations and place in the academic community. Terrified of controversy and change. Unwilling to accept conclusions and new theories based on the latest scientific methods. The second group are those bold enough to speculate on new ideas based to modern exploration and research. These people are unafraid to reveal their conclusions to public scrutiny.This work will be of interest to hard-core students of Freemasonry, especially those who are open-minded and inclined to search for the roots of Freemasonry among the ancient Egyptians.To the Master Mason interested in the origins of the Craft, the section dealing with the &quot;Crata Repoa&quot; will be quite interesting. To avoid forming the misconception that he is reading the narrative of a modern ritual The reader must keep in mind the author is dealing with a ritual that could only have originated in ancient Egypt and passed down through the ages. Ultimately, the reader must make up his own mind about the information presented by the author.In chapter Four, &quot;The Secret Doctrine of Egypt&quot;, Freemasons will be fascinated by the author's treatment of the &quot;Widow's Son&quot;.Those who are not members of the Masonic fraternity may have difficulty grasping some of the concepts relating to Freemasonry presented by the author.Manly P. Hall was raised on November 22, 1954 in Jewel Lodge No. 374. In 1990 Mr Hall was elevated to the 33d degree, the highest honor and degree in Freemasonry.The author has written other books on Freemasonry: &quot;The Lost Keys of Freemasonry&quot;; Masonic Orders of the Fraternity&quot;; and &quot;The Secret Destiny of America&quot;.An extremely interesting section of the book presents the author's perspective concerning the &quot;Curse of Tutankhamen's Tomb&quot;.In my opinion, this book will not be well received by Christian Fundamentalists and the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church, based on the author'frank and historically correct criticism of these two groups."},{"Title":"Freemasonry of the Ancient Egyptians, To Which is Added an Interpretation of the Crata Repoa Initiation Rite","review":"This book is about initiation into ancient mystery schools. It was written several years after the great work that made Hall famous, \\"The Secret Teachings of All Ages.\\" There are hidden layers of meaning in ancient texts which can reveal great wisdom IF, and only if, one knows what to look for. He tells us that much ancient writing has \\"a higher signification than was known to the people.\\" (p. 85) Most of this wisdom is astronomical, some is spiritual. Those who have significant knowledge of masonic rituals will appreciate this book much more than those who are unfamiliar with them. Surprisingly, Hall did not become a mason until after writing these books; and did not become a 33rd degree mason (the highest level) until 36 years after this book came out, in 1973.Hall traces much masonic ritual (such as Crata Repoa) and symbolism back to ancient Egypt, specifically to Osirian legends (in which Osiris dies, and is sought after by his son Horus, \\"the son of the widow\\" - the widow being Isis) Hall comments on learned Greeks like Plutarch, Plato, and Solon, who were initiated by Egyptian priests into \\"the brotherhood.\\" Some would argue the origins of such rituals go back much further, to whatever civilization came before Egypt. Hall quotes P. Le Page Renouf: \\"The difficulty is not in literally translating the text, but in understanding the meaning which lies concealed beneath familiar words. A great part of Egyptian literature is cryptic; its true significance was probably unknown in the Ptolemaic period even to the Egyptians themselves.\\"As an author who has researched ancient knowledge at great length, I can say that it was well worth reading the works of Manly Hall. But these are not light or casual reads and are only suited for someone digging deep into unorthodox history. Readers should already have a good background in these topics."},{"Title":"Freemasonry of the Ancient Egyptians, To Which is Added an Interpretation of the Crata Repoa Initiation Rite","review":"This book was full of good information. I recommend reading this book.It will help you get a better grasp on a challenging topic."},{"Title":"Freemasonry of the Ancient Egyptians, To Which is Added an Interpretation of the Crata Repoa Initiation Rite","review":"While I enjoyed this book, I think its title is misleading. The connections between the Egyptian Mysteries and anything resembling Freemasonry, at least that of the last several centuries, is very tenuous. Furthermore, it is not clear to me that the details of the Egyptian ceremonies described are more than speculation. If you would enjoy such speculation, as I did, that's fine. Otherwise, beware."},{"Title":"Freemasonry of the Ancient Egyptians, To Which is Added an Interpretation of the Crata Repoa Initiation Rite","review":"As an introduction to the Crata Repoa (which is an interesting document that used to circulate in masonic and paramasonic circles) this is a good book. It is however, highly speculative that the Ancient Egyptians practiced these rituals, so the title is somewhat misleading."},{"Title":"The cornerstone;","review":"This is a sequel to The World is Not Enough and begins almost exactly where the other one left off. It is a pretty good read and quite a bit better than the first one in that just about all of the stultifying character summaries are gone. Also, the narrative concentrates on just a few characters, so that it is much easier to follow. The bad news is, these character summaries have been replaced by lengthy prayer recitations, which begin about half way through and start to weigh the thing down. \\"Oh heavenly and most gracious Father, in my blindness I have learned to see, for when I was sighted, I sought the superficial pleasures of the world, and was blinded to the love which . . .\\" And so forth. Although they are nicely written, they become dull fairly quickly, and I got to the point where I just quit reading them.But this is a heck of a story nevertheless. The first plot line follows the old baron, Ansiau of Linnieres, as he goes on his last pilgrimage to the Holy Land. With companions he meets and loses on the way, we follow him first to the south of France. There is a war going on against the heretics--if indeed marauding bands of soldiers murdering and pillaging helpless villages in the name of God can be referred to as such--and Ansiau, mistaken for a soldier by the peasantry, barely escapes having his hands hacked off and being nailed to a tree. But he gets through this, and is able to make it, finally, to his destination, where his grim adventures continue. Constantly hungry, footsore, weary, robbed and beaten, they beg for alms wherever they go, along with the thousands of other poor and desperate people. His story ends in the Holy Land, and it is not pretty.The other story line concerns Herbert, his son, now the Baron, and Herbert's son, Haugenier, now a knight, at Linnieres. Again, as with the first book, their lives are dominated by religion, superstition, and strict societal codes. Nobody in their class marries for love; every marriage is a political alliance. Therefore, true love is always illicit, and with the strict, gloomy eye of the Catholic Church brooding over everything, happiness is very difficult to achieve. It is impossible for anybody to reconcile their basic human desires with the strict codes which govern their lives. Herbert, despairing early of ever achieving goodness, simply abandons the attempt, and becomes a self-indulgent, evil man. Haugenier, the best of them, goes the other way and gives up everything: his home, his child, and his true love, to become a monk.Don't look for any happy endings here. There are none. As with the earlier novel, Oldenbourg paints a completely believable and historically accurate picture of the middle ages. It can be rough sledding on occasion, and indeed is very sad. This is great historical fiction."},{"Title":"The cornerstone;","review":"This is a MUST READ NOVEL! WHY HER BOOKS HAVE BEEN OUT OF PRINT SO LONG IS BEYOND HUMAN KNOWLEDGE.

She was so right.Yes, the book is depressing, yes, the things that happen are horrid. What it does do, however, is what ultra-romanticised so called medieval fantasy novels (see anything written by Mercedes Lackey) fail to do entirely: it to gets the Middle Ages RIGHT, not like we wish it were. All the infigthing, inbreeding, papal nonsense, poverty, down to the lice and heat exhaustion from armour, great rotting face cancers, the unatainable women and violent men, and starving pilgrimages, The Conerstone nails down the middle ages in all of its so called glory.I highly reccomend this book, especially to anyone who attends &quot;Ren Fairs&quot;, reads Middle Ages Fantasy tripe, anyone who goes to SCA events and picks on those in polyester tunics as &quot;not historically accurate&quot;, and especially history majors (poor buggers) to see the reality and romance of Medieval Europe in its truest form."},{"Title":"The cornerstone;","review":"The Cornerstone takes place in a feudal setting during the Albigensian crusade and captures the story of the Linnieres landlords, somewhere in southern France. All kinds of family intrigues surface, including shocking revelations of incest, forbidden love coupled with generally scrupleless jockeying for power and status, with accompanying unbridled hate and betrayal. Side stories include lots of anxiety, sufferance, vice, repentance, and finally some (controversial) chivalresque love.This is a genuinly French book and intended to be read in the original French. There is something about the poetry of language that gets lost in the translation and this makes the reading of The Cornerstone a rather lengthy and sometimes boring affair. However, overall, The Cornerstone makes a suave, delicate, and yet brutal fresco of early French medieval culture."},{"Title":"The cornerstone;","review":"The book continues to narrate the life-story of the characters and their children started in &quot;the World is not Enough&quot;.

Events of their family lives (adulters, plunders, squabbles, first &quot;blossoms&quot; of the Chivalric culture), description of religious persecution in France and piligrimage to the Holy Land, Saracen captivity - the life of the 12th century comes alive in its horror and nakedness.

Nothing more, nothing less.I decided to pick up Madame Bovary at a library sale after having read Nabokov (in Speak, Memory) gush about Flaubert's linguistic mastery. Unfortunately, I don't speak French and, of course, quickly found that linguistic mastery does not necessarily transcend language (sometimes, though - Eco, for instance).It might be an important work of literature - historically. And Flaubert seemed to do an excellent job of inventively portraying the many revolting traits of his denizens. Regardless, or possibly because of this, the book left me cold. After I finished, I wasn't exactly furious with myself for having read it.

It is not only the story of a dissatisfied housewife but of the author himself. Emma attempts to fill her solitude with literature, dreams, sex, and things in general. Her struggle is universally identifiable. Many people cannot like this book because they see too much of themselves in Emma.

She is also told by society that money and social stature will bring happiness, but again this only brings her to debt and in the end it is her eternal demise. Madame Bovary is an extremely well written book, it gets the reader on a level of intimacy that isn't always comfortable, but that is what makes it so good."},{"Title":"Madame Bovary (Classic Fiction)","review":"Depending on your perspective, this book is hopelessly dated and has little relevance to today, is an important step forward in the French novel, or is a classic depiction of tragedy in the Greek tradition. You should decide which perspective is most meaningful to you in determining whether you should read the book or not.The story of the younger Madame Bovary (her mother-in-law is the other) is presented in the context of people whose illusions exceed their reality. Eventually, reality catches up with them. In the case of Emma Bovary, these illusions are mostly tied up in the notion that romantic relationships will make life wonderful and that love conquers all. She meets a young doctor of limited potential and marries with little thought. Soon, she finds him unbearable. The only time she is happy is when the two attend a ball at a chateaux put on by some of the nobility (the beautiful people of that time). She has a crisis of spirit and becomes depressed. To help, he moves to another town where life may be better for her. She has a daughter, but takes no interest in her. Other men attract her, and she falls for each one who pays attention to her in a romantic style. Clearly, she is in love with romance. Adultery is not rewarded, and she has a breakdown when one lover leaves her. Recovering, she takes on a younger lover she can dominate. This, too, works badly and she becomes reckless in her pursuit of pleasure. In the process, she takes to being reckless in other ways and brings financial ruin to herself and her family. The book ends in tragedy.Here is the case for this being dated and irrelevant for today. A modern woman would usually not be trapped in such a way. She would separate from or divorce the husband she grew to detest, and make a new life. She would be able to earn a decent living, and would not be discouraged from raising a child alone. So the story would probably not happen now. In addition, the psychological aspects of her dilemma would be portrayed in terms of an inner struggle reflecting our knowledge today of psychology, rather than as a visual struggle followed mostly by a camera lens in this novel. The third difference is that the shallow stultifying people exalted by the society would be of little interest today. You find few novels about boring people in small towns in rural areas.The case for the book as important in French literature is varied. The writing is very fine, and will continue to attract those who love the French language forever. This is a rare novel for its day in that it focused on a heroine who was neither noble by class nor noble in spirit. The book clearly makes more of an exploration into psychology than all but a few earlier French novels. The story itself was a shocking one in its day, for its focus on immoral behavior and the author's failure to overtly condemn that behavior. Emma pays the price, as Hollywood would require, but there is no sermonizing against her. So this book is a breakthrough in the modern novel in its shift in focus and tone to a personal pedestrian level.From a third perspective, this book is a modern update of the classic Green tragedy in which all-too human characters struggle against a remorseless fate and are destroyed in the process. But we see their humanity and are moved by it. Emma's character is a hopeless romantic is established early. To be a hopeless romantic in a world where no one else she meets is condemns her to disappointment. She also seems to have some form of mental illness that makes it hard for her to deal with setbacks. But her optimism that somehow things will work out makes her appealing to us, and makes us wish for her success. When she does not succeed, we grieve with her family. Flaubert makes many references to fate in the novel, so it seems likely that this reading was intended.My own view is that the modern reader who is not a scholar of French literature can only enjoy this book from the third perspective. If you do, there are many subtle ironies relative to the times and places in the novel that you will appreciate, as well. The ultimate ascendence of the careful, unimaginative pharmacist provides many of these. The ultimate fate of Madame Bovary's daughter, Berthe, is another. Be sure to look for these ironies among the details of these prosaic lives. The book positively teems with them.If you are interested in perspectives two or three, I suggest you read and savor this fine classic. If you want something that keeps pace with modern times, manners, mores and knowledge, avoid this book!If you do decide to read Madame Bovary, after you are done be sure to consider in what elements of your life you are filled with illusions that do not correspond to reality. We all have vague hopes that &quot;when&quot; we have &quot;it&quot; (whatever &quot;it&quot; is), life will be perfect. These illusions are often doomed to be shattered. Let your joy come from the seeking of worthy goals, instead! What worthy goals speak deeply into your heart and mind? In this way, you can overcome the misconceptions that stall your personal progress."},{"Title":"Madame Bovary (Classic Fiction)","review":"Anyone who calls this book boring is probably not giving it a chance. This novel is truly excellent, and stacks up well against other great 19th century novels."},{"Title":"Madame Bovary (Classic Fiction)","review":"Flaubert objectively portrays his characters as fallible human beings in an environment which is both light and dark. As a Realist, Flaubert's aim might have been to show human weaknesses and lack of communication through a realistic environment. He succeeds if this was his endeavor. What makes this book fascinating to read (or to listen to) is that all of the bothersome traits of the characters usually reflect those of the reader as well! Flaubert is excellent in painting images so that one can almost feel as if he/she is in the moment. This book is very broodish though. In fact, it is slightly over done in expressing melancholy and the main character, Emma, is somewhat hard to like. At times, you may want to skip ahead. One can only stand so much darkness, in his own life, as well as in a book!"},{"Title":"Madame Bovary (Classic Fiction)","review":"MADAME BOVARY is one of it's own.

When that failed she had 2 different lovers, and did everything in her power to be with them. Dr. Bovary was a fool, he never knew anything that was going on. Emma needed much more than her husband could give, that's why she left and pretended to be taking piano lessons. She was a bored woman, who needed to spend a carefree life. In the end it was her demise. This book was excellent in portraying a woman who only wanted to live in her fantasy world."},{"Title":"Madame Bovary (Classic Fiction)","review":"I purchased this novel after hearing so much about how influential it is and how it may be the perfect novel. In capturing Realism or being a classic demonstration of Victorian Age style and values, it does succeed; but in terms of creating an emotional bond with the reader or creating deep characters, it fails.The first couple chapters are a little odd since they spend most of the time giving the reader the background of Charles Bovary, which tried to give the reader some idea of how his mind works, but never quite makes him come to life. After he meets his future wife, Emma, he pretty much becomes a piece of furniture in the background of her story. The author successfully describes the slow boring pace of provincial life in mid-1800 France by boring us with two dimensional characters, some of which talk non-stop.Really the only thing that the reader can sink their teeth into is Emma Bovary's naive, mercurial, and over romanticized behavior. The woman has no moral scruples, no grasp of reality, and goes through such wild mood swings that the reader could easily guess that she is mentally ill. Poor Charles has no idea any of this is coming as he, like the reader, has no idea she is this unhinged from our first encounters with her. The reader is taken on a wild ride that spirals out of control until her life and the life of her doting husband end in complete tragedy.Pros:1. If you like the all too quaint works of the Brontes and Wharton you'll probably like this story.2. Descriptive narration when it comes to scenery3. Two characters in this book really stand out. The Apothecary has non-stop mouth that makes you want to slap him; and the emotionally infantile Emma Bovary.4. Is the gold standard for Victorian era writing (such as it is.)Cons:1. Only the two characters stand out and have any sort of depth. Most are stereotypical caricatures.2. The book would be a few dozen pages shorter without the Apothecary.3. For all the talk about scandal and affairs, this story could be read by a elementary school child and not offend them. If it wasn't for Bovary talking about the affairs, I would have been sure she had them.4. I didn't really care when I finished reading it. I didn't want to know more about the characters or want to look for more of the author's work.Bottom Line: If you're literary glutton should should probably read this book just because. For men, this book can be very instrumental in defining that the term \\"damaged goods\\" means when it come to women. For women, let Bovary's bad-girl antics and miserable end speak for themselves."},{"Title":"Madame Bovary (Classic Fiction)","review":"Making a statement like Madame Bovary is the &quot;greatest&quot; novel ever written would be superfluous. It could be argued that it is the most perfectly written novel in the history of letters and that in creating it, Flaubert mastered the genre. What can't be argued is that it is one of the most influential novels ever written. It changed the face of literature as no other novel has, and has been appreciated and acknowledged by virtually every important novelist who was either Flaubert's contemporary or who came after him.It's interesting to see the range in opinion that still surrounds this novel. Some of the Readers here at Amazon are morally affronted by the novel's central character, viewing her as something sinister and &quot;unlikeable,&quot; and panning the novel for this reason. Such a reaction recalls the negative reviews Bovary engendered soon after its initial publication. It was attacked by many of the authorities of French literature at the time for being ugly and perverse, and for the impression that the novel presented no properly moral frame. These readers didn't &quot;like&quot; Emma much either, and they took their dislike out on her creator.But this is one of the factors making Madame Bovary &quot;modern&quot;. One of the hallmarks of modern novels is that they often portray unsympathetic characters, and Emma certainly falls into this category. How can we as readers &quot;like&quot; a woman who elbows her toddler daughter away from her so forcefully that the child &quot;fell against the chest of drawers, and cut her cheek on the brass curtain-holder.&quot; After this pernicious behavior, Emma has a few brief moments of self-castigation and maybe even remorse, but very soon is struck by &quot;what an ugly child&quot; Berthe is. Emma's self-centeredness borders on solipsism. For readers looking for maternal instincts in their female characters or for a depiction of a devoted wife, they had better turn to Pearl S. Buck and The Good Earth, perhaps, rather than to Flaubert.Much has been made of Flaubert's attempts to remove himself from the narrative, that he was searching for some sort of ultimate objectivity. His narrative technique is much more complex than that, however. It is his employment of a shifting narrative, sometimes objective, sometimes subjective, that again is an indicator of the novel's modernity. At times the narrator is merely reporting events or is involved in providing descriptive details. Yet often the authorial voice makes rather plain how the reader is to look at Emma and her plebeian persona. When she finally succumbs to Rodolphe and thinks she is truly in love, Flaubert becomes downright cynical: &quot; \`I've a lover, a lover,' she said to herself again and again, revelling in the thought as if she had attained a second puberty. At last she would know the delights of love, the feverish joys of which she had despaired. She was entering a marvelous world where all was passion, ecstasy, delirium.&quot;Emma is a neurasthenic, in the modern sense, but in the 19th century she would have been said to suffer from hysteria, a mental condition diagnosed primarily in women. When her lovers leave her, she has what amounts to nervous breakdowns. After Rodolphe leaves her she makes herself so sick that she comes near death. Her imagination is much too powerful and too impressionable for her own good. This is part of the reason for Flaubert's oft-repeated quote, &quot;Bovary, c'est moi.&quot; Flaubert was a neurasthenic as well and could easily work himself into a swoon as a result of his imaginative flights. There is even conjecture that he may have been, like Dostoevsky, an epileptic, and it is further intimated that this disorder was brought on by nerves, though this may be dubious, medically speaking.Madame Bovary is not flawless, but it comes awfully close. It is one of the great controlled experiments in the fiction of any era. It even anticipates cinematic technique in many instances, but particularly in the scene at the Agricultural Fair. Note how Flaubert juxtaposes the utterly mundane activities and speeches occurring in the town square with Rodolphe's equally inane seduction of Emma in the empty Council Chamber above the square:&quot;He took her hand and she did not withdraw it.&quot;&quot;\`General Prize!' cried the Chairman.'&quot;&quot;\`Just now, for instance, when I came to call on you...'&quot;&quot;Monsieur Bizet of Quincampoix.&quot;&quot;\`...how could I know that I should escort you here?'&quot;&quot;Seventy francs!&quot;&quot;\`And I've stayed with you, because I couldn't tear myself away, though I've tried a hundred times.'&quot;&quot;Manure!&quot;This is representative Flaubert. With a few deft strokes, he lays the whole absurdity of both the seduction and the provincial's activities bare.If you have read this book previously and have come away feeling demoralized and even angered, please try reading it again, this time concentrating on the richness of its metaphors, Flaubert's mastery of foreshadowing, symbolism and description. Maybe you will come away with your viewpoint changed. For those who have not yet read this classic of classics, I know that if your mind remains open, you will come away with an appreciation for this master-novelist and for this monumental work."},{"Title":"Madame Bovary (Classic Fiction)","review":"Madame Bovary is perhaps the finest French novel of the 19th century, and that is really saying something; consider that this was the century that produced Balzac, Zola, Maupassant, Hugo, Dumas, and Stendhal. Madame Bovary is one of the greatest anti-heroes in all of Western literature, as she leads the reader through a tragedy that explores the extremes of ambivalence. Masterful and compelling. An absolute must-read.HOWEVER, this particular edition (published by General Books LLC) is absolutely atrocious. I have never seen a book so rife with typographical errors -- it's like reading a Kindle transcription gone horribly wrong. Several times, Charles is referred to as \\"Charlea\\", and many of the chapters are divided improperly and begin nonsensically. Spend a little more $$$ and get the Penguin edition, or one that is translated by Lydia Davis."},{"Title":"Madame Bovary (Classic Fiction)","review":"This novel both starts and ends with the story of Charles, the title character's husband. Emma, his wife, thinks that Charles is incredibly boring, which to her mostly means that he's lacking in ambition and masculinity. He is also not very smart, though he does have a lot of other enviable traits.Charles is honest, hardworking, conscientious, uncomplaining and relatively good at his chosen profession (he's a country doctor). In Flaubert's time, just as in our day, for a physician to be good he had to consciously practice as little of his craft as he could get away with. We're told that Charles doesn't prescribe much to his patients besides laxatives and sleep aids, always fearing that he'd hurt them with anything more substantial. Flaubert was a son of the chief surgeon of the biggest hospital in Normandy, and he obviously knew the realities of the medical profession well. The only proactive medical decision described in the book - the unnecessary maiming of a stable boy named Hyppolite - is conceived and urged not by Charles, but by the pharmacist Homais, who is the novel's biggest villain.If Charles is so great, why does Emma hate him so much? The answer is suggested by the nature of the men with whom she chooses to cuckold him. Emma's first lover Rodolphe is the most macho character in the novel, with the possible exception of the international opera star Lagardy whom she can only admire from afar and of a mysterious vicomte she once meets at a ball, and whom she can't have either. Rodolphe had had a lot of affairs and is never shy or insecure about anything. Unlike Charles, who truly loves her, Rodolphe can easily go in and out of the baroque, flowery language in which seducers usually talk in the cheap romance novels Emma had been devouring since childhood.Her second lover, Leon, is somewhere between Rodolphe and her husband on the all-important manliness scale. When he tries to seduce her, she repulses his initial advances and he shyly apologises. A description of that is followed by a revealing sentence: \\"Emma was seized with a vague fear at this shyness, more dangerous to her than the boldness of Rodolphe when he advanced to her open-armed\\". Eventually Leon gets the hint.Emma's impatience with Charles's literal-mindedness and her strong desire to be lied to are made explicit in a scene that follows the death of Charles's father. Charles is being typically sincere about his mourning, shedding tears and saying all the things people usually say when their loved ones die. Emma is so bored with all that that immediately afterwards she welcomes the chance to talk to the shopkeeper and usurer Lheroux, who practically drowns her in insincerity every time they meet. Lying, noticing other people's lies - those things are less boring to her than honesty for the same reason that the romance novels she reads are more interesting to her than the real world.Because of their secularism most modern reviewers of this book concentrate on the corrosive effects on Emma only of the sappiness and romanticism of the novels she loves so much. Charles's mother, however, diagnoses a very different problem when she calls them \\"bad books, works against religion, and in which they mock at priests in speeches taken from Voltaire. But all that leads you far astray, my poor child,\\" she goes on. \\"Anyone who has no religion always ends by turning out badly.\\"Does it say anything about Flaubert himself that he put such words into a novel that ends with the heroine's suicide? Can it really be that Charles's mother was speaking for the novelist here? Perhaps. While Flaubert has obvious sympathy for Emma, he never shows any such feelings for the pharmacist Homais, a militant secularist who mocks Christianity on dozens of the novel's pages. Homais is portrayed in a negative light in every single scene in which he appears, while his biggest adversary in arguments over religion, the priest Bournisien, is usually shown sympathetically.One of the fun things about reading any classic novel is finding all of its inevitable anachronisms - things that point out how radically our world has changed since the book was first published. For example, early in the novel Flaubert goes on for a while about how ugly Charles's hat was. Nothing made in that period seems ugly to us now, does it? Fine art museums built in the 21st century routinely look worse than 19th century prisons.It's hard to believe now that Flaubert had to defend this essentially moralistic tale in court against charges of immorality. He was especially criticized for the phrase \\"platitudes of marriage\\", incorrectly believed by some at the time to vaguely justify Emma's adulteries. Modern would-be censors would far more likely be incensed by the mention of \\"the ardent races of the south\\", which appears during a description of the singer Lagardy.Emma and Charles implicitly agree with each other about their respective values in the sexual market. He can't believe he managed to marry someone so far above his league. She can't believe she ended up with someone so far below hers. Since they come from very similar economic backgrounds, their mismatch has nothing to do with social class. It is biological in nature - one of the obvious problems is that Charles simply doesn't have enough testosterone to be able to genuinely attract women of Emma's level of beauty.Is what's good in the sexual market good for a civilized society as a whole? It's hard to believe that Flaubert would have been uninterested in that question while writing this book. He had certainly depicted Charles as being more productive and useful to the world than Emma. And at the very least, Charles holds his own on that score against Leon and Rodolphe. By far the most emotionally moving part of the novel is the last chapter, which concentrates on Charles's fate after his wife's death.If you read up on Flaubert, you'll inevitably learn that he worked hard on his style. He spent countless hours getting each word of each sentence just right, treating his novels almost like poetry. I liked Flaubert's clear sense of morality and his unsentimental insightfulness about relations between the sexes, so I would have been happy to report to you that I loved his use of language as well. But that would be a lie. Having read the whole thing in French, I found its style clear and unobtrusive, but nothing more than that. Since French is not my native language, I very well could have missed some of the great man's stylistic subtleties. However, I did not find anything extraordinary about the language of the two English translations I've looked through either. If the translators involved were aware of Flaubert's stylistic awesomeness, then they clearly failed to reproduce it in English. This is, of course, not impossible, so I should probably withhold final judgment on it.If you liked this review, you can find more of them at [...]"},{"Title":"Madame Bovary (Classic Fiction)","review":"I will break my review into two parts since I would like to separate out my ratings of the novel and the Audio book. First, I'll review the audio book.Ronald Pickup was the reader and I think this is one of the better audio books I have listened to. The narrator did a great job on the characterizations and made each person sound distinct and portrayed them well. The mother-in-law sounded self righteous, the chemist sounded like a know-it-all, and all of the others sounded just right. I have listened to enough audio books to really appreciate a good reader and I would give him 5 stars.I had mixed feelings about the novel itself. The author had an extremely beautiful and descriptive way with words, but the result was that it moved a little bit slow for me at first. By the middle of the book, I was able to appreciate it more, but I am not a great fan of this very descriptive style. It reminded me somewhat of the writing of Proust.The story itself was a serious tragedy (in a literary sense), so don't read this if you are looking to be uplifted or are looking for a \`happily ever after' type ending. I can see why this is classified as great literature because it effectively teaches the consequences of certain choices."},{"Title":"Madame Bovary (Classic Fiction)","review":"I probably disliked this novel as much as I did 'Sons and Lovers'. For a while I just thought I'd been reading too many French writers (Huysmans, Sand,....) but it was much deeper than that.Although Madame Bovary is the central character, and an intriguing one at that, I don't believe that she is any more than a vehicle for Flaubert to vent his virtiole against men. There are four principle male characters in this novel and we see them reflected and caricatured in their responses to mixed-up, not altogether lovable Emma.There is husband Charles who is overwhelmed by the love he feels from Emma - he sees himself as SO lucky. But he is blind - seeing none of Emma's distress, or philandering. And he is not very successful at what he does anyway.Then there is lover Rodolphe. He is the ultimate selfish prig of a man. He reflects, as he walks away from Emma - having raised her hopes of a new more exciting life - that she was a wonderful mistress but he couldn't possibly compromise his selected way of life. Not for any woman, no matter how rewarding she might be. And when she appeals to him for help, she gets nothing from him.The second lover, Leon, is a more youthful and inexperienced participant in Emma's life. But later he does marry (not Emma, of course) so it is not commitment he shies away from. Nevertheless he fails Emma.Finally there is the chemist Homais, Charles's 'colleague'. He also has no sensitivity to Emma, almost misses seeing her at all. Like Charles, he is unsuccessful in some of his ventures, but he has such comically grand illusions about himself.All four men exhibit fundamental flaws. For me Charles and Leon have some saving graces. But none of them I have much sympathy for.And then there is the matter of Emma's decline - not due to her affairs. Was Flaubert unable to undermine Emma because of the affairs, because of Emma's selfish self-seeking? Did he have to create other artifices to inflict upon her - and the men around her (not that Homais really notices) - to give the story a 'moral'?The writing is spectacular - Flaubert was a wonderful observer and expresser of ideas. But for me, good writing is more than observation and a facility with words. It is the structure of the novel that failed me."},{"Title":"Madame Bovary (Classic Fiction)","review":"Madame Bovary is a stand-out novel more for how and when it was written than for any virtues imbedded within the text. What was novel writing before Flaubert? Actually, it was very much like the flowery novels that Emma feeds on--Victorian in the high-flown ideals of romantic love and perhaps not too far off from the Harlequin Romances of today's marketplace, but without the sexual innuendo.Flaubert wrote perhaps the first novel that frankly discusses a married woman's disenchantment, and while he is not a sympathetic author, his landmark novel was part of a movement that changed the way writers write about their characters. For that reason alone it is worth the read--it must have been a breath of fresh air in a marketplace full of novels that featured limpid-eyed damsels and sensitive, altruistic and well-dressed heroes.This is also a surprisingly modern cautionary tale about the dangers of getting in over one's head monetarily--Emma's dramatic fall from financial grace is not that far off from stories that are so common they don't even make today's newspapers.Read Madame Bovary for the story alone, and you will have read only a story of one woman's tragic life. Read it with an eye towards its place in the history of novel writing, and you will come away with something to mull over and compare with any other book you read that features a strong-minded female."},{"Title":"Madame Bovary (Classic Fiction)","review":"This translation was too often seemingly a transliteration which resulted in many virtually incomprehensible sentences, grammatically incorrect and incomplete sentences. It read as if completed by a translator who was actually not fluent in spoken English and who was using an out of date French-English dictionary. I was left with the impression sometimes that perhaps this was a voice to text publication and that the computer had misheard the voice and produced a garbeled result. This is not the only book which has left me with this feeling.It would help to always be able to preview such things as publishing dates, the name and information about the translator, whether the book is an abridged version and other information provided on the pages before the commencement of the book proper."},{"Title":"Madame Bovary (Classic Fiction)","review":"The biggest problem I had reading this book was the language itself. I've often been told about how Flaubert is a master of prose, his painstaking French, etc. To be honest, I'm not really seeing it in the translation. This, again, might be a translator issue - the original translation (in my edition of the Dover Thrift) was published in 1886, and shows. It's written with all of the mundane stuffiness that has come to stereotype Victorian England, and the (overused) rhetorical exclamations seem like something out of a creative writing student's attempt to be melodramatic.The language itself is stiff and unyielding, and in many areas I'd be hard-pressed to call it a translation so much as basic word-replacement. A good amount of the paragraphs are overly long, complex, and so frankly arcane compared to modern usage that I found myself pressed to reread not a few paragraphs. The problem is, in short, it carries all the plodding hypo-emotion of Victorian prose without the delight of Dickens, or the inevitable melancholy of, say, Hardy.Then there are things I can't fault the translator for, I'm quite sure. A large portion of the book is taken up with eventually tedious and intricate descriptions of clothes, food, accessories, and so on. The problem with this is that, especially with the clothes, I felt like I was being so weighted down with jargon about 19th century dress that I couldn't actually extract the point Flaubert was attempting to make. Most of the descriptions outlive their usefulness, since I had understood what their point was long before they end. \\"Yes, it's a poor, rustic farming community,\\" \\"Yes, it's a sumptuous meal,\\" \\"Yes, this person dresses magnificently.\\" It smacks of someone telling a joke and dragging it out too long so the punchline loses all power - most of the descriptions would have been more effective at perhaps a quarter of the length.Then, there are the characters. The problem is that they can be effectively summed up in a single sentence. They're like theatrical archetypes - you have the loving-yet-hapless-and-somewhat-dimwitted husband Charles Bovary, you have the raised-in-a-convent-to-romanticize-romance Emma Bovary, and so on. They're generally flat and in 160 pages (my edition is around 200 pgs.), I've yet to be surprised or astonished by anything anyone would regard as a complex understanding of the human condition, which to me would be a no-brainer in a classic of such repute.In all, the book is stiffly worded, uninspiring, tediously descriptive and rolling around in it's own display of attempted luxury, with characters that really show little insight into how humans are or act. I know what happens to Madame Bovary, and I have to say, I couldn't really care."},{"Title":"Madame Bovary (Classic Fiction)","review":"I heard this book mentioned so many times that I finally decided to read it. I don't understand its popularity. I even read some other reviews to see if I could figure it out. And I noticed that while many people disliked this book they still rated it four or five stars, hmmmm. Perhaps, this book with all of its adjectives is more beautiful in French maybe it is even poetic.... in English, however, I found that beauty to be lacking.While, I sympathized with Emma's problem, her loneliness and unhappiness, the fact that no one around her understood her, I thought this book was just an easy, not too lengthy read and nothing more.Flaubert earned a third star from me for attempting to recognize a woman's plight during that period when women didn't have much to look forward to. I think it is both commendable and a pity that he, a man, tried to write from a woman's perspective. It's a pity because it makes Emma less believable and more masculine.... and its commendable that he did attempt to recognize women like her.Overall, this book is past its time and not a recommended read by me."},{"Title":"Madame Bovary (Classic Fiction)","review":"I hesitate to write a review of this book.

Although my story was based upon my shocking contact with a \\"dead\\" optics physicist colleague, I was likewise forced to seek scientific answers to these same spiritual questions: Does God Exist? Who are we? Why are we here? Where are we going? in the ways that this writer has indeed captured for us now. After 15-years of painstaking research into astrology, biology, computer science, genetics, mythology, physics, psychology, medicine, sacred geometry, and theology, I finally came to the relative conclusion that this author has as well, that we are all becoming fifth-dimensional beings of light with third eye open psychic powers. Moreover, I saw that Solar Cycle 24, what ancient astrologers portrayed symbolically as the Eternal Return of the Sun of God, is our golden window of opportunity for transformation between the Venus transits of our Sun in June 2004 and June 2012.

First, the whole issue of credibility concerning the author actually \\"speaking\\" with God; second, all the theories concerning what happens after our heartbeat stops... My question is: how does the author know about what happens at the time of one's death and after? HOW?It might be my lack of faith in some higher divine creature or concept, but I remain convinced that death is merely the return to the same state you were before you were conceived, period. I do however have the hope that my thinking will change. I want to believe in something different, but so far I only have what my perception and physical senses allow me to comprehend.I wonder how far I will go if I sit down and write a book stating that the only thing we will encounter at the time of death is the NOTHINGNESS, and I claim \\"God told me so.\\"For that reason, I now even more regard life as the \\"one golden opportunity\\", the moment is here and now, because once this is over, I will be exactly in the same place I was before I was conceived: nowhere."},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"How can you copyright words from God, have all rights reserved for it, and require permission to show it elsewhere?"},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"While it is true that for many people, this book will ease their fears about death, it is just as true that this book was written by a man who has no greater knowledge of the hereafter as anyone else.

And the total loss of consciousness forever.While I certainly do not claim to have any greater knowledge of death than anyone else who has not experienced it yet, I think it is fair to simply acknowledge what is MOST LIKELY to be true. We experience consciousness through our brain. Once the brain goes, we no longer have consciousness. Death is truly the loss of all consciousness. We no longer will experience any emotion--happiness, sadness, joy, or pain.Perhaps the easiest way to consider what it would be like is to imagine how you felt when World War I ended. What? You weren't even born then? Exactly. The world existed for thousands (millions? Billions?) of years before you were born. What were you doing during all that time? Were you bored? Upset that you didn't exist? Of course not--you simply didn't exist, and didn't have awareness or consiousness. Put in this perspective, in death you merely return to the same state you were in before you were conceived. Why is this such an unacceptable concept for so many people? It shouldn't be.So while this likely scenario doesn't have the happy family reunions and eternal bliss promised by ficitious man-made religions, it DOES have the ring of likelihood, and really isn't such a bad concept once you have time to digest the reality of it.

His books are great for opening dialogue on tough topics such as \\"what do YOU think happens when you die?\\" My 2 housemates and I sat and read from this book together while having coffee this past weekend. Easy to start conversations wherein people can challenge their OWN belief systems (as opposed to people becoming defensive with each other when belief systems differ).

I love Neale's work, and feel blessed to have discovered it!"},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends by Neale Donald Walsch is a book about God and what you will experience after death. You will explore the journey with the author and his experience with God. Walsch explains that death is different for everyone. According to the author if you expect nothing after you die than that is what you will get. If you expect to be embraced by a loving God than that is exactly what you will be given."},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"This should be the first of Walsch's books to be read by a person not familiar with his wonderful insights about life and \\"death.\\" This is because so much of what concerns most people is what happens when we pass away. To read this will either comfort you or make you incredulous. I say incredulous because many people have never understood or never accepted reincarnation. For those with this reaction, think about the meaning of the Lord's prayer where it says, \\"...and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive others.\\" We are praying for \\"Reincarnation\\" where we are in a position to have God forgive us as we have forgiven others. This is a bit of mental shorthand where a complex process was summarized in nine words. Actually God forgave us a long time ago, but there is a natural process known as reincarnation where each soul is born gain repeatedly. Before a next birth our soul is helped to understand our previous life and with this understanding to follow God and Jesus' teachings on how to love ourselves and everyone else, too.It is not only a book for the reader to use, but it is a wonderful resource to help someone who is ill and in the process of \\"passing on.\\" All fear of the \\"Hereafter\\" will be dissipated from reading this sensitive and meaningful book."},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"As someone who has been investigating life after death for some time, this book comes as a welcome addition to my library. Its candor and conversational style makes it readily accesible to all those interested and its tone is never preachy or matter-of-fact. I would say that that is key in determing the validity of books such as this. If ever you find anything or anyone that attempts to preach at you and make you believe that only what they say is correct, then I would say that there is little truth in that person or thing. This book offers hope for those seeking to understand what happens after death and where their loved ones have gone. It also offers a view of our larger purpose and goal. I would recommend this a primer for those interested in more advanced study of the afterlife."},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"I usually refrain from using cliches such as \\"breathtaking\\" for the simple reason that their excessive use so frequently causes others to bypass the word's meaning; however after reading Home with God there is no better description for the book. It LITERALLY took my breathe away with its extraordinary insights and beautiful prose. My longstanding questions regarding the afterlife were so clearly answered and so simply articulated. Moreover, God's play on words was often so brilliant I marveled in Her ability to relay the information to me. If there was one author I would recommend to someone yearning for spiritual food I would offer Neale's name. If there was one book I would recommend for inspiration, it would be this."},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"This book gave me a lot of insights about death.

This book just jumps right in without the gradual easing in of Walsch's other books- really great stuff. I find even reading a few pages shifts my focus and mindspace.I am extremely greatful for the book, and the refreshing perspective it gives on the subject of life and death."},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"If you liked the previous books in this series you'll enjoy this one also. The ideas put forth in this book are interesting and make sense in relation to the previous books in the series.

It capsulated life itself in such a terrific way that you get to understand the bigger picture and therefore life opens up to the next level. If there were ever a book to read and your searching for answers, or want to know the meaning of life this is the book I'd recommend straight away, but it does help to have read the others first, just so your in tune with what is being said. Its one of those books that's a keeper, that sit's on your selves to be read over and over."},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"I have read all of Neale Donald Wasch's Conversations with God.

I enjoyed it so much right after finishing it I read it a second time. I feel his descriptions of the other side of life are very accurate. The reasons are 1) I do have some out of body experiences myself, limited as they be. 2) I have read the accounts of many great masters who are quite adept with out of body experiences and this book echos what they have reported, but in its own unique way helps to clarify the experiences many others have reported.Bravo, great job Neale!Michael SkowronskiAuthor ofUnforgettable: A Love and Spiritual Growth Story"},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"I say this: it doesn't matter if you take this ENTIRE book to be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth...the author does not expect or insist you do that. Instead, what he says is that you should take away from this book what is truth for YOU, and ditch the rest. Some of these reviewers very quickly discard that part. The most meaningful part of this book for me was that held within there is no doubt at least one phrase, one sentence, one comment, one concept, one idea, or one possiblity that will ring true and give you peace about what happens after death, either your own or a loved one's...or maybe there were ten-that was all I needed to rate this book a solid five. I personally loved it."},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"This should be a MUST READ for everyone and especially for those who harbor doubts concerning what happens after death.

It's the final book to be published in the series. I strongly recommend it for those who still have doubts about life after death.

If everyone read this and recognized it for waht it is, we could save the world from its current path of destruction.By reading this and others by Neale Donald Walsch, you eliminate you fear of death, which will eliminate your fears about life.We cannot change the world by doing things, nut only by changing our beliefs. We do not need to get rid of the worlds religions, but we need to enhance them by dispelling some long held innacuarate beliefs.This book and his others can do just that."},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"Having read all of the other Conversations with God, Home with God was still as fascinating as the first book in the series. And, having studied Eastern and Western religions as a hobby, I find that there is absolutely nothing to disagree with. The bottom line of religious thought (the mystical revelations) are very much in sync with Walsch's writings. I feel that the material in the book is consistent with my own revelatory experiences."},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"I have been a fan of CWG books. I read a few pages in a book store and liked it enough to order from Amazon. It's a good book with some new insights. My biggest turn offs were: 1) too much repeatation to the point that I was think if he is so dense that God has to say the same thing 100 millionth time!! 2) some contradictions in his statements. There are number of things that writer claims he \\"remembered\\" for the first time from his dialogue with God only to mention the very same things to someone in his email or letter \\"prior\\" to his conversation with God.Overall a good book but take it as it is: his own understandings from many other sources; no doubt inspiration from God could very well be one of these sources."},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"Anybody could write a book exactly like this. Although, you have to give it to him for realizing how easily he could capitalize on the fears of the masses. I'll bet he's thanking God right now that America is full of Christians.Okay, seriously...what? Why? This is just a guy's modernized version of the bible. A way for a new generation to get sucked in.What a pair this guy has, to talk with the so-called creator of the universe. Of course, there's no law against it, and there are plenty of puppets out there waiting to swallow all this crap.What I'm wondering is...does this guy actually think he's talking to God?

If you really want to know where you are going after you die (or other spirituals matters), go to the real source, read the Bible!Why do you want to find answers for something so fundamentally important (such as your or other's eternal destiny) from someone's misguided opinion? I think that Mr. Walsch's writings, while superficially comforting, are very misleading and you would be better served and do some real research into who God really is and what he really thinks, and that is only found in the Bible. There's too much at stake for you to take his words without further consideration."},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"The unofficial Book 4 is another great generation from Neale. Everyone should read these books. Even Christians."},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"I stumbled upon this book in a used bookstore, had no idea it was even out. Having enjoyed reading his CWG books, I grabbed it for a good read, but it was so much more than that. I was provoked in new ways, my beliefs du jour were challenged on every other page, I found myself writing notes till my fingers hurt...this is unusual for me as I have read ALL the books of this ilk for over 30 years and NEVER had such a response before. Since I enjoy being challenged and shaken up, it was an absolute mixture of joy and discomfort and ahas and oh ohs... If you are interested in the possibilities of what lies 'Beyond' this book gives a unique tour and I felt like I was 'there' (wherever 'there' might be!). I do not recommend this for the faint of heart or for those that are too sure in what they believe.

I gave it 5 stars b/c I love this series & the book is a good read. The only complaint I had was that it was bit too \\"scientific\\" at times, but not so much I couldn't follow it. The details made it easy for me to get a visual in my head about what God was talking about.If anyone has not seen the CWG movie, it is well worth seeing & owning a copy."},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"The book takes my breath away. It's profoundly stunning and reaches beyond \\"The tibetan book of the dead\\" in its depth, scope, implication and application for Life."},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"Another book I enjoyed and yet found frustrating all at once. Once again Walsch squanders valuable pages missing the points God makes. One would think after so much conversation with the man upstairs that he'd grasp these concepts better. After touring the world explaining spirituality to others he frustrates readers who I think likely get what God is saying when he himself does not. I skip the Walsch parts at times reading only what God has to say leaving Walsch to ponder what is being taught. I feel the main points in this book could have been covered in 50 pages or less if Walsch hadn't taken the conversation in circles once again."},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"As my world around me is shifting with the passing away of my youngest sister from metatastic breast cancer, I needed someone or something to help me bridge this most difficult period of my life. This wonderfully written book by Neale Donald Walsch, Home With God: In a Life That Never Ends, has come to me to do just that. I struggled so much with the need to approach my sister about her dying, but I just didn't know how to do so. This book has allayed my fears about talking to my sister about her passing away; it has calmed my own fears letting go. It has reassured me of the things that I already knew on some level: that life is forever. I am comfortable in knowing that my sister's dying is a planned event. I am accepting of the fact that my sister's dying is all about her and that she is doing it for herself: she is tired and needs to move on to another reality. For all of us who are struggling or will struggle with the death and dying of our loved ones, this book is a salve. It is a necessary application for everyone who will deal with death."},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"This book could be the most enlightening and helpful item available to anyone grieving the departing of a loved one. It offers insights to what can be expected by anyone departing the physical world and going onto whatever they anticipate lies in store for them in the \\"afterlife.\\" It offers insights, to those left behind, in knowing that their loved ones are \\"all right and safe.\\"Those who also seek answers to problems encountered on their own \\"journey\\" will surely find comfort in learning that the \\"journey\\" isn't necessary and that there really isn't anywhere they need to go. We all are, in fact, in the Kingdom of God, for there is no other place. A minor change in perspective is all that is needed to find happiness and understanding."},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"Listening in on the conversation between the author, Neale and God provides a clear, easy to understand discussion which reshapes the very foundation of conventional reality for the reader. These discussions are well structured by building a tree of connected rememberances. This book has the power to change the world as we currently know it!"},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"The author has tapped into something that many of us do not recognize. Our portal to God is within, not out there somewhere.When we all seek guidance, it ultimately comes from within, and NDW (author) has a delicate ear for hearing inspiration.I also question the credibilty of some of the negative reviews posted. I HIGHLY doubt they actually read this book for they did not offer any tangible argument or pertinant specifics found in this book.After reading this this book I have come to this conclusion. I had rather live assuming there is an after life and die to find out there isn't one, than live like there is not, to find out there is!"},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"This has got to be the most awesome book ever written on the subject of the \\"hereafter\\". It's loaded with descriptive metaphors brilliantly used to enhance the subject with the most breathtaking clarity. I highly recommend this book for anyone open minded enough to receive the information contained within and give it serious consideration as to its relavence in their life. I loved it!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"I was totally enthralled by the breadth of information in this amazing book. About not only the way we create our lives here but also the death experience. The reader is taken on a journey of discovery into the soul, the very heart of our being. A very joyous path of remembrance. Totally uplifting comforting and loving. A book to keep and refer to often. I am recommending all my friends to read this wonderful book."},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"I read Home with God without the benefit of having read Mr. Walsch's previous works and I must say that I recommend it without question. Since I read Home with God I have purchased ALL of Mr. Walsch's previous work and I have enjoyed them all tremendously. Home with God is so special because we all want to know what is beyond our current knowing. I have always felt that my idea of what God would do and be was quite different from what mainstream religions preach. I never could understand how God could hate anything he/she created. Mr. Walsch's God is the God I have always believed in and had faith in and experience daily in my conversations with God. I recommend you take the book slowly and allow it to become a part of you. We are all one people (children of God) and what hurts one of us hurts us all. Reminds me of the phrase \\"United we stand, divided we fall.\\" Read this book with an open heart and allow yourself to be healed and comforted and reconnected to God like never before. It will positively change your life.I highly recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"Books that deal with controversial topics often provoke reactions of opposite extremes. Just look at the number of 5 star reviews and 1 star reviews on this book. If you are looking for a sincere review on the book, I can tell you right now that most of the 1 star reviews are written by cynics, hard-core Christians, and (strangely) kids promoting a book by someone named Maddox. I especially love the review ironically entitled \\"Wake Up,\\" because that is exactly what Neale Donald Walsch is trying to do. If you are one of these people, all I can say is that belief is not required - and this book is probably not for you.As someone who has read all the previous Conversations with God books, I honestly think \\"Home with God\\" is one of the best books in the series. It contains fascinating information about the process of life and death, and if you have read a lot of metaphysical works already the ideas are not exactly new. However it is definitely a new spin on old ideas, and the ways they are expressed in this book are intense, eloquent, and inspiring. As another reviewer pointed out, the Neale in this book reminds me of his voice in CWG 1-3, where he is for the most part asking questions to satisfy his own curiosity and thirst for knowledge rather than posing questions for \\"the skeptics\\". Like most other books in the series, there are great moments of revelation, inspiration, and humor, and each moment build on the next so that you're left with a sense of absolute wonder at the end of the book that is rather hard to explain in words. But don't take my word for it. Read it and find out for yourself."},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"I have read all of Neal Donald Walsch's books, many three or four times. I am 50 years of age and in all of my life I have never found truths that resonate so strongly with me. It has been said many times that when the student is ready the teacher will appear. This does not mean that Neal is my teacher. He has never claimed to be in any of his books. None the less I have found Neal's books, the current one included, to have lifted the veil that I had lived under for most of my life. It doesn't matter what others think of your newfound knowledge. It only matters what you do with it and how you use it to benefit mankind, the earth, and all living things on it. Thank you Neal for another excellent book in the series."},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"There has never been a more positive look and comforting thought about death,dying, and our personal coming HOME."},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"well.....my comment is...even if its a total fiction of author's thought/imagination, he's a philosopher. I don't mind if all he said was fake but it do help in soothing one's mind, and helping those who is near/facing death.I wonder why those who hate the author so much read his book..and I wonder why are there much less rejections against Tibetan Book of Living and Dying."},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"This book holds the answer to a request I made to God and was promised over 20 years ago.I asked to know and experience what Death is like before I died.This book shares with you the knowledge needed to attain this.It takes all I knew al-ready and puts it together in a perspective that helps this BE-known. Experienced. LIFE AND DEATH ARE ONE.There is no death. After reading this Book I am Not running from death but running with life.AS a man thinks so IS he. unless not. :-) and still you will never suffer. It IS all-right.All Good. All God.Thank you to that part of God Called Neale Donald Walsch for all these WONDER-FULL Books!"},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"In 1975 my mother passed away from this Earth plane. I was only nine years old. When I first heard of her passing, the news hit me like a ton of bricks and I was completely hysterical. I went out to the backyard and sat under the peach tree that my mother and I used to sit under many times and I had a very vivid dream of my mother and in it she told me how happy she was, how good she felt, how she really didn't die but just left the body she was using. When I awoke I was filled with a feeling of peace and a knowing that there is never any death of any kind in God.Well, needless to say this went over like a lead balloon when I told my family that mom didn't really die. They took it as being insensitive and that I must've not really loved her that much if I got over her passing so rapidly. No matter what I said I was shut down and made to feel very guilty. So I forgot all about my dream of my mother being happy and alive and doing well and I learned how to mourn and I learned how to mourn very well.One morning I woke up and I realized I was now 22 years old. Where was I for the last 13 years of my life? I was basically on auto-pilot. Even though I was now in my twenties I still felt like that sad little nine year old boy. The shock was traumatic and I actually had what professionals like to call a mental breakdown but I have since learned to call it a breakthrough.I finally got a chance to talk about my pain, my suffering, my guilt. I finally got an opportunity to tell someone who was willing to listen to me that I was sad and angry and disillusioned and somehow through the power of compassion and grace I could tell that the pieces of my psyche were coming together. I began to feel as though I was healing.When I got out of the \\"looney bin\\" I made a pilgrimage to the cemetery where my mother was and through some help, I located her grave. I fell down on my knees and cried bitterly, \\"Oh, mom, I've been such a horrible person. I'm sorry I didn't love you. I'm sorry I didn't care enough to think that you were gone from my life.\\" I was so emotionally exhausted that I fell asleep at the gravesite.I had another dream with my mother in it. Once again she told me that she was fine, that she was still in my life, that the Love we had for each other could never be destroyed. I woke up feeling completely healed. I woke up knowing that God is a God of Love and Love never dies.This book confirms those things that my soul knows to be true. You can't really explain these things to people who aren't open to such things and we don't even need to. We will be with the ones who left before us again. We will continue our journey forever. Life and Death are not separate but the same. This is a great book. It took me three days to read it and I am now reading it again with a pad of paper and a pen so that I can take detailed notes.It's not going to be for those who are adamant that there's a place called Heaven and a place called hell, but it's for those who have an open heart and a soul willing enough to remember that there is no death in God.Peace & Blessings, children of Love."},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"Is it really over? Is this wonderful series really coming to an end? Sadly, it appears so, as this is apparently the final book in the conversations with God series (which has changed my life for the better). But while it may be the final book, it is one of the most important, for it deals with the one issue that everyone, no matter who you are or where you come from, must inevitably face: What happens to us after we die?That's the one big question that is looked at in this book. Just what does happen when we die? Happily, the answers put forth not only make sense and give a reasonable view of the transition from physical life to spiritual life, but when one takes the answers given in this book and compare them to near death experiences and other other-worldly experiences, they match up.The big message of the book is this: It is impossible to live and die without God, but it is possible not to know this. No matter where you are, what you do, or how you die, God is with you. It's possible to know this, and it's possible not to know this.On to the subject of death itself, the book goes over death and it's implications. There's a lot of stuff presented here, so i'll just list some of the biggies:1. Death happens in three stages, realizing that you are not a body, experiencing what you want to experience after death, and merging with your higher self.2. One goes home to heaven when they have experienced all that they wanted to experience in this physical lifetime. The spirit of the individual may know this and when the lifetime will finish, but frequently the individual does not know when he or she will die.3. The death experience is different for everyone, depending on your expectations, views, and ideas. If you expect to find nothing, you will be allowed to experience that (the second stage of death) until you decide to look for something else. If you expect to find yourself embraced in the arms of a loving God, you will be allowed to experience that. If you expect to find yourself being judged and sent to hell, you will be allowed to experience that (though you can change it by choosing to look for something else).4. Death is simply becoming whole again, for you splintered upon birth. Death is the transition from one state of existance to another. Everyone inevitably makes it home.That's just the tip of the iceberg with regards to what happens after death. There's a life review, there's the big question that you will be asked (so big that all of heaven will pause to hear your answer), and there's deciding what to do next. Overall the book does accomplish what it set out to do, to explain death, what it is, what happens, and how you affect your own experience.Granted, what's said should be taken with a grain of salt because we, of course, cannot confirm for certian what happens after physical death. I don't agree with everything said in here about death (For example, spirits who see themselves in hell don't feel it. I'm not quite sure what to think of that), but I find myself agreeing with most of what is said here. There are some passages in paticular (the passages on page 109-111 made my heart and my spirit soar as I read them) that are just so beautifuly written and so emotionally moving that they are, in my opinion, some of the most beautiful and divine words ever inspired to be put on paper.In addition to death itself, the book also discusses other aspects that add to the death process such as the topic of how one perceives things. One big note here is that your perception really changes your life and your world. Your perception helps determine, to an enormous extent, how your life plays out. I love this quote on page 214:God: It's really quite simple. Tune in to how you feel.Neale: Now I can just see someone saying, \\"Boy, what a piece of new age jargon-Get in touch with your feelings.\\"God: Those who see it as jargon will experience it as jargon. Those who see it as wisdom will open the door to a whole new world.There's also a good amount of material describing why you're here on earth in the first place (experience things that help you grow and evolve as an individual spirit). There are no victims and villians, and everyone has their own truth, but there are people, places, and things that help guide people to that truth within them. Some people may indeed dismiss such statements, but when one thinks about it in a certian context, it does make sense. How does one really find wisdom and truth?God: All human beings are born with the wisdom of the universe imprinted on thier souls. It is in the DNA of everything...this is why, when people are confronted with great wisdom, it often sounds so familiar to them. They agree with it almost at once. There is no argument. There is only a remembering (page 5).I could keep writting for pages at how incredible and easy to understand this book is, but I will finish with this: What is in this book is not for everyone. Followers of religion may hate what it says and others may say that it's all a bunch of wacked out new age propoganda, but there is good stuff in here. When I got this book I was going through a stage in my life where I was afraid of what was going to happen to me after my death. Yet, after reading this book and recognizing (remembering?) so much good stuff in it, all my fear of death has vanished completely, replaced with that simple statement. \\"It is impossible to live and die without God, but it is possible to not know this.\\" Although it's sad to see such a wonderful and life changing series of books come to an end, it has finished with a wonderful ending that helps to reassure, comfort, and explain one of the things we as humans fear the most.Thank you Mr. Walsch. Thank you so much for bringing us all these wonderful books. Rest assured that there is one spirit, one person out in the world whom you have helped guide towards a more loving path in life. Thank you so much.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"Neale Donald Walsh's OUTSTANDING new book \\"Home With God: In a Life That Never Ends\\" is a breathtaking explanation from God about the death experience, and what to expect when we go to the other side.To give you a feel for this extraordinary book, here is a brief explanation quoted directly from the book: (note: I placed \\"Neale\\" and \\"God\\" so you will understand who is speaking.)(Neale) \\"I had heard that we are reunited with our loved ones after death and that they help us \\"cross over,\\" and I am soooo glad to know that this is true!(GOD) You may even become aware of the presence of some of those loved ones before your death.(Neale) Before my death?(GOD) Yes. Many people, while they are still in their physical bodies, announce to others in the room that they are seeing loved ones, or that their beloved has come for them.Those others in the room often try to convince dying people that they are seeing things-and they ARE seeing things, things that are very real, but things that other people cannot see because of their limited perspective. Your perspective widens immensely after \\"death\\"-and often in the moments just before you die.(Neale) That's exciting! Now you're almost making death sound exciting.(GOD) It IS exciting. In fact, your death can be one of the most exciting moments of your life. It all depends on what you believe. As in life, in death what you believe is what you will experience.For instance, if you do not experience the presence of these spirits at the time of your death it will be because you do not expect to, and because the possibility of their presence lies outside of your belief system. Yet if you so much as hope that these loving presences will be there, you will immediately perceive them.(Neale) I understand. So it is really important to be clear about your beliefs surrounding death.(GOD) It is important in life to be clear about your beliefs surrounding everything. It is not just your death that is affected by your beliefs, but your WHOLE LIFE.\\" (My Caps.)*****It is my deepest belief that anyone who has ever been afraid to die will receive great relief after reading this book.There is the most love filled tone throughout, of course that unconditionally loving tone and feel comes from GOD.There is so much reassurance, beauty and truth. Can we \\"prove\\" any of this information? Not with scientific data, however, we CAN ask anyone who HAS \\"died\\", went to the other side, and came back.Of course every person's death experience will be as unique as the person, and THIS is \\"why\\" this book is so important!There is GRAND LIFE in the death experience. I would also HIGHLY suggest this book to anyone who misses a loved one who has passed on. I feel you will receive a great deal of relief and inner peace from this book.I also feel this book would be PERFECT for anyone who does have a terminal illness, and IS facing \\"death\\" in the near future. I am positive it will bring the same feeling of relief and inner peace.This is an OUTSTANDING book that I recommend from my heart. The subject matter goes into ultra fine detail, and there is not a dull moment in the read.Thank you, Neale, for your extraordinary contribution to humanity!This book deserves at minimum 10 stars!Barbara Rose, Ph.D. author of If God Was Like Man, Know Yourself and If God Hears Me, I Want an Answer!"},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"The reviews here are essentially: \\"I loved it\\", or \\"What kind of drugs are you on?\\", with a few, \\"hey, it's not the Bible!\\" thrown in for good measure.As the authors (I'll give Neale the benefit of the doubt, not that it really matters) are simply trying to help us all make sense of the unknown. Religions have been doing this for millenium, but how many religions have updated their doctines to keep up with new information? None. So people get fed up and decide to find the answers for themselves.The beautiful thing about the whole series is that it is internally very consistent, sort of a light version of \\"A Course in Miracles\\" (and a LOT easier to read). This last book actually does a nice job of bridging some of the differences between the two. It all comes down to what you want to believe. Actually, this is basically the message of the entire series: \\"if there is a God, and he created us like Himself, then we too would be God, and could do/have whatever we want\\". The problem is that our previously imprinted beliefs are so strong that we limit ourselves because we don't even really understand the concept of desire and how it manifests itself in our lives.If you read this book, what you will get out of it depends on: (a) how open your mind is; and (b) how much you want to believe the material. If you have (a) but not (b), you'll probably find it thought provoking. If you have (b) but not (a), you'll probably find it blasphemous. If you have neither, don't bother reading it. If you have both, you will find the experience truly uplifting - and may possibly never be the same (in a very good way!)."},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"I have read all eight books in the \\"With God\\" series a few times now and I must say they are the best books I have ever read. The first book came to my life when I needed it most. I was depressed during the writing of my Master's thesis. I was smoking Marijuana half of the day and playing Quake III Arena online. At that time, I was an atheist and did not know what to do with my life. Then I got a wrist injury and could not game anymore or write my thesis. Then that Christmas (2000), I got the first book \\"Conversations with God\\" from my girlfriend. When I read it, I realized this was the book I had been waiting for all my life. I was an atheist because I never believed in Christian concepts such as Hell, original sin, the Church etc. These concepts made no sense to me. I thought if that is God than I am rather an Atheist. But in these books I found a God which I could really believe in. A God who is unconditional love, non-judgmental, peace, joy, wisdom and gentleness. I immediately read all the books of the series I could lay my hands on. Everything made perfect sense to me I immediately agreed with almost everything. I saw it as if someone had finally written down what I always had believed subconsciously. When I started reading these books, I asked God: are these books really true? Do you really exist? I must say that God answered me. During that period some extremely unlikely coincidences occurred to me which I perceived as signs from God. Then I was sure: this IS MY truth.However, applying these books to your life is not easy. When you read these books, you realize that most ideas you had about God, life, humans and the world are completely different from what you learn from these books. This requires a great willingness to change. It requires great courage to closely investigate you own ideas and see if they are still valid or not. Many people never challenge their own ideas and want to keep them the same throughout their lives. They just believe what they have been taught and do not challenge their own ideas and others such as politicians and religious leaders.I must be said that these books can make one feel lonely from time to time, because you realize that your ideas about life and God have become completely different from most people around you. As such, discovering your truth can be a burden from time to time. However, given the current state of our world, the endless wars, (religious) intolerance, and rapid decline of our environment, a new way of thinking and living is required if we are to survive as a species. I believe that these books offer us compelling solutions for the great challenges our world faces today. Therefore, I urge everyone to read these books.Now with this book this magnificent series has sadly come to an end. With the first three books, I must say that this is the best book of them all. However, the ideas, which are discussed in this book, are rather advanced so I would advise people to start with the first three books.I thank Neale Donald Walsch and God (and myself and all people) for bringing humanity and me these powerful, hopeful books, which are full of love, wisdom, and understanding.If I would ever recommend a book, I would suggest to read these books.Be Blessed..."},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"When I was 14 years old, I had what is called a \\"spontaneous mystical experience,\\" which put me in direct contact with the eternality of my soul. I have never forgotten that experience, and what it taught me about \\"death\\" -- the fact that there is no real death. We are, in every sense of the word, eternal beings. Ever since that experience, I have tried to put it into words, and many authors have helped me do just that. But this last addition to the Conversations With God series is, by far, the most detailed and eloquent expression of what it means to live eternally.

This book gives us the description of the journeys thru death and then gives us an idea of where we go, who we see, what awaits us...it is our design much like all else of life. It will take you on several journeys that we will all go through and the \\"why\\" of our choices to do so. It is \\"the\\" most unexpected information and I was brought to tears and then to deep reflection that lasted days after reading the information. I was so enthralled in the book and what it was telling me that I spent 3 days not doing much else but reading and contemplating what I was learning. Some of it IS hard to believe, (though I find that I definately can!) just as the reader is warned, but I found it ALL to be what I would desire, and partially what I had dreamed that it would be. This is eye opening, it will cause the heart to strain at what is learned and it is without a doubt most hopeful.

Degree but even some of this was confusing for me.Then around Chapter 27 or so it changed. What led me to this series in the beginning had now come full circle - and in time! I recently lost both of my parents - within 82 days of each other - and was having a hard time. This has made me remember all I know. The other reviews detail the books contents quite well so I won't duplicate that here.Seven years ago I started a spiritual seeking that led me through 200 books on all religions but one book - Friendship With God - led me to what I'd always felt in my heart. Communion with God was even more clear and now this book. I did read all the others but these 3, if you must read any of the books in the CWG series - these 3 are the ones to read.It is not the end as most CWG readers know - we all re-visit the books over and over - Re-membering something new each time.I highly recommend this book and series."},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"This is a book comforting people about death. It brings an understanding of very real circumstances (life after physical death) to those who are perhaps afraid of death. It brings solace for those who are morning the death of a loved one.For those of you who have a problem with this, writing a political thesis as a \\"book review\\" it looks rather odd. If you believe people just die, why bother reviewing the book to begin with, you obviously haven't read it, because if you did, you would know that we do not have just one life, and life continues after this life is over.The author is entitled to promote his book to help people, and to reach people. It wasn't written to just sit in a box. Perhaps if you had a conversation with God, you might get excited about it too.

However, I always get the feeling on reading his works his God is a very wishy-washy one.The conversations seem to reveal a God who is basically what Walsch would like God to be; God is sort of like a friendly grandpa, all we have to do is take some time off from our day and talk to him. While I would certainly agree God's love is important, his version of God is very hard to believe, as are his 'revelations.' How can we know what Walsch claims to experience really is God? God seems very vague and changeable in Walsch's book, and strangely conducive to our wishes and shallow.While Walsch may stumble on truths, like much New Age material it is very vague, to the point where virtually anything can be said about the realm of spirit, even if they are mutually contradictory. Such a faith is a bit too soft-headed for my liking."},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"An excellent book series, Neale is a brave man. Obviously Alex Alaniz (Los Alamos, NM) has not read the book. CWG suggests that religions need to become more inclusive, in fact on page 97 Neale takes a jab at the Church's dogmatic ways. God wisely responds, \\"No comment.\\" For this book to do anything for you, an open mind is necessary, an idea most religion's could find helpful."},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"Definitely the right content to close off the CWG series, with amazing perspective on the meaning of death, dying, and its relation to life itself.It will give the reader a 'good' feeling about what will happen when the time is there for him/her self. Something like the message in the books of Elisabeth Kuebler-Ross, but there's more in this book. The explanation using the principles of Quantum mechanics - and all this coming from God Himself - really an eye opener.L. Lugita"},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"An Amazon reviewer from Australia pointed out something that seems to me extremely important. He said that the trick of having a conversation with God, enables the author to peddle his ideas as if they have the authoritative confirmation of a higher power. It also works to diminish the criticism of those ideas, for who wants to presume to know more than God.Worse than this, I find the whole business of a human pretending to know what no human can know, arrogant and offensive. The great medieval philosopher Moshe Maimonedes ( The Rambam) said that in regard to certain questions such as the character of the life or world - to- come human beings should not presume to know what no one can know.Certainly no one should pretend to reduce God to a certain set of simple formulas which work to satisfy the human being's own conception.I believe that instead of pretending that we know about life- after- death, or 'the world- to-come ' that we should pray for God's help for ourselves and for those we love.And perhaps we too should end our lives praying and not knowing for certain what will become of us."},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"Thank you publisher and author. Also, thank you Jesus Christ my lord/"},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"\\"Home with God\\" is the first Neale Donald Walsch book I've read.I ask myself the following questions:1 If he has already written lots of books containing \\"conversations with God\\", how come he keeps asking all those rather naive and ignorant questions in this book? Had he read (let alone written?) just a few esotheric books there wouldn't be any need for most of these basic questions.2 Just how does he get hold of the information he claims he gets from God? Why is this kept a secret?3 The book seems an ego trip to me. Walsch's questions seems at least as important or \\"well formulated\\" as \\"God\\"s answers. Who is the protagonist here? Walsch or God?Conclusion: I didn't learn anything new, I just got irritated.I'm normally a very positive person, and I feel a little cruel writing this, but those are my thoughts."},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"It is practically impossible to read this book with a straight face. The images and the dialogue are so sophmoric that one begins to wonder how the author could write this \\"dialogue\\" without blushing. To wrap genuine esoteric thought and principles up in such drivle is not worthy of the topic he addresses. Like most beginner's texts, it will prove to be either a stepping stone as an introduction to real life and death issues, or it will serve as a stumbling block to those who think that in reading this book they have found the \\"Truth\\" and will stop searching for real enlightment."},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"A friend gave me this book when my father passed away suddenly. I'd read much of Neale Donald Walsch's work, and loved it, but hadn't heard about this one. While I was at home back east with my family right after Dad left, I was reading it every night at bedtime, and actually feeling HAPPY for my Dad rather than SAD for us \\"losing\\" him. Neale's work puts everything in perspective for me, expands upon my intuition of the circular nature of life, and it makes SO much sense! I highly recommend this book for anyone grieving the loss of a loved one, OR openly searching for answers to the meaning of life. I now have a great sense of peace and acceptance surrounding death AND life...the peace that passeth understanding. This takes all I learned in Sunday School (Dad was a Methodist minister) to a WHOLE 'NOTHER LEVEL! One that works for me as an inquisitive soul searching adult, and takes NOTHING away from my traditional Christian upbringing. It just adds fresh perspective to what I was taught, and in my opinion, really resonates with the words of Jesus. It's like the next layer of understanding for me...now that I'm ready for it. Why wouldn't God keep speaking to us today, in these changing times of evolving intellect and heightened awareness? Thank you, Neale, for being the messenger practical hope and clarity."},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"Neale Donald Walsh has written many books and I believe them all to be very helpful in finding one's own truth. This book is another way to see how life and death compliment one another and to release the fear of dying. Hopefully you have been working on understanding reality/life for a while, because if you are looking for answers, this book may create more questions. It is a very deep perception of reality. Remember, we are all born knowing we will die...this book gives a different perspective to how this happens ...or does it? What is your truth?"},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"This is a fantasy trip into the real reality of spirit. As such, it provides answers to the questions man has posed throughout all of history.God's responses to those questions are easy to understand, practical, and inspirational.

What's truly amazing is the feeling of love that is promoted throughout all chapters...Isn't that Godlike?"},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"Home with God brings a great understanding about where we are, where we're headed and how to get there even now while in our life.There are wonderful examples and explanations about how we create our existence on the other side, just like on this side here on earth.

In it, Neale Walsch converses with God one final time and explores the topic of death. Without going into the dialogue, which really must be experienced through reading it, what I felt as a result of reading this book is an immense sense of knowing. A sort of \\"ah-ha\\", that this feels right. Such a fitting and beautiful book to end the CWG series. Thank you Neale and thank you God for such a beautiful message.

This is as much as we can know and understand about the physical \\"death\\" process and what comes after, without actually being \\"there\\". As our thoughts and beliefs about death affect our experience of it, this is valuable information. It's time to let go of our fear, and to understand that birth and death are the same. There's also some great information on how we create our lives and experiences, both physical & non-physical, wondrously and multi-dimensionally."},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"Looking back over the 69 years of my life, my experiences with communication from the \\"other side\\" are validated by Neale's book. The fact that his writings came from spirit is very credible to me. Believe what you read and you will never fear death.My mother and father were spiritualist mediums who met in Lily Dale, NY. Two months after I was born, their marriage fell apart. The day after my 6th birthday, my destitute mother took me to a Lutheran orphanage where I spent 11.5 years learning the bible. Mom visited me once a week and I got to know her spirit guide, White Eagle, who would speak to me through her in a whisper voice. He called me his boy. It was normal for this little boy to be taught the bible and talk to a \\"dead\\" Indian.During engineering school and a stint as a Naval Aviator, I received several messages from the \\"spirit world\\" from mom that were \\"dead on\\".Was excited that Paul in 1Corinthians 14 said prophecy was the preferred spiritual gift. He even used spirits vs. Spirit when he said the spirits of the prophets were subject to the prophets (vs.32). Later versions of the bible changed that chapter to fit the religious beliefs of the translators. But, I had living proof of spirit communication.Dad died alone in Florida at age 75. They found his body five days later. Too late for a funeral. Heart attack or stroke, couldn't tell. Saw him only six times in my life. When my wife and I got back from getting his things, I asked mom if there was any kind of church where mediums worked. With no car and working six nights a week, Wednesday off, she hadn't been to the spiritualist church she knew about. We all went for the first time. Of course dad came through with five definite proofs that would have convicted O.J. The most memorable thing he said is that he asked for my forgiveness. The life traps from eleven years in the orphanage had already begun to hurt me. Dad's spirit came through an unfamiliar medium to us, absolutely no doubt in my mind.Mom died in my arms 13 years later at age 80, cardiac arrest in the hospital just at the end of visiting hours when all of her earthly loved ones had left except her two grandchildren and me. She died a wonderful death. I gave the eulogy recounting the sacrifices she made so I would be well taken care of. Arriving home after the cemetery, my wife called Hazel, a medium, one of many at the service, to thank her for the nice words she had said. Immediately, Hazel went into trance and my mother was on the other end of the line. My wife said my mother was on the phone and handed it to me. I said \\"Hello Hazel\\" but the voice said \\"I'm alright, I'm alright, I'm younger than I used to be.\\" It was mom speaking in the faint voice White Eagle would use.When I retired from a successful insurance career, I took a two year course at Lily Dale and became a medium. After giving several very credible messages from spirit, I was satisfied, personally, of spirit communication.Many books later, I came upon Walsch's first book. Having had a lifetime of proof of spirit communication, I soaked up the whole series. The final book would be familiar to any spiritualist but the details of what happens following death are far more credible and revealing than any of the previous such books.Believe what you read, its true. At least, take the best and leave the rest. If the information seems unbelievable to you, check the scale against which you are comparing it. Is your scale credible or did you just accept it as true?IS it hard to believe that we are the creator? My Lutheran confirmation verse was Matthew 7:7- \\"Ask and it, etc.\\" Isn't that creating?You will definitely enjoy the book, now or later. Buy it new."},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"I have been riveted by Walsch's books for the past ten years, and indeed, they have altered my perception of life. In February, I heard that this book was soon to be published and I looked forward to buying it. In fact, I kept reminding myself to buy it from time to time...to watch for it in March.Quite unbelievably, my father passed away just days ago, at a young age and very suddenly. He was my mentor, my sage.. an endearing and fulfilling part of my life. Wise beyond his time, his beliefs and the way he lived his life were very unusual and extraordinary. His passing was a shock and a great loss to all who knew him. I have never known such sadness and suffering.And yet, the idea of this book popped into my head just days after his passing and I can't tell you what comfort it was to see it on the shelf when I set off to find it. Some of the concepts and ideas are incredible to grasp, but yet, they ring true and broaden our perceptions in such amazing ways.

In the final book, God filtered through Neale, leads us through what the world really needs right now. Right from book one when God described how really we should view the 10 commandments to His explaining how death in this realm effects us (we never really die we just move on/back/sideways/forward/circular or any way we feel)I found myself saying yes yes yes!!! I always felt that religion was missing what God really expected of us (nothing/everything). I am at peace and in love with where I am at. Thank you God! I love you!"},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"What a wonderful book this is! Showing how life lives on, love lives on, and we can always be certain that we both take with us, and leave behind, every good deed that lives in the hearts of those we love. This is just a beautiful book, and one to remember!"},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"First of all, I love the controversy on here. I think it's great to have a lively debate on perhaps the biggest question of all time (Is there life after death?)I would like to say, also, that this book is hard to rate. Mostly, because I can see how different groups of people would have widely different points of view on this book.I gave this book a 5-star rating, because, I believe that FOR IT'S PRIMARY AUDIENCE (people who like Neale's books) this is very much an excellent book. I would say that this book is really \\"written for the fans\\" of this series. It is a great end to the Neale Donald Walsch series. It should not be the first book that a new reader of the series reads, because the concepts are truly out of this world. It contains mind-bending and mind-blowing revelations that are wild and unbelievable even to those already familiar with Neale's books (therefore, it is NOT simply all old material from Neale's other books restated -- it is stuff you've never heard before). I just want to say that if you find Neale's concept of death and the afterlife to be true for you, you will DEFINATLEY have a completely new view of death, no matter how familiar you are with the Conversations With God series. There is a revelation towards the end of the book, called the \\"Holy Inquiry,\\" that will blow you away. Neale also provided visual illustrations to help people grasp difficult concepts such as \\"time is an illusion\\" and parallel universes. From a simple visual illustration that the book tells you to imagine, I understand this concept of space and time much better than ever before. And Neale has many stories of \\"real life examples\\" of death that may bring a tear to your eye. There is a lot of detail on the stages of death and specifically what happens at each stage. The tone is very warm and comforting.FOR THE AGNOSTIC, this is a one-star book. The reason for this is that this book simply describes the process of death and the afterlife, but does not really argue for the existence of an afterlife. I was surprised, because I really thought that it would. I realize that Neale says his mission is not to convert everybody, but simply to allow them to find their truth. But how can you do this if you simply write your truth about death? I believe it could have been written in a different way that would make it be at least a 3-4 star book for agnostics! I'm not saying that it could have been better, I'm just saying that I would have written it differently to appeal more to my agnostic friends......Throughout Neale's books, there have been many passages that had such a philosophical ring of truth, that after reading it, I felt a \\"high\\". The first 100 pages make so much sense that even my atheist friend who borrowed the book ended up saying \\"well... maybe\\" after reading it. Communion with God provides a detailed, 10-step argument for the unity of all life (describing the \\"10 illusions of humans\\" and why they are just illusions). If this book, \\"Home With God,\\" argued for the afterlife using the argument from some of Neale's first books, it would have appealed to a wider audience.In conclusion, this book is fantastic for fans of Neale's work, but may not satisfy the agnostic. For the first time reader of Neale's work, read Conversations with God, Book 1, or Communion with God."},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"This book, \\"Home with God\\" by Neale Donald Walsch, is truly a Gift from yourSELF to yourself; a remarkable journey to the Moment of \`Only NOW' that holds ALL There IS. It's a beautifully orchestrated tool of remembrance [as Neale writes] and not really a teaching at all. Your Soul will remember and resonate with its eternal Truths as it opens to them, like a thousand pedaled lotus opening to the Core of ITS BEING, Our BEING. My husband and I believe that there is Ultimate Reality, beyond the Space/Time continuum, and that when one of us leaves their physical body, in \`no time at all', the other will be there in re-Union. This is a quote from \\"Home with God\\" that resonates with us so perfectly:\\"Such is the wonder of the ultimate Reality that, though it may be experienced as a long while for those who remain living in physicality within the illusion of time, it will be in your own Moment of Now that you will be reunited.\\" Pg 300If you are reading these words, your Soul has invited you to read this book. Do it now. Accept the gift and then BE the Gift. Love is truly all there IS. I-Love-You &lt;- All are ONE."},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"Some of the reviews on here are baffling! I'm sorry to hear how bad life is for some people, how they put down others for offering hope and inspiration to others who need it. True, Neale Walsch has seemed to hit the same topics over and over with his Conversations With God series of books. I'm a natural skeptic about people who release book after book with little variation between them. Does it seem like a money making scheme? Well...my suggestion is, don't buy it then. That's what libraries are for. I checked out some of his previous books from the library and read them and was struck by his message. With so much bad news out there and pain and cynicism...it's refreshing to be reminded of our spiritual nature, with humor, hope, and inspiration to get us to look past the petty details of life at the larger picture that will emerge at the end of it.So...cynics beware! This book is not for you perhaps, but if life is so great for you, then why are you putting down writers and readers who are only trying to help each other see the meaning behind life? Such level of nastiness in reviews means there is an underlying disappointment, sadness, anger, hostility that isn't being addressed. I hope you will find peace someday and come to know true, authentic spirituality in whatever form suits you best. I'm a \\"nobody\\" and yet I can attest to life's mysterious design. I've had many coincidences with spiritual relevance that can't be explained by science. I've manifested dreams into reality. So when I read similar messages by people such as Neale Walsch and Wayne Dyer and James Redfield and others...I know what they are saying is true...because I've seen it in my own life.For the critic who asked why Neale was special enough to \\"talk to God\\" and record His responses...you haven't read the series, have you? Neale explains it in one of his earlier books. It's not that he's special for writing it and a lot of it isn't even \\"THE TRUTH\\"...it's just one man's conversation with the divine source and what he learned has universal relevance for others. Reading this book series shouldn't prevent you from having your own conversations with God. But for those who attended church and were told that you weren't worthy enough to talk to God, then this series is meant for you, to inspire you. God is far greater than the image any religion can give Him. God doesn't hate anyone, for God is the essence of love. Forgiving, unrelenting, pure...and basking in that love is the greatest drug you could ever take in your life.So, don't listen to the cynics and the skeptics who only love to tear away at other people's happiness. Read this (whether you buy it new, used, or borrow from a library or friend) and let it inspire you to have your own conversations with God. I guarantee that it's a journey well worth taking."},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"I must say I agree with Neale's conclusions within this book. I remember bits of previous live's, and so I at least believe it possible that we go on in some way. Truth be told though, I think we go on as a continous expression of \\"oneness\\". The more each of us realizes that everything is linked, then the acceptance of the possibility of linking with any life at any time becomes a distinct possibility, as well as linking with alternate us's. Now, wouldn't that be living -- to freely play with possibility; to freely talk to our ancestors, while truly loving and living with those of us with us now; to freely listen to our inner hearts and do what we really want to do. It serves little purpose to get bogged down in religion or \\"god\\" \\"goddess\\" \\"universe\\" type thinking (my way is the only way, bleh...) and I much prefer a goddess god archetype than neale's \\"God\\", but what of it -- I still enjoyed the book. Now, do I think the hype neale is generating for this book is a bit ridiculous. Yes. There is a tendency for those of us today to look to books and gurus like this as the new religion. Look inside yourselves ... You don't need this book ... If you read it as a pleasant companion, and realize it's just not that important, and enjoy an adventure ... GOOD! If you worship it, and pledge money to Neale's growing fortune ... BAD or not :) If you use the book as an impetus to believe you can make your life and other's lives better ... VERY GOOD! If you blindly believe whatever you think the author of this book would want you to and live your life not following your inner dream ... VERY BAD. If the book is drawn to you, then enjoy it, but don't fall for hype. A book is not as important as the heart and soul of it's reader. Listen to your inner voice and let go of that which does not serve you."},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"Out of 323 pages, am only at page 129 after having the book for over a month now. I have to \\"chew\\" it, close it and \\"think about what is being said\\", but the time element is of no concern to me as there is so much to learn from these teachings. Having been a Catholic for 32 years, I left the church much to the dismay of my relatives, especially because I was \\"depriving your children\\" (mine) of the one, true, catholic and apostolic faith. Because \\"I\\" could not believe in the teachings of the church, nothing my family could say produced guilt or the shame that I always felt in the Catholic church. After going to many other churches, from JW's to Pentecostals and all in between, I came to a conclusion. There is no \\"right\\" religion; in fact, organized religion causes much division and war! I had my own pre-conceived notion of who God is/was which brought me much peace, but I'd had no actual confirmation outside of myself to affirm what I believed. That is, until I got my hands on Conversations With God, and there it was finally! The saying that \\"when the student is ready, the teacher will come\\" was crystal clear to me in that moment!I could never conceive of a \\"loving\\" Father/Mother/Creator sending Its Child to a place of eternal damnation; could you as a parent, no matter what your child did, turn your back and say, \\"you are damned to burn forever!\\" Wow, I could not! I don't believe in hell, I think it exists right here on earth over many lifetimes, and that we come back as often as we'd like to learn from prior (you may call them \\"mistakes\\", I choose to call them \\"experiences\\") which we want to repair, grow from, therefore, spiritual evolution. Oh, my, yes....Reincarnation! Second chances! Who'da thought that a loving parent would give second, third, fourth, a million, etc. chances.Yes, the words in his books completely resonated with my soul and I felt more peace than I'd ever experienced before. Home With God shows the reality of a loving Parent while He explains scientific truths and universal laws about what happens when we pass over into the next plane, the ease of death compared to the horrible physical suffering of illness. Some may find this to be esoteric BS, but from young adulthood, I knew that I was being taught to believe what \\"others\\" felt safe in believing and teaching me, not actually what \\"was\\" or \\"might be\\". Call me a maverick, but Neale Donald Walsch's books have moved me to a higher spiritual plane and a perception of the great,wonderful, all-encompassing and unconditional love of the Creator and the Universe.If you are wondering what to believe, having doubts about your faith, just try reading one of these books, stick with it for a bit, read the sentences over again until you understand. You might find the peace you are looking for."},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"Over the years I've read many of Mr. Walsch's books because I found the content to be inspirational or thought-provoking in several ways. I particularly liked \\"Conversations with God Book 1\\" (CwG Book 1) because it had a profound effect on my spiritual philosophy. In this book Walsch focuses primarily on the after-life, and if that is a serious interest of yours then this would be a good book to read. If not, then I'd recommend considering one of his other titles instead, such as \\"Friendship with God\\"Friendship with God: An Uncommon Dialoguefor example, or CwG Book 1Conversations with God : An Uncommon Dialogue (Book 1), which in my view remains the best work he has ever done."},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"Over the millennia a most malevolent, pernicious, petrifying air has surrounded the mystery of death, thus I argue it has nearly disqualified many from living. That constantly being absorbed in, or rather, paralyzed by the thought of death, non-existence, oblivion would produce a hellacious state of living is obvious.However; analogous to the main precept of the CwG cosmogony, that being that human kind \\"Has God all wrong,\\" what if human kind has death all wrong as well? What if death in not synonymous with nonexistence? What if death and oblivion are mutually exclusive terms? What if death is a beautiful expression of being, evolution and creation just like birth? What if death was really just a matter of going home? What if death was/is an illusion as the Christed One clearly tried to demonstrate (among many other things) two thousand years ago?To take a very personal tack for just a moment; the hellfire, brimstone and damnation stories of my childhood in the R.C. church scared the crap out of me! It foisted upon my shoulders (and billions of others as well) such mind boggling inconsistencies, ambiguity, terror, as well as the burden of our \\"spiritual teachers\\" misguided and even insidious thinking - it's a wonder there aren't insane asylums on every corner! The fact that there aren't, doesn't mean we think or behave in a sane capacity however.Neale Donald Walsch has written a piece the gently asks, begs and encourages us to look at death and thus life from the perspective of a 180 degree turn. Deathdays (or continuance days) like birthdays should be celebrated, not mourned. Life is not akin to a line segment having an origin and a terminus, but rather a circle which has neither. And while the death of a friend or loved one could certainly be lamented, it doesn't have to lead to debilitating grief if one understands that the ensuing separation (illusory as it is, as one is never really separated from anyone else) is in the grand scheme of things, quite transient.This is my fourth or fifth pass through this wondrous work and I'm sure it will not be my last. A new way of thinking about life and living that is joyful, articulate, wise and inspiring deserves 2,759 stars, but I'm only allowed to select at most 5.

Death and the conversing and questioning has been taboo in America.....up until great Mediums like James Van Praagh and John Edward brought the Life After Life concept and made it real to us thru the medium of television.

For those who yearn to learn more about what happens when we die, you'll find a very clear description of that . . . as well as the purpose of life and what happens between lives. I especially found intriguing the concept that we can incarnate as the same \\"person\\" many times (reliving the same \\"life\\" several or many times over), but making different decisions during each lifetime. If you resonate with other CWG books, Home With God will be thoroughly satisfying. The author is not out to convince anyone that this is the only Truth -- as you read it you'll definitely know if it's Truth for you."},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"The perfect end to this series. The tone throughout is one of peace, love, and reassurance. This is a joy to read."},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"Through Neale's extraordinary clarity, I recognized the voice of God that had spoken to me since childhood. I believe these books will resonate throughout the world forever, touching the hearts and changing the lives of millions of people along the way. Thank you, Neale, for your contribution to us all."},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"Great read as all the series are. Very deep information here and although it does its best to simplify its subject and topic matter, it is still a complex subject. The words will be an affirmation to any who are well along their spiritual journey and can be enlightenment to those who are somewhere mid path and may be overwhelming for those beginning their path. Those who aspire to a religious belief can embrace the book, reject it, or accept something in between. The conversation in its attempt to \\"simplify\\" the covered subject material, may lead you to create some conclusions that allow you to have a basic understanding of the mechanics of our existence, birth and death. How easy is it to explain that all things that have been, will be, and are exist in the infinite moment of \\"now\\" and that there is only \\"one\\" of us here? How does one explain that \\"you\\" exist and yet \\"you\\" do not? How does one explain how \\"you\\" create all that IS and yet ALL THAT IS is already created? Yes, very hard to wrap your MIND around, but this book makes a great attempt at trying to explain this. It will be a lot to digest depending on the level of your spiritual growth. You will get out of it what you need to get out of it. It is a book to review and re-read if you are one on an evolving path of spirituality, more of the text will become clearer. I suggest a few other titles that will compliment this in that they will aide in a better understanding. No one person has all the answers. Many people have the pieces and by connecting the pieces as in a puzzle, the whole picture becomes clearer and better seen. Read, STALKING THE WILD PENDULUM (Soft cover) by Itzhak Bentov. A good read on the mechanics of the world we exist in and how it relates to God as ONE. THE HEARTMATH SOLUTION (Soft cover) by Doc Childre and Howard Martin. Clearly defines the connectidness of heart and mind and how it relates to your physical experience and intuition. AWARENESS (Soft cover) by Anthony deMello. Its all in how you look at things that creates your reality. But who taught you to look at things the way you do? Change your view and you change your reality. DISAPPEARANCE OF THE UNIVERSE (Soft cover) by Gary R. Renard is a great companion book that explains much about the human experience and the MIND/EGO. Be careful in allowing what \\"you\\" want to envision or understand as opposed to what IS. You must understand that your MIND will influence what you WANT to see versus what IS. All of the titles mentioned are areas spoke of in HOME WITH GOD. There seems to be a trend to this \\"create my reality\\" thing. It is covered in this CWG book, but it is simplified for you so that you may understand it, but it is not as simple as it is made out to be. You don't really create anything if ALL exist simultaneously at the moment of NOW, which is another definition of GOD. Those organizations or publications which promote this revelation are not incorrect, but neither are they correct because they do not fully understand the mechanics. A person can easily get sucked into this \\"trap\\" into believeing this because they want to believe it. If you are one of those types, I suggest you look deep within and figure out \\"why\\" you believe this or want to. What is it YOU are lacking? If you believe you can \\"create your day\\" or \\"create\\" anything for that matter, then this would signify that you have \\"control\\". How can one have control, when it is GOD who has control? YOUR control is simply an illusion of control as you believe it to be. Does your control override another beings control in creating a desired outcome, event, or situation? CWG does simplify this aspect, but think about it deeply as it is not quite this simple. It would be better to simply understand that ALL possibilities exist at every given moment in time and that all time exists in the momemt of NOW. And time does not exist as we exist eternal and that moment just IS. HaHaHa, complex yet so simple it almost makes no sense! So, you do not \\"simply\\" create anything at all if ALL exists. What you can do is bring into your reality, that which you desire, but ONLY if it is on your present path of destiny to which you are presently on. You are not creating anything if ALL exists already. What you are doing is navigating your path through life to bring into your reality that which you desire. This book uses for an example the room in which you enter navigate) and are finally drawn (navigate) to a book you have been seeking (navigating towards). Your path may have never taken you into this room IF it was not part of your destiny, no matter how much you prayed, hoped, or desired to have that book. You are not alone, and it could have been the destiny of another to have that book. It does not mean that you should give up either. Your destiny might simply take you (navigate) to the person who has the book and he/she becomes a friend and you get to borrow the book and read it without the ownership of the book. The end result IS still the same, access to the book to read. This is just a small topic covered in this title and there are so much more. I simply used this example to demonstrate that simplification of complex matters does not make them any less complex, simply easier to grasp the concept. Then look deeper into the mechanics of how it really works. There is an answer out there that has been given to someone. Find that someone and you will find YOUR answer. This book provides many answers. Believe it. KNOW IT."},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"The book is powerful and straight-forward. To say that it is \\"uplifting\\" is inadequate to describe the heights to which the conversation inspires the reader and clears the channels to the reader's own truth."},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"For all those critics who think that God couldn't have a hand in writing the 'Conversations with God' series and this latest book... have a think about this:God did not write the bible ... it was, believe it or not, actually written by human beings. And not just one. Not only that, it was written in a rather different world to suit different needs. Sure, much of it may have been inspired by God, but it was still filtered by humans. And than much of the early word of God has been twisted and distorted to enable certain religions to preach fear - and thus try to control the masses. Thankfully, most these days can see right through this.So, now, there are many who again are writing and are inspired by God. And thank heavens - it is more appropriate to us now.Thank you Neale, thank you God, and thank you to all the other wonderful teachers and students are likewise being inspired. As CWG states, this isn't the only way, it's just another way."},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"I can't figure out what all of the conflict is about this book, but after reading it I can at least guess that most if not all of the one star reviews must come from people who really didn't read it.I enjoyed this book and learned so much from it! There is nothing negative in here, and I no longer fear death! The conversation between Neale Donald Walsch and God goes beyond just the death subject, it also deals a lot with life now. It discusses how people do live a \\"living hell\\" right here on earth, and how people also live \\"heaven on earth.\\"I wish the people who are so determined to blast this book would read it and give it a chance. It is a moving read, and there's a lot to learn from it! Of course if you feel you know more than God, and have nothing to learn, then by all means continue to trash any book where the title or subject may not be to your liking. But if you are going to review a book, it would be a good idea to read it so your review can reflect an honest approach.With that being said, I loved the book, and as another reviewer wrote I would also recommend it to anyone facing death, and for anyone who is grieving the loss of a loved one. \\"Home with God\\" brings some great answers. It's definitely a great contribution for this subject, and will help you understand much more about life because that is what happpens after physical death, there is a new life.Read and learn, you'll be glad you did!"},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"I don't want to rehash what's been said above but I do agree with most of it. What I want to add is that the book says as much about living as it does about dying! In my case, I was going through an experience where I felt the victim of a life situation and 2 people I love dearly were the villains. Beginning on page 41 \\"God\\" says:\\".....there are no victims and no villains.\\" Me=?????? \\"He\\" goes on to talk about perspective creating perception and in the next 8 pages I went from feeling the victim to feeling blessed and the feeling has lasted, my life is changed.If the book changed my life for the better it might change yours also??Thanks Mr. Walsch."},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"Top Drawer! I have read all of the Conversations books. I have always maintained that Book 1 was the penultimate of this entire series...every other book up to this one, has just been commentary. Now, here we are, at the end of this magnificent series, and I say BRAVO! Neale and God, in their co-creation of these books, has finally put into place a book equally worthy to Book 1. In essence, we have the Alpha and the Omega. I have read a lot of channeled \\"Dialogue\\" style books...as a matter of fact, I have spent a great many years searching for every one that I can find, and in having read many other books from people who have passed on, to books written by those on the other side, to NDE experiences...I have never read a book until this one, which was so clear and concise, so crystal perfect in it's statement, about the purpose of IT ALL...Yet, there were glimpses, even in book 1 of things to come. If you do not believe me, go back now my friends, and re-read it with hindsight. There is much in Book 1 thathas been restated over and over again in all the others...but this one, THIS \\"ONE\\" is finally the most eloquent. In Neal Donald's typical fashion, his ability to speak planely, in words we all could understand...his ability to connect with you and I...in the face of the most profound concepts...I believe, was the reason and remains the reason why Neale was selected to be the One of us, who transmitted all this wonderful information to Us all. In sitting down and thinking about what I just read, a fantastic idea came to me, that it wasn't EVER really, a two way conversation between just Neale and God, it was always a THREE Way conversation, between the reader, Neale and God. Thus what we have been experiencing here is a Trinity, most appropo in its beginning and ending. I am deeply going to miss the \\"next\\" dialogue which will not take place between the three of us again. I have waited patiently, but persistently, for every book in the series...now come to a startling and wholey succinct end...but the revelation that has poured into my mind is just this: The conversation NEVER ends! Haven't we all learned? The conversation will NEVER end. Neale has ended the three way dialogue, and now, it is up to all of us, to use the tools we have been given so that we each can have our OWN personal Conversation with God. If we have even learned a single thing from all the books, it is just this: We are ONE!We are Inseperable. The conversation never ends! Let us all have our own, personal, deeply loving conversation. There is no one more important than any other and all are of equal importance. Bravo Neale! Outstanding! Decisive! Thank You!"},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"I have been working on my enlightenment for 3 years now. I read practically anything I get my hands on. I have had some trying experiences in my life, within this incarnation. I realized that I wrote a very difficult chart, to experience what my soul decided on, before I was born. Having to deal with coming out of a 2 year prison term and dealing with the enormous ignorance that is around me, this has made me wonder... IF I can deal with staying around? And yes, I have tried suicide once and I was wondering if...I read an explanation from God about suicide. Chapter 10 (pgs. 59-62) covers it very well. \\"Two conditions classify a death as suicide. 1) You must be consciously aware what you are doing and 2) the purpose is of escaping your current life, rather than completing it.\\" Then God goes on to say that if these conditions are met, and you cross over, you would have to start your chart over at the beginning, in your next life. Not where you left off. Personally, ONCE is enough for me, in this particular chart! I Have lived many lives. Two I can remember. This life seems to be one of my most challenging incarnations.\\"We must achieve what we set out to do.\\" It's like a video game. You can not make it to the next level, until you complete the level you are currently on. For the last several years, I have longed to go home (Heaven). Now, I know that I am always home whereever/whenever and however I am. And that God is ALWAYS with me, at every moment. I am never alone! I find this book, and ALL of Mr. Walsch's books a GIFT! I don't care about what other people think of me. They live their truth and I have Ultimate Reality. Ultimate Reality is the only truth that is important to me, because it explains my reality. I am learning how I can see from a much larger point of view than most. Even psychically! YES! It's happened to me!! I am starting to see and FEEL psychically. I send blessings out to those who can see past their Earthly Illusion... The ones who have or are currently \\"waking up!\\" I also send larger blessings out to those who, are unable nor willing to have the desire, to see outside of the box.For those who wish to end their life and return home, PLEASE read this book. Then BELIEVE! Then read the book again!Many Thanks Neale! Job well done!"},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"Neale Donald Walsch, in my estimation, has only the best intentions in writing this series and is not out to exploit anyone or tell them only what they want to hear. Even if a statement seems to play to what people want, that does not make it automatically false. It is fine for Walsch to make a living writing books, and if he were out to make money, I could think of a lot of faster and less controversial ways to do so.This book challenges traditional ways of thinking about death. Many of us are unknowingly entrenched in hereditary prejudices and rigid schemas. This book is at odds with the deep seated beliefs of many people and thus provokes a negative reaction in some.Walsch does not \\"ally himself with God to make himself infalliable\\"; in the first book in this series (Conversations with God, Book 1), Walsch encourages us to question what is said; to not accept blindly what Walsch/God have to say. The book is not out to coerce anyone, which in my opinion is quite a relief from a lot of the current spirituality literature out there. The problem lies in most people's thoughts about who the \\"God\\" that Walsch refers to really is--many see him as lording over us with an iron rod; thus they think that this sort of character is offering us directives in these books. Not so. The God of this series is an inclusive, benevolent being that represents the best that all of us can arrive at, both individually and collectively. Therefore, ascribing something to God is the same as ascribing it to the best that humanity can arrive at. When we view God as an angry character entirely removed from human existence, that is where we have the holy wars and shouting matches and conversion attempts. This series is not at all about that mentality and aims to assuage a lot of the pain that comes from fundamentalist thinking of any genre.I commend Walsch on his courage to publish what he knew was volatile material that would be scoffed at by many. This book is worth reading even if you disagree with everything that is said, because you will still learn more about yourself and how you believe. If nothing else, you will have a backdrop against which to compare your ideas about death. I encourage you to truly consider what is written here. Try to bring an open mind to the table; whatever your conclusion, you will know Yourself better when you emerge."},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"I believe this book should be owned or read by everyone who will one day die/transition/crossover - i.e., every human being on this planet. Such a beautiful and lucid discussion by God/Neale Donald Walsch of what death is and means, and really, what life is and means. Sadly this is the last CWG book and such gratitude to Mr. Walsch for bringing through this absolutely awesome book to the human race. To my opinion the CWG books are possibly the most important messages humanity has ever received, especially at this most crucial time in our evolutionary development. I read this book in it's entirety yesterday (March 11, 2006) at a local Borders bookstore (sorry Amazon) and although it's not supposed to be published for another 2 weeks, there it was. A paradox but then, if you've read the CWG books, life is about paradoxes. If nothing else, this book should be read for the lovely and profound prayer God offers to be read to the dying. \\"Death\\" is something we all face and most fear, and reading this book makes this transition (when it is truly time) feel natural and welcome. Again, I feel strongly that copies of this book should be available at hospitals and hospices and anywhere transition is imminent. A fitting and amazing end to a true classic series. Namaste'!"},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"Conversations with God Books 1,2,3 and Friendship with God, were astounding enough, groundbreaking, original, but some of Neale's other books I found somewhat repetative, but perhaps they needed to be to keep the message going, but I was still yearning for the natural successor to the scientific and spiritual wowness of book 3. Home with God is it, this is the truly mind blowing book to the whole experience of crossing over from one dimension to another, what we call 'death'; But with the amount of psychic experience and links I have had with my 'departed' family, it has become very clear that 'death' doesn't happen, it doesn't even reigister on the radar. We simply change into another form, another body or shell/cloak if we wish, and we go on as before. Home with God is the highest level of writing I have ever read, which is clear and unlike the others I raced through with excitement this one, needs your full attention, it is truly new material, and you will need at least five reads for it to sink in, but you must buy it. It is truly magnificent, it is home."},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"\\"What would happen if I died today?\\"I know we all have asked this question to ourselves, many, many times.The fact is that understanding Death helps me in a big way to understand Life! I have come to a short way of explaining this: \\"The way you feel about Death is the way you Feel about Life.\\" That is, if you fear death you fear life. If you understand death you understand life, etc.I have had the chance to thank Neale in person for the powerfull inspiration he had given me in my life with his books. I thank him again in writing and in public because I now understand better than ever the intricances of Death and the wornderfull gift it is to be Alive and well.We are all one! Nothing we do is either right or wrong. The reason for everything is to BEcome what we Choose to Be. I personally love at page 115 where GOD explains the \\"100 Word Formula for All of Life\\": Hope, Believe, Know, Create, Experience, Express, and Become.Thanks Neale for this wonderfull gift of Love. Humanity appreciates your work VERY MUCH."},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"WOW - I had no idea when I purchased this book that it would be so packed with intense, mind-expanding, soul touching information - it's hard to find the words to describe how I've felt while reading \\"Home With God\\" - it's truly amazing! There are ideas/concepts about metaphysics, physics, life, \\"death\\", life after \\"death\\", time, \\"parallel universes\\", we as creators of our own experiences, the impact of our thoughts, words, and deeds, and much, much more!There is so much information, that I'm not quite sure where to begin... Let me give it a try.I feel like there are several \\"major\\" themes, and many \\"minor\\" themes within \\"Home With God\\". Here are just a few:*We don't have to go anywhere to be with God - we are ALREADY with God, and God is ALREADY with us!!! So, we can experience that amazing \\"feeling\\" of being in union with God RIGHT NOW - we don't have to wait until we \\"cross over\\" to enjoy this type of experience.Once we understand that, that God is already with us, and we are already with God - all day, every day - the \\"fear\\" we may have about this meeting starts to dissipate.*We create what we experience, both while in the \\"physical\\", and in the \\"spiritual\\" realms - so, if we're not happy with the life/death we are experiencing, what we need to do is take the time/effort to change our thoughts/ideas/perceptions, and what we're focusing on - this will then change our experience.*There is no \\"death\\" as we define it, it's just a different way of experiencing ourselves & what is around us*There are 3 stages after we leave our physical bodies, and each person will experience them differently based on their beliefs and expectations - but, in the end, everyone will \\"move on\\" to \\"Heaven\\", to begin experiencing/learning what their soul wants to until it decides to begin another lifetime.*We live physical lives to experience who we really areThere is so much more that I could add, but I don't want this review to turn into a book itself (smile). Suffice it to say that if you are at all interested in the \\"themes\\" above, I would HIGHLY recommend this book. One word of caution though, an open mind is a must.One more thing... I read \\"Home With God\\" once all the way through, and began realizing quite early on that this is one of those books that I'll need to read several times through to REALLY get the most out of it - you may want to do the same thing..."},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"Before you read my review, a screening process:Want to read a review from someone who says \\"meh? or a review from an entirely different book that doesn't use the book recommendation features and instead misplaces those reviews on this product's pages? Go read that.Want to read a review from someone that says nothing happens after you die, and then for some reason cares how you live? There's one of those too.Want to read words that aren't even a review, but 14 year olds having flame wars because their book is making millions of dollars too? Again, what variety!Finally, if it makes a difference to you whether or not these conversations are with a God of any kind, or if you take Walsch's series too seriously or worse verbatim...look away.The review:This book is the the most intense, most heady, and likewise most vulnerable CwG book to date. Good thing there won't be any more =) The first few chapters are empty and just rev up. When the convo gets going, it gets going. This isn't the normal self-congratulatory, high-and-mighty guru-speak Neale of the past umpteen books. This is frustrated and confused Neale, and it makes his character entertaining and the God character able to be down-to-Earth but not in a gimmicky, marketing, \\"cutesy\\" way but akin to something cool you might overhear at a restaurant. If you can keep up this is very entertaining stuff. Tons of people have written convos with God, so I learned a long time ago to not every worry about that part of these books, which ASK not to be absorbed directly and believed out of hand. The fact is that even if the content is a bit heady, chunky in structure, the man has a gift for writing, technical-proficiency wise and -especially- if the whole thing is BS is an incredible storyteller.Conversations with God is not fact or fiction. It is a format. When you can appreciate the dynamic of the layout, you can get on with thinking about the material, which builds intensity and has the single overall point of trying to live a good life and remain spiritually open.There are three short stints of beautiful poetic metaphor, and there's a new literary device of showing letters to emphasize the points he's trying to drive home. Nice touch. It's a read that's engaging enough to seem to go by quickly and there aren't a lot of playing-stupid setup-punchline mechanics at play. When you're thinking \\"Don't be stupid, ask this\\" he asks it to the God character and that helps the flow immensely. For the tone of the characters this might be the leanest and tightest piece he's made but you'll see what I mean when you read where there are places you can pick out and see that either something disagrees with you on such a strong level, or something is saying nothing and just has empty words around it, that you can identify them as mental blocks that kept the convo from going smoothly. Overall a great read and worth even the list price.Personally I find it hilarious that (as some others have pointed out) the squeakiest wheels reacting against the publication of these stories has been from the faith that most resembles its teachings. Half of today's Christians are people that practice the religion through boinking their mistress while judging other people and cursing them to Hell. Wait till they find out that Books-A-Million has this title away from the other CwGs and deliberately categorized in Christian Living. Why? Presumably because if you follow and understand Christianity for what it is, and put it into genuine practice, this book, and the first and third CwG books are essentially the life you would lead, so this kinda stuff would be of interest to you."},{"Title":"Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends","review":"This is the first book I've read on my kindle paper white.

As a devoted mother of only one child, it helped silence those fearful, unwelcome thoughts that I would have about losing her, as if I had some control over it.

Judging from the generous reviews I would love to read this book too. Sherman's book has been a revelation. I only recently re-discovered this wonderful writer and humanitarian-scholar of parapsychology and ESP since first discovering his work in the early to mid 1970's. I actually wanted to leave a comment regarding the seller of this book, Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends. The Collecktor gets (5) five stars from me. This seller is honest and has tremendous integrity and care of customers and satisfaction. I had ordered the Harold Sherman book I mentioned. It was listed with this seller but he could not find it in his inventory when he attempted to process the order.

It also has definitions of certain types of competitions, and how to start your own twirling group, or teach. I give it a 9, because It is very close to perfect, and I was impressed. But, since it is an older book, a couple(very few) advanced twirls that are new, are not in there. This didn't really bother me at purchasing, because it has so much to offer, and if you can do the twirls in this book, you can pretty much (with practice) get the newer twirls down pat.

This book may be recommended only to the prepared reader, who is ready to trace every speculation and calculation of the authors to find absence of common sense.To date the catalogue of stars containing 1028 stars from Chapters VII and VIII of the Almagest, the authors select on the basis of obscure criterion in contradiction with the logic of astronomical observations, and the words of Ptolemy himself only 8 stars of &quot;informational kernel&quot; as they call it. From these 8 stars only one - Arcturus has pronounced proper motion. As the systematical errors in latitudes of all stars in Bootes is very large, the authors obtain their X-th century. Than the authors select 18 observations of lunar eclipses which are provided by Ptolemy in the Almagest. Ignoring the precise dates and other information and taking only phases and separations in years, they find 18 medieval eclipses from which one third could not be observed at all in eastern hemisphere! After that they try to calculate 4 occultations of planets and find 4 dates with absolutely enormous errors in degrees. This immediately raises the question on the acquaintance of the authors with elementary technique of astronomical calculations. In only more or less appropriate date for Venus (but the calculations show that the distance was still 50 times (!) more than given) during the &quot;occultation&quot; in 2 degrees the Sun was shining!It seems that the authors have read the book &quot;How To Lie With Statistics&quot; - by Darrell Huff very attentively, unfortunately that can not be said about the works of generations of scholars studying the Almagest."},{"Title":"Geometrical and Statistical Methods of Analysis of Star Configurations Dating Ptolemy's Almagest","review":"This book is for prepared reader only, but I share all ideas discussed in this book."},{"Title":"Geometrical and Statistical Methods of Analysis of Star Configurations Dating Ptolemy's Almagest","review":"Few years ago I was a student of chemistry department, Moscow State University.

It comes from a veteran CBS news correspondent with strong connections to these world communities, reflects his journalistic experience, and proves a strong survey of not only American and Islam ideas, but how misreporting has emphasized differences."},{"Title":"Reflections in a Bloodshot Lens: America, Islam, and the War of Ideas","review":"As far as I'm concerned there are far too many biased books on this important subject of US foreign policy and the impact that the mass media corportation have on public and especially US opinion. The author shows with concise logical arguments and insightful examples how \\"news reporting\\" is done in the USA, especially with regard to anything that's considered Arabic or Islamic. Its interesting to find out for example that ever since the clash of the US government with the Barbari pirates back in the 1820s that the images constructed of that region and its people were extremely biased. Later when the US became a world and Superpower after the 2nd World War, the mass media outlets virtually began a tacit conspiracy to construct a image of Arabs and Moslems as weired, backward and irrational people, that blindly followed their \\"aggressive, and expansionist\\" religion: Islam. The cultural biased disposition can be seen anywhere in the US or for that matter in the West, whether on TV, in newspapers or on the radio. Only the Internet provided a somewhat more balanced account, due to its decentralized natured.Pintak does an excellent job (especially as an American) who tells us vividly that the atmosphere and response to 9.11. was preprogrammed, since the US public has been conditioned, ever since the end of the Cold War to see everything islamic as alien, dangerous and subversive, if not downright terror bound. He calls this propensity and almost habitualized way of acting by Americans as referring to the Others. It was also thus, no coincidence that after the sudden demise of the Soviet Union, many government officials and especially the military industrial complex in the US was desperately looking for a new enemy to replace asap the former well serving enemy image of the S.U. and communism. It is also well known that the US economy ever since the 2nd World War has not only been dependent on the military industial complex (m.i.c.) but that it can actually no longer survive without it. Without the lucrative and massive orders that it places consistently every year, the economy would almost immediately spiral into a recession at the very least if not depression all together.This book does an excellent job of explaining how the false and deliberate misreporting has implanted a new type of enemy in the minds of the US public. Similar to what occured during the Cold War, when Americans saw Russians as the enemy, they are now seeing anything associated with Islam or Moslems as the enemy. 9.11. and the War on Terror has only made things far worse, and created an atmosphere of fear and suspiciousness in the US and the West. Where the Bush administration has severely curtailed civil liberties and turned the country into a big brother surveillance society. It has been said that if people give up their freedom for the promise of protection, they'll lose both. This is precisely what is happening in the US, where a worse big brother state has been errected than what had existed under the McCarthy years back in the early 1950s when the Russians were turned into enemies, that had been the World War II allies of the US. Interestingly enough the same pattern or relationship existed between the radical Moslems and their Jihad movement against the Soviet's during the Afghanistan war that lasted from 1979-1989 because the Soviets had invaded Afghanistan in late 1979. Here also the soon to become new enemy was the ally of the US that even helped significantly to bring down the Soviet Union, that to many was the last empire in the world.This book is very useful in showing how among other things a deliberate government and media policy has conditioned people in their views with regard to anything islamic. The successive US governments and the mass media have worked hand in hand to construct a false biased enemy image of the Others. This makes it on the one hand easier to surpress any dissent in the USA to the precarious US foreign policy that Washington has been following ever since the Cold War began with regard to the islamic countries. On the other hand it fuels the so called \\"War on Terror\\" that simply polarizes the world once again, as it had been during the Cold War, which benefits a few huge corporations of the big business establishment and the military industrial complex. If this \\"War on Terror\\" is not to become an \\"endless\\" war the US government as well as the mass media must change their dispositions toward the islamic countries considerably, or else in a worst case scenario we might really one day have something akin to the Crusades in the atomic age, that could lead to a disaster for humanity."},{"Title":"De Re Metallica","review":"This is one of the great classics, richly illustrated with over 200 woodcuts, most full page. It was published in 1556 by Georgius Agricola. For over 300 years, until the late-1800s, the illustrations constituted THE textbook on mining engineering, used worldwide--albeit few of the mining engineeers who depended on it could read the Latin text. The English translation is by former U.S. President Herbert Hoover, and first Lady Lou.Virtually all of the equipment illustrated was current until perhaps the late 1800s in the U.S. and Western Europe. De Re Metallica could still be used as a textbook in remote parts of Asia, Africa, and South America. Agricola describes and illustrates such \\"modern\\" methods as amalgamation, and the use of spiral inclines for transporting heavy equipment from the surface to underground.CONTENTSThe (unnamed) \\"books\\" (chapters) which compose the book could be titled: 1 The Social Impact of Mining; 2 Mine Management, Exploration, and Prospecting; 3 The Theory of Ore Deposits; 4 Mining Law; 5 Shaft Sinking, Drifting, and Surveying; 6 Mining Equipment, Haulage, Dewatering, Ventilation, and Hazards; 7: Assaying; 8 Beneficiation; 9 Smelting; 10 Separation of Gold from Silver and Silver Refining; 11 Separation of Gold and Silver from Copper and Iron and Copper Refining; 12 Industrial Mineral, Chemical, and Glass Production.THE TEXTThe text, translated by Agricola from German to Latin and by the Hoovers from Latin to English is dense, sometimes incomprehensible. Nevertheless, there is no comparable window on Medeval mining."},{"Title":"De Re Metallica","review":"Georg Pawer was an extremely well educated German in the Humanist tradition of the late fifteenth and early sixteenth century. It was natural that he turned his Greco-German name into Greco-Latin, labeling himself Georgius Agricola. Both versions mean Farmer (Georgios) Farmer (Pawer = Bauer / Agricola). He was a physician by profession. Neither side of his background would seem to suit him to write one of the great books on mining and the refining of ores, but as an official town physician, responsible for treating miners at no additional charge, he seems to have won their trust. The result was a manual, aimed not at people who would have to dig up ores, but at potential investors, and officials and lawyers, who would have to deal with financing, administration and litigation. He set out the basic customs and practices of mining, described the remarkably elaborate machines needed to keep mines dry and ventilated, and processing and refining, with their devices and chemicals. Naturally, he wrote it in the language of real scholarship, Latin, not sixteenth-century German.Since surviving classical Latin is not abundantly supplied with appropriate technical terms, and those which exist are not always clear, the resulting text was soon found to present formidable difficulties, despite important aids from accompanying illustrations. There were early attempts at translating it into German, and even a rendering into Chinese (an early attempt to emulate the mysterious Occidentals and their terror-weapons), but when this translation appeared in 1912, German scholars were humiliated to find that they had been outclassed by a couple of mere \\"Englanders\\". They were probably even less happy to find that the translators were Americans.Actually, Lou Henry Hoover, a good classicist, made a perfect team with her husband, the mining engineer Herbert Hoover, who was shortly to become much better known for humanitarian relief work, and an unhappy experience as President of the United States. The engineering half of the partnership knew what the problems were, and the sort of thing that Agricola must have been trying to say, and the classicist could tell whether the vocabulary and grammar could carry that meaning. The result was a book which was not only beautiful, with its reproductions of the original illustrations, but a genuine contribution to the history of technology.The Dover reprinting of 1950 was one of the first, if not the first, of that publisher's adventures in bringing important works back into print, in attractive editions, at reasonable prices. It remains a gem, whether regarded from points of view of the history of technology, of art, or of Renaissance Humanism. The only thing missing is Agricola's companion treatise on other hazards of mining, like kobolds and other malicious spirits (yes, I am serious; he had lots of testimony from honest miners, after all).Of course, nothing human is perfect, and there are some hints of why such a practical man as Herbert Hoover, with a real concern for human suffering, proved so doctrinaire in the face of the Depression. At one point, the Hoovers scold the Romans for concentrating on German metal resources, instead of trying to build up the only true source of wealth, Agriculture. A lovely sentiment, very eighteenth-century Physiocratic, but it did not seem to occur to them that any agricultural surplus would have had to be shipped down the Rhine, into the North Sea, and around Europe, to be of any immediate benefit to Rome. If it stayed in Germany, it would just feed more nasty, Roman-hating Germans -- so much better to concentrate on something more compact and worth carrying across the Alps, or at least useful for arming the Legions. (Of course, there are also the problems of whether Italian agricultural techniques were of any value in the Rhine valley, and why the Germans had not learned appropriate methods from the neighboring Gauls -- but that leads in other directions.)"},{"Title":"De Re Metallica","review":"This early work describes the thinking of early technologists and shows the development of materials technology and related engineering knowledge of the late 15th century. Of particular interest is the detailed research done by Herbert Hoover, former President and mining engieer. His research is detailed in extensive foot notes. The illustrations are exact copies of the originals. Some of the early chapters are the most intersting reading because of the insights gained into archaic thinking that extrapolates to modern times."},{"Title":"De Re Metallica","review":"This book is not a simple read for those looking for the basics, it a detailed review of the process of mining in the 16th Century throughout Germany with the inclusion of some surrounding regions. All aspects of the search for and creation of metals are covered from how to determine where a vein of materials is most likely to be found thru the methods of ore refinement and ingot production. The footnotes are incredibly helpful and sometimes (necessarily) take up more space than the text they refer to. This is not a basic overview, it is a manual designed to educate in specifics.As a reference this text is wonderful. The woodcuts alone provide a review of the methods and technology used that is more detailed than any other source I have found - although I am admittedly a novice in this particular field of study in Early Modern German History. As an amateur historian I would say that this manuscript is not a \`friendly' read for a general audience, however as a reference for those deeply interested in the subject of mining or Early Modern German metal working it is invaluable.

This is the rejected original version of VALIS, althouth I find that hard to understand after reading it since it's so brilliant and unique. It's arguably better than VALIS for the fact that it contains all of the same themes in the context of a better story. One of the strong points of this novel is the dialogue - there are some unforgettable conversations here between Phil and Nicholas, the two main characters. Two other memorable characters are a mysterious cancer patient named Sadassa Silva and an ex-preacher named Leon at the very end. This book gives you the perfect combination of Dick's religious cosmology and his political philosophy. In most of his books, one of these is prominent over the other, but RFA gives you the perfect blend. I also felt that this completed and complemented VALIS. In an amazing way (fitting of one theme in the book itself), it's a good thing that RFA was rejected by Dick's editors 30 years ago. It caused him to write two masterpieces about the same things, and now we get to read them both.This was one of the most satisfying and important reads of my life. Everyone should experience it - especially those with an affection for metaphysics - but even if you don't, this will open up your mind."},{"Title":"Radio Free Albemuth","review":"Book five of my 39 book PKD odyssey. Radio Free Albemuth is Dick's last book. So far it's my favorite of the lot. Radio Free Albemuth has two main characters, one of which is Philip K. Dick - who watches his friend receive information from mysterious extra-planetary sources. The other is that friend. Taking place is a typically PDK police state in the US and amusingly self-referential (if you're the main character how can you not be), Nicholas receives incomprehensible information that slowly forms into a coherent message. A very controlled book without much of the frenetic pace of his earlier works."},{"Title":"Radio Free Albemuth","review":"This is, in many ways, the quiessential Philip K. Dick novel. It's not his best, and it's not the one you should read first (after all, it's part of the Valis series), but it is a culmination of the the themes that have always dominated his writing. In particular, paranoia and the nature of reality have always been his two major themes, and this book is no exception. At his best, Dick could truly make you ask the question &quot;What is real?&quot; and be unsure of the answer. His writing can also have that &quot;looking over your shoulder&quot; effect. He rarely portrayed either of these two themes better than in this novel. Also, the ruminations on God and religion that dominated his later writings (in particular the Valis series) is a major part of this book as well, though here it is looked at from a more remote perspective than in the previous novels. The plot is also very coherent and easy to follow, unlike in some of his books, while still retaining that unmistakable Dick touch. Essential PKD primer."},{"Title":"Radio Free Albemuth","review":"RFA is a good book if you like PKD and are familiar with his themes, his life, and the specific concerns that he had at this point in his life. As a novel, RFA is quite lacking. As art is incomplete. Valis would prove this, and would remedy the problem. I read RFA after 30 other PKD novels, so naturally I loved it, but I think that it is not the best example of PKD the artist."},{"Title":"Radio Free Albemuth","review":"This book and UBIK are PKD's two greatest masterpieces. I can see why he never dared publish this book while he was alive: it frankly, almost brutally, describes all the deep dark mysteries merely hinted at in his other books. He may have been afraid people would laugh at this book. There is some humor, but I'm not laughing at this book. You shouldn't either. It's even more relevant now (1999) than when he wrote it."},{"Title":"Radio Free Albemuth","review":"Radio Free Albemuth is one of my top 3 favorite books by the master. It actually bumped Valis down to 4. It actually has somewhat of a variant storyline from Valis but there is so much original work it doesnt feel repetitive. Anyone who is a PKD fan should try very hard to find a quiet night alone, no distractions, and just merge with the book. It is told from 2 viewpoints, Phil's and his best friend, and each takes up where the other leaves off. It is very well done and by the end you will definitely want to re-read some of his later work. Can't say more without ruining it. Enjoy. If anyone wants to discuss it after reading it reach me at styx@hotmail.com"},{"Title":"Radio Free Albemuth","review":"This book (RFA), Valis and Divine Invasion are essentially the same excellent book/story. If Valis is the Oxford English Dictionary version of the story, then RFA is Webster's dictionary. This is the best book to start with, to prime yourself for the others. As an earlier amazon.com critique pointed out, this is a cool way to think of the GOD/Jesus phenomenon. Much more comfortable (and believable) for me than normal dogma. A friend and I were inspired back in '87 (harmonic convergance) to do an album on pink vinyl with angelic messages after reading this book. The LP is dedicated to Philip K. Dick, John Lennon and world peace. I hope Ferris Freemont or the FAP doesn't find us! (if you've read the book, you'll know what I'm talking about). Read it."},{"Title":"Radio Free Albemuth","review":"Having read a fair amount of PKD&#65533;s work, I&#65533;m hardly an expert but I do know that some of his stories are incoherent and directionless, while others are excellent and deeply insightful (especially my personal favorite, &#65533;A Scanner Darkly&#65533;). In either case, I will always be amazed by his uniquely subversive ideas. This book was found in unpublished form after PKD&#65533;s death, and I think I can see why he did not submit it for publication. First, it runs parallel to the Valis Trilogy in ways that may cause confusion. Meanwhile, the ideas used here and the methods of narration are kind of a messy hodgepodge, although the book does succeed in the end. The most awkward aspect is PKD&#65533;s insertion of himself as one of the two main characters in the story. This method sometimes devolves into merely an outlet for PKD to complain about being labeled as a drug-induced writer, and to play out his extremely paranoid delusions about the Feds monitoring and whitewashing his work. Meanwhile, as opposed to some PKD books that can&#65533;t quite carry a single undeveloped idea, this book has just too many of them fighting for space. Here we have rampant McCarthyism, disenfranchisement, near-death experiences, subliminal messages, cosmology, and even ancient religious philosophy. All these ideas and awkward techniques make this book rather clumsy and careening, and PKD&#65533;s sheer paranoia shines through at every turn. But you can still be moved by his nightmarish scenarios of conformity and state control gone mad - and these are valuable insights, regardless of their plausibility...."},{"Title":"Radio Free Albemuth","review":"I've been an avid PKD fan for years, but I've never been able to work my way through his VALIS trilogy. Not sure why. Radio Free Albemuth is a good alternative, in my opinion, to VALIS. It's classic PKD but more accessible than VALIS. The idea behind Radio Free Albemuth, similar to all of PKD's stories, is brilliant: there was once a link between humans and a higher intelligence, helping humans to advance. The link has become tenuous and is about to be lost forever, thanks to the fear and stupidity of some humans. Unlike some PKD novels, Radio Free Albemuth remains a satisfying read to the very end -- it is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Radio Free Albemuth","review":"This is my favorite of all of his works so far(and I've read most of them). Heavily autobiographical, Dick captures the paranoia of the early 70's surrealistically as he is slowly hunted down by 'The Friends of the American People' and desperately seeking contact with an alien force that could save them all. Recommended!"},{"Title":"Radio Free Albemuth","review":"Essentially an older draft of the novel that was to become Dick's brilliant _VALIS_, _Radio Free Albemuth_ is, strangely enough, my favorite of the series (which also included _The Divine Invasion_ and _The Transmigration of Timothy Archer_). Dick's story works on an almost fairy-tale level, weaving together Christ imagery with revolution against a totalitarian government quite, um, breezily. This is the book that converted me into a Dickhead, and I heartily recommend it to the fans of Dick's older work who are intimidated by what they've heard about Dick's later, schizophrenia-induced novels."},{"Title":"Radio Free Albemuth","review":"It's always thrilling when a manuscript from a brilliant author is published posthumously. So I had high hopes with \\"Radio Free Albemuth\\", released from the private collection of some Tim Powers. Bummer ! It turned out to be a re-run (or was it a pre-run ?) of the sickly abomination that was VALIS.That makes two flukes on the account of the otherwise extraordinarily talented, most important science fiction writer of the 20th century. Well, perhaps it just counts as one, since it's really just the same novel, rehashed twice.So this novel had all the dreadful \\"insights\\" that plagued the dope-inspired \\"masterpiece\\" VALIS. Well actually, in this novel, badly autobiographical like VALIS, Dick claims that none of the drug allegations were ever true. I'll let historians be the ultimate judge about that. Anyway, the extraterrestrial inspiration, the phosphene glimpsing, the pink beam of warning straight to the forehead, the Koine Greek, it was all there. I was surprised that the obnoxious little girl didn't turn up, as in the last chapter of VALIS. Think Dakota Fanning in some unrewarding role.If you will masochistically insist, like I have, to go through all of Dick's work for completeness, even the known misfires, then this one might be slightly less unpalatable than VALIS itself. I found some relief in the typical Dick humor that rapidly turned into slapstick, when Phil decides to get friendly with a young female member of the thought police. And also, the frenetic but doomed attempts to stage a coup against the new world order, at the end of the novel, rekindle the vibrant buzz that is normally so intense in a Dick novel, from the first sentence to the last.Yet, my final review is unabated. Don't ever read this as a first introduction to Dick. Read his large set of revolutionary art instead, and then forgive him for being human after all, errorprone as demonstrated by this failure; not the writing deity that you'd expect when you marvel at his stunning analysis of both 20th- and 21st-century life, in all his other novels. See one of the ground-breaking movies based loosely on his work, if you're visually oriented.

Using their advanced technologies, other civilizations could create our civilization in their image. That is God. God is the altruistic element of a society (or perhaps the society is entirely altruistic) light years away, beaming their thoughts through satellite hovering above Earth and into a few lucky people's bodies. This was his hope, that non-corporeal entities (angels) could help us &quot;good&quot; people fight the establishment of stupid, paranoid, mean-spirited assholes that now rule most of the world. As with most Dick, only California can save us (has he forgotten his MW roots?), and only those who act as if they have taken too many drugs are the instruments of God's will. PKD was a very smart man who could get his ideas down on paper reasonably well. Especially chilling are Nicholas's encounters with the agents of the facist regime that has taken over America.

At first, all the similarities and little differences made it hard to take RFA one way or the other, but then I started to think: what about if I had read this one first, would it have been so much worse? The answer is no.Of course, RFA couldn't ever be a complete match for VALIS, which is a masterpiece. This one makes a point of preaching about the tyranny of Nixon, showing that PKD truly was a political paranoid; VALIS concentrated more on the religious side, and that's just fine. But Radio Free Albemuth is, by any standards, a great work of fiction, postmodern in the original sense of the world, but also easy to read with detailed character descriptions and brilliant oneliners so typical for Philip K. I recommend."},{"Title":"Radio Free Albemuth","review":"Philip Dick has once again created a moving and interest-grabbing novel by merging themes. I picked it up based on the alternate-america totalitarian plot but was later struck by the religious themes. They were well-blended to create one of Dick's best novels. If anyone considers themself a Dick afficionado and has not read this, they should do so as soon as possible. A masterpiece."},{"Title":"Radio Free Albemuth","review":"This was a great book when read alongside VALIS for the simple reason of all of the strange connections between them. To me, this seems to be an alternate universe in the same reality as VALIS, and there are little windows between them such as the movie VALIS using all the main character's names. This seems to be a world more hopeless than that of VALIS, and it makes me wonder &lt;since these are the only two PKD books I've read&gt; if there should be another book about a universe with more hope than either this or VALIS."},{"Title":"Radio Free Albemuth","review":"Much like VALIS, one must combine the two main characters to understand what PKD is doing. He uses his narrator as an analytic third person to gain objectivity from his personal revelation. This book, the VALIS trilogy, and A Scanner Darkly are the best primer to PKD's Exegesis"},{"Title":"Radio Free Albemuth","review":"Philip K. Dick chose not to take a new editor's notes on this novel and entrusted the manuscript to a friend. While his next attempt to deal with some of the same themes - VALIS - is rightly considered a masterwork - there are many ways in which Radio Free Albemuth is more successful. Certainly the story-line is tighter and more focused. More humor. And more tenderness for the fragile human condition - that's a hallmark of PKD's later fiction. This book is a message of hope.There's a new indie feature film version of Radio Free Albemuth - and I respectfully suggest all fans of RFA to join the filmmakers on Facebook - Radio Free Albemuth - movie and the website [...] where you can also view the trailer. The movie was made at an efficient enough budget to not have the \\"economic necessity\\" to add extraneous gun fights and car chases - a rare chance to tell the story in the spirit of the writer's original intentions. Your support of this effort would be very appreciated."},{"Title":"Radio Free Albemuth","review":"To me, this was the accessible, sentimental VALIS. While it is not so rich in detail, one does not have to read the exegesis of Gnostic terminology found in VALIS. I believe the story benifits from this as it allowed Dick to focus more tightly on his main characters and their emotions.Parts of this books made me feel like I was reading a later day addition to C. S. Lewis' Perlandria series. The feeling of divine contact and its sudden withdrawal was just devastating. I have rarely read such a clear portrayal of the emotions surrounding direct religious experiences.The other aspect of this book I liked was its obviously autobiographical narrative, and its dark hints at Nixon's raw grasping for power and possible responsibilities for the loss of some of our most popular leaders of the '60s.Radio Free Albemuth provides a fascinating alternative to VALIS, and can be enjoyed at several levels. It also combines in an accessible manner the important themes Dick wrote about in &quot;A Scanner Darkly&quot; and &quot;Flow My Tears, The Policeman Said&quot;. While it is derrivative of these books, the insight and ideas have been honed to their essence."},{"Title":"Radio Free Albemuth","review":"Set in California in the early 1970's, record producer and hipster Nicholas Brady is receiving communications from outer space that put him in the thick of a political plot to depose the despised U.S. President from Orange County, while Phil Dick is his science-fiction writer friend in this outrageous novel. Do these outcasts have what it takes to overthrow an authoritarian government and right the social wrongs of America? Not if the administration's goons have anything to say about it. A marvelous romp through faith, insanity, free will, and paranoia.While not technically part of the \\"Valis\\" trilogy, this book deals with many of the same themes and occasionally even the same events, some of which supposedly really happened. It seems likely that the reason Dick never published this novel during his lifetime is because so much of this material had already been covered in his other books. But this work is far more novelistic, telling a chronological story about how two individuals decided to stick it to the Man, and less a scholarly treatise on the nature of God, reality, the universe, etc... For those who found \\"Valis\\" a little too methodological in its analysis of comparative cosmologies and so forth, \\"Albemuth\\" is a much more readable, straightforward science fiction novel. If you haven't read the \\"Valis\\" trilogy yet, read this book first.The characters are pretty much standard for Dick: the everyman who overdid the drug culture during the 1960's, and the science fiction writer who tries to turn everything into a story. Since both of these are Dick's alter-egos, they serve to bring the writer into the action and let him toy with both autobiography and meta-fiction. As a general rule, Dick's style is easy enough to read, but his plots are often difficult to follow, since things are rarely what they appear to be and some dichotomies are never really resolved. Unlike some of his better known works, this book at least has a fairly clear-cut conclusion. The bottom line is: if you're a fan of imaginative fiction who is still unfamiliar with the work of this astonishing writer, then you need to tune in pronto. And while this may not be the master's tightest work, those new to Dick might just as well start here as anywhere."},{"Title":"Radio Free Albemuth","review":"This is a very well-written novel from an author who is generally hit or miss. It also has an unusual narative structure (which I will not give away) that provides a clue into Dick's own state of mind. Based on actual events of Dick's life, (as he sees them) this novel, published after his death, is the first version of what became (the very confused) VALIS. Read this first and you will understand VALIS much, much more. Dick's final four novels (RFA, VALIS, The Divine Invasion, The Transmigration of Timothy Archer) should all be read in that order to really unlock the mind of Dick in the last years of his fascinating life."},{"Title":"Radio Free Albemuth","review":"I don't know why, but ever since I read RFA it has been my favorite book by PKD. Dick's strength has always been his loose entanglement (&quot;grip&quot; is too strong a word) with reality--something that has always shown in his work. His plots are never straight-forward and, when he is at his best, it is quite possible to finish one of his books and then ask yourself &quot;what the heck really happened here?&quot; Dick's ability to call even reality into question has always been his strength, and RFA is no exception. What makes this particular book so good is that his writing technique lives up to the task. All too often some of Dick's works come across with a jerky, &quot;pulp&quot; feel. This is not bad, and it fits his style and his earlier plots, but is usually not a recipe for creating a classic. In his later works, though, he really developed his writing into something that could stand on its own, and when coupled to his extraordinary plots amd ideas would make for an unmatched read in sci-fi. His VALIS trilogy is, according to many, the greatest of his many masterpieces. RFA is not really a part of that trilogy, as it was written separately and not published until well after Dick's death, as a sort of addendum. In one sense, though, I feel like it takes all of the ideas Dick was struggling with and developing in his later years--ideas about the nature of God, the history of humanity, the question of why there are so many religions and is it really possible for us to come together on that issue--and writes them out more clearly and succinctly than any other of his novels. Don't get me wrong, they're all great. But RFA is sort of the &quot;meat and potatoes&quot; of his ideas--clear, organized, and what's best: it's got a great plot. It's about love, death, the threat of communism, political revolutions, subliminal messages, record stores, messages from the stars, and votive candles. What more could you want?"},{"Title":"Radio Free Albemuth","review":"Phillip K. Dick is at his best when he is working with BIG IDEAS, and it doesn't get any bigger than this. This book is connected in interesting ways with his insanely metaphysical Valis trilogy -- but what I think is most exciting about this one is the way he inserts himself into the universe depicted in the previous trilogy, as if to suggest that the genesis of the ideas from those books had its basis in his own experience. This tie to the \\"real\\" world makes this the ultimate Phillip K. Dick novel (though probably not the first one to read, since the conceit works best if you are already familiar with some of his ideas and works) -- since it \\"intensifies\\" or brings to completion the level of metaphysical speculation, as if to say: \\"you know all those books I wrote about fantasy worlds in which it was impossible to tell the difference between fantasy and reality?... that wasn't just fiction, some of it really happened to me.\\" If you've only encountered Dick through the various movie adaptations (some successful some not), you should read Scanner, Ubik, and at least the Valis trilogy first, but then you won't be disappointed by this, his final work (even though it wasn't completed to his satisfaction when he died there's more good stuff in there than in several stacks of standard pulp sci fi.)"},{"Title":"Radio Free Albemuth","review":"Essentially, this is another version of VALIS. I recommend VALIS often, especially to readers who tell me they've read a book or two of his (usually Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?) and haven't been all that impressed, or people who are looking for something totally out of joint. VALIS, if you're even considering this book, should be read first. Radio Free Albemuth is actually an earlier version of VALIS. It's bland, by comparison, though more firmly delineated in its themes. So if you've read VALIS and are having trouble grappling its web, pick this up and chisel. Many don't realize that Dick, though hardly a great prose stylist, is a formidable literary mind that speaks in very complex ways to many of the themes studied in his more respected contemporaries."},{"Title":"Radio Free Albemuth","review":"Browsing through the library I stumbled across this book; I hadn't read any Phillip K. Dick since The Man in the High Castle some years ago. Though the Russia/US conflict is dated now, the book doesn't suffer, as the main plot is the relationship between VALIS (aka God) and the characters. What really surprised me was the Christian theme running throughout, and the comparisons drawn between early christian believers and the believers in VALIS. While it is probably not theologically correct to say that VALIS and God are one and the same, I found his use of VALIS as a metaphor for God to be admirable. It's interesting too that in a time when worshipping God and Jesus is not cool, and something a lot of hipsters would snicker at, worshipping something like VALIS seeems a lot more palatable as it is placed in a context of being an extraterrestrial life form."},{"Title":"Radio Free Albemuth","review":"Radio Free Albemuth captures the true meaning of paranoia. The book swiftly tells the story of a wicked and manipulative government attacking its own citizens. With elements of George Orwell's 1984, Radio Free Albemuth focuses on the federal government spying on its own citizens to find out who is being unpatriotic.Author Philip Dick uses himself as one of the main characters of this eerie story, making it seem quick feasible. Dick plays himself - a science fiction writer. His long-time friend in the story is Nicholas Brady, who works at Progressive Records. Nick's job is to audition and sign new artists (mostly folk) to the label.Nick begins to experience dreams, which seem to predict the near future. Then he starts hearing voices while he is awake. Confused at first what this means, Nick turns to Phil for advice about his experiences. Soon Nick gets a visit from government officials called FAPS (Friends of American Patriotism). They question his patriotism. In order to prove his loyalty, the FAPs want him to agree to sign only artists with government approved messages. When Nick is reluctant to agree to this proposal, they become more suspicious of him and his possible affiliation with a communist party called Aramchek.The story revolves around this concept. Throughout the story the FAPs get more aggressive and Nick more paranoid. He increasingly hears and experiences sub-human things. Is the government making those voices or is it another life form?If you like Cyberpunk novels that are realistic enough to get you thinking and evaluating your own government, this book is a must read. This book never has a dull moment."},{"Title":"Radio Free Albemuth","review":"Tired of SF novels that read like increasingly banal versions of &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;? Well, Philip K. Dick is the cure for you. Each of his novels sets off on its own, wonderful meandering journey that takes you places you've never imagined, and Radio Free Albemuth is no exception.The plot basically follows American History until the late 1960s, when a character named Fremont but actually a shell for Richard Nixon takes over the country by assassinating his rivals and proceeds to make a mockery of the Bill of Rights.That's just the backdrop for a fascinating foray into the &quot;real&quot; meaning of the Bible, the Jesus story, and eternal life.BTW, this book, at just over 200 pages, takes a while to read. There are no banal page-long descriptions of the weather, clothing, etc. a la a pulp fiction novel. It's rich with ideas from page to page, so it's not necessarily a page-turner. You have to stop and think about it -- best if read not all at once but a few chapters at a time."},{"Title":"Radio Free Albemuth","review":"I wonder what Philip K. Dick thought of Radio Free Europe, the American show broadcast to anti-American nations during and after the Cold War. He had little patience with any totalitarian system, so he may have thought it was a good idea to invade evil empires with ideas. He certainly thought enough of the notion to base this novel on it. In this case, though, it's not just evil nations being invaded by ideas, it's all of Earth.Within the story, there's no Radio Free Albemuth as such - that's a joke between some of the characters trying to figure out what's happened to their friend Nicholas Brady - but there is a broadcast from space that locates certain people and attempts to free them from the evil illusion that Earth is. Nicholas, like a few thousand others, comes to see by this extraterrestrial effort that Earth is under the thrall of a vast wickedness, and that the information beamed into his brain is in the nature of an invasion by a Vast Active Living Intelligence System. (Yeah, it's VALIS, from the later PKD novel of the same name, which makes this novel a sort of first pass at the later story. Hold your horses, we'll get to that.)In some ways, this sort of moral invasion sounds like a pretty a good idea. It's an even better idea in the world of \\"Radio Free Albemuth\\", an alternative America in which one Ferris F. Freemont has won the American presidency and turned the county into a Stalinist police state, under the guise of fighting Communist infiltration at home. This is pretty scary for ordinary citizens like Nicholas's close friend Philip K. Dick, the science fiction writer. Such citizens find themselves under constant observation by the Friends of the American People, a sort of volunteer secret police who bully others into informing on their friends and neighbors. For someone like Nicholas himself, this state of affairs is even more tense. Not only is he under surveillance like everyone else, he's also in touch with an extraterrestrial (and maybe divine) enemy of the state. And there's always the possibility that he may just be nuts.Complicating matters further is the fact that all of this is loosely based on events that occurred in PKD's own real life in 1974. \\"Radio Free Albemuth\\" may have been one way for him to sort through his experience, but it doesn't always make a good novel. For instance, as you may have noticed, he more or less divided himself in half here - Nicholas has the experiences and \\"Phil\\" watches. By naming a character after himself, PKD evidently sought to consider his materials coolly and figure out just what the truth was. This is fine for an essay or philosophical treatise, but a novel usually requires a little more heat.What's more, Phil and Nicholas trade off narrating \\"Radio Free Albemuth,\\" so this division doesn't really even work as a distancing device. What's the point of ascribing all your pain to a fictional character if you're then going to inhabit that character in the first person?Phil and Nicholas, and Nicholas's wife Rachel, also spend a lot of time discussing the ethics and cosmology that Nicholas receives by divine broadcast. It makes for some fascinating reading here and there - PKD's prose had been improving for several years by this time, and \\"Radio Free Albemuth\\" is no exception to that process. Nevertheless, the exposition slows the novel way down, which is a shame. After all, with this setup, the novel had a perfect opportunity to join the ranks of paranoid thrillers like \\"The Parallax View\\" and \\"The Manchurian Candidate\\", but it doesn't really work to interrupt a thriller periodically for philosophical/theological discourse.Okay, so it's not a paranoid thriller. I have a sneaking hunch that PKD wrote \\"Radio Free Albemuth\\" to comfort himself after some years of genuine agony - to assure himself that the world had some meaning, that he would be okay one day, and that eventually the good guys would win. If I'm at all on the right track about this, it was a wise choice. As you might guess, by writing a story for himself, PKD came up with a story for the rest of us.Now, he was too much of a realist to tack on a happy ending - even in his earliest days he almost never did that. With this story, as the narration itself points out, we're considering a worldwide global empire of evil established nearly two thousand years ago, opposed by a small cadre of men and women largely unknown to each other, all of whom hear voices in their heads. This is not \\"Star Wars\\". The Empire strikes back with a vengeance and the good guys' victories are much smaller. They are there, however, and that's what gives \\"Radio Free Albemuth\\" its teeth. I said earlier that novels require more heat than expository works, and as a matter of fact the finale of \\"Albemuth\\" has enough emotional punch to satisfy anyone, whether PKD put it there deliberately or not.A good many commentators have suggested that this novel was a sort of first draft for \\"VALIS\\", which found a publisher during PKD's lifetime where \\"Albemuth\\" did not. At some point I'll discuss whether \\"VALIS\\" was more deserving of that distinction than \\"Albemuth\\". For now, suffice to say this: The fact that \\"Radio Free Albemuth\\", with its message of small but potent victory over death and destruction, found a publisher at all and can be read by you and me, is in itself one of those small victories. Like so much of PKD's work, especially his later stuff, it makes you feel good at the end. Read and enjoy.Benshlomo says, The little things aren't as little as they seem."},{"Title":"Radio Free Albemuth","review":"I'm only part way through this book, and I'm re-reading VALIS (a book I'd rate at 10) at the same time. What strikes me is that despite different plot lines and different characters, both have some elements that are identical. The protagonist is communicated to by VALIS via a beam of light in both. VALIS informes both of a birth defect in their son (identical defects, identical results, different characters). I'm going to continue and see if there are other similarities. So far it looks like RFA (posthumously published from notes found by a friend of Dick) is a rip-off from VALIS, or possibly a rejected first copy. That's not to say it isn't good or worth reading. I just have a suspiscion that it's not to original.CIAO...--Terrapin"},{"Title":"Radio Free Albemuth","review":"As usual with Dick, there are some interesting things to besaid, but the flaws outweigh the good here. First, several aspects ofthe plot are ridiculous. Of course with sci-fi, you have to forgive the ridiculous, but at heart this book is a political thriller with sci-fi aspects thrown in. As a result I have a problem with the fact that the entire plot to bring down Fremont rests on some harebrained scheme to send out subliminal messages through popular music.The second flaw stems from the fact that Dick makes himself a character in the book. I have no problem with that in theory, but in practice it is a disaster. Dick plays it completely straight, all the while touting his importance as a writer. A lot of it was very tough to swallow.The third flaw was the inclusion of several long diatribes on the meaning of Valis during the parts narrated by Nick Brady. They just seemed goofy and brought the narrative to a screeching halt. Throw in the fact that the core political conspiracy (Left Wing Forces Using a Right Wing Puppet as their Agent) was lifted directly from The Manchurian Candidate and you have a book that must be considered a failure."},{"Title":"Radio Free Albemuth","review":"Beautiful, paranoid, haunting, mind-blowing"},{"Title":"Radio Free Albemuth","review":"Try to read &quot;Radio Free Albemuth&quot; and you'll need no further explanation of why it wasn't published while he was alive.

All writers have drafts and manuscripts that serve their purpose of getting the brain going; they make interesting footnotes for scholars and groupies, and they churn out royalties for literary estates, but they don't make literature.

Nixon's paranoia about domestic \\"enemies\\" becomes Fremont's all-out campaign against a supposed conspiracy called Aramchek. To crack down on this enemy, an insidious secret police organization called FAP (Friends of the American People) is set up. Nicholas Brady, an alter ego for Dick himself, is the target for FAP harassment, and learns that the conspiracy is real. Aramchek is the satellite that is beaming information to several thousand highly aware individuals around the world, forming a \\"collective brain.\\" Radio Free Albemuth is cast in a more straightforward science-fictional mode than the unconventional VALIS.

What should make anyone pick up this book compiled by the British Ambassador to Korea is largely up to the reader and his or her goal. If it is one's goal to get a frank look into what foreigners were commenting on over a hundred years ago then this book is most certainly for you.The collection is laid out like an old travelogue. Although the source materials are taken from the 1600s to almost the 1920s, the book is organized by day and month, not by year. For example, the book starts in January 1895 and then jumps to 1904, 1884, 1930 and so on. While the author explains that it is understandably impossible to lay out a perfectly balanced \\"one entry per day of the day\\" format, this does become a bit confusing as one paragraph mentions the Japanese colonial minister visiting and the next paragraph is describing a bunch of Dutchmen stranded in the Hermit Kingdom without a regard to any colonial power whatsoever. If you are familiar with your Korean history and are able to mentally switch between periods, it's not a problem. However, for the uninitiated, it's likely enough to drive you crazy.As clearly stated, the book is not an interpretative study by any means. It's simply a collection of hard-to-find mentions of Korea from the author's extensive personal collection. Knowing this ahead of time, I was pleasantly surprised to find foreigners being just as idiotic a hundred years ago as some are today. To their credit and to balance out some of the more crude statements of ethnic superiority, there are a surprisingly large amount of modern parallels still valid today. It's almost shocking to find so many things have not changed, at least on the surface.All in all, this book is a great addition to any Korean history book collection, if that's what you're doing - collecting. It's a bit pricey and even harder to find outside of Korea. The original publishing date is back in 2003 which might account for how hard it is to find, but even when found, roughly fifty American dollars is a lot to throw down for a glorified snapshot largely devoid of photographs and character. However, I must be honest and say that I thoroughly enjoyed reading what missionaries, diplomats, adventurous vacationers and other passerbys had to say about Korea a hundred years."},{"Title":"The Einstein Theory of Relativity a Trip to the Fourth Dimension","review":"In my opinion, this is a \\"must\\" book for everyone, who wants to learn full general theory of relativity. I had read many books about the GTR (and had a rather difficult time to comprehend them!) before I found a reference to the original (1949!) edition of this book in R. D'Inverno \\"Introducing Einstein's Relativity\\" (a very good book itself). In the introduction D'Inverno mentions how discovering this book in a local library had led him to learn the full GTR while he was only 15! This made him to choose relativity physics as his profession, and also his foreknowledge of the \\"hard stuff\\" rather shocked his professors at Oxford! Back to me: a few years ago I have acquired a used original of this book (at a rather steep price!), and immediately loved it, despite that I have already learned lots about the GTR in a \\"hard way\\". When I found that this book is going to be re-issued, I immediately have ordered a copy! Well, first, the re-issue is of a very high quality. Second, it is supplemented by the new editor's notes, which add lots of the stuff, which is missing in the original edition due to space constraints and the efforts to keep the book as \\"elementary\\" as possible. If you want to get a great help in learning the GTR with tensors and all that stuff, to really understand why the star light is bent by the mass of the Sun, or why Mercury's perihelion precession has extra 43\\" arc-seconds per century, buying this at $10 is a no-brainer ! Get it ! Another two good books for the start are:Schaum's Outline of Tensor Calculus (Schaum's),The Mathematics of Relativity for the Rest of Usand Sokolnikoff, Tensor Analysis (out of print)."},{"Title":"The Einstein Theory of Relativity a Trip to the Fourth Dimension","review":"This is a republication of a book that was originally published in 1945. While the mathematical approaches to Relativity Theory have changed since then, this book still provides one of the most accessible treatments of the subject. There are, however, two very quirky features of this book of which any prospective reader should be made aware. (I mention these quirky features so that a prospective reader will look beyond them in order to see a very interesting book.) Professor Lieber had the idea that the book would be more easily read by putting each phrase on a separate line, making the book look like poetry. I found just the opposite. Furthermore, when I first saw this book I put it back thinking that is was some sort of cute attempt to discuss Relativity Theory in verse. This incorrect view was unfortunately supported by the numerous drawings that the author's husband contributed. For the most part, I found the drawings innocuous and if you looked at them carefully they did have some relevance to the text. Putting one phrase per line greatly reduced the amount of text per page. Had a conventional layout been used, and the drawings eliminated, the book would have been less than 150 pages long. The upside to this arrangement is that it did provide plenty of white space upon which I could write numerous notes.This book aims at providing the mathematics of both the Special and General Theories of Relativity, in a manner that is reasonably accessible to someone with at least some mathematical background. However, this is not the book if you are looking for explainations using people on trains firing guns, twins in space ships or people in falling elevators. There is almost none of that sort of thing in this book. If that is what your are looking for I would recommend a book like Martin Gardner's \\"Relativity Simply Explained\\" or Wolfson's \\"Simply Einstein\\". The book being reviewed here focuses on the mathematics, not on general explanations.The first third of the book is concerned with Special Relativity, and the treatment in this book is very similar to that provided in many other books, especially Einstein's \\"Relativity, The Special and General Theory\\", which was written for a general audience. (If you buy a copy of Einstein's book be sure to get the 15th and final edition, which contains all of the appendices and corrections.) Some of the text of Professor Lieber's book comes (with the proper attribution) from Einstein's book. I liked Einstein's treatment better (it had some of the moving train analogies as well as the math discussed here) and if you are just interested in Special Relativity I recommend it over the book being reviewed here.The final two thirds of the book being reviewed here are devoted to the mathematics of the General Theory of Relativity, and if you are interested in this subject you should be interested in this book. The General Theory of Relativity is one of those subjects that is so daunting that every other treatment for a general audience eschews providing any mathematics at all and in-depth treatments are frighteningly complex. In my opinion, Professor Lieber did the near impossible in that she made the subject intelligible. I cannot say that after reading this book I can solve problems in General Relativity, but at least I now know what kind of mathematics Einstein utilized and I now have a general idea how General Relativity problems are attacked. General relativity replaces the idea of a gravitational force by the idea of the curvature of space and that this curvature is described by tensor calculus, by means of a curvature tensor. Solve the curvature tensor and you solve the gravitational problem. As illustrations, Professor Lieber uses the calculation of the phrihelion of Mercury, the bending of light by the Sun and the shift in spectra lines due to the curvature of space caused by a large mass (such as that of a star). The phrihelion solution cleared up a problem that had been unexplained for about 50 years when Einstein provided a solution, and was unexplainable by Newtonian mechanics. The confirmation of his prediction of the bending of light made Einstein world famous and the spectral line shift was something that had heretofore not been suspected, but when measured was further confirmation of General Relativity.In addition to the original author, there are two editors who have done much more that just edit the book. They have provided 21 pages of notes that solve some of the problems that are left for the reader, provide the text from books that are referenced but are no longer in print or available, and provide modern references. The editors fill in some of the gaps that are left for the reader to search out from other books. This is a set of editor's notes that are essential and should not be skipped.As I have noted the mathematics of General Relativity is that of tensor calculus. Professor Lieber defines contravariant and covariant tensors and how they are manipulated, but does not provide anything like a complete discussion of tensor calculus. For the most part, Professor Lieber defines the relevant tenors and how they are to be algebraically manipulated. Tensor mathematics utilizes a very compressed notation that allows hundreds of equations to be expressed by a single one, but one that utilizes subscripts, superscripts and many different symbols and Greek letters that define complex mathematical operations. The result is a very complex looking expression, but one that I think someone who is adept at algebraic manipulation may be able to follow. However, without the necessary physics and mathematical background they may not really understand why the mathematical operations that the equation describes are being performed. For someone with the right background this may not be too much of an impediment.An important question to be considered is how much background mathematics does one require in order to get anything out of this book? I have been exposed to some tensor mathematics, but only the simple tensors used to relate vector qualities such as stress and strain. I had never been exposed to contravariant and covariant tensors. I found the discussions to be relatively clear, but the resulting algebraic manipulation of the tensors was daunting to say the least. I doubt that someone who had not studied college level mathematics would get very much from this book, but at least one other reviewer seems to have found otherwise.The major problem that I had with the book was that there were many places where results were just stated and not properly explained. The editors cleared some of this up, but there were still many places where I wanted to know why a particular operation was being performed. I guess one cannot expect more from a book that effectively devotes only about 100 pages to the mathematics of the General Theory of Relativity. Anyone looking at a text on this subject will see that many, many, more pages of very, very, complex text are required to give a more detailed presentation, which is usually taught as a graduate level course. I am giving the book four rather than five stars because this lack of exposition and because of a concern that in spite of the efforts of the author and editors, the book may be over the head of a reader without the necessary background and I do not want to mislead prospective readers into thinking otherwise. However, with the right background, you should be able to understand what sort of mathematics is used and where to go to learn more (especially from the modern references provided by the editors). For me, that was sufficient and made the book well worth the time I spent with it."},{"Title":"The Einstein Theory of Relativity a Trip to the Fourth Dimension","review":"I'm glad to see this back in print. When in high school, circa 1965, I bought the hard copy version of this. It is indeed a nice introduction to the subject. I confess I did not finish it for some years, because I got stuck on trying to make meaning of the Christoffel symbols. But nobody else's books made me feel comfortable with those, so the fault is not with the author. Eventually (after a graduate course on General Relativity), I finished the book.This is a lovely book, written with appreciation for the reader as well as the subject. And I loved tying in Hugh Lieber's drawings with the text. Sometimes his tongue was firmly in cheek.I bought this with the hope that the notes would shed more light on Lillian Lieber, but sadly it appears that there is little left on the record."},{"Title":"The Einstein Theory of Relativity a Trip to the Fourth Dimension","review":"Not only charming in the format and illustrations from 1945, but a wonderful introduction (requires good High School math) to relativity -- special and general.I can't think of a better book on the subject for a bright High School student (or even College Freshman/Sophmore). Contains a wonderful explanation of tensors in general relativity.Whatever(!) it may cost, buy a copy of this book and read it carefully. It would make a fabulous present for a parent/grand-parent to give their relative, who is going to study math/physics, on graduating from High School."},{"Title":"The Einstein Theory of Relativity a Trip to the Fourth Dimension","review":"This is a wonderful little book that certainly gives you insight into the theories of relativity; it is worth the effort to read it.The 1945 edition happened to be in my high school library, so many years ago, but the last half of the book proved too formidable for me at the time. In those days one studied calculus in the second year of college; in the first year one studied college algebra and then spherical triganometry. Alas, I had to be satisfied with the knowledge the Liebers were able to convey to me. Also helpful to me was that little gem, \\"The Evolution of Physics\\" by Einstein & Infield (also in my high school library),and a small, well-written pamphlet by Phillip Frank (Einstein's successor at Prague, then at Harvard), \\"Relativity and its astronomical implications (1945),\\" available at the time at the Chicago Planatarium.This 2008 edition is certainly a 'labor of love' by the editors, Messrs. Derbes & Jantzen, who are to be commended and thanked for their efforts."},{"Title":"The Einstein Theory of Relativity a Trip to the Fourth Dimension","review":"This book is an algebra level introduction to the concepts and math of Einstein's theory of Relativity. It is written in a lucid style and illustrated with whimsical cartoons that help to clarify the concepts. I first read this book when I was in high school, and it was an excellent introduction to relativity for me at that time. After 50 years I am happy to be able to include it in my library."},{"Title":"The Einstein Theory of Relativity a Trip to the Fourth Dimension","review":"If you know high school maths and a bit of calculus, and are not scared of equations, this book is for you. (I got English A-levels grade A in math, further maths, physics, a long time ago, but that is all the formal training I have had.)I agree with all those who give the book five stars.Prof Leiber writes in short sentences with lots of white space which makes it easy to absorb the material.It is all there, tensors, the lot!I tried D'Inverno, but it was too much for me. With this book I taught myself general relativity in a couple of weeks, albeit, I had met tensors before in D'Inverno.It is a pity more maths/physics books are not written like this."},{"Title":"The Einstein Theory of Relativity a Trip to the Fourth Dimension","review":"I read a library copy of this book when I was an undergraduate Physics student, and was eager to see it for sale to read it again. Thanks to the editors of this new edition, who could do the same for other books of this author. Although a basic knowledge of Electromagnetism and Mechanics is enough to make anyone pleased with this delightful reading, I think it is equally understandable for those who possess only High school mathematical knowledge. Besides, the necessary Mathematics is appropriately exposed by the author throughout the text and appendices.It is a must have for Physics students."},{"Title":"The Einstein Theory of Relativity a Trip to the Fourth Dimension","review":"This book made learning about the theory of relativity interesting, and gave a very thorough outlook.I recommend this book to anyone who still has a bit to learn on this subject"},{"Title":"The Einstein Theory of Relativity a Trip to the Fourth Dimension","review":"The Einstein Theory of Relativity: A Trip to the Fourth Dimension [Paperback]Lillian R.

Good for her! In making the claims she does, she needs a very powerful rhetoric that can persuade and dissuade simultaneously. Her concentration on the erotic dimension of the Hypnerotomachia is persuasive as is her description of the proto-feminist voice of Polia. This is the best introduction to the text available even if some will not be won over by the argument for the geneology of the text. Kudos to Lefaivre!!!Some of the illustrations were not worth including in the book (30 h and j) because they are so very dark they just look like gray boxes. For a book so persuading of the beauty and erotic, it hardly seems fair to have placed such illustrations here. Perhaps it just adds to the plaisir du texte, not knowing what is behind the smudge. Maybe it is Polia or Poliphili, maybe even Alberti, in the buff. It certainly calls for the reader to suspend disbelief. Otherwise the physical look of the book is fine quality."},{"Title":"Leon Battista Alberti's Hypnerotomachia Poliphili: Re-Cognizing the Architectural Body in the Early Italian Renaissance","review":"Lefaivre aims to demonstrate that one of the most fascinating works of the Italian Renaissance, the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili was the work of one of that era's most intriguing personalities, the architect and writer Leon Battista Alberti. She bases her claim on the volume and quality of architectural discussion and comment in the Hypnerotomachia, which she argues could only have been written by a learned architect with a flair for literature. Moreover, she shows that several coinages of Alberti's, rarely if ever found in works other than his, are incorporated into the text. Lefaivre states her case with verve and conviction, but there are just too few known facts to make it water-tight. Besides, there are arguments at least as strong, if not stronger, in support of other candidates for the work's authorship. Most authorities, such as the editors of a recent Italian edition of the Hypnerotomachia remain of the opinion that the book was the work of Francesco Colonna, a wayward Dominican monk of Venetian origin. Nevertheless, Lefaivre animates her subjects and writes of them with intelligence and passion: that her central thesis is likely wrong does not detract from her book's charm. The MIT Press have done her proud, the book being beautifully designed, laid out, illustrated and printed. I recommend it wholeheartedly."},{"Title":"Leon Battista Alberti's Hypnerotomachia Poliphili: Re-Cognizing the Architectural Body in the Early Italian Renaissance","review":"I came across this book and was instantly seduced by the illustrations. Then, of course, I started reading random passages trying to get a glimpse of the quality of the writing, insights and views of the author and was impressed. It is a well-researched material. Clear. Engaging. Substantial.But I have to give it 4 stars because of the lame cover. It is so thin and soft I keep mangling the pages whenever I try to prop it up on my desk. But that is a very petty thing. The book is a delight to read. Forget about the trashy Rule Of Four book.

Everything from the War of the Spanish succession and the Great Northern War, through the American Revolution and the Napoleonic period, finally to ceremonial troops and the colonial troops of the European powers, this book gives an excellent accounting of the development and finery of military dress.If you don't own it, you should.

As [the] editorial review explains, but the book description only hints at, this is a collection of previously published work. Since I read the latter, but not the former, I was expecting a retrospective analysis of the .com bubble. Because of the rapid rate of obsolescence of most things written about the Internet, I don't think I would have bought the book had I known that parts of it were written as long as a decade ago, but I'm glad I did anyway.Looking back with the benefit of hindsight at things written about the Internet over the course of the last decade proves to be an illuminating exercise. It definitely seems to be a case of the more things change, the more they stay the same.Some of the things that have changed a lot since the time the original articles were published are:* Everyone knows what the Internet is (in his introduction, Gleick explains that in the early \`90s, editors made him explain this when he used the term in articles). One of the really interesting things I learned reading the book is that the original development of the Web only dates back to 1989.* In a 1993 article, he describes people being annoyed by mobile phones ringing in airports. Given the far less appropriate places they ring today, that seems positively quaint.* In 1993, some people remembered who Dan Quayle was and cared enough to create a newsgroup devoted to making fun of him.Some current issues that the book demonstrates have a much longer history are:* Concerns about bandwidth and information privacy (or more accurately, lack thereof).* Password overload (described in amusing detail in a 1995 column).* The incomprehensibility of software and Web site user agreements - even to those who bother to read them.As an added bonus, since it was written as technologies were emerging, the book provides the full name of things that are now only known by their acronyms. For instance, I've never known what ISDN stands for, but now I know that it's \`Integrated Services Digital Network.'With the benefit of hindsight, we can see that some of Gleick's predictions were very prescient (e.g. the Y2K anti-climax), while others were less accurate or at least premature (e.g. cash becoming obsolete). All in all, the book provides a very enjoyable look through the rearview mirror."},{"Title":"What Just Happened: A Chronicle from the Information Frontier","review":"It's usually a good sign when picking up a collection of essays to find that they have been previously published in some noted periodical such as The New Yorker or Harper's or in this case (with one exception) from The New York Times Magazine. Gleick's focus in these thirty highly polished essays is information and especially the Internet and how the Internet and related technology are changing our lives. There is a personal, and an \\"I lived it\\" quality to the writing that I found engaging.Author of the challenging Chaos and the very long and adoring Genius about physicist Richard Feynman and the more recent Faster, here Gleick gives us short and easy to appreciate recollections of the communications revolution. His observations are trenchant, mildly apocalyptic and/or gee-whizzed, amusing and very well expressed. Having good editors is something Gleick says he has been blessed with, and in these pieces it shows. This attractive book is simply a pleasure to read.The first piece is from 1992 about the bugs in software, in particular those in Microsoft's Word for Windows; and I want to tell you even though (or especially because) I use WordPerfect, I identified. I felt the aggravation. Gleick notes that software is unlike any other product in its complexity, an observation that no doubt pleases Microsoft's software engineers. However, he reports that Microsoft, unable to cope with the bugs munching on their code and unable or unwilling to excise them, came to an accommodation with the world by declaring that \\"It's not a bug--it's a feature,\\" while compiling an in-company list of known bugs dubbed, \\"Won't Fix.\\"And then, I guess, had lunch.My favorite essay in the collection is the one entitled \\"The End of Cash\\" beginning on page 143 in which Gleick notes among other things that issuers of digital cash cards expect to \\"profit generally from lost cards.\\" He adds that \\"telephone companies and transit systems already figure gains ranging from 1 percent to a phenomenal 10 percent.\\" (p. 152) This is an example of privatized \\"escheatment,\\" an aptly named phenomenon in which governments have traditionally benefitted from lost coins and paper money, or people dying without heirs. Gleick reports that billions of pennies \\"simply vanish from the economy each year\\" which he cites as a \\"hidden cost of money.\\" (pp. 157-158) But credit cards too have their hidden costs. They amount to a tax on those who do not use credit cards (basically the poor) because \\"the credit card companies have mostly succeeded in forbidding merchants to offer discounts for cash purchases.\\" (So everybody buying the product shares the credit card transaction costs.)Gleick also looks into the changes that a cashless society will bring, noting what kinds of crime will no longer be worth doing (e.g., kidnaping for ransom, armed robbery.) He reflects on the phenomenon of \\"float\\" in which digital money can be used by financial institutions to earn interest for themselves. Gleick observes that holders of the Yankee dollar at home and world wide (think of the large safe-deposit drawers of Arabian sheiks) are actually lending \\"their wealth to the United States, interest free, just as holders of American Express traveler's checks lend their money to American Express.\\" (p. 153)I also liked the essays on advertising (\\"Who Owns Your Attention\\") and on the growing lack of privacy (\\"Big Brother Is Us\\") and on the awesome power of Microsoft (\\"Making Microsoft Save for Capitalism\\"). There are lesser essays on political websites... web browsing (\\"Here Comes the Spider\\") and software contracts between vendor and user (\\"Click OK to Agree\\"), etc. Finally Gleick notes that we are \\"Inescapably Connected\\" and gives on page 299 a weird but telling example of how we are being transformed. We are not yet \\"neurons in the new world brain,\\" he observes, yet we have gotten so much in the habit of knowing things, or at least being able to find them out that \\"You get a twitchy feeling that you ought to push a button and pop up the answer.\\"I've felt that, and soon a connecting chip may be inside my brain that really does do something like twitch as my synapses are activated by the World Wide Web."},{"Title":"What Just Happened: A Chronicle from the Information Frontier","review":"I've read Gleick's Faster, and when I saw What Just Happened in the bookstore, I picked it up immediately. Gleick's candid analyses of technological triumphs is an enjoyable walk through the computer and Internet revolution of the 1990s; however, the book was lacking some of the critical interprative edge that one finds in Faster, and for that reason it fell a little short of my expectations. Although What Just Happened does offer an opportunity to step back and think about the implications of the IT revolution, I found myself reading it more for entertainment."},{"Title":"What Just Happened: A Chronicle from the Information Frontier","review":"I found myself keeping a list of all the things that he overemphasized, like modems, or the things he completely did not anticipate, like Google and Wikipedia. It was just too hard to remember what life was like in the 1990s without feeling a tinge of boredom. Still, I found the book funny in some places, and I applaud his thoughtfulness and willingness to be skeptical about technology. Many science and technology writers talk about certain inventions as if they're the greatest things, like we should accept a refrigerator that knows what's inside it and will reorder milk automatically with no question. Not so Gleick, he's frequently suspicious of the social consequences of our addiction to microprocessors and the internet. Privacy, identity and individual freedom weigh heavily in this book."},{"Title":"What Just Happened: A Chronicle from the Information Frontier","review":"A book about the Information Age that is of course becoming dated every day, but still a rewarding book to read. A book that forces a reader often in the midst of a daily struggles with technology to take a step back and review the progress that has been made when one is often so close too the action to appreciate it. The author gives a little overview to show the overall plan of the technology and where it is headed, and discusses some very interesting ideas, such a cyber-dollars. Money that would be good only for internet purchases, only if people will have enough faith in an internet monetary system. The book is a collection of previously published articles by the author. The book is easy to read, thought provoking when discussing the future, and his summaries of the recent past remind the reader of the progress being made in just a years of the information age.

Unlike the others, if someone borrowed this one and didn't give it back, that would be OK.

The huge, thick volume might not serve as a text but rather a desktop reference. It was chosen as a course bible for my organic synthesis class.The first part of the book deals with strcutures in organic chemistry. It serves as a prerequisite to understanding of reactions and mechanisms. This section contains information about some of the most ambiguous organic intermediates (species) such as nitrenes, carbenes, carbocations, and tautomers. One can also find detailed discussion on cis-trans isomerism and structural reactivity relations.Part II of the volume discusses organic reactions and types of reactions in depth. Representative reactions include nucleophilic substitution, electrophilic substitution, rearrangements and radical reactions. Though March's work is self-containing as a sole reference, it is also meant to serve as a companion to major texts such as Miller's &quot;Advanced Organic Chemistry&quot;, the double volumes of &quot;Advanced Organic Chemistry&quot; by Carey and Sundberg and any undergraduate introductory texts.March's book distinguishes itself in discussion of organic named reaction such as Susuki reaction, Wolf-Kishner reduction, Swern oxidation, etc. One might often encounter difficulty in looking up named reactions. Jerry March's book will ease much of the trouble. Organic chemists and students should not miss this treasured work. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Advanced Organic Chemistry: Reactions, Mechanisms, and Structure","review":"As usual, March's brings tens of thousands of reactions and structures to the desktop.

Best of all, March's gives you an excellent set of references for more depth on any reaction. Just the same, the mechanistic side tends to be a bit short or sometimes not illustrated as well as elsewhere. Also, the paper is way too thin, giving bleed through if I copy it for reference to give someone else when trying to prove or illustrate a point. Its also a bit fragile and sometimes harder to read because of that. It really should be better paper and two volumes by now. Softcopy would be even better. I haven't used this new edition enough to be certain, but I think there are more typos and so forth in it than I remember seeing in my earlier edition.

Since Jerry's death in 1997, it will be up to Wiley to find a suitable coauthor to update this volume. I can only hope for a choice as good as Jerry. Along with Cotton &amp; Wilkinson's Adv. Inorg.

This book is actually worth the price."},{"Title":"Advanced Organic Chemistry: Reactions, Mechanisms, and Structure","review":"I paid more for my 4th ed. new, and find it to be worth even more. It is not a cookbook per se, but it is a very comprehensive textbook that details general reactions by functional group. It outlines every way known to remove, add to, or otherwise modify every functional group. There is as much commentary as is needed, if not more, and every pathway is mentioned regardless of how exotic or primitive and low-yielding. The corresponding OS synth refs for specific cpds. are given for each type of reaction, along with a total of 15,000 other refs in footnotes. This was cutting-edge in 92, with much updating of the 3rd ed. The index will take you to the section that shows how to make the manipulations you want - if it doesn't, it probably can't be done."},{"Title":"Advanced Organic Chemistry: Reactions, Mechanisms, and Structure","review":"This is far and away the most useful book to own for anyone involved in organic synthesis. Nothing else comes to &quot;Jerry&quot; for completeness, accuracy, and ease of use. I also highly recommend &quot;Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis&quot; by Greene.

If you are curious about the various reagents that can be used for a reaction that you have in mind, March quickly leads you with two indexes to the desired information in heavily documented and succinct detail. I won't say that this is the only book that you will need, but with this book and a few notable others, as well as a nicely stocked university periodicals section, you will be well on your way to having a large chunk of organic knowledge at your fingertips. It's fantastic if a set of reaction conditions are just on the tip of your tongue and you need a reminder. It will also help you out if you are lost and need a brainstorming session. I can't tell you how many times it has helped me out of a jam."},{"Title":"Advanced Organic Chemistry: Reactions, Mechanisms, and Structure","review":"I cannot believe nobody has written any comment about this book here yet.

Buy it!"},{"Title":"Advanced Organic Chemistry: Reactions, Mechanisms, and Structure","review":"He's done it again! For those of you who thought March just couldn't get any better, take a look at the new edition. With my first use, it's already saved me the meager purchase price in time and energy.

More adult in subject matter than Nemo, it is less visually resplendant, but still quite powerful in its invocation of the fears and hopes underlying our day-to-day thoughts.This collection is the standard, but it collects only a fraction of what McCay produced (this is a reprint of a 1905 volume, but the strip ran until 1910 or 1911). You can pick up the Checker \\"Early Works\\" volumes for a more complete run (in questionable quality) and there are more strips in the Canemaker book on McCay as well as the Fantagraphics \\"Daydreams and Nightmares\\" (which I highly recommend).Checker has since produced a fine collection:The Saturdayswhich would make a great follow-up to this book.When I first wrote this review in 2006, I pleaded for someone to do this strip justice with a comprehensive reprint. Little did I know that Ulrich Merkl was, in fact, working on one at the time. You can search the web for his \\"The Complete Dream of the Rarebit Fiend\\" ([...]). I highly reccommend it, though it is a bit pricey. Amazon now lists it here:The Complete Dreams of the Rarebit Fiend"},{"Title":"Dreams of the Rarebit Fiend (Dover Humor)","review":"Winsor Mccay is considered one of the pioneers of cartooning AND animation. His drawing style is so architecturally fine tuned that each panel of his work is a piece of art itself! The Rarebit Fiend has a habit of eating toasted cheese before going to bed and consistently wakes up from a nightmare at the end of each piece. The nightmares vary from the slightly off-kilter, to the maddeningly surreal. This large paperback book reproduces a good number of these, and is well worth the price. Essential for fans of early comic strips."},{"Title":"Dreams of the Rarebit Fiend (Dover Humor)","review":"Though the last century has witnessed a supernova of scientific innovation, our fizzy watery brains still haven't revealed the mysteries of sleep and dreams. Whatever underlies these prickly enigmas, many embrace dreams as something fundamental, almost primordial, to their being. Some even claim those inchoate simmering movies that invade our senses through some wispy interior camera obscura expose our desires, fears, or our \\"real selves.\\" Perhaps this seemingly inexplicable nature of our private films explains why a some one hundred year old comic strip, fashioned with simple pen and ink, can enrapture gadgetized and digitized twenty-first century people. \\"Dreams of the Rarebit Fiend,\\" a newspaper comic strip that ran in the first decades of the twentieth century (1905 - 1911, 1913), penetrates the human psyche even today. It must have given unsuspecting nineteen-noughts incurable nightmares. Some strips may even disturb modern readers. The premise was both simple and brilliant: each strip depicts a horrid surreal nightmare that ends with the dreamer sitting up or plummetting out of bed while cursing the apparently psychotic properties of Welsh Rarebit (sometimes also called \\"Rabbit\\"). Each cursed dreamer has imbibed this cheesy concoction served over toast before retiring to bed. Not one of them questions the correlation between their gluttonous ingestion of this noxious substance and their subsequently well-deserved nightmare. Had a \\"National Welsh Rarebit Council\\" existed at the time, it would have declared outright war against this comic. History was kind, thankfully, because \\"Dreams of the Rarebit Fiend\\" stands as one of the medium's unquestioned masterpieces. One of the numerous brainchildren of Winsor McCay, this early strip often gets lost in the shadow of his better known masterpiece, \\"Little Nemo in Slumberland.\\" \\"Rarebit Fiend\\" is often described as \\"Nemo for adults.\\"For adults it indeed is. At least, adults will likely appreciate it more than children (the platitude \\"comics are only for kids\\" is an unfortunate recent development in the US). This slim inexpensive volume reprints one of the few, if not the only, volumes printed during the strip's actual run (according to the back cover, only two or three copies of the original book exist). Following a brief introduction, including a McCay biography, the phantasmagoria begins to spew. The first strip features a poor soul being dismembered, a la Monty Python's \\"Black Knight,\\" by speeding carriages. Before his wife, who is the dreamer, awakes, we see his disembodied legs, arms, torso and head floating splayed behind a rushing car. The head proclaims \\"Well! I believe I see my finish at last.\\" This serves as an apt introduction to what follows. Another man gets cooked by natives (depicted in the stereotypes of the day), but they find him insufficient, humorously adding insult to injury. Another dreamer gets melted in a sticky mass (also featured on the cover). Others find themselves eaten by handbags that morph into vicious animals, getting soaked in blood, being cloned, frozen in giant icicles, headbutting locomotives, stuttering during important speeches, falling down endless steps, being buried at their own funeral, being hideously suffocated to death with chloroform, or simply going mad. One bizarre episode involves a cigar store Indian (again, remember the times) who seduces a man into kissing her. His wife sees him and sues for divorce. In the next to final panel a judge declares \\"I grant your wife absolute divorce and $5000.00 a minute alimony. Yes.\\" The wooden seductress says \\"I love him still as much as ever.\\" Absolutely brilliant. Other unforgettable strips involve a tailor trying to fit an amorphous and impatient customer (with \\"bazazza fits\\") and a man whose perspiration causes a flood, bringing a trolley car to a helpless halt. The scariest episode appears towards the end as an already frightening furnace transforms into a demon that pursues its owner across rooftops. He runs and screams in absolute terror before waking. Here lies the stuff of nightmares. If one could distill this strip into a catch phrase, \\"Psychological horrific surreal comedy\\" might suffice. Maybe. It defies description. Don't even try.This small book provides the best introduction to this sadly obscure strip. Nothing like it exists, or could exist, in today's mainstream. \\"Rarebit Fiend\\" hails from the golden age of comics, where newspapers were one of the few means of mass communication. And comics helped sell newspapers (as anyone familiar with the history of \\"The Yellow Kid\\" knows). Consequently, newspapers wanted the most sensational, artistically accomplished strips possible. Today's comics, even the best ones, pale embarrassingly to the strips of this early era (at least those in newspapers; today's \\"Graphic Novels\\" often include stunning artwork). This book provides the perfect glimpse into these bygone glory days. Even some one hundred years later it can shock, intrigue and disturb. The artwork, of course, shines throughout (discounting McCay's puzzlingly sloppy word balloons and often smashed text). Readers who want more have few additional resources. Checker books have released a book of Saturday strips and anthologies of McCay's early works, including examples of \\"Rarebit Fiend.\\" Also, a complete collection was printed privately in a limited run of 1,000 in 2007. Copies now fetch quite a premium (though many strips were on an included DVD). As admirable as that book is, hopefully a more widely accessible complete collection will emerge soon. In any case, given the stunning quality of this much smaller collection, \\"Rarebit Fiend\\" has the staying power of our very nightmares and dreams."},{"Title":"Dreams of the Rarebit Fiend (Dover Humor)","review":"This is no children's book of comics! When I showed it to my over twenty-one daughter she asked,\\"This used to published in a newspaper?\\" She loved it as much as I did. The \\"Far side,\\" type humor is still funny today. Dover said they removed some of the ethic humor that would offend people today. It is sad to me that people can't laugh at themselves any more without getting offended. I would have loved to have seen all of the strips uncensored and formed my own opinion."},{"Title":"Dreams of the Rarebit Fiend (Dover Humor)","review":"Dreams of the Rarebit Fiend presaged Little Nemo In Slumberland. This series of excellently illustrated comics anticipates the coming of Little Nemo.These drawings were done at the early stage of Winsor McCay's career.Winsor McCay made his first animated cartoon at age 38. At that time he was already illustrating Little Nemo In Slumberland for about 14 years.These black and white drawings offer a glimpse into the technical drawing skill and genius of Winsor McCay striking even more considering they are set in a World where most people can't draw worth a crap.The editorial drawings of Winsor McCay teach as much if not more than the Little Nemo cartoons. In these drawings, Winsor McCay shows deft handling of the artistic demands of drawing crowds and entire cities close up and in the distance. He is a master of perspective.Unfortunately, most people have never heard of Winsor McCay who died in 1934. However, he counts as one of my major artistic mentors. The best I ever had, alive or dead, probably. Winsor McCay through his drawings taught me how to be a better illustrator. He would teach anyone that who looks at his drawings."},{"Title":"Dreams of the Rarebit Fiend (Dover Humor)","review":"I'm delighted to see that this book is available. I bought my copy of this book in the mid-70's and it is still one of the favorite books in my library. Mr. McCay is just devastatingly funny and honest about the mayhem that is turned loose in our dreams. Decapitations, public nudity, personal disasters and humilitations of all sort are rendered in the sky's-the-limit fashion that dreams take...and definitely not PC!McCay is also a superb draftsman, although these cartoons are a pared down version of his work on the Little Nemo strips. Highly highly recommended."},{"Title":"Dreams of the Rarebit Fiend (Dover Humor)","review":"I discovered Winsor McCay pretty recently and have been enjoying the Little Nemo full page newspaper spreads and been astonished at McCay's talent. I've seen the full sized hardcover Maresca Little Nemo 2005 publication, and two hardcover reductions: the Evergreen (Taschen) and the \\"Best of Little Nemo...\\" edited by Richard Marschall, which closely resembles the former in most cases (evidently from the same source). I read the reviews here on this book, \\"Dreams of the Rarebit Fiend\\" and decided to order it. It too is amazing, but in a very different way. Whereas Little Nemo is wonderful and lavishly illustrated and colored, it doesn't make me laugh. However, just about everything in the 1905 black and white Dreams of the Rarebit Fiend (this book) makes me laugh out loud. I wasn't sure when I ordered (not having seen any of the material previously) but quickly realized it's well worth it. I can't think of a modern comics artist who makes me laugh so consistently.This is a handsome little book and McCay's illustrations are beautifully presented. I own 4 different McCay books and have seen another and of all of them, this is the most flawless... and by far the cheapest!"},{"Title":"Sailing Seamanship and Yacht Construction","review":"This book sells for around $50 in museum bookstores. For that price, you get a beautifully bound coffee table book with full page photos - definitely worth the cost. However, if your funds are limited, and your coffee table is already full, this ebook is a great alternative. For me, it was a good find, because I personally know and have sailed on a number of the yachts included in the book.This book also provides an insight into the (other) world-wide Depression. While much of the World was struggling to put food on the table, the wealthy were building fabulous yachts purely to race each other. The &#34;J&#34; boats were the penultimate result of cheap labor and materials available in the 1930's - 130 foot boats with solid bronze hulls, an outrageous extravagance even by today's standards.The enthusiasm of the author for this subject is infectious, and he was truly fortunate to have sailed on so many wonderful boats. He also describes his meetings with many of the greatest yacht designers of all time. For a personal insight to the golden era of yachting, I recommend this book highly."},{"Title":"Zany Afternoons","review":"If you are visiting this item in the Amazon.com online catalogue, then something special brought you here.

The real author used to be an automobile advertisement illustrator in the '50s, which accounts for the other half of the book. See, what the other reviewers were laughing too hard to explain, is that this is a book of spoof illustrations, taken from various publications. Blueblood nostalgia for the Jazz Age is sent up in gags on conspicuous consumption like &quot;Indoor Golf&quot;, &quot;Autogiro Jousting&quot; and such. The clever, name-dropping text of those pieces is very funny, also. The auto ad gags feature parodies of 1950s layouts, featuring vehicles that look like they came off the proverbial wedding cake, and double-talking sales copy, like &quot;...with twin-lock dual-fade brakes!&quot; Anyone who's read old copies of Popular Science will scream at the parody of the articles (the automatic nose-blowing device) and the ads (I quit, boss!

There is just nothing to compare it to. The first part is a spoof of how the neer-do-well old money preppy crowd, out on a lark, might fight boredom. The retro 1930's style artwork is priceless, and the accompanying narration equally funny. The humor is delightfully dry. For example, In the Zepplin Shoot, depicted much like a grouse hunt, the comment is made by a gentleman in tweeds, \\"They fall so gracefully.\\"The fun games are depicted poster style, accompanied by short commentary. Games like Tank Polo, Autogyro Jousting, and the all-in-fun, \\"Blindfold the seaplane pilot\\" (as it banks and twists between skyscrapers). The absurd \\"Wing Dining,\\" as depicted on the cover, is worth the price of the book.The second part is a collection of spoofs of 1930's through 50's advertisements, everything from monstrously large automobiles with tail fins, to rediculous home-study courses so you can afford to \\"eat steak.\\"There is just too much good about this book that can't be covered by a review. It does, however, require a somewhat twisted sense of humor for full appreciation.I first saw a copy of Bruce McCalls colorful book when I borrowed one from a colleague 35 years ago.

The new printing has replaced that material with \\"The Adventures of The Hotel Throckmorton, est. 1906.\\" This new (?) material (though still funny) is not nearly as good - even though my Dad and I both agree that \\"Stewardesses...\\" was probably our least favorite section of the original. But why the replacement? Was the orignal artwork misplaced? Very very odd.One thing to note that I JUST spotted after years of faithful reading, one the airplanes featured in this original section was one of the first commercial jetliners that flew for British Airways... the De Havilland Comet. Infamous in real life for it's disastrous window blowouts. The plane originally had square windows which would occasionally blow out at altitude causing the entire fleet to be scrapped. Looks like the \\"Airlines of Emerging Nations\\" contained an extra insider \\"joke\\" from Mr. McCall."},{"Title":"Zany Afternoons","review":"Man I first laid eyes on this book while skimming the shelves of my hometown public library in December, 1983. Dumbfounded, I checked it out and took it home.

I actually don't think these fateful events colored my reading of Zany Afternoons. Just thought you might enjoy the coincidence.From &quot;Autogyro Jousting&quot; to &quot;Nazi Regalia for Gracious Living,&quot; this book is a fabulous parody of splashy print promotions from a bygone era. McCall's humor, dry and relentless, brought no end of giggling around my house. I would awaken in the night laughing.I renewed the book a few times before reluctantly turning it in. After that I learned just how hard it is to find this book.Four years later when I was a senior at Berkeley I spotted it in a set of coffee table books at the Morrison Library, where as if by bureaucratic miracle students are allowed to do only recreational reading as they luxuriate in big overstuffed chairs.

Unfortunately, it's also the best line in the book. This is a vast, slow-moving work in which all of the action takes place in the last twenty or so pages. Most of the rest is a more or less inaccurate description of the whaling industry and the anatomy of whales. The sea is perhaps one of the most colorful and compelling backdrops for a novel filled with tension and power, but Melville fails to communicate either of these except in rare moments. Coupled with this is his failure to fully develop what would have been some very interesting characters. One of those rare cases in which the movie was better than the book."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Moby Dick is a great story but a poorly written novel. The story of Moby Dick is actually very interesting and contains great meaning and symbolism. The events occurring in the book have the perfect combination of truth and fiction to make the action gripping. Nearer to the end of the book you are overwhelmed with a sense of wonder and suspense as you try to guess how the book will end and are blown away by the events that occur.In Moby Dick, Herman Melville proves that he is the master of descriptive language. In some parts of the book the extremely descriptive writing is an extremely positive aspect of the book but in others it makes the book unbearable to read. During the action parts of the book this excessive description makes the book a delight to read as you can see in your mind exactly what is happening. While envisioning this some amazing images come into your mind. Like the sights in the real world that would make you stop and take another look, you feel compelled to read certain passages over and over again just to keep that image in your brain. The other up side to his description is the attachment you feel with the characters. With the simple mention of a main characters name you can picture them, hear their voice, and give an attitude to the words.The downside to all of this description is during the long down time in the book, when no action can be described in hundreds of pages. For example there is one chapter all about a man's pipe, a chapter describing a bowl of chowder and a particularly long chapter describing the masthead (top of one of the masts). These long rants about unimportant aspects of the story make up the first three quarters of the book, as Moby Dick is not even spotted until the last quarter of the book.I would not recommend reading this book unless you can find a condensed version that only contains the details important to the plot. To just pick up Moby Dick in its original version and start reading is a painful and can be an almost impossible task. Overall however the story and the theme of the story is very entertaining and meaningful."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"digital books are perfect and easy to use!

A curious book, readable and worth the effort."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"The introduction to my edition says that Moby Dick is regarded as one of the \\"Great American Novels\\", along with Tom SawyerI wonder how many readers have actually completed Moby Dick which is extremely drawn out, with the first whale not even appearing until almost page 300.It gets off to a good start with its famous opening line - \\"Call me Ishmael\\" - and introduces the reader to the whaling town of New Bedford and the members of the doomed expedition about to set off in pursuit of the white whale, led by the insane captain Ahab.There are plenty of well-drawn characters and the tension between Ahab and his officers and the relationship between Ishmael and the harpooner Queequeg is convincing.Some parts are even quite amusing but, once afloat, Melville spends too much time sidetracking. He tells sailors' stories and presents dull factual detail in a documentary way about different types of whale, ships, ropes, harpoons etc.This interrupts and overshadows the flow of the narrative such an extent that I became impatient and gave up two-thirds of the way through."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Very good book read it a million of times AMAZING!!!!! Its just missing a little umph!!! I think very good book missing something though."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"The writers of Maxwell Smart once had a gag saying that \\"nobody gets through War and Peace\\". The same may be said about Moby Dick.While I cannot recall an American novel that has been more influence on so many writers (even Star Trek II and Star Trek VIII, were loosly based on Moby Dick), and while I agree Melville is a wonderful writer rich with ideas and expression, there is also truth to be said that many of the peoples complaints about the book are justified.Melville smothers the reader with endless symbolism , Biblical references, commentary about life, and endless exposition, to the point where the basic story itself gets completely lost. This is a bit disheartening because Melville is an excellent writer who does make it look easy to do (it's not, trust me on this).The story itself is quite basic. Ismael, the wandering seaman who is the story teller, and not much else, is set to become a whaleman. He has the mind of a scholar, so if you were being logical about this, you would find it quite amusing that the character itself is not the head of a university!We witness him eating, sleeping and having running commentary on everything from man itself, to an almost endless lecture on whaling and whales. Don't look for plot or dramatic tension at this point. There is none.Thirty four chapters or so later, the story shifts to Captain Ahab, and Ismael becomes more of a columnist rather than a character at this point. This is of course the famous part of the book. Be warned! The real story of the destruction of the ship via the White Whale named Moby Dick, occurs in the last half of the book starting on chapter 120 or so. You heard me. The last half of the book. No I am not making this up!The reason why it takes so long, is that Melville still isn't done pontificating on the issues and ideas that are important to him. It's not that this material is bad, it isn't. Melville, is without question a talented writer, and this book is quite remarkable, but the pace and story arc are grueling in their length, and todays reader may be screaming at the pace of the novel. There were times I wondered why after the first twenty four chapters, the most engaging theme was the eating of soup. On top of that lots of the dialog is King James style which can be a bit hard to read through.Perhaps it is us with our impatience and demand for quick rewards that forever ruins a great book by Melville. Please understand thought that despite my complaints, it is a great read ,but I grew up on things like plot and chacter and conflict so without that, I have to fight to maintain interest.However, unlike Melville I will not take One hundred and thirty three chapters to ponder the signifigance of that idea nor will I wonder endlessly on the thoughts of the mind so carelessly, so tediously, that I shall again loose its purity of thought like man itself who has drifted endlessly in search of that greater meaning of ones life only to find the taste of brime to fill his soul. Well you get the idea now don't you!"},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"This book was a very good one. But it had alot of big and unusual words in it. They do not interdues Moby until you get half way thrue the book.The words were ity bitty. they used an accent as if you were in there country. This book was a very good book."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"An over the top piece of work, one of the world's best novels and certainly the single best American novel. Melville points out to us what at some repressed level we all know yet won't allow to occupy our psyche's: that our world is a dangerous and mysterious place where evil masquerades as good. Melville was so far ahead of his time on so many issues like racism, the environment and slavery that it's no wonder he died broke like other tormented visionaries like Van Gogh. Melville's style makes it a tough and challenging read, no doubt, but it all works to deliver one profound and critical message after another. A must read if there is one."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Time well spent is exactly how i would characterize a reading through of this classic work of American literature. It is inconceivable to think of any novelist today producing such a work, with its lengthy digressions on a wide range of subjects that do and do not have to do with whaling. It's equally as laughable to think that a publisher would accept it in this age. But Melville had the love of the sea and its most maginificent creatures, and the courage to write his novel to his standards, not anyone else's. And it's a cracking good sea story. The last 40 pages are thrilling and truly classic. Invest the time and mental energy to read Moby Dick; the novel will reward your efforts."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Moby Dick is one of my favorite works of literature. It is a book about madness and obsession and humanity, combined with a fascinating history of whaling. I do realize that many readers may not be as enthralled as I was by the long passages about whales and whaling methods that interrupt the plot - I hold a degree in marine science so I must admit that I'm a bit biased. But even if you are not so interested, I think that it's worth fighting through those chapters for the sake of the story."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Ironcially, Moby Dick is not the real star of this novel, but he (the whale) is merely used as a vehicle for Melville to describe whaling as an industry and as a way of life. The whale only manifests himself in the very end of the novel. However, Melville describes the characters and the events so expertly that one cannot help but to be intrigued by the ideas and situations outlined therein. You can almost smell the salt air. P.S. I have often heard that the one unanswered question in the book is this: Why does Captain Ahab hunt the whale, for revenge or to rid the world of a creature he believes is evil? Interesting question, a selfish act versus a selfless act. Well, as far as I could ascertain, it is clearly a story of a madman obsessed with vengeance. Read for yourself and see if you don't agree."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"While this book has a strong plot that pulls the reader into its style and context, there is a little bit too much attention to detail that does not need to be included.

Well for starters, the book is quite a task to read, but a task that should be completed by anyone who is interested in fine writing. Or even perhaps the human pysche. But of course the book is not without flaws. The main flaw being that of length. I found it extremely irritating at times the number of pages Melville would prattle on about the type of rope used by the whalers or the hardness of the steel used as the spikes for the harpoons. Another criticism I have to make is that collectivly the tale of the search for White Whale only constitutes about half of the novel. The other half taken up by seemingly trivial information on the tools of the Pequod. But if these aspects can be overlooked or perhaps even skipped, as alot of the chapters don't add to the story at all, then the final result is an extremely well written novel about the insane quest of Ahab for the White Whale in which he &quot;came to identify with him, not only all his bodily woes, but all his intellectual and spiritual exasperations.&quot;"},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Melville's sixth novel, \\"Moby-Dick\\" received mixed reviews when published in 1851 and was nearly forgotten after the author's death in 1891. In the early 1920's, the book was rediscovered and quickly achieved the stature of an American classic. The book is inexhaustible. I have recently returned to it. In his 2005 study, \\"Melville\\", Andrew Delbanco discusses some of the ways \\"Moby-Dick\\" has been read over the years. Delbanco writes:\\"Moby-Dick was not a book for a particular moment. It is a book for the ages. What gives it its psychological and moral power is that, freakish as he is, Ahab seems more part of us than apart from us. Like all great literary representations of evil, he is attractive as well as repulsive. And so Melville emerged in the twentieth century as the American Dostoevsky -- a writer who, with terrible clairvoyance, had been waiting for the world to catch up with him.\\"\\"Moby-Dick\\" is long, difficult, and digressive. It is not a straighforward narrative. Melville pauses many times for extended chapters to explore matters seemingly tangential to the intense story he has to tell. The book is written in a baroque, large, blustery and exhuberant prose that is worlds away from the tightness and concision favored by many 20th Century American writers. Melville also knows how to build tension. The work unfolds story and by indirection. A rather lengthy opening section of the book takes place on land in New York City, New Bedford, and Nantucket. Captain Ahab's monomaical character is revealed slowly through hints, offered by a shadowy character with the Biblical name of Elijah and by visions and foreshadowing. A sermon on the Book of Jonah by Father Mapple frames the book and it is quickly contrasted with Queequeg and his attitude towards his gods. When Ahab and many of the main characters appear, the book is already well underway.The book is narrated in the first person by Ishmael -- a Biblical outcast -- with his famous opening line, \\"Call me Ishmael\\". As the story proceeds, however, Melville seeminly disregards the limits of first-person narration as the story describes closely scenes and events well beyond Ishmael's ability to know.Ishmael denies that the story of Ahab and the great whale is an allegory, and his denial deserves to be thought about and taken seriously. Many readers have found meanings of all sorts in \\"Moby-Dick\\", ranging from the personal, through the religious, through the political. Melville was himself a seeker and largely an autodidact with the deepest doubts about religious faith combined with a need to believe. Understanding evil and suffering is at the heart of \\"Moby-Dick\\". Ahab fanatically and selfishly pursues the whale and destorys himself and his crew. Ishmael, in signing on to the Pequod and undertaking a voyage hazardous in the best of circumstances is also a seeker in the story. Through luck, prudence, and sense, Ishmael is a survivor.The story moves between Ahab's quest for the whale and a welter of factual material on the biology of whales, the history of whaling, the techniques of the whale fishery and immeasurably more. These long sections, which puzzle many readers, seem to me integral to the work. Mellville wants the reader to see the difference between a symbol and an icon, taken for good or ill, and the vast being of the natural world. Ahab expands the whale to something metaphysical in his ravings. Melville understands this, and he also understands that the whale is simply a magnificent animal. The various factual chapters move in different ways. Most of them develop a theme at some length before offering philosophical or spiritual questions about the matter under discussion. The broad themes of the book seldom are absent from view.During the course of the voyage, the Pequod encounters other whalers, some of which seek Ahab's help while others bring messages of the joys of life. Ahab dispenses with what are the overtures of common, shared life with his abrupt opening query to each of them: \\"Hast Seen the White Whale\\"? Readers can identify with Ahab to a greater or lesser degree as they try to understand the passions which tend to rule their own lives. There are many extraordinary scenes in this book, not the least of which is the climactic fight between Ahab and the whale at the end.Amazon's reader reviews allow for many different perspectives on Melville's book from readers with different degrees of familiarity with the text. \\"Moby-Dick\\" invites many different readings in searching for the sources of one's demons and for the common life. I have tried to offer some of my own reactions from my recent reading of \\"Moby-Dick.\\"Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"A splendid tridimensional world projection despite the narrator's skillful efforts to act as a filter-consciousness, amending, magnifying, trivializing, commenting, and mostly, competing with the author-in-the-text's voice; a dialogical product functioning as a parable of post-modernist literature to come in one hundred years."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Over 300 reviews of this book so far, so what more can be said? Yes, the print is small in this compact mass-market paperback but the story and themes are gigantic.This is perfect writing. It's distinct, regardless of borrowed conventions (Shakespeare has been mentioned), and weaves - or floats - several different styles of prose together. The book takes time and concentration to read but it is absorbing once you open up to it. Moby Dick may just be the greatest American novel of all time.It could be said that Herman Melville used the Pequod as an allegory for the United States. Whaling is the ultimate in capitalistic excess, as mentioned in one of this Bantam edition's appendices. Notice Melville mentions the differences between the whaling ships and the other cargo fleets on the water. Whaling ships were never hurting for oil to burn, and in fact burned it crassly. The crew was made up of diverse nationalities, all coming together in near perfect union for one common goal - whales yes, but more precisely wealth and adventure. Such a weak foundation for their brotherhood was an easy target for the demagogue Ahab, a madman whose dream is to seek vengeance and conquer pure evil. Moby Dick is scapegoated as such. The whale, content to thrive on his own does not seek the Pequod but rather, they seek it. Fedallah - that demon from within the ship (or within Ahab) - at first hidden from the crew but one who gains prominence as madness unfolds, enthralls the leader. Blind allegiance coupled with greed and bloodlust brings the Pequod to ruin despite the ominous signals to reverse course, to repent. In the end, they go down, new flag flown high.Melville takes the time to satirize and skewer the current (and recurrent) philosophies of his day, memorably the Transcendentalists (among others) in the \\"The Mast Head,\\" Chapter 35. Characters' roles ebb and flow unexpectedly. Tragic and unfortunately prophetic, perhaps needlessly so. Tragic also because books of this sort are not written in these times (if they are, I'd love to know!). The references Melville throws around will have you dashing to your dictionaries and encyclopedias and will leave you richer for having read it. Highly recommended for continuous reading and reflection."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"I anticipated the arrival of the \\"Moby Dick\\" I had sent for. I had planned to use the book in a collage. We were instructed by our teacher to find a copy of a book that meant a lot to us. When \\"Moby Dick\\" arrived in the mail I looked it over, checking the pages, the cover, and the overall condition. I was so happy with the book I decided to keep it for my library instead of my original plan, which had been to take it apart and use it in the aforementioned collage. The book, which is a Modern Library publication, includes pen and ink drawings, the kind of illustrations I remember from books I had read in my youth. The type font is an easy size to read. If I were to give a copy to a young reader, I would look for one just like this one. The condition was practically perfect. The book had once been part of a small library, the name of which was printed inside the cover, lending history to the volumn.

I would recommend this book for ages 12 and up. Especially for young boys and adventurous young girls."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"This version is by far the best I've seen. The quality of the book is unsurpassed."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"\\"The Whale! The Whale! Dash on, men. Dash on!\\"Moby Dick Or the Whale by Herman Melville is told through the eyes of Ishmael, a young man that becomes bored with his life and decides to go whaling. After befriending a harpooner and cannibal named Queequeg and traveling to Nantucket he finds himself on the Pequod, a whaling ship sailing around the world. Then Ishmael discovers the captain's complete obsession with killing the whale that devoured his leg. Things only get worse when the captain spots that whale and decides to risk everything to wreak his vengeance. Will Ahab's fixation with killing Moby Dick lead his crew to \\"a watery grave\\"?The book was very interesting, but the author spent much time describing topics that were unnecessary to the plot, such as whale classification. This made the reading pace very slow until the end, which had less filler. The genre was probably realistic fiction, even though some of the situations were hard to believe. The book is written in old English, so it is difficult to understand at times. I would recommend the book to kids in high school or older with a exceptional vocabulary and finds \\"classic\\" books interesting."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Most books I don't think i'd want to read twice but I'm definitely gonna read this book again because it was one of those books you gotta read twice to enjoy it thoroughly.

Ahab was the insane man bent on one thing in life - revenge. This made the story all the more intriguing as Ahab went closer and closer to the edge as he led the Pequod onward to Moby-Dick. Thar she blows! If you liked this book too, I recommend also Billy Budd, Sailor."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"This was indeed the best book I've ever read. It gave interesting descriptions of savage native life and of life at sea during the time. Ahab was a perfect portrayal of a man blinded by revenge. He will go to any price to get it, and the price he pays...well, that would reveal the ending. Bildad was the religious old man most people think of when they think of the times. Peleg was the swearing contradiction of Bildad. I definitely think you should read this book. It was very interesting and fun to read."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"I am so grateful that &quot;Moby Dick&quot; was required reading in a college English class of mine. I'm not savvy enough to describe it like a book critic, so let's just say that it is AWESOME. I felt like I had read a work of art from a person inspired by God. However, and this is a big however, I would have to admit that if I had not read it in college then I don't know if I would have had the stamina to work through the book on my own. I've given up on a couple of Faulkner books. Present day life has too many distractions, and one must immerse oneself completely in &quot;Moby Dick.&quot; If you can do it, then believe me you will definitely see that it is worth it and you will have the satisfaction of knowing that you read one of the greatest novels ever."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Well, so I had to read (in English, a foreing language for me!) a book which lasted for more than eight hundred pages. Slightly scary, I may say, especially when the average number of books this year were 13. Well, indeed some parts of the novel are simply delightful. Any reference to the cultural clash with Queequeg, or any description of the landscape, the sea, the people, were delightful. And then, in the middle -yes, encyclopaedia entries. &quot;It's a bit misleading,Mr. Melville, what the h. do you want?&quot;. Until I had to revise it for an essay. The thing is, take all that &quot;flat passages&quot; again. Think of the Pequod's fate. Does it ring a bell? Ishmael, as a Cassandra, spents half the book prophetizing what will happen, and nobody seems to listen. When you read it twice, Moby Dick is simply one of the best metaphors of life. If only it weren't so tiresome..."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Probably anyone who picks up this book already knows the story of the whalers against the whale, driven by Captain Ahab's obsession with killing Moby Dick. But there's a lot more in this book besides: it's a treatise on whales and whaling, it's a novel about friendship, and it gives you all the excitement of an adventure story. In some ways Moby Dick is very much a nineteenth century novel along the lines of the work of Jules Verne--it is full of lengthy asides intended to instruct the reader. Although this tendency slows the pace, it makes Moby Dick a more substantial novel than it would otherwise be, and worthy of its status as a classic."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"First I have to say that Moby Dick is probably easier to get into if you occasionally like to read poetry. Otherwise it's a challenge for the average reader like myself, and a challenge that I personally found worthwhile. It's not the &quot;light read&quot; to take to the beach for summer vacation. There is a flow to the writing that is an essential part of drawing the reader into the story, similar to Shakespeare. The plot is exciting without it, but the writing is what raises this story to a classic. Captain Ahab (our hero?) is a man whose personality and fate have been twisted from a comfortable course as a successful whaler. When we meet him, he is well on his way to turning from an intelligent, logical captain and family man into a driven hunter. As we read, we notice the remains of what was a simple love story: A man of strong senses and the passions of an artist; in love, as he knows it, with whaling. Instead of a life of turbulence, which would seem more to fit his intense, sensitive nature, Ahab is a respected whaler with a deep and quiet love for the ever-changing sea living a lonely but content life providing for a rarely seen family. We watch his submersed passion turn from a sense of joy in pitting himself against the giants of the deep, to a slow, consuming hatred of one whale--Moby Dick. Moby Dick is the great white whale who took Ahab's leg and left him with eternal physical pain. Where this physical pain began, so through the story Ahab's emotions follow. Moby Dick changes Ahab's submerged passion from gentle love and appreciation to intense hate. Ahab has been betrayed. He has been hurt. In his contorted mind, his pain can only be removed by the death of Moby Dick. We came on a game, a hunt. Now the hunt is everything and death is the only end. In the telling of this tragic adventure, we are swept into the picture. We feel the vastness of the deep ocean, the power and beauty of nature, the awesome strength of the whale, the fury of the storm, the boredom of endless hours of waiting, and the exhilaration of the battle of man against nature. We become one with, now, the man, now, the whale. Words disappear behind feelings. And we feel it all. &quot;Moby Dick&quot; takes us on a splendid trip to a time and a place and a state of mind. This book can entertain the readers who like &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; and enchant those who enjoy Phyllis Whitney. For those not into long sentences and rhythm, it may be more work than fun to get started, but I don't believe anyone could stick with the book to the end without growing as a reader and ultimately liking the book a great deal."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Moby-Dick is the best book ever written, only excepting All The King's Men by Robert Penn Warren. All of the allusions and metaphors and meanings in this awesome book could only be found by spending a lifetime on it. &quot;Moby-Dick and Taoism&quot;? Get a life! Melville was not &quot;warning&quot; us about anything except the danger of maniacal pride. The whole point of the book is that Ahab doesn't give a blankety-blank about Taoism or any other philosophy that would tell him to lay off the whale; he hates the whale and he has willingly, deliberately submerged and sacrificed his reason and his soul to kill the white whale, and at times he even meditates on the madness of pursuing a dumb animal for an injury it no doubt was not even conscious of -- and then rejects this argument because of the insult to his pride offered by Moby-Dick's very unconsciousness.The stylism in Moby-Dick has never been surpassed; the rainbowing, extravagant images -- of the blank, mind-banishing terror of the color white, of the seductiveness of the dreamy reflective nature of the ocean from the crows-nest, of tired old Ahab throwing his pipe into the ocean, rejecting all comfort forever -- are breathtakingly striking and unforgettable"},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"While reading this book- you feel it is just itAltough not poetry- you sense that every wordis just right, and cannot be taken out.You are consumed by the book , and your soul gets embedded in the world created by it"},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"A suberb, atmospheric book of biblical proportions. It is a journey through Melvilles obsession, as well as Ahabs, and presents a robust and romantic metaphor on oligarchy and the power and influence that psychopaths in charge exert over their crew or army. Fury like Ahabs has an almost indominatable force. Men like this have lead many unwilling accomplices to their graves. If it was't a whale it would have been something else, a mountain, a country, possesion, endless wealth, the lust to usurp and dominate.I loved Melvilles rambling passages about whales."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"We should dispense with the Great American Novel business that usually clouds the real issue about the literary value of this book, along with others like Twain's &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot;. Moby Dick is a difficult book: difficul because, like America, it tries to make sense of many things all at once. We're confronted by Ishmael, the philosopher struck by wanderlust; Queequeg,the highly-civilized savage; Ahab, the American Faustus; Starbuck, the moralist who is torn by a temptation to blow Ahab's brains out with a musket and the desire to turn him away from his revenge plot; and finally, the silent yet pervasive character after whom the book is named, the White Whale himself, who seems to be some sort of deity whose motivations are unfathomable, like the depths he inhabits. It is next to impossible to find a satisfactory treatment of all these characters at once. Keep in mind that these are just the main characters; we haven't even started talking about the others yet. Where should we start judging a book? By what standards? It would take a lifetime to figure out all the hidden real-life implications within the book.

It seems that Melville couldn't decide whether he wanted to write a dark, brooding novel of obsession and destruction, or rather a scientific treatise on whales and whaling. The digressions seemed interminable. I recommend future readers simply skip them; you won't miss much and some of what he says is quite wrong (e.g., whales are NOT fish). I suppose a modern editor would have cleaned that up for him and prevented the novel from suffering from its reputation of being boring (not at all deserved).

This is a fantastic story about revenge, the follies of man, and the inevitable shadow of fate. The only downside to this novel is Melville's extreme use of confusing diction. Sometimes adding twenty adjectives to a simple sentence or over describing an unembellished setting makes it arduous to follow. But the incredible story makes up for this measly flaw.The story touches greatly on symbolism and imagery that enhances the novel's purpose. For example, Captain Ahab's ship, The Pequod, represents doom. The ship's name even comes from a Native American tribe that vanished off the face of the earth after being attacked by white settlers. The ship is also decorated with objects relating to death; which include whale bones and teeth. Not to mention the boat's painted with a dark black.As acknowledged before, the diction in this book is more than prevalent; which sets the foundation for excellent imagery. The description of Father Mable when Ishmael listens to his sermon in New Bedford to the final pages of the climatical battle of Moby Dick conjures a movie inside your head. Everything seems real and looks as if it's happening in front of your eyes. Herman Melville entices the reader with his exquisite form of imagery.This book offers something for everyone. Whether its the incredible story for those enjoyable raconteurs or the author's unique style for the literature fanatics. Moby Dick is a novel that will last for centuries to com and will never lose its literary merit."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Finishing this book is an accomplishment. It's more than the length. Reading it is a commitment and I feel a certain intellectual and snobbish satisfaction at making it to the end.I wasn't sure what to expect from Moby Dick. I didn't know much: its famous first line, that captain Ahab was obsessed in his quest to catch Moby Dick. I'd been warned that the whale only appears in the last few chapters. Otherwise, I was going in completely blind.Getting through this book feels like hunting the whale. There are peaks of action and long stretches of seeming calm in-between that focus on minutae about whales and whaling. I don't know if any of Melville's facts are true. I didn't bother to check, because ultimately, that wasn't the point.My experience. I'd started the book once and quit. Started it again and got further. But, after a few entertaining opening chapters, things started to look bad (= get boring) and I thought I would quit. I cursed this book on a daily basis. I was bored. I was confused. I had to look up way too many words related to parts of boats (gunwale) or antiquated English.But, somewhere after the chapters providing a lengthy descriptions of every type of known whale (I can't confirm if it presents precise information or not), I got into the experience of reading this book and hungered for it. I got excited when the Pequod encountered another ship. I pained for poor Pip who lost it after being left in the sea a little too long. Queequeg was a favorite. REally, everyone was. Even Ahab was fascinating.The book is experimental and innovative. It isn't a book to read for plot or character development. I think it's the sort of book you can find what you want to in its pages: metaphors for religion, the meaning of life, etc. It isn't an easy text. It requires work to slough through it. But, ultimately, it pays off. Even the seemingly boring bits (though I guess I didn't find them so boring as the more I read, the more interested I became) help make the drama of the final chapters that much more exciting.I won't reveal the ending, but it is abrupt. I was sad when I realized that I had reached the epilogue. But that is beside the point.At any rate, I wouldn't recommend Moby Dick to anyone. It's a particular book that will speak to a sophisticated reader who is looking for a book that looks at deeper questions in an indirect way. The reader must be willing to shift gears with Melville's changing approaches. Finally, it is best for someone who isn't put off by confusion and lack of clarity, who can be patient and wait for a payoff."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"I was alway led to believe that this American classic was very boring, but I did not find it so. I thoroughly enjoy it."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Some novels get the recognition they deserve, some are mysteriously overlooked and others...well, let's just say that the reasons for \\"Moby Dick\\" being considered a great work are as difficult to hunt down as the whale itself. The narrative is confused and rambling, often all at sea. Thus we have a first-person narrator (Ishmael) who is somehow able to tell us what Captain Ahab is thinking when alone in his cabin, a harpoon, without a rope attached, which is thrown into the sea and has miraculously reappeared in the next scene, and so on. Whole books could be written, and indeed have been, detailing all the errors in this story. Apologists have contrived elaborate and unconvincing excuses for what is clearly simple carelessness on the author's part.As for the characters, they never quite make sense. If the whale represents Evil and Ahab Good, why is the latter such an unsympathetic person? What are we to make of the livid lightning scar down his side? The book is full of such presumed symbolism but it all remains vague and unfocused. Ahab having a young wife and newborn child also does not fit the man and his motivations. Queequeg, the most interesting character, is abandoned and forgotten by the author near the end.Melville attempts humor but it is embarrassingly weak. Sometimes, as when he discusses the nature of whales and decides they are fish, not mammals, it is hard to know if he is serious or joking. Either way, it would be such a poor joke, who cares?\\"Moby Dick\\" has such an iconic place in American literature that anyone with a serious interest in the subject will want to read it. Please do so unprejudiced by the conventional view that this is a masterpiece. Ask yourself honestly; is it really any good?"},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"I bought this book for a friend in jail. Alas, he was unable to read it because the font was too small."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Let me start by saying that I read this book as part of a book-club with several friends. When it was my turn to select a book for us to read I chose Moby Dick simply for its status as a classic. There really is a very good tale here, but it is often buried in unneccessary and uninteresting digressions. More than anything else, this book needed some judicious editing. It would be a much better book at half the length. Melville's prose and vocabulary is challenging and filled with nautical jargon that is almost incomprehensible to anyone not familiar with sailing. Don't get me wrong, I don't object to unfamiliar words. Quite the contrary, I enjoy adding osbcure words to my vocabulary and sprinkling them in my conversation. However, when one has to look up several words per page, it does tend to interrupt the flow of the narrative.I would say the best way to experience this tale is to watch one of the film adaptations or perhaps to read the Classics Illustrated comic book adaptation, which has the distinct advantage of telling the tale in only 64 pages."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"I don't know how such a book can be a classic!

I hate Captain Ahab. I especially hate Herman Melville for writing this novel. It was not popular when it was initially published, and I don't understand why it is popular now. This book is not a fine wine, it does not get better with age. The story is overblown, the characterizations are horrible, and it is impossible to connect in any way with what you read. Had Melville cut this book down to about 25 pages, that would be bearable. Unfortunatly, he never stopped writing, and if he were alive today, he would probably still be adding onto Moby Dick.

I got to be honest, I've only read 10 chapters and that was all that I could take from from this major let down. Honestly I haven't read a good &quot;american classic&quot; if there is such a thing maybe for the exception of Huck Finn. Those chapters about Ishmael sleeping with whatever his name was and Ishamel had such a good time with the other guy's arm over him and leg over him that he didn't know if he was straight or gay any more. But that's not the point, the point is that this book is horrible, it is even worse then another so called american classic &quot;the red badge of courage&quot;. I love literatur just as much as the next guy but we must face it 100 years or so ago American literature was reall weak and lagging from the rest of the world, perhaps now they're starting to catch up with writers like Ann Rice and them."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Moby Ick's more like it.

Primarily, however, it is boring, plain and simple. There are endless digressions, and asides, and plot-sabbaticals. Very easy to put down. Undoubtedly an amazing intellectual feat to pull off (hence my five stars), but still...I'd estimate that 1% of high-schoolers assigned this book end up actually reading it. Can't blame them, either. To be fair, the last twenty pages, when Ahab and Starbuck have their final tete-a-tete, and Ahab famously snarls to his finned nemesis \\"From Hell's heart, I stab at thee!\\" do cause a frisson. And I don't regret reading the book...it's a great laurel to rest on, but I will never pick it up again. Eh, give 'er a go...if you finish it, you'll know that you're a man, not a boy."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Moby Dick is one of the rare novels where I think that you should go and see the movie first before reading it. The Plot of the book becomes very hard to follow with there being over 200 hundred chapters in the book(1-10 pages long)so you should go and see the movie so you can know the plot and know what is happening so when you read it you won't get lost. Herman Melvile provides incridible details almost as if it really happen. This can make some people think the book is boring but Melvile seperates the 500 page book into over 200 small easy to read chapters so when you get bored with what Melvile talks about in one chapter you can just skip the whole chapter and not miss anything big in the book. Melvile kind of makes the book long with his details but towards the end it gets really exciting and the ending is the best you will ever read. I promise."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Embellished and imbued with light yet piercing thought, and rolling in the opiate waves where all things man wants most swim fated never to be caught, you catch sight of MOBY DICK just before it disappears--a wondrous marvel, a collection of prose poems pounding out with brilliant sparks some chain of eerily, obscurely, indisputably connected (with much a symbol and a never-prior-scented smell from lands close and unexpected that will never bear a human foot) themes and necklaced on a plot that through a whirlwind to a WHIRLPOOL runs through words that flex like honey, pound like GUNS, challenging as bravely as words have ever dared the WHITENESS that all words abhor and where, no matter what a quantity of brilliance mad captain MELVILLE spends, all words and (hark, you critics!), words about words meet their END!AND it'll turn your conversations with your friends into THIS for a long time after you read it:\\"Arr! Come over here, mate. Hast seen The Whale?\\"\\"What?\\"\\"Lo--listen close, now, 'What?' is all he says! Now hear this, sailor, art thou the dust that settles in the shadow of an ape? What ears hast thou been lent by long and crude progressions of a wretched birth? Has ever man spoken more clearly than in the plain and English syllables I have cast thy way? To the pleasant and monotonous heavens I declare again: Hast seen The Whale?\\"He he he."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"An American classic? Yeah, maybe, but not a very good read; more soporific than reading Nausea or studying for the CPA exam. Too much whale talk. It is interesting to learn of the differences between baleen and right and sperm whales, but to devote a whole lengthy chapter to it? I dunno, seems a little excessive, especially when Mr. Melville integrates a lot of the scientific blabber (not blubber) about whales in the rest of the chapters as well. Was he just trying to impress us with his cetology knowledge or bore us to death with his words stiffly lined together like a harpoon slowly inserted through the brain? Maybe I missed the boat, I don't know. Supposedly the style was revolutionary at the time, more fluid and natural than some of the old dogs writing then, like Hawthorne, but it sure doesn't seem that way now. Maybe fifty years from now Kerouac will seem slow-footed. Who knows? That still doesn't change the fact that Moby Dick ranks up there as one of the most overrated novels in American literature, right up there with The Sun Also Rises in fact. Now Bartleby the Scrivener was a helluva story--concise and tight, and he didn't waste bombarding you with superfluous legal background info. My advice to you, the American reader: Read the first two and last two chapters, skip the rest. Then get Bartleby the Scrivener and enjoy. Oh yeah, when you do read the last two chapters of Moby Dick, let me know how they are, 'cause I never got to them."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Moby Dick is the most BORING book I have ever read!

But if you have other options, turn to those. We were given a list of books in English class, and I chose to read this. After a week, I was just in page 103.

Very few 16-year-olds forced to read this in high school English class are going to have good things to say about it. Why high-school English teachers persist in inflicting it on adolescents is a mystery. Moby Dick is a novel about the desperation and futility of the search for meaning in life (the whaling motif is secondary), which is not a theme that will ring true for readers who've barely begun their own such quests."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"I won't try to repeat any of the millions of words that have been written about this book, but will restrict my short comment to an aspect of this novel that is not well-known: its relevance to the disease of depression.During my bout with severe clinical depression, I had occasion to read \\"Moby Dick\\" by Herman Melville. Because of my condition, while reading it I suddenly realized -- and I mean KNEW -- that Melville was afflicted with depression. I still remember the passage, Ahab, watching the sunset, thinking to himself:Chapter xxxvii - SUNSET (page 165) \\"Oh! time was, when as the sunrise nobly spurred me, so the sunset soothed. No more. This lovely light, it lights not me; all loveliness is anguish to me, since I can ne'er enjoy. Gifted with the high perception, I lack the low, enjoying power; damned, most subtly and most malignantly! damned in the midst of Paradise!\\"And that exactly described my condition. \\"Gifted with the high perception,\\" I perceived the total, utter pointlessness and meaninglessness of -- not only my life -- but of existence itself! And so I could no longer enjoy the things of the world that other, less \\"insightful\\" mortals could. I later researched the life of Herman Melville, and it turns out that he did indeed suffer from depression!I heartily recommend reading \\"Moby Dick.\\" And if you're \\"lucky\\" enough to read it while clinically depressed, you may find it has a lot to say to you that may prove valuable. And you'll learn things from it -- many things -- that someone who is not experiencing depression could not possibly understand."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"The thing I always tell people about Moby Dick is that the beginning is lighthearted fun, the ending is amazing, and the middle is (to be blunt) quite dull. I think most people who make it to the end love the book, but getting there is a chore because Melville spends a great deal of time either talking about minutia of the whaling trade, or going off onto tangents almost in a stream of consciousness fashion that seem to have very little to do with the narrative (he devotes an entire chapter to telling why the color white is frightening, and another to listing characters from legend whom he identifies as whalers (Perseus I can see, but St. George?)). The language is gloriously poetic in places, but other times it rambles almost aimlessly and feels very convoluted and self-indulgent, even by 19th century standards. (Yes, I know these are qualities that the book's devotees hold dear, but they're also the reason that so many people never finish the thing. Might as well be honest about it.)At the end, it's extremely disturbing getting into Ahab's head and understanding what makes him tick-disturbing because it's present in all of us, an instrinsic part of the human condition: his rage at not being God. Ahab is pride incarnate, with all the hatred that comes with it. (The story of Jonah, sermonized in the beginning, is ultimately one of the need for humility before God, with the whale as God's agent. And it's important that Jonah's sin is not merely disobedience but a refusal to go on a mission of mercy.). I felt unsettled for a long time after I read this, because it demonstrates what a short jump it is between a classically Satanic villain (a being of total pride and hate waging an all-destructive and ultimately futile war on God, and luring all others to follow him to damnation) to the modern concept of the existentialist hero, fighting bravely against hopeless odds. Seen through his own eyes, Ahab is genuinely heroic--and then the reader has to step back and realize that on the contrary, hatred has all but consumed Ahab's soul, leaving the Rachel without help and leading his crew to death for his own pride's sake. If to understand is to approve, the reader who now understands Ahab is left asking, \\"Good God, what kind of person am I?\\" Today we tend to view pride as a virtue rather than a vice; what does that make any of us?Needless to say, there's a lot there. It wasn't until years after I'd read the book that I'd sorted it out enough in my mind to feel that I finally \\"got it,\\" and I'm still in the process of getting it. Everything in Moby Dick is a symbol, and I suppose that no two people completely agree on what the symbols represent (Melville surely wanted a degree of ambiguity, anyway). Here are my own opinions on what it all means: (spoiler warning)The whale represents God.The crew is mankind.Queequeg, Dagoo, and Tashtego are the pagan nations of the Earth, willing to literally worship Ahab.Starbuck is Christendom.Ishmael and the rest of the crew are godless men of no religion, whose anchorless wills are overwhelmed by Ahab's own.Elijah is a prophet.Ahab is the Antichrist.Fedallah is Satan, and his attendants are demons.Even though Queequeg is one of the pagans, it is through his seeming death and resurrection midway through the novel that Ishmael lives--because of the coffin. And Starbuck, innocent of any crime, goes down with the ship anyway (giving Ahab pause, just before his own death, to essentially stop and say in horror, \\"What have I done?\\")I'm not sure what Pip represents.If you're buying a paperback, I'd recommend the Tor edition, (ISBN 0812543076) just because I think it's got a very nice cover painting, something publishers often don't bother with when reprinting a \\"classic.\\""},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"It is as if by mistake that I picked up this book. I thought it would be an adventure story, like The Count of Monte Cristo or something of its like. As my reading progressed, it became clear to me, however, that it was more of a philosophical rumination rather an ordinary suspense or thrill book. After I finished reading the book, I've had a feeling it was more than a masterpiece--Melville had just uttered my innermost feelings through a myth, with so much life, that I could never be able to.No, the book isn't a tragedy. In the surface, you may call it that way. But more than anything, it is a Triumph. It speaks of man's upholding of his dignity amid torture in the universe. Melville gave us, implanted in us, through the most poetical language, something that we can hold onto, something that will re-reveal to us, against Gods, that we are unconquerable."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Sitting in a small room overlooking Mount Graylock on his farm in Pittsfield, Mass, Herman Melville was a magician. There are no words to describe the ineffable, and Moby Dick is *the* novel for anyone who has ever been on a quest; anyone who has wanted to know something that loomed just out of sight.Sure, Ahab hunts the whale...but these chapters pale in comparison to Ishmael's own quest: knowing what the whale is. He is the greatest narrator in the history of fiction. The two chapters: \\"The Whiteness of the Whale\\" and \\"Moby-Dick\\" are matchless, as are \\"The Hynea\\" and the humorous \\"Bower in the Arsicades.\\" One can envision Ishmael covered in tatoos of the whale's dimensions.Is Moby-Dick tedious? Only if you're reading it as cetology. But as allegory, it is a tale of limitless drive--even self-consuming drives.Best book ever..."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"It must be admitted to, whether you enjoy his work or not, that Herman Melville is one of the most thorough writers in the English language.

The book is too thorough, too exact and too honest for readers who do not dedicate a significant part of their life to reading it.As for a review, I will not offer one, because of my deep appreciation for the novel (I do not want to bore you with my overused adjectives). I will, however, offer sound advice on how to enjoy the novel:1. Read the unabridged versionYou cannot remove one comma from the work as originally published without losing the beauty of the novel.2. Have a Bible handyPreferably a Bible with an index. There are many Biblical names and events mentioned, including Job, Elijah, Noah, the Great Flood and Rachel.3. Set aside plenty of timeThe novel took me over seven months to complete. Rarely was I able to read more than two pages in one sitting.

I feel for you, dear Ahab..."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Moby Dick is one of the most elegantly written novels in American history. While it is the story of the Pequod's journey around the world in search of Moby Dick, it is also far more than that. The psychological studies of Captain Ahab and the other boatsmen that Melville has sent along on the voyage are captivating. At down times in the Pequod's search, Ishmael, the onboard narrator, gives many insights into the mind of the typical early nineteenth century whaler. He also gives brilliant, colorful analyses of whales and other marine wildlife encountered on their journey. Some of these chapters may seem tedious at first, but their fundamental nature in relation to the heart of the story and the motivation of its lively characters quickly becomes apparent. While this book might appear lengthy to the modern American reader, it is definitely worth the time spent in its consumption as it is one of the most beautiful of all American novels."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"We call classics those works of art which say something essential about the humankind and that also say different things to different people, no matter when or where they live. This book is one of those. It is a story of adventures in the sea; of the obsession of a man; of Fate and its inevitability; of the blind race that is life; of the undesirability of getting what we lust after. The plot is the simlpest, as it happens with many masterpieces: Ismael tells us the story of a mad captain whose only thought is to kill the whale who damaged him. The symbolism is not hard to find. What happens in between is great literature. Instead of writing a long and pretentious lecture, Melville decided to tell his message in a novel of adventures. We travel the world with Ahab, witnesses of his madness and his deep humanity (not understood as goodness, of course). In a sense, we all are Ahab: we lust for something we don't really know, and we spend our lives running after that undefinable object, until we die. Moby Dick has a quasi-biblical tone and ambience (and size), but every single page is worth the time."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"I picked this up because it was Moby Dick and I wanted to read the book that so many of my friends and peers had so much scorn for (they said it was utterly boring).I began to read the book and was immediately captured by the grace of the relationship between Ishmael and Queequeg. Then, as the book became more cerebral and Melville went into his (extremely) detailed descriptions about every part of a whale and every type of whale, my interest began to wane. I kept pushing on, though, enduring for nothing more than the incredible passages that sprinkled this book. And then it hit me. This book hits a reader hard. For a few hundred pages, I was removed, looking at Ishmael and only mildly interested in the workings of the boat and the scrubbing of the deck.then it changedAfter a while, Melville's poetic prose drew me in and I was on the boat. I caught myself anticipating the arrival of whales and dreading Ahab's rise to the quarter deck. The book captures readers. Perseverance is rewarded, you will be missing out on so much if you put this book down.And this is just dealing with the story. Melville is undoubtedly one of the finest writers ever. He is so subtle; he challenges the readers to keep up with his elevated symbolism. There is so much meaning in each line of this book, it is impossible to realize it all. This book deals with so many things: the basic adventure story, God, nature, human ambition, etc.If you are unconvinced, pick up a copy and read the last page of &quot;The Whiteness of the Whale&quot; chapter. Good readers will be rewarded by this book. They will be given a literary opus for all people who enjoy books.

Like the ocean it contains a depth that would take a single person years, if not a lifetime, to fathom. But it's also a very intense experience to read this book from cover to cover. If it's a class assignment, it's bound to be torture. If you're reading it because you think it's important to read, you may have a bad experience. However, if you listen to Ishmael, listen to his fascination and catalog of the whale and the experience of whaling, you will have revealed to you a soaring treatise on existence on Earth as a human. God, death, transcendence, reek: it's all here: an amazing undertaking for Melville and for any reader. But prepare yourself with patience and awake attention before you undertake this rigorous journey."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"I just finished reading this breathtaking masterpiece which somehow eluded me until now, though I think this is a book one enjoys more when you come to it with some life experience under your belt.I became fascinated with it while reading about Melville in Daniel Boorstins The Creators, and I have to say that I'm even more flabbergasted now that it was so lightly regarded when it came out and that Melville spent most of his life after writing it working as a clerk in NY city. But then, how often this is the fate of the great creative visionaries.It is truly a colossus that interweaves so many elements in a way that defies categorization. First off it's one of the greatest adventure stories and maybe the greatest sea adventure story ever written. There's great humor and parts where I laughed out loud (a rarity in itself) the philosophical elements are some of the best in literature and then of course there's the language. Beautiful prose that often rises to the level of poetry with so many fascinating allusions. Just an amazing creation that stands alone amongst the milestones of literature.And even though it is long and I found myself getting a tad impatient at times with the chapters describing whales and whaling, this is more the fault of the reader who's been a little too influenced by the age of instant gratification. As a matter of fact, some of the passages that I marked for their unsurpassed artistry and depth were in those very chapters.It seems our lives become more accelerated everyday, sadly it seems at the expense of our inner lives.And such a great reminder that one of the most moving and profound entertainment experiences one can have is also one of the most inexpensive and accesible to all. And such riches for the imagination and soul the literary masterpieces have to offer, and none more than this one."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Yes this is not for the faint of heart...tough sledding at times but the reward of allowing Melville's poetry to seep into your soul makes it well worth it.

I would advise any first-time reader of &quot;Moby Dick&quot; to give himself plenty of time to get through this book, cetology and all, say 4 to 6 weeks. It's also a good idea to have a passing knowledge of maritime terminology: to know the bow from the stern, what a bowsprit is, a capstan and a shroud. Because Melville was a sailor for so many years, he assumes his professional jargon will be understood. He was also a well-read man, and &quot;Moby Dick&quot; is filled with historical and mythological references. (Quick! Who was King Porus?) It's best to keep a one-volume encyclopedia handy. The story itself is populated with mysterious characters: Ishmael is the narrator who never fully reveals himself -- and who recounts scenes he couldn't very likely have seen. Then there's Bulkington, the mariner who is only seen from a distance, but who receives his own special apotheosis,then disappears. Captain Ahab's wife is described as &quot;a sweet, resigned girl&quot;, but the Biblical Ahab's wife Jezebel was a scheming pagan. Does Ahab have a dark family secret? The first time Ahab himself is mentioned, the Pequod's owner calls him &quot;a grand, ungodly, god-like man&quot;, and his long-awaited first appearance has all the drama of a Shakespearean entrance. (He's been compared to Lear and Prospero, not to mention Marlowe's Doctor Faustus.) And when the title creature appears, he's more than a whale, he's a world. Ahab against the world -- it's a theme that inspires one dazzling chapter after another: Chapter LXX, Ahab's Aristotelian contemplation of a severed whale's head. Chapter LXIV, the cook's strange sermon to voracious sharks. Chapter XCIV, with its mind-boggling homoeroticism. Chapter CXXXII, with its beautiful comparison of sky and sea. The language becomes quite rich. Here's Ahab at the height of his obsession: &quot; ... supper he never touched; nor reaped his beard; which darkly grew all gnarled, as unearthed roots of trees blown over, which still grow idly on at naked base, though perished in the upper verdure.&quot; Readers have called &quot;Moby Dick&quot; difficult, bizarre, and boring. Is it difficult? Yes. Is it bizarre? Actually, it's probably one of the most bizarre books ever written. Is it boring? Only if you're not willing to accept the literary conventions of a hundred and fifty years ago, before there were telephones, radio, movies and television. The long descriptions and digressions are a part of the universe Melville created in &quot;Moby Dick&quot;. If you're bored with slasher thrillers and political potboilers, you'll be fascinated by this masterpiece of American fiction."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Melville's book is astounding, to be sure, but this version begins with the first chapter, not with the extensive front material that Melville included. In other words, it is NOT a complete text."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"I give credit where it is due... Melville knew his subject. All of that knowledge, however, weighs down the story. There were times when I drifted away, forgetting about Captain Ahab and his fervor to find and kill the white whale and thought I was listening to a manual on how to be a whaler. I feel now I am trained well enough to go on such an expedition, that is what I carry away from the story. Which is sad, for this voyage that Ishmael has taken on by chance, his friend Queequeg and above all the maniacal bent of Ahab upon the Pequod seeking revenge is so diluted that much of its impact is lessened.No doubt, this book is a classic full of thought provoking themes. At times it's enjoyable. But the intent on reading it is not to become a whaler. Remove that third from the book and the ill-fated seafarers' voyage resonates as a deeply emotional metaphor.Volume and rate were good, reader was engaging."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"On the heels of thoroughly enjoying Nathaniel Philbrick's IN THE HEART OF THE SEA, there was little choice as to what next to read. Studying Philbrick's subject, one can only marvel: how inconceivable that in the early nineteenth century men from a tiny island off the coast of Massachusetts could build sturdy boats, sail them half-way around the planet on voyages lasting years, and harvest oil from the heads of the most terrifying creatures to inhabit our world. Fighting colossal leviathans with wooden sticks called harpoons that men would hurl from wave-tossed dinghies, thousands of miles from land. All to bring home the finest oil attainable for machinery and illumination. (Melville: \\"Sperm oil in its unmanufactured, unpolluted state, the sweetest of all oils.\\") Improbable expeditions, almost unimaginable, but true. Man versus Sperm Whale.The 1820 voyage of the whaleship Essex, ended by a single ferocious and attacking sperm whale, provided an amazing real-life saga of adventure and ghoulish survival, brilliantly recounted by the contemporary historian, Philbrick in the year 2000. But back in 1851, a writer who himself had spent time in the whalegrounds of the South Pacific, Herman Melville, parlayed this very tale as he heard it from survivors and Nantucket relatives into an epic story. The Essex becomes Melville's whaleship Pequod. And it is this ship's executive, Captain Ahab, who through his obsessive and relentless pursuit of his finned nemesis, Moby Dick, becomes an American literary icon. In Melville, the tale becomes, Man versus Himself.MOBY DICK is rich with heavy themes, heavy writing and much metaphor. The 821 page novel famously begins with an introduction from everyman narrator: \\"Call me Ishmael.\\" Ishmael introduces us quickly to the upcoming journey, to life in the whaling port, as well as race relations and class politics of the time. All English majors know the book bogs down in the middle with painstaking descriptions of this fantastic industry. Melville belabors analysis of the hunters, their equipment, and their prey. Readers learn about tying knots, and boiling blubber and the precise dimensions of a full-grown sperm whale. Thankfully, Melville breaks up the reading into digestible chapters, and topical lessons. It's as if he brings us along on a lengthy time consuming day-by-day voyage, and we learn in painstaking detail everything about this peculiar industry. We become intimate insiders. We get inside the heads of the whalemen. We get an up close look at their possessed Captain Ahab. And we begin to sympathize, we begin to learn what drives Ahab.The language is archaic and a struggle at times, (we don't hear \\"There she blows!\\" until page 781,) but highly rewarding. More than once, I turned down corners of entertaining pages. We Americans can thoroughly enjoy Ahab's cheeky thoughts on monarchy: \\"Certain I am, however, that a king's head is solemnly oiled at his coronation, even as a head of salad. Can it be, though, that they anoint it with a view of making its interior run well, as they anoint machinery? Much might be ruminated here....\\"We enjoy the second mate Stubb's exhortations to row: \\"Why don't you snap your oars, you rascals? Bite something, you dogs! So, so, so, then:- softly, softly! That's it- that's it! long and strong. Give way there, give way! The devil fetch ye, ye ragamuffin rapscallions; ye are all asleep. Stop snoring, ye sleepers, and pull. Pull, will ye? pull, can't ye? pull, won't ye? Why in the name of gudgeons and ginger-cakes don't ye pull?- pull and break something! pull, and start your eyes out!\\" He makes a first rate coxswain.And Ahab's remorseful line, surely echoed a quarter century later by William Ernest Henley, (who like the whaling captain had lost a leg,) in his famous poem INVICTUS: \\"Oh, oh, oh! how this splinter gores me now! Accursed fate! that the unconquerable captain in the soul should have such a craven mate!\\"Melville hoped this book would be his masterpiece, but it was not recognized as such during his lifetime. Not until after the first World War, and oil found under the earth began the mothballing of the whale industry, did academics recognize the grand, arching narrative. But Melville was confident in his ambitions. Ishmael remarks as much: \\"Such, and so magnifying, is the virtue of a large and liberal theme! We expand to its bulk. To produce a mighty book, you must choose a mighty theme.\\"[Final note: I highly recommend purchase of this version of the novel which is chock-a-block full of fantastic pen-and-ink line drawings by noted American artist Rockwell Kent. Kent's illustrations, completed in 1930, help pull readers through tedious portions of Melville's text with their sharp lines, ominous tones and dramatic composition. How appropriate - Kent spent much time aboard sailing vessels in arctic waters and saw the same whale pods as did Melville.]"},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Writing Quality: 8/10.Melville is a great wordsmith, there is no doubt about that. And if I was a little bit more versed in the development of literary language, I might come to the opinion that Melville is better than an 8, perhaps even a 9 or a 10. But my taste has been shaped, for better or worse, by more recent syntax and articulation. I can see wonderful phrases frequently as I flip through the novel now, but by scoring Melville a little lower, it allows me to put Cormac McCarthy, who fits my syntactical taste a bit better, a little higher.Depth of Concept: 10/10.Holy Cow. Really, I should score this an 11. Anything you've ever thought about life, it's in this novel. Any interpretation you've ever had about good or evil, about power, about struggle, about beauty, about transcendence, it's in here. And whatever you think about those things, the opposite view is equally present. Maybe Ahab is a hero, an allegory for Christ. Maybe he is a villain, an allegory for Satan. The brilliance of this novel is that everything is possible, with enough material on hand for you to come up with almost any theory and follow it to some sort of conclusion from the beginning through to the end of the novel. But that's not because it's mushy or unfocused; it's because it's expansive, and nuanced, and impossible to pin down perfectly, just like life itself. Since I first read this novel for an English class, I can't say if all of my reactions would be the same if I had picked it up on my own. But with a competent instructor as a guide, reading this novel was like discovering God and then second-guessing myself. If you can't tell, I'm really into this novel, and it (along with Cormac McCarthy's The Road as a masterful piece that in some ways is on the opposite side of the spectrum) is probably my benchmark for what makes a truly incredible work of art.Rounded Characters: 10/10.For the same reasons that I describe above, the \\"roundness\\" of the characters in this novel is unsurpassed by any other novelized characters that I am aware of. You might roll your eyes at someone who says they learn something new every time they read a novel -- I usually take such statements a little skeptically myself. But if there's one novel to use that expression for, it's Moby Dick. Every character has about a thousand ways he interacts with the story, in ways both unexpected and profound. Anyone who reads Moby Dick as merely a revenge tale, or sees Ahab as merely a crazy man bent on revenge, hasn't had the courage to do more than wade on the shore of the ocean that is Moby Dick. As a starting question, you might ask yourself, is the novel Ahab's story or Ishmael's? Which you choose will determine a lot about the way you see the characters, and it might be a fun exercise to try switching one for the other.Well-Developed World: 10/10.The world of Moby Dick is the Universe, as far and as big as you can imagine it, and then a little beyond that. Clearly, I have a problem with hyperbole when it comes to this novel. But it won't take long into reading Moby Dick to get a sense of its encyclopedic nature; if there's a book to read about both the trivial details of whaling and the psychological inclinations of a whaler, this fulfills both to the maximum.Page Turner: 7/10.Moby Dick is daunting, there's no doubt about that. Even reading just a few pages can feel like a mental workout. But while some people may not connect with the material, I never found it \\"boring.\\" In fact, I found Moby Dick more readable than a variety of other novels I'm reviewing, including Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norell and Robert Jordan's The Eye of the World. It's certainly not fast-paced, but each of its many chapters is a jewel, and it feels satisfying to bite off each one of them and digest.Kept Me Thinking: 10/10.See above.__________________________________________________Overall Recommendation: 10/10.Moby Dick is the bomb. I'm sure there are those who don't care for it, and I hope they'll comment and explain why. If I had tried to read it outside of an English class, I sometimes wonder if I'd have gotten through it; it just has so many ideas. And if you're only reading it for the plot, you'll be frustrated, since the plot is only a place for the bigger ideas to stand and dance about, and generally taunt linear narratives. But if you want to have anything to say about American literature, even if you don't like this book, you've got to read it.See my profile web site for an expanded review."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"I have read so many, many books, articles and reviews try to boil Moby-Dick down to the purest most refined elements. But, like Russian television and Nietzschean abysses, when you deconstruct Moby-Dick, Moby-Dick deconstructs you. Ultimately, every reviewer finds, somewhere in this oceanic work, their own gods and demons. This particular read I blogged more fully at my blog.Boil, boil, trouble and toil. Tell me of ships, whales and oil. Melville's words are a mashup of all that comes before. There is Shakespeare. There are sailor's ditties. There is Biblical poetry. There are songs from the kids in the street. There are myths. There are encyclopedia entries. It is a hip-hop book wrought of minnesang and hula and kathakali, ending in a glorious danse macabre. Most of all, there is humor, there is seriousness, and there is drama. Come, more wine! There is a roaring furnace before us and we've tales to tell!Melville does not so much challenge the novel's form as disregard it, crafting a tale that makes sense to him, pulling together his whaling canon from all the literary and philosophical flotsam gathered in a life of global wandering. He sprinkles acts of a drama among tableaus and stories and treatises, he throws in footnotes, he steps out of the book and comments upon it, and steps back in and takes on a new voice. Throughout, ever writerly, the story plods on, in those wonderful words and phrases and rhythms, slowly building, building, building into a drama like no other (however much it borrows from others - is this the fish that sank a thousand ships!). There is a typhonic crescendo at the end, and then the music tails off.Since this review must ultimately devolve into a deconstruction of myself reading, since the book is beyond knowing, I might as well tell of this particular reading of Moby-Dick, which has been quite different from prior readings. In this reading, I see a book of uncommon dramatic energy and careful construction that seems to pull all the diverse threads of our deepest myths and creation tales together, building out of them a misty, mystifying fabric, diaphanous as Cleo's gown, a sort of alternative mythology for a world in which science and technology are emerging and removing us more and more from nature itself, and putting us more in opposition to it. He offers us this mythology because he knows that this new, scientific world, this world of observations and answers, will ultimately provide no more answers than the ridiculously pious (piously ridiculous?) world that came before.But, whatever my reading, you must tell me yours, for the book lends itself to many."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"This was one of the best sea stories ever written. It was different than I had expected. I thought it was going to be like the movie with Gregory Peck. The book is different in many ways. First you have to realize when the book was written to really understand it. It was written in the 1850s in the US.I found the book to an indictment of the times and a protest against slavery. You have to remember the characters. All the guys from Nantucket are from every race in the world, look at the three harpooners. There was an Indian, a black and wild South Pacific Island guy.This show about the way that people were treated at the time. What are they all going after but the great white whale in the South. What is the whale but a great beast beating down on all the others.Ahab is my favoriate character who against all odds goes after the great white whale to take from him what the whale has taken from so many others. It is this stuggle against this Madman who tried to get all his crew to work together to slay the beast, but as was the times the evil which was slavery still existed in the US so the whale prevailed.I also like all the details about whaling and how they used every piece of it for something. The funniest part was Keequay coming in from the rain with the poncho that was made from that part of a whale. Before this book I never knew that all these ships carried buoys with them in case of a cataclysm.I recommend this book to everyone and I was glad I was older when I read it because I understood it more."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Moby-Dick... thought it would be a good whaling book with adventure and perhaps some suspense. How dissapointed was I when I finished reading this book.First of all, Melville just loves to start discussing whales and sea and then somehow jump to an absolutely irrelevant subject, such as ponds and paintings. Secondly, if you are looking for adventure and suspense there may be some. However, what little there is of it, it is killed off by the very boring narration.I thought there were some good points. It had strong symbolism, quite a good description of the life at the time and the life of the sailors. Must admit that the characters are masterfully created, especially Ahab with the solemn mystery of his life."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Moby Dick may seem daunting at the outset - a huge, rather difficult read - but it is an amazing novel. Stick with it and you will be truly rewarded with a riviting, deeply psychological, and suprising story."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"I enjoyed this book in retrospect but it was not an easy book to read. I would really rate it at 3.5 stars and in reading the other reviews posted, I also note that it is certainly not a book for every one. The book is heavily segmented in short, bursty chapters that shift from one subject to another like a worn out party drunk who can't finish a thought or make a continuous series of points. The story really doesn't flow as it is constantly interrupted by Melville's soliloquies on history, art, culture, and philosophy. However, there is a mosaic effect to the work that is only gained in retrospect, which is actually quite impressive. Overall, the book is definitely worth reading, but expect to either appreciate it after you've read it or not to like it at all."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Bill Bailey makes this audio cassette version come alive. His voice is deep and rich. You can become immersed, even tranced by the entire works. Even where Melville gets a bit too detailed in the craft of whaling, I found that was still quite interesting."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"There are certain books which become classics because of the characters they create, the stories that they tell, what they say about society, both in the time they are written, and later, or because they simply make you think. This is not one of those sorts of classics. This book is a classic because it is a classic, not because it is any good. Oh, I suppose if one could get past the fact that it was written by a man being paid by the inch, you would find a story/allegory buried somewhere inside. But you would have to be extremely patient, enjoy torturing yourself, or just want to be able to say that you've read it in order to get there. It pains me to think of all the good books which were probably written around the same time which have faded into obscurity, while this dreck has become a classic."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"I am not a literary genius by any means. I don't have the great eye for art. But I'm smart enough to not be talked into believing something is great because someone tells me it is.Someone telling you an ugly old painting is great art because it &quot;flows&quot; or because the person who painted it was famous should not convince you to like it if you think its ugly.This applies to Moby Dick as well. I read the book, I understood the symbolism, I studied what people thought about it and how it was written and gave every attempt to like the work. I could not bring myself to like it because of one important thing. Moby Dick is boring. A great work of literature should share symbolism and teach us something and use great language, but it should also keep us entertained enough to finish it. Moby Dick fails to do so and I only finished it because I hate leaving something unfinished.Just my opinion, most people will be forced to read it in school anyways, so hopefully your opinion of it will differ from mine."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Have heard for years that MOBY DICK is a great American Classic. Decided to try to read it. Very disappointed. If you want to read lots of meaningless whale trivia read the book. If you want to read a good book stay as far as you can from this book."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"While Melville's book is considered to be at the very center of great American novels, the author recites a story with so many wandering pig trails, it is difficult to read without many breaks. It is a challenging assignment to read the book from beginning to end and there are many times where it just begs you to skip entire chapters just to avoid falling asleep or spending all of your time reminding yourself that it is a highly celebrated novel. I suppose that it is to be lauded for having taken so much effort to build characters that could be believed. At the same time, Melville made everyone either black or white. Good or evil. Pretty simplistic. Even the driven Captain Ahab only sees the whale as being an evil creature that must be destroyed for the sake of his own vengeance.At first, I simply wrote it off as being a product of the times. However, now that I am rereading The Count of Monte Cristo, I am reminded that there were some really good novels written at the time that do not make you sorry to read them. Put into context with other great American works, I just can't see how this one made the list."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"A friend told me that \\"Moby Dick\\" is really a two part book and I now know that to be true. Much of the book is a detailed explanation of whaling of the anatomy of whales.A segment of the book, mostly at the end, is the true novel. The novel portion of the book is in the nature of an adventure story, along the theme of man vs. nature. Ahab, the obsessed whaling captain chasing after Moby Dick to the exclusion of his commercial duties to the ship owner and the crew is matched against the powers of the great White Whale. I will not spoil it for you, but suffice it to say that, if you have an interest in whales or whaling or nature novels you will enjoy \\"Moby Dick\\".I started reading \\"Moby Dick\\" after reading Jacques Cousteau's \\"Whales\\" (see may Amazon review) in preparation for a vacation which included a whale watch. Cousteau's many quotes of Melville drove me to seek their source. For this I was satisfied. I do not consider \\"Moby Dick\\" to be a great novel. The character development, save that of Ahab's obsession, is shallow to non-existant. The action scenes do grip your attention. Toward its end this is a book that you will not want to put down. There are some interesting \\"time capsules\\" in its pages, such as the repeated references to whales as fish, a misnomer thoroughly dispelled at modern marine parks. A reminder that \\"Moby Dick\\" was written in 1851 is the warning to a Negro crewman: \\"I won't pick you up if you jump...We can't afford to lose whales by the likes of you; a whale would sell for thirty times what you would, Pip, in Alabama\\"Overall I give \\"Moby Dick\\" a moderate recommendation."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Can there be anything more absurd than writing a note in Amazon.com about Moby Dick? Fortunately, I write in ignorance of the Moby Dick scholarship.But anyone can see that Ishmael shares with Philip Marlowe an erudition completely inappropriate to the character's role and whole station in life. (His wonderful use of language!) There must be a back-story to each misfit, and I gather that Ishmael's (Melville's) back-story has been identified.One of Melville's motives seems to be political, to project himself as pro-people and anti-dictator. Ahab is a dictator who knows full well that he is misleading the people (both sailors and the Pequod's owners). He is driven by fear and resentment, and uses his political abilities to gather and motivate a mob that will lash out at his enemies.Does this make Ahab one of Bob Altemeyer's RWA leaders?Specifically, does Ahab stand for the Scotch-Irish warlord, the Jackson-Houston-Polk type that figured so large in Melville's time? If so, then since W reincarnated Polk perhaps the vastness of nature idolized by today's environmentalists corresponds to Melville's white whale.The book is full of innocent blood, by the way."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"This book was in good shape and delivered in a timely manner.Great job thank you for your service."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Moby Dick is a fascinating and imaginative tale and it is my favorite American novel. I must admit that some of the descriptions of whales had me cursing maledictions, but in the end I was enthralled by Melville's philosophy and metaphysics. Also, I was thrilled with the amount of symbolism that Melville used because it forced me to continually look below the surface. Believe it or not, there was also a great deal of humor in this robust book, esp. in the beginning when Ishmael meets Queequeg for the first time. Ah, there is too much to say on this one, and I do not want to give anything away, so I recommend this book to anyone with any interest. Finally, if you are looking for a love story you will not find it in this novel. There are no women on the Pequod, which is the boat the crew goes whaling on."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"This book is fantastic at every turn. While Ahab's hunt for the white whale dominates the book's foreground, Melville weaves in so many other rich elements along the way. I admit that two-page descriptions of dorsal fins are less than inspiring (I read the unabridged version), but such verbose scenes are few and far between. This story leaves you with numerous lessons about revenge, pride, relationships and much more. On top of this, the plot is very exciting and fast-moving. While there are some dense sections, this book is one to be treasured. I recommend this book highly--those who want to avoid the sections of minute detail material should try the abridged version instead."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"This story will make you forget your troubles and I don't think anyone can read it and not be affected in a personal way. I plan on reading it every decade I am alive."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Overall, Moby Dick was a wonderful piece of literature filled with all sorts of symbolism and artful imagery. It gave a very realistic take on things since the narrator was not really bias. Also, it is an anti-transcendentalist piece so it focuses more on reality and it examines the darker side of the human condition, so if you're looking for a story with a hero and a perfect ending then I suggest you find another book. It is difficult to describe how I really felt about Moby Dick because on one hand it was a boring read with a topic that less than interested me, but on the other hand it was fine, respectable literature that has a lot to analyze and that gives you a lot to think about. It is the kind of book that when you go back and read it again you find tons of little symbols and connections that you may have missed completely the first time around. That is what I like about the book; it gives you plenty of room to interpret these things as you will. I suggest this book if you do not get bored easily because it is sometimes hard not to when Melville starts getting off-topic and talking about things like the specific steps in whale-hunting, which he often does."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Herman Melville's \\"Moby Dick\\" easily wins my vote as among the greatest American novels of the 19th Century, joining such august company as Mark Twain's \\"Huckleberry Finn\\", and Henry James' \\"The Europeans\\", among others. It's surely one of the greatest American novels of all time. Part adventure story and part memoir of the whaling industry, \\"Moby Dick\\" remains as vividly exciting and relentless in its pacing as I remembered reading it years ago in Frank McCourt's Stuyvesant High School creative writing course. Perhaps it's no wonder that the novel is quoted by Captain Jean-Luc Picard in the film \\"Star Trek: First Contact\\", as a commentary on his anger towards the Borg, which seems quite akin to Captain Ahab's towards the whale Moby Dick. It was well worth waiting over twenty five years to read this splendid novel again."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"And totally worth the effort I put into it.

You have to think about it and even maybe you have to learn them carefully.This book I recommend to everyone to read because I think this book is suitable for youngsters and also for adults. For those youngsters, you guys have to be patient during the reading because this book is somewhat heavy for us.

I had no sympathy for Ahab until the end chase. He is not really developed till almost the very end.

Having read several reviews on the text, I believed it was one of the greatest of American Literary works. When I began, the tale proved to be accepatable and I found its insights profound indeed. However, the story quickly became tedious and boring (it seemed that Melville could not come up with any new material, so expanded on the mental processes of Ishmael). I wondered how readers could rate a story which had little (if any) plot and moved extremely slowly, as a great novel. True, literature is seldom interesting, and authors like Dickens and George Eliot are hardly better than Melville, but nevertheless, I believe that a literary text should at least be able to engage the reader and make him/her interested enough in it to finish it, so that the message can be fully comprehended. I did not finish Moby Dick and perhaps never will. I do not recommend it to readers. However, to give Melville credit, Moby Dick is an accurate portrayl of the American spirit in that context and thus, in that sense, does hold that mirror up to nature, as literature often does."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Very funny to read the reviews of other people.

This bored reader is either (1) too intelligent for literature: it seems hardly possible that these readers could be beyond a rich retelling and comentary on the history of all of human understanding and existence as well as a puzzling epistemological inquiry; (2) this bored reader is indifferent to the questions of life: I suppose there may be those who are not interested in reading a novel that challenges the reader to examine truth, the meaning of life and the meaning of truth (It sure interests me); (3) The reader is too stupid to understand any of the philosophical subtext that is practically impossible to ignore: It also does not seem possible to me that there may be people who cannot see past the beatiful and poetic narrative of Ishmael's to the philosophical journey through the sea of truth. This book is an amazing metaphorical masterpiece. The symbolic world of the novel is masterfully woven into the rich and interesting storyline. The novel, through its varied voices and stories takes a meandering stroll through the major outposts of human thought, while keeping the reader entertained by a enthralling plot. The novel as a whole can be taken as a journey unto itself (its own outpost of thought) through the sea of understanding which sheds light onto the human condition and the quest for truth. In any case, I am confounded by the possiblity that one could find Moby Dick boring. Please write me angry e-mails explaining your case if you do find it boring."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"I would recommend getting the abridged version.

Sometimes I wondered how any mortal could use our language in such sublime fashion, and as I looked for these passages, I knew I would finish the book this time.

Although there is too much density for today's reader, Melville continues to shine as a brilliant writer."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"I've read MOBY-DICK before but never have I understood many of the underlying messages Melville attempts to impart until this critical and absolutely necessary edition. There are many footnotes and only a few are obvious padding; understanding Melville's inside jokes, asides and biblical allusions make this edition actually fun to read as opposed to just reading it straight through without any distractions. And yes, sometimes the footnotes will interrupt the flow but this is such an immense undertaking that it is like reading a whole new book with blinders off. We see Melville's taking jabs at religious orthodoxy and realize this is not a book just about whaling; it's about man's relationship to God in all it's guises. But there is alot to learn about whaling, man's relationship with different cultures and power structures. Many of the negative reviews see this as a long, boring book forced on high schoolers who never grew up to be adult readers. It is a book for mature audiences and should be savored like a fine wine or a single-malt scotch. There is much to indulge in after the text of the novel; whaling terms, drawings of whale-ships, lots of commentary and period and contemporary reviews, etc. to immerse yourself in. This is the most complete and authoritative edition I've come across and anyone trying to \\"get\\" the greatest American (and one of the top 10 international) novels ever written can't go wrong here.

Authors do not write in this fashion any more and our literary experiences are the worse for it. The narratives are colorful and richly descriptive. It is amazing to see some of the speech patterns and descriptions that were in use during the time period that I never would have thought would be used. One has a detailed narrative given in the story and the immagination is encouraged to build, if you will, the environment within the depths of the mind, picturing the quaint towns of seafaring folk; of a cannibal tattooed and speaking pidgen-english; of the salt-spray of the waters and pitching deck of a small (by today's standards) whaling boat; and the terror of the deep -- the great white whale.Moby Dick; the Great White Whale is well worth the time to read it. I encourage you to go a-whalin' with Melville today."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"I did not enjoy reading Moby Dick. Actually, I enjoyed the beginning, right up until the introduction of Ahab. At this point it was an exciting adventure story with a very interesting sea captain, Ahab, who selfishly put his personal agenda ahead of his crew. I liked the torment and allegories that Ahab's character represented. He was both inspirational and obsessive. The white whale, Moby Dick, took his leg and now the godly sea creature needed to be punished and nothing was going to stop Ahab from carrying out his revenge - even if it was to the detriment of his crew. Then it changed from an intiguing story into a detailed lesson on whaling, on the anatomy of the whale and on any conceivable tribute to whaling that could possibly be imagined. It was here that I felt lost at sea and hoping to be consumed by the whale. The very detail explored was great, and written with a fanatical clarity and depth that can not be questioned. But it was not for me. I tried really hard to enjoy it, but it did not eventuate until the last page when i was glad it was over. If the history lessons were not so long and tedious and if they did not overshadow the heart of the story then my rating would have been higher."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"\\"Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul...\\" I read Moby Dick, and if you haven't yet, well I say give it a try."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"its Moby Dick....what more needs to be said, i am trying to read the classics i missed in my youth, this is an excellent way to do it, melville is not even close to a favorite, so i am glad i didnt pay for it and it was nice that Kindle has these for free."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"\\"From hell's heart, I stab at thee!\\" Maybe the best line in any book ever...This book is pretty fantastic in many ways. The characters are good, and the story is an interesting one. And I can hardly imagine more descriptive narrative regarding the whaling days of Nantucket. In fact, that is also the worst part - Melville can be a bit boring when goes to lengths about this set of sails or masts or whatever. But if you stick with it, you can pretty much picture a whaling vessel at work, which is quite an achievement. It's a piece of history preserved largely by this one man.So the story suffers a bit when he goes off on multiple chapters about the ship details, but it remains a good story. And Ahab is a fascinating character - he is surely crazy but in many ways also pretty inspiring. He is the quintessential man that won't give up..."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"It starts off as a story. Then you learn that the globe was charted by whaling ships, because there were more of them than explorers. There were some good moments when he looked at jonah and the whale, his method stirring up the crew into a frenzy about moby dick and the final battle with moby dick.The rest reads like an encyclopedia on the working and running of a whaling ship, its crew and dissection of the whale.

Hence my 5-star rating. However, my copy came with a damaged front cover."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"I own a half dozen print versions of Moby Dick, but I've never read one. It always seemed just too deep. I even took this version out of the library more than once, and returned it un-listened-to. I am eternally grateful that I finally forced myself to listen to it. It is devestatingly great, and this version is spoken beautifully. I have to admit that while listening to it I was transported onto a whaling ship on the ocean... and I did not want to come back to the reality of the here and now. The language is verbosely flowery and chock-full of references and descriptions, and allusions, and detail. Melville is a writer's writer, and you will not find such language elsewhere. A few notes on the story that struck me: almost every chapter has a title that alludes to what is in it, and the chapters are many and short. So, if you want to read the part about the whale's skeleton, just look for it. If you want to read about the blubber, just look for it. This is cool and very satisfying. Also, almost every chapter ends with a cute or thoughtful quip or comment or joke; this is also cool and lightens the serious tone. New readers may be amazed to find that the famous white whale of the title does not actually show up until the last hour of a 21 hour read. Although this is disappointing, it tells us that the story is NOT about confronting the whale. The story is ABOUT men, and men thinking about stuff. The confrontation with the whale is brutish, nasty, and short ( similar to Hobbe's famous quote about life ). If you think about it from another perspective, from the whale's point-of-view, the confrontation with MAN is hardly a blip on his radar; not something to think on for 21 hours. I also notice some deviations from my memory of the famous Huston film. In the book, Moby Dick tries to separate Ahab from his men to kill him. The ship intervenes. Moby Dick tries again, and again the ship intervenes. So Moby Dick kills the ship, then kills Ahab, then swims away. Not much else is said at that point. As if the whale has to get rid of a flea, and does. The description of the confrontation is great, and different from any I remember seeing. Moby Dick swims upside-down through Ahab's whaleboat, splitting it in two with his mouth. Moby Dick then swims in a circle, trapping Ahab in the center of a whirlpool. The dreaded, special harpoon Ahab had made is worthless, and does not hinder the whale. The idea of all the ropes and harpoons being dragged by the whale slows him down is good. I remember from the Huston film that the end showed Ahab wrapped in ropes trapped on the body of the whale. This is not in the book. Another man is trapped in pieces on the whale's body. Ahab is standing in his boat when a loop of hemp catches him around the neck and he is pulled out of the boat. That's it. This book and audio reading affected me greatly and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Several times during my life I picked up Moby Dick, anxious to see why it is held in such high regard. The first two or three times I was unable to finish the book. It didn't interest me enough at the time, due largely to my own ignorance it would seem. Some of you may have had a similar experience.Two years ago, as a middle aged adult, I read the entire book. My viewpoint was different; I had a greater appreciation of what I was reading. Now, I am almost through reading it again. I am not the most well read individual, but I have sampled a fair share of the classics. This book, in my opinion, is the greatest work ever written by an American. It will probably never be surpassed. It is one of only a handful of books that can stand toe to toe with anything written by Shakespeare.When I approached Moby Dick the first few times, I did so as I would any other novel. But Moby Dick isn't like any other novel; it's epic poetry - and much more. Melville uses a whaling voyage as the vehicle to explore almost every theme you can imagine. His insights and commentary on human nature are timeless, which is why he is a master. This is a book you can return to every other year. The more time you spend with Moby Dick the deeper truths it reveals.As an aside, I recommend the Modern Library version since it includes the wonderful illustrations by Rockwell Kent. Also, try reading a chapter or two a day. It may take 2-3 months to finish the entire book, but that is good. Think about what Melville is telling you."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Well, not really stupid but i just didn't have whatever it took to appreciate this novel. I tried to slog through it back then and I don't even recall if I actually made it; I certainly didn't remember any of it. But I just read it again for what felt like the first time and wow...This book has more passages worth quoting on a variety of subjects than anything I have ever read. It's a wonderful story about whaling and about human nature. It brings alive an extremely important part of American history and the spirit that made this country what it is. I used to be amused that it was considered a \\"great American Novel.\\" I thought a great novel was something like \\"Coma\\" or \\"Timeline.\\" : ButI suspect that for other than the really intelligent and perceptive (of which I certainly was not as a youngster) the scope and feeling of this book may not be apparent until one has quite a few years under his/her belt.An absolutely glorious work."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"What more can be said about this novel that defies any attempt to categorize or name the narrative? Melville's excruciating and almost treatise-like fixation with detail must be torture for the millions of high school students who are forced to read it, but for those who persist the beauty of the language and symbolism must surely create many lifelong fans of great literature. The reader discovers many many symbolic twists from the mystery of Queequeg's tattoos, which are discovered late in the novel that even he cannot decipher to the hieroglyph like wrinkles on the white whale's forehead. Ishmael is a bit player looking into the inscrutable maw of destiny, into the face of god. He is reborn from the whirlpool into which his shipmates disappeared, brought to the surface by a great bubble to survive by a coffin (qua lifebuoy) and this too is fate.All the men aboard the Pequod, save Starbuck, seem to accept Ahab's madness and their watery fate and thus madness becomes king and death the only out. Starbuck has the opportunity to murder Ahab and save the crew but like Hamlet cannot bring himself to do it. Is this religious-based morality then not the greater madness? Sustained by Melville's amazing prose (and a few devices clearly ripped off from Shakespeare), one travels with the Pequod herself and ponders such issues for 600 pages in which the world is turned upside down and evil seems destined to triumph. But then what is evil? There is no firm footing and we're left having to balance like Queequeg on the spinning carcass of a whale. Amazing work."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Among my friends and most of the people with whom I've spoken, this book has one of the worst reputations of any of the many classic novels. This book is well-known by virtually everyone; however, almost no one reads it, and many who have wish that they hadn't. This is the case for a number of reasons: the book is often marketed as an adventure novel, and it is often forced upon young readers who are much too young to understand the novel, much less remotely appreciate it. Despite the fact that it is seen as an adventure novel, it serves almost as an inverted adventure. The novel primarily consists of philosophical musings, with the whale serving as more of an abstraction than the subject of an adventure quest. The discrepancy between the expectations and the actual book leaves many readers to be unprepared for the experience of reading the book. The book is often taught to high school students and children in some cases. However, in most cases, it should only be read at college age or above.This all likely makes the book sound intimidating and unfun; however, there is much to be enjoyed about the book. The humor of the book is often very underrated: Ishmel (if that is his actual name) is a particularly witty narrator who often finds himself in many absurd situations. For one thing, he is a terrible whaler, as he is more given to philosophical musing than the physical components of whaling. The novel often comes across as a parody of the propensities of the American romantic literature that was popular at the time. The most incredible feature of the novel is the extent to which it is ahead of its time. Moby Dick is certainly a precursor to modernist novels. The novel is particularly protean in form, just as Ulysses would be later. The style often shifts from that of a typical first-person narrative to that of a Shakespearian play to that of an encyclopedia. Moby Dick was heavily derided at the time of its publication for this reason. This book is best compared with those of later writers like James Joyce and Joseph Conrad rather than the works of Melville's contemporaries. Moby Dick proves to be a very rewarding reading experience for those who stick with the novel at an age at which it can be appreciated."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Finally. I finished reading this book last night. It's not so daunting a task if one reads only several chapters a day, for no more than an hour at a time. The voice the author chooses to use throughout is quite different from anything else I've encountered. It's not Shakespearean; it's Melvillian. The story is majestic, sonorous, tragic, and well worth your time to read. You will not be disappointed. But do read it from a BOOK, not some electronic gadget or audio recording. The edition I read was the volume in the \\"Great Books of the Western World\\", published by Britannica."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"This is one of those books I have always known about, the more I read, the more the novel was referenced. It was one of those books on the list of *things to read before I die* but it wasn't until it was on the bargain-shelf of the local bookstore.The cashier asked me if I was a masochist as I checked out. This determined me if anything else.Melville does a fantastic job of creating a terrifying, awe inspiring, and sometimes oppressive atmosphere. I was afraid the book would come across as dated, instead it transports you into an immortal journey.The book is incredible, Melville makes even the mundane day-to-day dealings of the whaling ship poetry and foreshadowing as you follow Ahab's Madness along with the crew of the Pequod to the corners of the Earth, before finally being dragged to a watery grave.It is a long, metaphorical epic. Poetic and beautiful. It is going to take you some time to get through it, but it is worth it. I found myself underlining passages in the book - which is something I rarely do, but some of the prose almost demands it."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"After completing Moby-Dick for the first time I was surprised about its contents. For the most part it is an academic cetology text. The body of the novel prepared the reader for the final fight with the white whale, the white whale who did not appear until chapter 133, page 625 out of 701 pages; 87% of the book completed.The quest is the reader's as much as Ahab's, getting through the primer for the eventual confrontation. The major portion of the book only hinted at Ahab's presence beneath the deck, and Moby-Dicks' presence somewhere beneath the seven seas. By the time Ahab became present in the novel- having the blacksmith forge his special harpoon, affixing a sturdy ivory limb on his stump, and finally receiving notice that his prey was nigh-, the reader had digested the nature of the fighting boats, the characteristics of the sperm whale, and the dangers of the fight. Both were ready for the story to begin.Thus Moby-Dick was as much about the reader as the literature. The quest to master the lexicon of whaling boats, the quest to match Ahab's obsession with his own desire for completion, a persistence through the incidental sidebars in order to conquer a masterpiece of literature.After all is said and done Moby-Dick is about whaling, plain and simple.Ishmael, himself, warns not to allegorize the tale. It is what it is. Leave the Biblical references for those who wish to see the moral judgments of the Lord. Leave the Nineteenth Century language, and the changes in narrator and form to the students of literature. Leave the fires in the on-board oil ovens for those who need a hell in which to place Ahab' mania, and leave the (partially) white whale to those who need purity, virtue, or innocence.But let we readers enjoy the story of an intense whale-hunt written in unending captivating prose, poetic images, and a grandiose style that allows one to grasp what one needs to grasp within Moby-Dicks' detail and scope."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"This is a book unlike any other i've ever encountered. To say its a classic is an understatement. It's a shame that it's forced on high-school kids and that they think it isn't any good. In reality, it's a brilliant piece of artwork. All of the characters, the settings, the conflict, it's all real and alive. The story is about a whaling boat named the Pequod that is set on a course of vengeance by a man named Captain Ahab. He desires to kill the white whale that bit off his leg a while earlier. It's this mad quest for revenge that serves as the story, but that isn't the only thing happening, not by a longshot. Melville uses his vast knowledge of whaling to explore all sorts of philosophy, morality, and pure poetry. His writing style is utterly beautiful. Some people complain about the middle portion being nothing but a textbook on whaling. It seems that way, but at the same time, Melville is showing the reader what must be done in order to capture a whale. And within that frame, he also explores themes such as man vs nature, man vs god, and many more. How this book came to him is beyond me. If you are willing, you must experience this novel because my words can't justly explain it. But if you are put off by the length or the middle or for any other reason, you will likely be disappointed. With respect to Huckleberry Finn, THE American novel is here and nowhere else."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Wow! Every aspiring writer should give this a read...or then again maybe they shouldn't since it may be too depressing to read something this good. Like Joseph Conrad's works, Lord Jim and Heart of Darkness, Moby-Dick is somewhat autobiographical, at least in the sense that Melville took to the high seas in a whaling boat in the middle of his life, prior to writing this. As a high schooler I found this book terribly boring, but now I mainly see it as amazingly well written. Kids probably shouldn't be forced to read classic literature because they generally don't appreciate it. In a sense, the whole novel is one long buildup to the final devastating scene, and perhaps there's some Freudian or other indirect psychological meaning to that layout of the story, but you'll have to find an expert for the correct interpretation. Apparently, Melville wasn't particularly commerically successful in his lifetime, partly because he was unconventional in style and wouldn't crank out mindless rubbish. Billy Budd is also certainly worth reading again. In summary, Moby-Dick should be required reading for every adult! Author ofAdjust Your Brain: A Practical Theory for Maximizing Mental Health."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Moby Dick has had a reputation for being an American classic, and this notion has long received both ire and support from everyone from literary enthusiasts to the casual reader. While the novel is a \\"monster\\" to get through in certain regards, and while it has its imperfections, there are many instances and elements that make this a great work of literature. If for nothing but just the sheer depth of Melville's work, it should be highly merited. While not flawless by any means, Melville still captures the essence of revenge in one man, creating a microcosm of a world onboard the Pequod, and examines the conflict of man versus nature on a small and grand scale. There is also an air of ambiguity within many parts of the narration that seem to correlate with the book's mysterious tone, as Ishmael at times disappears and gives way to an unknown narrator.There are many subtleties scattered throughout, as well as paradoxes and parallels, which give credence to the book's depth. Consider the story of Jonah and the whale in the early part of the story--during Father Mapple's sermon--in which Jonah learns to repent from his mistake. He seemingly is the antithesis of an Ahab, who illustrates that while he does think on a complex level, is immovable. Ahab seems to be equated with the tragic hero who has lost his sense of reason, and is only narrow-minded in that his ultimate goal is the only means to an end.If there is a larger contrast from Ahab to another character in the book, it is in the form of one of the ship mates, Starbuck, who is the only voice to oppose Ahab's journey. When Starbuck suggests that killing a \\"simple brute\\" of a whale out of sheer malice and retribution would be foolish and against the laws of nature and God, Ahab retorts, \\"I will wreak that hate upon him. Do not talk to me of blasphemy, man; I'd strike the sun if it insulted me.\\" Although Starbuck confronts Ahab, and serves to be his character foil for the entire duration of the novel, he continues to fill his required duty for Ahab, and thus keeps the fated exodus in motion. At one point, the fate of the Pequod is set in stone during a ritualistic ceremony in which Ahab gets a \\"nervous\\" crew to drink from a flagon and cross lances as a means of affirming their goal.While many onboard may not have agreed with the plans of Ahab, there is almost a sense that all was \\"meant to be\\", that fate was unalterable when it came to boarding the Pequod: \\"Such a crew, so officered, seemed specially picked and packed by some infernal fatality to help him to his monomaniac revenge.\\" Perhaps the inevitability of fate is what garners the crew onboard to something bigger than they can comprehend or even agree with.Still, to say that the book exclusively is about Ahab's revenge would be to undermine the larger points that Melville seems to make about changing destiny's course and learning from others' mistakes or tragedies. Many times Ahab sees right in front of him that chance to turn back, to cease his journey. One sign comes in the form of the lost ship the Rachel, whose captain is looking for his lost son. The Rachel's captain implores Ahab to aid in the search, to help out another fellow human, but Ahab ultimately rejects humanity and seals his fate. Starbuck in the later parts of the book once again begs him to cease his maddening quest, but, alas, Ahab's vindictiveness on the whale outweighs all reason, and the chain of humanity is officially broken.Moby Dick earns its reputation as a classic because of the level in which it presents this moral about changing one's fate. It takes a very subtle form, however, and much of the book's second layers of meaning are subjective and ambiguous so we can arrive at the point ourselves. There is nothing \\"quick\\" about this novel, and perhaps for this reason, many people refuse to work at it. For what it's worth, it does have its flaws, but as one reviewer said, maybe it is a stronger book because of its apparent flaws. Make no mistake: this book takes much patience and work (the infamous \\"whaling\\" chapters come to mind). But, if you read it, I think you will have a greater appreciation for the classics."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"One thing really bugs me about the Modern Library... edition, and that is the way the annotations are set up. The very helpful endnotes follow the text of the novel, but the text contains no indicators whatsoever.

This probably is not the best edition of _Moby-Dick_ to choose."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Moby-Dick is, without question, the greatest novel written in the English language. Middlemarch doesn't come close; none of the mature Henry James novels come close; heck, not even Ulysses comes close (frankly, I'd like to see some scholar examine the influence of Moby-Dick on Ulysses--there has to be some). This book shouldn't be merely read, it must be consumed Eziekiel-style. I have never read any book that has had such a powerful influence on me. Whenever, I travel, I now carry a copy of Shakespeare, Milton, and Moby-Dick. If I were banished to an island and could take only one book with me, Moby-Dick would be my choice. No matter how many times I read it (and it has been several), I always find something new. It is endlessly fascinating."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Patience is a virtue; and if patience is needed to truly appreciate Melville's Moby-Dick, then virtuous am I. I admit, there were many places in this novel where I &quot;just wanted to get through it&quot;. However, when the reader takes a step back to truly examine this work, it soon becomes an obvious masterpiece. For myself, the most interesting aspect of Melville's writing is his tendency to use Biblical characters: Ishmael, Ahab, and even the ship &quot;Rachel&quot; searching for her children. There are literally hundreds of links to their Biblical counterparts. This was most fascinating for me to discover. I challenge readers to see this novel as more than just a story, but rather, a work which calls for in-depth examination."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"I was excited to order Moby Dick for a long camping trip west.My daughter had an assignment to read it over the summer, but shecan't read in the car without turning green. This seemed perfect.Unfortunately, it wasn't made clear that this was an abridged version.Therefore, we couldn't use it and had to order another from the library.I'm sure that it is excellent for what it is.I really felt, however, that we should have been told more directly that thiswas a greatly shortened version.Thank you,Cecilia Johnson"},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"To say that Moby Dick is long, rambling, and weird, would be to understate the case. Many - perhaps most - of its 135 chapters are entirely extraneous to the plot. There are long unnecessary discourses on obscure whaling practices. Minor characters are introduced at length...and then promptly forgotten. Even the main character - the narrator - fades into obscurity as the book shifts from a first-person narrative to a more omniscient perspective. Apparently, more than one contemporary reviewer of Melville thought that the author had literally gone insane while writing the book...and perhaps he did.But it's all really wonderful! Here's what I like about it: Often-brilliant prose with beautiful words, amazing extended metaphors, and vivid imagery. That's it in a nutshell. Even chapters that have nothing to do with the plot are fun to read when they're written well.We live in a modern society that is often depressingly impatient. I think it's too bad that modern readers want their books to get started, move quickly, get to the point, and be done with it already! It's weird, isn't it? We read books because we (hopefully) want to read them; they provide an interesting diversion. Why, then, are we impatient for them to be over? Why not enjoy each chapter of Moby Dick for its own sake? Weird, rambling, but brilliant, they are enjoyable, if you suspend the need for instant gratification. I think it helps that I have a two hour commute in the car every day, and listened to this as an audiobook.Oh, one other interesting side-note: The book has remarkable thoughts / insights / scientific questions about whales. One fascinating thing to think about is the visual system of whales. Whales have two eyes on either side of their enormous, massive heads. There's no way they can see directly in front of themselves... which means that means they almost definitely perceive two entirely-distinct visual fields. How are those disparate visual signals combined in the brain? How does a whale process spatial information? What a remarkable question Herman Melville posed in the 1850s!"},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Yes, friends, that's how it always went when my cousins and I played Moby Dick on the old farm. There were enough of us to make up a decent cast only on holidays, and there were always a couple of girl cousins who thought they should get to play with us, but since I was the oldest, we did it my way. Being the biggest also, it would have been natural for me to play the White Whale, but I was sensitive about my height and always stuck my humorless cousin Lennart with that voiceless role. And since I was the game narrator, it really WAS my job to be Ishmael, but my closest-in-age cousin Paul was jealous and likely to run to Mormor to complain that I was being bossy. So we rotated the role of Ishmael, on the condition that if anyone lost his place in the unfolding of the adventure, he'd be instantly demoted to playing Stubb or Flask, and I'd assume my destiny as the observed observer, the author of events.Ishmael is the main character in the novel, you know, the one who sets the pace and calls the tune. It's Ishmael who goes questing; Ahab's quest is just a bright projection of Ishmael's, a particularly fantastic shadow puppet on the wall of Ishmael's cave. It's mostly Ishmael to tells us what Ahab is all about, though betimes Melville lets Ahab rage in his own plenipotent Shakespearean dialect. It's Ishmael who leads us, in the reverse of Dante, to paradisal seas and proper Christian faith first, then to the purgatory of the butchery, and then the depths of hellish annihilation. If I ever had to teach a high school English class - an honor I don't aspire to - I'd tell the little blighters straight off that in any novel with a first-person narrator, that's the chap to watch. Finally, it's Ishmael who LEARNS. In his first encounter with Queequeg, he learns human relativity. Through all the pages and chapters detailing the nature of the whale and of whaling, he learns and learns, and shares his learning in his ever-bemused, ironic style. Of course, he learns eventually that HE is the sole survivor of his own quest. And don't be fooled for a moment that he hasn't learned the metaphysical truth that he set out to learn in the symbolic guise of the White Whale...Moby Dick is a book about the dread Melville felt at his increasing religious uncertainty, his fear of the infinite, and particularly of an infinite that might well be empty, that might be as void as the color white. He says as much in the key chapter 42, 'The Whiteness of the Whale': \\"...a dumb blankness, full of meaning, in a wide landscape of snows -- a colorless, all-color of atheism from which we shrink...\\"But Moby Dick is also a rollickingly funny book, ripping anything it touches with its sarcasm and satire. If one chapter seems wordy, dear reader, keep your eyes open and you'll be rewarded by a side-splitter in a few pages. Melville perhaps still wrote under the illusion that he could sell profundity to the parlor readership of Victorian America; a good thing for us, since he gave us full measure of adventure, of humor, and of personal anguish all in one unforgettable book. What each reader notices as she/he reads Moby Dick will be as different as what each hiker sees while descending into the Grand Canyon. I've read it three times now, decades apart; this time, with my own metaphysical quests all logged, I found it more hilarious, more picturesque, more a grand display of virtuosic wordsmithing than I recalled. Anyone who finds Moby Dick boring isn't worth his/her hard tack biscuit."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Among the musty old Classics, this book is surprisingly entertaining. I found the sections on whaling to be fascinating. I don't understand why some consider it \\"grueling\\" or \\"hard work\\" to get through it. Don't approach it as a Classic; rather, enjoy an amazing story written by a terrific storyteller. Afterwards, ponder the profundity of what you have read.The Norton Critical Edition has the most useful footnotes for casual readers."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Moby-Dick is a sprawling, unwieldy yet very great novel about the obsessive pursuit of happiness and fulfillment. \\"Call me Ishmael...\\" the famous opening lines establishes the omniscient narrator for this whale of an epic. The novel is filled with remarkable characters; their composite comradery is a true achievement of writing. Melville's insistence on explicating precise technical minutia on the craft of whaling and oceanography turned off most readers when the book was initially published (these sections still turn off most who dare penetrate this tome), yet it is really these sections that allow the reader to become immersed in the world of Ahab, the deranged symbol of evil amidst the beauty and sublime grace of the sea. Melville was an undisputed master of literary style, and this masterpiece is difficult to place for the simple reason that its' incomprehensible scale defies categorization. This is a reader's book; it is a divine allegory, a conventional adventure, and a bewitching construction all at once. Not for the weak minded."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"A critic of Melville likened him to a potter;but where as other writers shaped and formed their works into something aesthetically beautiful,Melville just tended to lump more and more clay on,turning out work that was so striking it lasts in the mind for an eternity.'Moby Dick' is the one story Shakespeare and the Bible missed out on;an extraordinary journey into the history of Whaling,and how obsession leads to distruction.It is indeed a book that lives with you forever and has shaped the modern novel.It also makes you feel contempt for such literary luminaries as William Golding,who attempted to capture Melvilles themes in 'The Spire' and came nowhere near!Even those I know who struggled to read this always list 'Moby Dick'in their top 5 book list. It really is a masterpiece in every sense of the word."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"I just wanted to put in my two cents here. If you are perusing these reviews under Moby Dick in an effort to see whether or not it is worth reading (which is why I personally scan these reviews) let me just say emphatically that it is. But... I would suggest that you not pick this book up lightly. It is a very stubborn work that in many ways is a precursor to the 20th century's flirtation with high literature. In many ways this book can be compared to the more stubborn works of Pynchon and Joyce in that you can read it over and over again and find an entirely new perspective in which to appreciate it every time.I picked Moby Dick up several times only to be frustrated with its seemingly antiquated cadence and structure. Luckily for myself I found a reading group a few years back that was delving into some classics and Moby Dick happened to be one of these works. It made all of the difference in the world to have a knowledgeable leader of a reading group opening up discussions after every few chapters to discuss what we had read. After undergoing this experience and finishing the book I was and still am in awe of the majesty Melville attained in these pages.Please, even if you are sure of yourself as a reader and scoff at my suggestion to use a reading group or class structure to enjoy this work, find a copy that will have a comprehensive \`readers guide' in order to cast light on some of the complex and arcane references. This will be helpful if only to note how uniquely Melville manipulates the focus of his story and the characters contained with in.Enjoy this book, and don't open its pages on a whim unless you have plenty of free time, patience, and a curiosity to uncover ideas or meanings that might not be so apparent at a first reading."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Finishing &quot;Moby Dick&quot; goes up there with my greatest (and few) academic achievements. It was a gruelling read, but---in the end---completely worthwhile.I've been reading it for 6 months. I started over the summer, during an abroad program in Oxford, and I remember sitting outside reading when one of the professors came over, saw what I was reading, and said: &quot;It's a very strange book, isn't it?&quot;Looking back, that might be the best way to describe it. The blurb from D.H. Lawrence on the back cover agrees: Moby Dick &quot;commands a stillness in the soul, an awe...[it is] one of the strangest and most wonderful books in the world.&quot;Now there are those who will say that the book's middle is unbearable---with its maddeningly detailed accounts of whaling. Part of me agrees. That was the hardest to get through. But, still, even the most dull subject offers Melville an opportunity to show off his writing chops. He's a fantastic writer---his text most resembles that of Shakespeare.And, like one Shakespeare's characters, Melville sees all the world as a stage. Consider this beautiful passage from the first chapter:&quot;Though I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers, the Fates, put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage, when others were set down for magnifient parts in high tragedies, and short and easy parts in genteel comedies, and jolly parts in farces--though I cannot tell why this was exactly; yet, now that I recall all the circumstances, I think I can see a little into the springs and motives which being cunningly presented to me under various disguises, induced me to set about performing the part I did, besides cajoling me into the delusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill and discriminating judgment.&quot;The end of &quot;Moby Dick&quot; informs the rest of the book, and in doing so makes rereading it inevitable. It is telling that Moby Dick doesn't appear until page 494. It is telling, because, the majority of the book is spent in anticipation---in fact, the whole book is anticipation. It's not unlike sex, actually---delaying gratification to a point of almost sublime anguish. What comes at the book's end, then, is mental, physical, and spiritual release (as well as fufillment).The book leaves you with questions both large and small. I was actually most troubled with this question---What happened to Ishmael? No, we learn his fate at the book's end, but where was he throughout it? We all know how it starts---&quot;Call me Ishmael&quot;---and the book's first few chapters show him interacting with Queequeg and an innkeeper. But then we lose him onboard the Pequod---we never see him interact with anyone. No one ever addresses him. He seems to witness extremely private events---conferences in the Captain's quarters, conversations aboard multiple boats, and--what can only be his conjecture--the other characters' internal dialogue. Is he a phantom? What is he that he isn't? Somehow I think this question masks a much larger and more important one.Try &quot;Moby Dick.&quot; Actually, don't try it---read it. Work at it. Like lifting weights a bit heavier than you're used to, &quot;Moby Dick&quot; will strengthen your brain muscle. Don't believe those who hate it, they didn't read it. They didn't work at it. Be like Ishmael, who says: &quot;I try all things; I achieve what I can.&quot; Or, more daringly, be like Ahab, whose ambition is his curse, but whose curse propels and writes the book itself."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Last year I decided to expand my intellectual horizons by reading a series of American literary classics. Moby Dick was the first book on my list. It took me three months to finish this legendary story and, looking back on it now, I must say that it was worth every minute. To others who are considering this effort I say this: buttress your stamina and open your mind. This is not John Grisham or Tom Clancy. You will be reading high literature and you will be required to think. If you do so, Ishmael, Ahab and crew will open a window to some of mankind's most profound questions: Is it better to fight evil or promote virtue? Where is the line between honorable justice and blind vengeance? Do bad things happen because the universe is evil or just indifferent? The true pleasure to be derived from reading this book can be found by closing its pages every so often and reflecting on the questions that it will raise in your mind. A completely different experience than breezing through the latest best-seller, but much more rewarding.Be aware that Moby Dick is many types of books in one. It is part adventure story, part sermon, part history of whaling, part encyclopedia of whale anatomy, part metaphysical allegory. Expect it to change periodically as you move through it, be receptive to each part, and don't try to compartmentalize it as any one particular type of work."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Unless you are a naval historian or a Melville scholar, you probably won't have a rewarding (or even comprehensible) time with Moby-Dick at this remove unless the edition you're using comes with a good set of footnotes. Here's the skinny on the various editions currently on shelves:THESE HAVE FOOTNOTES ON THE PAGE ITSELF:* Charles Feidelson, Jr.'s annotated edition. Unquestionably the most all-around useful edition of Moby-Dick ever printed. Generous and highly useful footnotes right on the page, covering lexical, allusional, and cross-referential items. Two disadvantages: you may at times feel put upon by Feidelson's interlarded interpretations, and the thing is totally out of print. Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1964. ISBN: 067260311X* The \\"Norton critical\\" edition, edited by Parker and Hayford. The edition most widely employed by scholars. Stingier with the footnotes than Feidelson, but still a good second choice. Many useful essays at the end. The layout of the text is a bit hard on the eye, though. Make sure you get the SECOND edition, from 2001. ISBN: 0393972836* The \\"Barnes and Noble Classics\\" edition. The footnotes for the most part are skimpy and confined to obscure vocabulary, not cultural and literary allusions.

This claims to be the \\"definitive text,\\" but any such claim is spurious -- cf. Hayford and Parker [v.s.] for a good discussion of why.

(This is the one included in the same volume with \\"Redburn\\" and \\"White Jacket.\\") About 9 pp. of notes at the end. Unfortunately, they're a bit skimpy. You see, they're of the \\"go get it yourself\\" kind. For example, when Melville writes, \\"send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger,\\" the footnotes -- the incidence of which is not marked in the running text -- merely says \\"Luke 16:24\\". In other words, you've got to look it up yourself. So I would characterize the footnotes as sparse and taciturn: they'll clue you in to the source, but as for the exact wording of something and its accumulated historical connotations, you've got to come up with those yourself.

Melville didn't write a typical novel in Moby Dick, even by his own standards. And reactions to the work are passionate and passionately divided, even to this day. Setting sail in this Melvillian squall is a difficult prospect, but despite my hesitations, I'm going to give it a go and say that, despite it's many technical flaws, Melville's book is the touchstone for American literature, much as Ives' music is the touchstone for American composition. Melville managed to find a voice that was distinctively \\"New World\\" and yet also universal enough to speak to the existential questions that have plagued humans since we first turned our heads to the sky to ask \\"Why\\".Some things are truly subjective....such as book reactions. The issue with Melville in general is that he is a flawed genius. Moby Dick is not a perfect book in the sense than a Henry James novel might be perfect. It's not even as tight as Dostoevsky...and he's no model of literary tightness. I think when people have trouble with Moby Dick it's because that for them, the flaws outweigh the virtues....The book is a stylistic hodgepodge, and this is probably exactly what makes it difficult for many readers. It starts out as a plain sailing yarn, much like Melville's earlier Typee or Redburn...or Richard Dana's Three Years Behind the Mast. But then it changes into a philosophical drama with many, many \\"informative\\" chapters that can at times read like a whaling primer rather than a novel. And the drama part is one part sea adventure and two parts Shakespeare....add to that a constantly changing philosophical view (God, as personified by Moby Dick and by other things, can be seen in the book as wholly good, Good but permitting evil, evil itself, good but locked in a battle with an equally powerful evil force, or finally completely indifferent to humans.)I think for people who have trouble with the book, if Melville had taken just one of these tacts the book would be much easier to read and less littered with flaws. However....for me at least....I recognize those flaws and find the power in the book despite them...and perhaps even because of them. In a sense to me, Melville was using the Pequod as a symbol for all of the human world, and his radical stylistic inclusiveness IS actually exactly to the point of the book. Everything in humanity is included in the book, as all of human endeavor is essentially an existential quest for meaning in the face of an unknowable God (at least unknowable in any normal human sense)...and we bring everything, warts and all.The character of Ahab can also be a stumbling block for readers. He is clearly monomaniacal, and for many, that singleminded desire for revenge obscures his greater humanity. The key to understanding Ahab though is to realize that he does indeed go through a change in the book. He begins as a man obsessed with revenge to the exclusion of human values....but he is also still capable of commanding love and respect from his crew. Even Starbuck, who most actively opposes Ahab, to some extent still loves the man and when given the opportunity to kill him and save the crew, Starbuck can't bring himself to do so. The tenderness in Ahab is shown in his relations to Pip, the addled cabin boy, but also peaks through briefly in the encounter with the Rachel, where Ahab almost gives into the pleas of the bereaved Captain who has lost his son to Moby Dick, and more fully in the marvelous \\"Symphony\\" chapter, where Ahab and Starbuck find a rare moment of communion in the beauty of nature and in their shared love of home and family. But despite all, Ahab can't let go of his quest to grapple with the bigger issue of good and evil that the whale has come to represent to him. It has become a compulsion with him and a fatal one.One suggestion for reading this book is to read the Shakespearean chapters aloud. Much of the nuance in the characters of Starbuck, Ahab and Stubb is lost unless you bring the language to life. Melville's language is grand and was meant to be heard out loud. Another strategy is to view the John Huston film. Though the movie is deeply flawed, hearing Gregory Peck declaim Melville's lines helps to bring the character to more vivid life.A final note on editions of this work. I have several and most of them are pretty equal in terms of the quality of the text. The Modern Library has the added benefit of Rockwell Kent's masterful woodcut illustrations. But to actually read the text I find the Bantam Mass Market edition is my favorite. The introductory note is excellent, and the book is stuffed with afterword material, including Melville's letters to Hawthorne while writing the book, contemporary press reviews of the work, and several excellent modern essays which help with understanding the greater issues behind this deeply moving and important work of American fiction."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"I'm an old man. And the sea is something I know nothing about. So call me ignorant. Still, nearly 60, I just read this book for the first time and it is unquestionably the best novel I have ever read, equal to any poem or drama. I believe you have to have lived a little and maybe even tried your hand at expressing yourself artistically to really appreciate this book. I don't think it's for young people - definitely not for most teenagers, and probably not for most college-level students, unless you want to discourage them. It almost makes arthritis worth while.The latest volume of \\"Best American Poems\\" has a work by Thomas Lux, originally published in Five Points, called \\"Eyes Scooped Out and Replaced by Hot Coals\\". That is his proposed punishment for anyone who hasn't read Moby Dick by their mid-20's. While it's a clever and humerous way to make a point, this Pol Pot approach to literary education is viewed positively by many teachers and helps explain why so many people end up with a negative attitude towards a book of this stature.Just consider the sea-nario: You are weary of the everyday world, and decide to sign-on with a whaling ship to get a little therapy. The ship's captain is a madman. That right there is enough. And consider the historical significance. Moby Dick was written right around the same time that science really began to explode, and we were entering the modern period of capitalism and capitalists (our new Ahabs). For the first time in human history, there were thousands of regular working people - some of them artists - who had literally traveled the entire globe on whalers and knew many parts of it well. These same conditions, of course, soon led to the demise - or rather the replacement - of whale oil for its traditional uses. So there was really only a brief moment in time when such a book could have been written. And it was, thank god. It is no coincidence that Moby Dick, published in 1851, was probably being written by Melville at the same time Marx and Engels were writing the Communist Manifesto. Both represent a similar landmark in human history.What more can I say? I literally enjoyed every single page. I had readied myself to be bored by the cetology chapters, but wasn't in the least. And some critics note the variations in perspective and writing styles, but that didn't bother me at all - I scarcely noticed. For me, one of the personal highlights was when Melville describes the setting for the skeleton of a great sperm whale found on an island in Chapter 102, A BOWER IN THE ARSACIDES:\\"Through the lacings of the leaves, the great sun seemed a flying shuttle weaving the unwearied verdure. Oh, busy weaver! unseen weaver! --pause! --one word! -- whither flows the fabric? what palace may it deck? wherefore all these ceaseless toilings? Speak, weaver! --stay thy hand! -- but one single word with thee! Nay --the shuttle flies --the figures float from forth the loom; the freshet-rushing carpet for ever slides away. The weaver-god, he weaves; and by that weaving is he deafened, that he hears no mortal voice; and by that humming, we, too, who look on the loom are deafened; and only when we escape it shall we hear the thousand voices that speak through it\\"By the way, this review is based on an old, worn copy of the book that I purchased at a sale. It's not based on any particular edition or publisher, and my review is focused exclusively on Melville's writing, not how the material is presented in print.Please give it a chance."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"I own the Penguin published version of this book as well as the Kindle \\"Penguin\\" version. While MOST of Melville's \\"Leviathanic\\" work is here, there are some serious omissions and problems with the Kindle version of this publication. Here they are, in the order they occur to me as I write this:1. There is no cover art2. There are none of the very useful diagrams and drawings present at the back of the actual Penguin publication3. There is no table of contents (This is VERY annoying in a book that begs frequent reference to various chapters, especially one already divided into 100+ chapters)4. None of the textual emendations are enumerated5. There are MANY textual mistakes, including wrong words, repeated words and other typos6.

Overall the Digireads \\"Penguin\\" version feels as though it was carelessly rushed into being."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Moby Dick is strictly for adults, which is not to say it's salacious or titillating (which, after all, is really just an appeal to that which is most adolescent in us). No, Moby Dick is a book for people who have experienced something of life, felt the painful disappointment of easy answers, smelled the fear of their own mortality and searched frantically for a solution to the puzzle of being alive. The fact that this book is often assigned to adolescents to read is a crime. It's like assigning Einstein's theory of relativity to a class of basketweavers. A little more respect, please. A person ought to be fairly well convinced they're going to die some day before reading Moby Dick - which is not to say he or she ought to be glum or fatalistic. Moby Dick is neither. It's surprisingly witty and ironic, sometimes even charming, but underneath runs a somber current that carries along with it formidable questions about what it means to be human, how we all suffer, even when we do the right things, and how a providential God can be easily confused with uncaring fate.Melville is a master of ambiguity and nuance. His characters, who seem caricatures at first, gradually reveal a depth of complexity that has had scholars hard at work for years. From Queequeeg, the agreeable savage, to Starbuck (yes, folks, the coffee shop is named after someone), whose stalwart Protestantism is put to the test, and on to Ahab, the mad, raving, conflicted Captain, and Ishmael, the clever, pliable narrator, each character reveals a depth of personality that makes you feel you know them and wins your empathy, even as their ship, the Pequod, plunges on in pursuit its unlikely objective, the destruction of a singularly vindictive whale, Moby Dick.Is Moby Dick some mad brute, an animal driven to distraction by the harassment of its predators? Or is it, as Ahab believes, an agent of the living God, bent on punishing the sinful pride of man, or worse - a mere mask behind which hides indifferent nature, spawned by the earth to reek mayhem and destruction to no apparent end? Ahab aims to find out and hijacks the loyalties of his crew in pursuit of his answer, distracting them from the official reason for their voyage, the acquisition of whale oil, an important commodity in the 1840's, setting them on a course that is sacrilege on more than one level.Melville spends a lot of time examining the ins-and-outs of the whaling business, from the outfitting of a ship, to the process of capturing whales, to the intricacies of extracting whale oil and trying it, and much more; which can be rather off-putting to the causal reader. But be forewarned: Moby Dick is not for the casual reader. This is no Huckleberry Finn or Catcher in the Rye which will reward you with an amusing story even if you're not willing to dig deeper. If you intend to skim over Moby Dick, forget it. You will find it dull and unrewarding. But if you are willing to surrender some uninterrupted hours to the reading and some time, during the process for reflection, you will have one of the richest literary experiences of your life.You will come away with a foundation of knowledge about something you probably never considered, much less cared about, how a whaling voyage in the 1840's played out, a fascinating glimpse into the trials and tribulations facing brave men bent on bringing home a vital energy source that lit homes and businesses in the years before crude oil was discovered and processed. And during the process you will be treated to Melville's philosophical musings, provoked by the processes themselves and relevant to the unfolding events, serving to underpin the thematic union of the book. And on top of it all you will get a rousing good sea story with some jaw dropping descriptive passages and a richly embroidered narrative, a ship world, peopled by an interesting cast of characters, and some food for thought that ought to stick in your teeth for some time.Yet Moby Dick is not for the half-hearted, be they adolescents who are trying to skate by with the least effort, or simply those who look to literature as a distraction from life rather a mirror of it. But for those who are willing to set sail in more challenging waters, Melville's classic will not disappoint. It will take you into a coursing jet stream, exhilerating to navigate, both spiritually and intellectually."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"I first read Moby Dick; or The Whale over thirty years ago and I didn't understand it. I thought I was reading a sea adventure, like Westward Ho! or Poe's Arthur Gordon Pym. In fact, it did start out like an adventure story but after twenty chapters or so, things began to get strange. I knew I was in deep water. It was rough, it seemed disjointed, there were lengthy passages that seemed like interruptions to the story, the language was odd and difficult, and often it was just downright bizarre. I plodded through it, some of it I liked, but I believe I was glad when it ended. I knew I was missing something and I understood that it was in me! It wasn't the book; it was manifestly a great book, but I hadn't the knowledge of literature or experience to understand it.I read it again a few years later. I don't remember what I thought of it. The third time I read it, it was hilarious; parts of it made me laugh out loud! I was amazed at all the puns Melville used, and the crazy characters, and quirky dialog. The fourth or fifth reading, it was finally that adventure story I wanted in the first place. I've read Moby Dick more times than I've counted, more often than any other book. At some point I began to get the symbolism. Somewhere along the line I could see the structure. It's been funny, awesome, exciting, weird, religious, overwhelming and inspiring. It's made my hair stand on end...Now, when I get near the end I slow down. I go back and reread the chapters about killing the whale, and cutting him up, and boiling him down. Or about the right whale's head versus the sperm whale's. I want to get to The Chase but I want to put it off. I draw Queequeg with his tattoos in the oval of a dollar bill. I take a flask with Starbuck and a Decanter with Flask. Listen to The Symphony and smell The Try-Works. Stubb's Supper on The Cabin Table is a noble dish, but what is a Gam? Heads or Tails, it's a Leg and Arm. I get my Bible and read about Rachel and Jonah. Ahab would Delight in that; he's a wonderful old man. For a Doubloon he'd play King Lear! What if Shakespeare wrote The Tragedy of The Whale? Would Fedallah blind Ishmael with a harpoon, or would The Pequod weave flowers in The Virgin's hair?Now I know. To say you understand Moby Dick is a lie. It is not a plain thing, but one of the knottiest of all. No one understands it. The best you can hope to do is come to terms with it. Grapple with it. Read it and read it and study the literature around it. Melville didn't understand it. He set out to write another didactic adventure/travelogue with some satire thrown in. He needed another success like Typee or Omoo. He needed some money. He wrote for five or six months and had it nearly finished. And then things began to get strange. A fire deep inside fret his mind like some cosmic boil and came to a head bursting words on the page like splashes of burning metal. He worked with the point of red-hot harpoon and spent a year forging his curious adventure into a bloody ride to hell and back. \\"...what in the world is equal to it?\\"Moby Dick is a masterpiece of literature, the great American novel. Nothing else Melville wrote is even in the water with it, but Steinbeck can't touch it, and no giant's shoulders would let Faulkner wade near it. Melville, The pale Usher, warned the timid: \\"...don't you read it, ...it is by no means the sort of book for you. ...It is... of the horrible texture of a fabric that should be woven of ships' cables and hausers. A Polar wind blows through it, & birds of prey hover over it. Warn all gentle fastidious people from so much as peeping into the book...\\" But I say if you've never read it, read it now. If you've read it before, read it again. Think Dostoevsky, Shakespeare, Goethe, and The Bible. If you understand it, think again."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"My comments pertain to the Norton Critical Edition of Moby Dick, second edition (published 2001) ISBN 0393972836. If this review is appended to a web-page showing some budget paperback edition, please know that I am reviewing a specific edition of the novel, not just the novel itself. The ISBN above will take you to the only edition of Moby Dick you should need, the edition that (if you're going to read the book, and not just go through the pages in order) you'd do well to get ahold of.In fact, I'm not reviewing the novel at all, really. I believe Melville's book is America's greatest novel, and the closest thing to King Lear or Job that our nation has produced. Despite our ideals, our country has yet to embrace the full measure of Moby Dick's numinous democratic vision. At any rate, I want to remark that a reader really requires help to truly wrestle with all of this book's artistry and implications. I sure did, as did a class of 11th graders who tackled the book with me several years ago. The vast range of literary, historical, and artistic sources that Melville draws from, and the manner in which he works them deeply into the structure and meanings of his book, are staggering, and in the 2nd Norton Critical Edition, Moby Dick and its readers finally get the volume they always deserved.Before the publication of this edition in 2001, the best choice was Harold Beaver's over-annotated (and very agenda-driven) old Penguin edition. That's the one my class and I used years ago. The previous Norton edition (which I used to supplement Beaver) was solid in its reprinting of Melville's sources and of through-the-years scholars and critics, but it was carelessly and lightly annotated. This 2001 volume, however, is fully and richly footnoted, as most of our civilization's great works require (Paradise Lost, The Divine Comedy, Shakespeare, Homer), and all of the useful illustrations and glossaries from the older Norton edition have been retained. The text of the novel itself is the painstakingly reconstructed Northwestern-Newberry text, and the editors (Hayford and Parker) are justly renowned, even groundbreaking Melville scholars. Don't be daunted by all this: due to their hard work, this great edition allows greater pleasure and ease with Melville's tremendous book.The critical articles include almost every review from the book's initial publication, plus more recent explorations of Melville's composition of the book and also of many interpretive angles. There is also a nice selection of Melville's seafaring sources, another good article listing all the books which he drew on (including both familiar classics and obscure resources), Melville's letters from the period, numerous voices from the 19th century pre-Moby-Dick debate about Melville's stance on Christianity, and a recent discovery--a self-portrait by a South Pacific islander, a portrait that may have been Melville's source for Queequeg. That image graces this exemplary edition's cover.I rank this among the top titles of the Norton Critical Edition series, up there with their volumes on Heart of Darkness, Paradise Lost, The Jungle, Shelley, Great Expectations, Oroonoko, and the new Macbeth and Othello volumes. In short, this new edition allows us a nearly complete experience with Moby Dick, which is the best service a scholarly edition of this novel can provide, and it is the only way to really read the book. Spring for a few more bucks and get the right copy of Moby Dick."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"It's always dangerous to label a book as a &quot;masterpiece&quot;: that word seems to scare away most readers and distances everyone from the substance of the book itself. Still, I'm going to say that this is the Greatest American Novel because I really think that it is--after having read it myself.Honestly, Moby Dick IS long and looping, shooting off in random digressions as Ishmael waxes philosophical or explains a whale's anatomy or gives the ingredients for Nantucket clam chowder--and that's exactly what I love about it. This is not a neat novel: Melville refused to conform to anyone else's conventions. There is so much in Moby Dick that you can enjoy it on so many completely different levels: you can read it as a Biblical-Shakespearean-level epic tragedy, as a canonical part of 19th Century philosophy, as a gothic whaling adventure story, or almost anything else. Look at all the lowbrow humor. And I'm sorry, but Ishmael is simply one of the most likable and engaging narrators of all time.A lot of academics love Moby Dick because academics tend to have good taste in literature. But the book itself takes you about as far from academia as any book written--as Ishmael himself says, &quot;A whale-ship was my Yale College and my Harvard.&quot; Take that advice and forget what others say about it, and just experience Moby Dick for yourself."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"The story had a lot of interesting characters and the descriptions of them was vivid.

When I was tired of reading, I hit the play button and let Audible read it to them.The vivid decriptions of the sailors life at sea made my children thankful for a warm and cozy home. As the main characters of the book speculated upon their place in this world, so did my children. My boys dreamed of going to sea to finish the job that Captain Ahab could not and my little girl dreamed of helping the sailors who were hurt by the great white whale.At first they viewed Moby Dick as a ruthless whale attacking innocent sailors. Later, they saw that the ruthlessness belonged to Captain Ahab and his yearning to kill the great while whale at whatever the cost including his own life and the life of his men.This opened the door to our talks regarding \\"good stewardship\\" as we discussed the gifts God has given to us and how we might use them in a way pleasing to Him. In the end, they had a view of Captain Ahab that was more in line with the character portrayed in the novel... he was a vicious man whose base human instincts were malignant and evil.A very good read but much explaining for a parent to do with his/her children."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"love this book!

However, Herman Melville belabors the point and confuses the issue with many words and repetitions. The story line, if you can find it, is very interesting as is the education but it goes on and on. What should be a few paragraphs goes on for pages."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"The radio made its grand appearance in 1895; the television coming along after that in 1929. Before these more modern forms of entertainment, books were king, being mass produced and widely distributed as early as 1454. And Herman Melville's Moby Dick: or, The White Whale is the king of books written for the king of whales (Whales as in sperm whale, not whales as in well -- the country Wales: a part of the United Kingdom and the island of Great Britain.)\\"Oh, the rare old Whale, mid storm and galeIn his ocean home will beA giant in might, where might is right,And King of the boundless sea.\\" --WHALE SONG.Brief:Moby Dick is the tale of a man so consumed with vengeance, eaten up with hatred and driven by madness that he goes to whatever ends of the earth, exhausts all possible means, and sacrifices many on the alter of his passion in the pursuit of the infamous Moby Dick. Read aloud this book unlocks it's many secrets and subtle tones. To quote Jim Henson,\\" When people told themselves their past with stories, explained their present with stories, foretold the future with stories, the best place by the fire was kept for... The Storyteller.\\"(My husband enjoy hearing this book read voices and all by yours truly.) The tale is told by a man who bids us call him Ishmael, a newly ordained whaler off on his first voyage -- what a trip that turned out to be!Melville uses his nautical knowhow and grasp on whaling vernacular to paint some beautiful maritime images. In this book, Melville hopes to illuminate the many darkened corners of everyday life aboard a whaling ship, a feat not many have had the opportunity to experience. (I was surprised by some of the goings on. Who would blaze a forge aboard a wooden boat in the middle of the ocean? Doesn't seem wisdom to me.) His tale is a fish tale told by a witness, too big to be believed, but too thrilling not to pass along. Chock full of tantalizing foreshadowing, exquisite imagery, lofty questions that harken even to the foundations of the universe: it is no surprise that this is a classic and should remain so for some time to come.In Depth:Written in 1851, Moby Dick didn't come into notoriety until much later, the 1920's, in fact. However, I don't believe that a work of genius loses its luster simply by being looked over for a few dusty decades. Moby Dick was still the peculiarly good book then that it is now, even without the recognition.The reason for this neglect is summed up in a critic's review upon the novel's release:\\"This is an ill-compounded mixture of romance and matter-of-fact. The idea of a connected and collected story has obviously visited and abandoned its writer again and again in the course of composition. The style of his tale is in places disfigured by mad (rather than bad) English; and its catastrophe is hastily, weakly, and obscurely managed.\\"-Henry F. Chorley, in London Athenaeum, October 25 1851Ouch, that is a harsh but not entirely inaccurate review.Here's how:1.The book is a hodgepodge of the epically awesome thrilling narrative of a vindictive whaling revenge story gone awry, AND it's a not so accurate antiquated whaleology (Cetology is the technical term, but you know...) dissertation.And I know what you're thinking...\\"OH, East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet.\\" And along with Rudyard Kipling you'd be right. Who would have thought of mixing science and fiction? (snicker, snicker... sorry) I am of course meaning literal science or at least the preconceived notions on whales from the time period . Moby Dick contains a wealth of knowledge and first hand whaling experience from Melville's life, but he doesn't just write it into Ishmael's tale. It is splattered haphazardly throughout the book educating the reader while disrupting the flow and pacing of the story.This is... well it's distracting, and well, it's infuriating! The story builds. As a reader, you are getting keyed in and keyed up. Then -- WHAM! Let's pause for this PSA on the differing types of twine used on whaling ships with an additional three pages on the species of whales this book is NOT about.More whaling, less waxing on whaling, please!From what I have gleaned about the book, it was not the current writing style of the times to marry fact with a tale of fiction -- however, woeful and whaleful it may be. But as much as it is a detriment to my attention span, this odd writing style also strokes my inner nerd and evokes my intellectual yearnings. I found myself continually questioning his information. Googling about whales -- heck, I even watched Blue Planet for some additional information.2. Now we come to the mad English bit. Melville uses either some extreme creative license or some heavily buried nautical colloquialisms to further embellish his maritime account. There are words in this book that only a sailor at sea cut off from civilization could conjure up. I remember looking at some words, and searching for them with my Kindle's dictionary. I cannot begin to relay the frustration that the phrase \\"No entries found\\" causes me now. It had me continually worried I wasn't understanding the story as it was meant to be understood.But beyond all this wordage and pacing, the story of Captain Ahab is intensely engaging. Long before you meet the whale (He doesn't make an appearance till the last 3 chapters out of 135...), you know things aren't going to go well for the captain or his crew. And it is these early portentous notions, that have you flat flying to the end of the book. You just have to know if Captain Ahab has his retribution or if the white whale exacts yet more torments on the already tortured commander.On the Stocking Scale, I give it a 4 for Darned Good. It is looooooong, and takes a commitment to read, but I don't believe you'll regret the decision in the end. And should you want to skip the whaling tutorial and get down to the gritty tale itself, well -- read the abridged version.I downloaded this book for free on my Kindle Fire.

It keeps your interest and informs you of how things used to be done in the olden days, although it is a little far fetched for my taste."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Although the plot dragged all over the place, it was a basicly good book with a lot of emence detale"},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Most people might consider me to be a bit idealistic to think that Moby Dick is the greatest novel of the 19th century, or even great to begin with. But undoubtedly this book contains so many subtleties and undertones that transcend most readers. The readers who get them, however, are brilliantly provoked. Moby Dick is the story of a vengeful captain Ahab embroiled in the fight of his life, the fight for the intangibly malignant great white whale. Herman Melville's messages on ambiguity, power, and masks are incredible. For example, his use of deconstruction and contradiction in describing man's discovery that there are things out there that are better left unknown, like with Moby Dick, are universally applicable. Moby Dick is not for everyone; it is a long book that can get monotonous and rambling. But just when people start to get agitated with its pace, Melville throws in some brilliant lines and ideas that are so powerful they can be hard to pick up. I encourage everyone, however, to give this book a shot. If you are really interested in reading the greatest novel of the 19th century, give yourself at least a month to do so. I promise you, you will not be disappointed. In time, you might start to agree what a remarkable book this is."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"I took a class in college all about Mellville a few years ago. A lot of the time I took the easy way out with the books that I just couldn't imagine actually trudging through (sparknote it!). But I was determined to read this one. I had always heard, as just about everyone has, that this is the greatest novel of all time. I wanted to see if that was actually true, or a bunch of old professors spouting off about a boring book. It was a shocker that it is actually true. Greatest novel of all time. No question, no argument.It's hard to explain exactly why though. It has a lot of weird stuff in it about whaling terminology, definitions and surreal scenes that reminded me almost of a wacky broadway number on crack. It is so hard to catch a hold of the atmosphere. Though there is one to be sure. It's difficult to talk about the themes or the points of the book. But there are more there than I could ever come up with, certainly. I think it is the nature of the book, the uneasiness, the expanse, the...what's the word...uncertainty...that makes it great. It looms out a million miles ahead of you.The other really uncertain thing about it, I don't why this is so, but it has the greatest character ever written on the page. Quequeg. I talked with many of my classmates about this, and they all agreed. I can't tell why, but he just is. He doesn't say much...but he's just THERE. I was floored by him. It's like he's more present than anyone you've ever read about before. You just have to see for yourself on that one.I've only read it once, but I really want to read it again. Because as Nabikov said, you cannot read a book, you must reread it. Something along those lines. But I would recommend this to anyone who is a book lover, or who wants a sense of history or culture since the book has been a big part of all of it.You won't believe it once you're finished."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"A classic? Yes. Long? That's an understatement.There's an entire chapter on why the color \`white' is scary. If you never read this in school, and you don't know what you're getting into, I suggest talking to a few people who have read it first to see if this is your flavor. Melville is a beautiful writer, but his epic tangents were too much for me. Some people like the Mona Lisa, some people don't."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"I read this book a few years ago when I was really into whales and whale watching and wanted a little historical perspective. I did get that and more, and less, depending on how you look at it.The book is long and difficult to get through. There are many chapters and parts of chapters that don't have to be included. As an example, there is a chapter on the identification of various species of whale, what they look like and where they range etc... From my previous whale knowledge, I knew that in several descriptions, multiple species were crammed into one and sometimes one whale was split into more than once species. Interesting, but hardly important to the story.If I were going to edit the book, and keep only the pieces that are of masterpiece quality, I'd have somewhere around 50 pages (the book is about 500 pages). At its best, the book is lyrical, suspenceful, the characters are deeply developed and their actions are believable. The story is exciting, crazy, tragic and frustrating all at the same time.At its worst, the book is pedantic, wordy, much too complex and down right boring. Truly, this book is combination of the best and the worst, sometimes right beside each other.In the end though, I have to agree with the critics over time, and that the classic pieces are what I took with me in the end. The plight of Ahab, the fanaticism, the tragedy and idea of an unobtainable goal all stay with me.The material that remains part of popular culture is there for a reason. The whole idea of a &quot;white whale&quot; as the unobtained goal. &quot;Thar she blows!&quot;, Captain Ahab himself, &quot;Call me Ishmael&quot; and many more make the book worth everyone's effort to read at least once."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"The right approach and the adequate level of intelligence is vital for that book's appreciation.Here are a few hints that might help.Did you notice that every time you dream the weirdest things there is nothing unfamiliar about them? Even when the enormous green elefant on gnat's legs attacks you with the eagle's beak you can tell your sleeping brain put the monster together using the oversized version of the animal you saw in a zoo, though in a different color, gigantic limbs of an isect and the bird's mouth. While communicating with itself your brain can not produce any images that do not correspond with your everyday experiences, it is capable of transforming them almost beyond recognition but the ingredients are real life.The same with the author. He neded to choose something to be able to communicate with you. Why it's the gigantic white whale?White is not a color but an absence of color - see the book's treatise on white and the eerie feeling it produces. The form of a whale is very elusive and hard to define. The animal lives in the most mysterious(it's still a few decades till the space age) but accessible element of that time - the ocean.So GWW is the most undefinable object Herman Melville could come up with. Even writing one of the most metaphysical books he could not have set the hunt for hk897]];\\\\'; or =-llk5gghh. The need to communicate - remember? But be assured that the GWW is no less abstract than these crazy codes.There is some semblance of plot with the characters and even the final battle. Many readers are misled to such a degree they put here these &quot;good plot and hystorical background but way to many details&quot; reviews. Once I even stumbled upon the video cassette with the kid's version of Moby Dick - chubby boy grinning atop a friendly whale.Guy's, you don't know what are you dealing with!The quotations from the enormous variety of sourses on a whale at the book's first pages are not Melville's erudite showing off but a testimony to the futility of all the efforts to categorize.What drives Ahab? Revenge? Bloodlust? Even the most understanding readers try to find a word or two - The Quest for Truth, The Search For The Meaning Of Life. Choose any version or none at all.Ever thought about death? Are you familiar with that sense if inevitability that makes you gasp for breath and clench the fists. The fit is passes in a few minutes. What do you feel? Rage, fear, anger, helplessness? You can find words but they are not helping.So the Captain sails into infinity to conquer the...whatever.Too many fishes are named and described during the voyage? Too many details? In Zen practise you repeat thousands of words, name lots of objects until it all becomes meaningless and something else emerges. These fishes are not something you eat - they are just an excuses to give names ad nauseam, to catch the little flecks of infinity and try to make the catalogue.Enough said. This book must be read, not explained. But it's a very special reading - like having a long string of beads pass before your eyes. Do not think too much, do not expect to be entertained - just enjoy the feeling."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"I just spent a week reading this whale of a book and decided the book has more water or filler than all the oceans of the world combined. The book is much like the Earth -- it is 2/3 water or filler and the other 1/3 land or somewhat of a story. The story is really thin -- Ahab and the Pequod in quest of the White Whale. This goes on for 589 pages in my edition. Moby-Dick is first mentioned in the book on page 177 and then seen for the first time on page 559. That's right, right at the end of the novel. For most of the book, we are bored and disgusted at Melville relating everything he knows about whaling and whales. Much of it, I imagine, is obsolete information. The story involving Moby-Dick is only a few pages. I think my copy of 589 pages could have been boiled down to about 235 pages, and that would have been a classic, engrossing story of the hunt for a White Whale. Anyway, if you have to read it, beware of the boring, sleep-inducing whaling chapters. Even though I really felt a lot of the book was unnecessary, I can see how the book became a classic. It is an unrivaled look at whales, and must have influenced Peter Benchley in his writing of \\"Jaws.\\" Sharks are mentioned many times in the book. But a white Sperm Whale seemed to be the biggest monster in the ocean, and so Melville chose him. There was supposedly an actual whale named Mocha Dick being hunted during Melville's time. In the end, I can give Moby-Dick a slight recommendation. The story is solid, but if that's all you want, I recommend renting the movie with Richard Basehart and Gregory Peck. No, in the end, Moby-Dick really should have been called, \\"But I Digress.\\" Read it any way, I guess, it is considered a classic."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"I could not finish listening to the terrible injustice Burt Reynolds did to this classic. It sounded as though he was reading it for the first time. The voice he chose to portray Ishmael was one of a drunken sea salt instead of a school teacher off on an adventure. All sense was lost of the meaning of the sentences with his arbitrary screeching and bellowing. I later found an unabridged version that I loved, the language and the cadence of the speech was respected in a way that Mr. Reynolds had not the wit, ability, or intelligence to understand let alone portray."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Melville is writing through Ishmael and Ishmael is Ahab. And it might help to stop thinking of the story as man/nature and dig deeper to the roots of what allegory it might have for Melville's life.The \\"slow\\" middle might seem less slow this way and you can apply the message to your own life. It starts to transcend being just literature and more a way of life."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"I've read Moby Dick. It took me two attempts to do it, but I did it! I now can understand why it is often cited as the greatest American novel ever written. However, if I was to read it again (and I may) I would do so with a good amount of judicious skipping. Bear in mind that Melville wrote this at a time when not much was known about whales and whaling. Therefore, while the actual PLOT of Moby Dick is a fairly straightforward read, Melville will digress for pages and pages about whales, and the history of whaling. This may not prove that interesting for everyone and, since the chapters are all neatly labeled, one can easily skip over them. That having been said, DO NOT skip over every chapter you feel has no bearing on the plot. On The Whiteness of the Whale is one of the most important parts of the book - it perhaps answers why we find clowns so creepy.The important thing to remember is that Moby Dick is both low art and high art. It is a rollicking adventure tale, in which we find a lot of great prose and ruminations on the meaning of existence. Beware of the phantom spout, don't look too long into the fire, and enjoy the book."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"This is an unquestionably classic. Indeed, you know a classic by how many times it has been ripped off, or alluded to in pop culture. In fact, the star Trek franchise's motto is when in doubt; either have a time travel episode, a Borg episode, or rip-off Moby-Dick. See episodes from the original series &quot;Obsession,&quot; and movies &quot;The Wrath of Khan,&quot; and &quot;First Contact&quot; and &quot;The Voyage Home&quot;Test: What's the opening line of Moby-Dick? &quot;Call me Ishmael.&quot;So why the four starts for a classic? Basically, because Melvin threw in too much exposition in explaining cetology and zoology, which is helpful in getting a feel for the book, but contributes nothing to the brooding Ahab's story. You get snippets here and there of Ahab's monomania, but it is only in the last several chapters that he blooms from being a poor addled man to a diabolic and satanic force of evil. Baptizing the spear in the name of the devil is what does it!But do we need to slog through 135 chapters, plus an appendix to get to the point. In reality this book is about the milieu of whaling and the whaling industry as a metaphor for life, not monomania as is popularly believed. He does a wonderful job of catching the salt and blood associated, and his poetic eye catches the glisten of meaning with these events, but he is doing several things at once, and the quest for the whale is only part of the story.But these cetology matters should have been relegated to an appendix, or the circular file. It was as if Melville was trying to write two books at once: a bouncy book on various whales and whaling in general, and a another being the tale of obsession and revenge. My advice would be to get an abridge version of the book, or skip to the next chapter when the book gets boring.So what is the appeal? First, Ahab is a strong character with a smoldering motive to get back at the whale that cost him his leg-i.e. Captain Hook. Does he ever get back at the wale? Are we ever Ahab-esque in that we get obsessed with revenge? Come on! Be honest! We feel Ahab burning in our veins at times.Ahab is crazy. Hannibal Lecter is crazy. But they are crazy for different reasons. You feel that Lecter is really in control of himself, and that he enjoys being evil whereas Ahab has surrendered his will to he appetite and passion for revenge. What wraps my attention is the question why.Second, the craft. Melville is a master storyteller. We see things through Ishmael's eyes, so we feel the distance between Ahab and us. We are detached from the goings on in the story as Ishmael comments on Ahab's journey downward. It must be read to be understood.Third, the milieu. Melville certainly did his homework in researching this novel. Indeed, chapter one seems like a brainstorm on all things whale, and he manages to sustain this encyclopedic knowledge throughout the story. Compare this to Jack London and The Sea-Wolf: London has as much technical knowledge, or more so than Melville, but the Sea-Wolf focuses on the characters Humphrey Van Weyden and Wolf Larsen and the idea of a Neitzchean Superman. Moby-Dick, however, is a study of the whaling milieu and the smudge pot Ahab. London skimps on the description of seal hunting &quot;culture,&quot; and the nuts and bolts of sailing while Melville revels in telling us everything about whaling. This exposition is what kills the book because the plot grinds to a standstill as Melville throws cetological tidbits and tales at us. It is fun to read, but the plot momentum stops dead. It is almost like seeing an infomercial in the middle of the book! Luckily we can skip ahead, unlike reality where we cannot fast-forward commercial.This book is part of a trio that deals with evil captains, the other books being Jack London's &quot;Sea-Wolf,&quot; and Jules Verne's &quot;20,000 Leagues under the Sea.&quot; Nemo is just as driven as Ahab, but is more mysterious. We understand Ahab's revenge, since we have all tried to chase down people who have hurt us, or wanted to get back at a barking dog, or barking spouse. That is the appeal-we relate to Ahab better than Nemo, who is cerebral, cold, distant and obscure.Wolf Larsen is another matter. He belongs in the Villain's Hall of Fame, or is it the Rogue's Gallery? Pure evil, a pure manifestation of &quot;intelligence . . . added to brute power and evil will&quot; (Inferno, 31) that was never matched or equaled until Thomas Harris created Hannibal Lecter. Ahab is obsessed and we understand why someone wants revenge, but Larsen is terrifying in that he enjoys being evil. I just wish that Larsen would get more exposure.So in a knot, I recommend this book, but advise people to feel free in skipping over the unnecessary chapter, or buying an abridged version. Read &quot;20,000 Leagues&quot; and &quot;The Sea-Wolf&quot; to nail down the image of an evil captain.FOR ANYONE WRITING A REPORT: This story is a tale of &quot;Man Versus Nature&quot; embodied by the whale. Read Genesis 16-17,21, 25, 28 and 1 Kings 16, 18, 20-22 for Ishmael and Ahab. Aren't I kind!"},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"My review is of the book, not this particular edition.There are only a few reasons to read this book:(1) You have to read it for school. If this is the case stop reading reviews and get to work.(2) You want to be cultured. There are many \\"cultural\\" books that are a lot more fun to read and more educational/enlightening than this book are. Come back to this book when you're more desperate(3) You are a whaler, or a member of some anti-whaling organization. It's really part of your field.This book fits Mark Twain's definition of a classic: \\"A classic is something that everybody wants to have read and nobody wants to read.\\" While I am sure there is a personality type out there who would like this sort of book, I think it's in the minority, and that most people wouldn't like this book, and it wouldn't be a classic unless college professors told us it was a classic. First off, the vast majority of the book is mind-numbingly boring. It seems that most authors of the 19th century thought that to write well, they had to write a lot, so Melville takes a story that could fit into a few chapters and bloats it with countless discussions on anything and everything even remotely related to whales. From the point of view of learning, these discussions are of limited value. A great deal of the information is out of date or of a limited perspective. If you want to learn about whales or even 19th century whaling, you'd probably learn a lot more and in a lot less time just by reading encyclopedia articles on the subject.That leaves two things to be gotten from this book: A moving story, and a lesson in good writing. Like I said, the story could really fit into a few chapters. The book is 135 chapters, and could easily have fit into thirty, even with Melville's ornate style.That brings us to a lesson in writing. It seems to me that there are two great schools of though on writing: The first values clarity, and the second values ornamentation. The first seeks to say something as clearly and succinctly as possible and when you read it, you say \\"ah, that is the perfect way of saying that.\\" The second seeks the most virtuosic way of saying something, and when you read it, you say \\"ah, that is the most impressive way of saying that.\\" I come from the first school, and I don't particularly like the virtuosic style: but Melville is such a pitch-perfect caricature of the most pompous wing of the baroque school of writing that I found slogging through his prose to be a miserable experience. If you like finding new ways of saying common things, I think you should give Melville a try, but if you value clear and direct writing, I suggest you heed this warning.I should end by saying it's not all bad. I was trying to decide between one and two stars for most of the book. But around chapter 119 I thought it really became good. The reading was actually enthralling and I even teared up at the part where Starbuck has a moment of insight into Ahab's soul and makes one final attempt to convince Ahab to give it up. I'd give from about chapter 119 to the end four or five stars, but that's not enough to save the book for me."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"\\"Moby Dick\\" has been hyped far beyond its worth because it was the first American novel with philosophic pretentions. You could read the first ninety pages, then skip to the last ten and miss nothing but a binful of symbols. It's gauche, jejune, primitive, a graphic novel without illustrations--one of the few American novels improved as a Classics comic book. Joseph Conrad covers the same material better, and Persig better than either of them. This is a wearying tome that no one would read if it weren't assigned reading. It will teach you . . . nothing."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"MOBY DICK was trashed by critics in its own time, and was a commercial flop. I think those folks had the right take on the book. I found it tedious going. And it was odd how the fictional story was interrupted here and there to become a text book for a college oceanography class: everything you ever wanted to know about whales. I truly think MOBY DICK has turned into a &quot;classic&quot; because university students and professors who needed a literary novel to write about found MOBY DICK so rich with symbolism (even though the actual novel itself wasn't worth much). English term papers (and articles professors have to write for academic journals) require you to show--not whether THE GREAT GATSBY is a good read or not--but what Gatsby represents (the failure of the American Dream!!). The optometrist's billboard that appears throughout GATSBY represents...THE OMNISCIENCE OF GOD, AND HOW YOU CAN NOT ESCAPE HIS FATE. Those are the two big symbolic/metaphorical things in THE GREAT GATSBY. And I could write an English paper explaining those symbols. But MOBY DICK...my God!!!!!!!!! There are more symbols and metaphors on a single page of MOBY DICK than there are in the whole of GATSBY, or most other literary &quot;classics.&quot; I could write a thousand English papers and professorial academic articles about the symbolism in MOBY DICK. I mean, the white whale...his whiteness is symbolic of...where do I start??? That Queequeg is all tattoed...what do those tattoos represent??? (That's a term paper right there). And Queequeg and Ishmael (two men) sleeping together at the beginning of the novel &quot;like husband and wife...&quot; (Another paper explaining that). Peter Coffin is the name on the sign outside the inn at the start of the novel. The last scene in the book has a coffin float to the surface after the Pequod (the name of an American Indian tribe!!!) sinks!!!! The inn is &quot;like Lazarus,&quot; the inn's windows like Lazarus's eyes. (Since when have you stayed in a hotel that reminded you of a g! uy raised from the dead?????? Ah...but it's symbolism!!!) Ahab's peg leg bitten off by Moby Dick?...well, of course, that peg leg is a phallic symbol! (Yet another academic paper written right there). And what of the biblical names...like &quot;Ishmael&quot; and &quot;Ahab&quot; (names not representative of American names of the time)...more term papers and articles for academic journals. Grad students and undergrad students and professors over the years have needed literary works rich with symbolism like this to write about. And when there is a book like MOBY DICK...that makes your work very easy. And all those students and professors writing papers about MOBY DICK over the years have had a snowball effect so that people actually now give the novel merit in and of itself, aside from its helpful wealth of academic goodies. I will say that the last three pages of MOBY DICK are good. It is a good action scene, that final battle against the whale. (And there is enough symbolism in those last few pages, besides, for ten term papers. But it's good stuff in and of itself. But three good pages at the end of such a long, grinding book ain't worth the journey). When I read Mark Twain's quote that &quot;a classic is a book everybody wants to HAVE read, but nobody wants to read,&quot; I thought immediately of MOBY DICK."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"I quite enjoyed this version, but it felt like it missed some action. I don't know the book off-by-heart so I can't pinpoint exact instances, but the overall feeling was that it was incomplete. That said, it was still a good read."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"moby dick..is the ultimate tale of obsession...we all know the story, so i wont go into it..but this version is a great presentation of the classic.."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"I read this book in High School and it didn't leave much of an impression. Having re-read other books from my youth and enjoyed them more the second time through (Great expectations comes to mind), I thought that I'd give MD another try, but again unfortunately,I didn't enjoy it.I have been getting into classic books on fishing and the sea in general, and most recently finished Captains Courageous and The Mysterious Island, because of that, I can't help but compare MD to those works. For me it falls short on several levels. First, I thought it was a long-winded piece. It's over six hundred pages and very heavy on descriptions. The passages can be wordy and sometimes hard to digest, or tolerate. The vocabulary and sentence structure (reminiscent of Poe's works) could also be a chore rather than a joy to get through. Captains Courageous, on the other hand shines brightly with its much livelier cast, and more enjoyable narrative.There is also a potential for an interesting gender study on this work. When I first read it, I either didn't pay attention to or skimmed over the homoerotic interactions between Ishmael and Queequeg. These took place in several scenes early in the book and only led to more questions about the characters and their makeup rather than informing the reader or adding depth. I'll probably try this book again later on in life, but until then I'd recommend others."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"O.K. 80% of this novel is boring as hell, unless you're into the history of whaling. But the other 20%, wow! The metaphysics of the whale is astonishing, and mainly by virtue of how Melville describes the creature, and links it to Ahab.So what is the whale? Some see good or evil, others life or death, others decay or life, still others God. If you read to the end, you'll see which interpretation I favor -- but the whale seems to encompass all of these.Charles Olson has a great analysis in his little known book \\"Call Me Ishmael\\"Call Me Ishmaellikening the whale to America's concept of vast space (as in land), which America tries to harness through technology. It's a great read, insightful but not \\"scholarly\\".I believe Melville was \\"schizoid\\" in personality type, feeling the vast force of God, but not the personal connection to God, e.g. through Christ. Melville tried, but he was to honest with himself to make himself believe something he really didn't buy. Writing Moby Dick almost literally killed the guy. God is too powerful for man to face unmediated, but this is what Melville tried to do. It was the only chance he had to make contact. Melville and Ahab both had to try to wrestle the whale, to bring something incomprehensible home to themselves, and to man."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"This is one of those books that can be the only book you will ever need. The range of characters is quite wide and it has excellent descriptive matter. I only wish it had more of the saucy and less of the salty. Otherwise I just love this book!"},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"This is the third time reading Moby Dick, an important part of American literature. The Kindle makes the book portable and more flexible.( Makes it very accessible ) Tale more enjoyable for me in this format. No lugging around a heavy tome. Excellent historical content.

Down loaded it to my kindle in seconds. Price was super, couldn't ask for a better book to read."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"This is the Norton Critical Edition. I ordered it for my wife. Moby what???? I said. Anyhow, it came in pristine condition except for a sturdy piece of tape that said \\"USED.\\" My wife was thrilled. If she ever finishes reading it, I plan on reading it next. Call it Moby envy."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"I read this edition of Moby-Dick a while ago. For a novel like Moby-Dick, a lot of terminology needs to be clarified, so the Norton Edition is helpful if you like footnotes/endnotes.Positives: Structurally, the novel is divided into over one hundred thirty chapters, which makes it very easy to read bit by bit if you don't have a lot of time. The first block of twenty or so chapters chronicles Ishmael and his companion at the harbor before sailing. This is where Melville's use of foreshadowing does a great job of establishing a foundation of strong characters (like the monomaniac Captain Ahab) and creating an infamous reputation of Moby-Dick. As the ship sails around the oceans, there are a few frightening episodes of peril, as well as meetings with other ships which discuss the legendary encounters with Moby-Dick. When the crew finally does encounter the whale, Melville concentrates the ferocious battle into just a few chapters. At first I was expecting the Moby-Dick encounter to disappoint me, but Melville certainly delivers when the story's climax arrives.Negatives: If you read any of Melville's Piazza Tales, you will know that Melville is sometimes inaccessible due to his particular linguistic flavor. Melville very often dives into very intricate details about topics a modern reader cannot grasp. The middle section (about chpts 21-125) of Moby-Dick contains many chapters which are essays on select topics of maritime navigation, differences among whale species, parts of the sail mast, whale-harpooning, etc. The pacing of the novel slows to a standstill as you learn about the specifics of these topics. Don't feel bad if you really feel the need to skim through these encyclopedic chapters (you can usually tell by the chapter title). Every few chapters Melville does allow the story to move forward.If you are patient and enjoy novels that prepare you for an exciting conclusion, check out Moby-Dick. It's widely considered a classic for a good reason."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Moby Dick is worth reading, despite being pretty abominable philosophically (and parts of it are seemingly interminable and hard to get through, but I think that's actually a deliberate aesthetic choice on Melville's part). There are parts that are very good. The opening chapters about the friendship that develops between Ishmael and Queequeg are actually quite entertaining, and Melville makes some insightful psychological points through the character of Ahab. There are a lot of sort of proto-postmodernist elements in terms of the novel's form, along with Melville's belief in man's impotence in both thought and action which they represent---but nowhere near to the extent that would come later, in, for example, Ulysses."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"I can't recommend this edition enough !

I would recommend this to others without reservation."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Moby Dick is Herman Melville's magisterial work on whaling and obsession. One of the other reviews states that whales are only a very tiny part of the book, but Melville spends far more time on whales than on Ahab's obsession. It appears fairly early on, but it stays in the background until the last fifth of the book (which also provides most of the action).Melville takes frequent asides to wax poetic about the law, whale biology, and the art of whale hunting. Moby Dick, at its heart, as much a book about work as a book about Ahab's obsession with the white whale, and no one has ever written work finer than Melville (although Cormac McCarthy comes close). And no one has ever written about work finer.The prose is almost always difficult to digest, but it is also almost painfully beautiful at times. The first paragraph of chapter 132 is illustrative:\\"It was a clear steel-blue day. The firmaments of air and sea were hardly separable in that all-pervading azure; only, the pensive air was transparently pure and soft, with a woman's look, and the robust and man-like sea heaved with long, strong, lingering swells, as Samson's chest in his sleep.\\"I read the free Kindle version created by GutenMark software. I did not notice any errors, but I have not read another edition, so changes in content would likely escape me. It does not include a foreword. The quotations about whales have all been moved to the back (it is my understanding some editions put this first)."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Now admired as a masterpiece of American literature and considered one of the greatest novels of all time, Moby-Dick is a \\"must read\\" book.

I started reading it when I was in school but put it aside, now I'm finishing it."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"After reading this book in college many years ago, I was transformed by the prose of Herman Melville. Not only does he delve into the human soul and all of its variables, but he deals with nature at its most primeval. It will always be my favorite book due to the intricacies of the characters and the fabulous writing style. I have been an avid reader ever since, daring authors to match the brilliance of Moby Dick: or, the White Whale."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Call me Fishmael.I gave MOBY DICK four stars because 80% of the novel is a rip-roaring adventure on the high seas, while 20% consists of digressions or sidebars that stop the story in its tracks. Some sample digressions are the classification of whales, whiteness, clam chowder, illustrators of whales, and so on. All of these detours do support the story, some more than others (whiteness), but they still interrupt the narrative flow. If I were teaching this now to gifted high school students, I would propose something heretical. I would mark certain chapters as optional--it's easy to find them given the chapter headings--but I would include them in class discussion by assigning students to individual chapters. Their merits could then be debated. I would suggest to anyone re-reading MOBY DICK or approaching it for the first time to take a similar approach--skip the detours unless you find them interesting.As for the bulk of the novel, it's like a superabundant ocean overflowing with treasures. The passages describing the hunting, killing, and harvesting of whales are incomparable. Adding to this corpus delectable are vigorous characters, Shakespearean language and irony, classical and Biblical allusions, allegory and metaphor, laugh-out-loud humor, and an engaging narrator who disappears seamlessly in the latter sections of the tale.Many of these elements are present in one of my favorite scenes. The Pequod frequently encounters other ships on its journey (these meetings are called \\"gams\\"), and Ahab in his haste to board one of these vessels realizes that his artificial leg will not allow him to climb from his dinghy to the other boat's deck. A huge grappling hook is lowered, one that is used to secure the carcasses of whales to the boat, and Ahab sits in the curve of the hook while being raised to the passing ship's deck. All of the gams in MOBY DICK are amusing and enlightening because Ahab's sole concern is to ask the other captains if they've seen the white whale, while their intent lies elsewhere. The conversations are thus at cross purposes, providing humor, and serve to underline Ahab's obsession.Two scenes were remarkably reminiscent of HAMLET. Starbuck, the first mate, is convinced that Ahab is leading the crew to its doom. Late in the story, he eyes a musket outside of Ahab's cabin and considers murdering the sleeping captain. After a long soliloquy, during which Ahab cries out nightmarishly, Starbuck passes up the opportunity, much as Hamlet does when he encounters Claudius alone and praying. Anyone familiar with HAMLET cannot miss the unmistakable foreshadowing. In another scene, Ahab and the ship's carpenter are discussing Queequeg's coffin, which is actually a canoe of sorts. The carpenter has been given the task of converting the coffin into a life buoy, a humorous irony in itself. The ensuing conversation is not unlike Hamlet's hilarious exchange with the gravedigger.Ahab: Art thou the leg-maker? Look, did not this stump come from thy shop?Carpenter: I believe it did, sir; does the ferrule stand, sir?Ahab: Well enough. But art thou not also the undertaker?Carpenter: Aye, sir; I patched up this thing here as a coffin for Queequeg. ; but they've set me now to turning it into something else.Ahab: Then tell me; art thou not an arrant, all-grasping, intermeddling, monopolizing, heathenish old scamp, to be one day making legs, and the next day coffins to clap them in, and yet again life-buoys out of those same coffins? Thou art as unprincipled as the gods, and as much of a jack-of-all-trades.The twists and turns of fate are out of Ahab's control, but Melville's mastery of MOBY DICK is complete."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"I consider Moby Dick one of the best books I've been reading until now.

Some years ago- never mind how long precisely- having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world\\".

The first failed reading of this novel happened when I picked up a lovely Easton Press leather hardback. I sat and cracked open the book and by the third chapter I realized I would be needing a dictionary handy. I never got farther than that in my first attempt and this second attempt was only made successful for not having to stop to look up the hundreds of archaic words. There were still quite a few that my integrated dictionary couldn't fin, but taking the time to look these up was far less damaging to the reading experience than had I gone with the print version. A word of caution: the free version of the ebook I read (ASIN:B004TRXX7C) had errors whenever it dealt with lists of numbers i.e. list of money valuations, weights, etc. Frequently the text was egregiously wrong with the first number in the list.Using the Moby Dick Big Read Along website was also crucial to my finishing this novel. This website was suggested by author Joe Hill as he commenced his reading of this novel. The site is dedicated to a free podcast reading of the novel with each chapter being read by someone different. There were only a few chapters I could not listen to (because of their style of reading) but on the whole, reading the ebook along with this verbal reading made the experience magnitudes better. There are times in the novel when it was not clear to me that a dialog was taking place, but the vocal performances made it explicitly clear. Also, Melville abuses commas and semicolons like a champ and the vocal readings made it much easier to find the flow of sentence than deciphering it out on my own. Added bonus is that there are a few celebrity readers such as Tilda Swinton and Benedict Cumberbatch.My experienceThis is a hard read but a rewarding one. Yet, I would caution the reader that if you're looking for a thriller - fast paced and exciting - this is not the book for it. There is action but it is far outweighed by the academics of whaling. On the whole, my experience with this book is to, at a very high level, say it is the grandfather of tales such as the movie Jaws. There's a fellow that knows all the biology of the animal (Hooper/Ishmael), a fellow that wants to keep everyone safe and kill the beast but not at the expense of his own life (Brody/Starbuck) and the fellow that will stop at nothing to see this beast dead by his own hands (Quint/Ahab).However, most of the book is dedicated not to the backbone of the Jaws storyline but rather to the documentation of whaling. Much like the book 20,000 Leagues Under The Seas, there are entire chapters (several actually) that take painstaking care in documenting the biology and happenings of the time - the anatomy of a whale, the various species of whale, the history of whale depictions, the process of hunting for whale, the process of dismantling a whale, the worth of whale parts (oil, ambergris, bone, etc) and exacting detail of the components of a whaling ship. It feels more like a biology lesson rather than a novel and in this day in age, it really made me wonder why anyone would go through so much trouble to hunt a whale. However as tedious as these parts can be, I found it incredibly interesting... almost as if it were a tome to a dying art. These sailors were the Deadliest Catch fishermen of their day and age. They suffered weather, rations, tediousness, physical hardship, sharks, and seclusion in hopes of bringing home enough oil to sell and receive their share. Many did not come home (or like Ahab didn't come home whole) and that was just part of expectations of such a hazardous profession.But if you can slog through those parts, the pay off is incredible. All that I knew about this novel (and that most people will hear about this novel) only takes place in the last three chapters of this 135 chapter novel. But the characters are so rich and interesting. The harpooners, Queequeg, Tashtego and Daggoo are my favorite characters because they are so different from anyone else. Ishmael, our narrator, is an interesting fellow himself. He seems to have a bit of jading toward religion (\\"I'll try a pagan friend, thought I, since Christian kindness has proved but hollow courtesy.\\" p. 46) but in all other things seems to be a fair narrator by conveying more of what he sees rather than commentary about what he sees. And of course there is steady Starbuck and our mad Captain Ahab. Ahab is more of a brooding figure that does not prominently play into the action until well into the second half of the novel. Ahab has a singular determination for revenge. Above the profit of the ship, the lives of his crew and even above his own life itself, Ahab's singular purpose for this voyage is to find and kill Moby Dick. He is so tortured by his first encounter with the White Whale, that revenge consumes him to the point that he no longer wishes to live if it means he must endure Moby Dick living as well. It is an all consuming hatred that drives Ahab and that in the end costs him everything. It is proof positive that frequently, hatred consumes the person rather than the object of the hate.Similar to Ahab, Moby Dick himself doesn't make an appearance in the novel until the antepenultimate chapter. Much like the movie Jaws, you'll have to wait quite some time to actually see the monster in all his glory. In Ahab's obsession over Moby Dick, I found it intriguing that Ahab truly believed that Moby Dick can hold a grudge and have a single mind for attacking rather than fleeing a capture. Whales apparently normally don't attack with viciousness, yet this is exactly what happens upon meeting the unique creature.The short of it - if you want to take a shortcut, read just the last three chapters and that will get you about 90% of everything you've ever heard about this book. If you want the full experience, I would strongly suggest taking your time reading it and augmenting a print version with an audio version. It helps immensely.Popular CultureThe thing I love most about reading classics is it becomes clear that all works of art are somehow connected or based on others. Slogging through and enduring the bulk of the archaic and There were several instances of this in Moby Dick.On two occasions, the movie Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan echoed lines from Moby Dick. The first was when addressing his first mate Starbuck and the listening crew, Ahab confirms that it was indeed Moby Dick that took his leg. Displaying all his enmity for the whale, Ahab shows to what lengths he is willing to go to hunt down and kill him when he declares,\\"I'll chase him round Good Hope, and round the Horn, and round the Norway Maelstrom, and round perdition's flames before I give him up.\\"- CHAPTER 36 The Quarter-Deck (p. 150)The second came at the end of the book. Ahab again utters a familiar quote. Similar to Khan, in his last moments of life, Ahab says,\\"Towards thee I roll, thou all-destroying but unconquering whale; to the last I grapple with thee; from hell's heart I stab at thee; for hate's sake I spit my last breath at thee.\\"- CHAPTER 135 The Chase - Third Day (p.538)The last pop culture reference I found in Moby Dick was a short but lovely song that the harpooners and sailors were singing on the Pequod - and it's because I first heard it from Quint in the movie Jaws:\\"Farewell and adieu to you, Spanish ladies!Farewell and adieu to you, ladies of Spain!\\"- CHAPTER 40 Midnight, Forecastle (p. 158)Finding these gems not only made Moby Dick more fun, but it also gave me an appreciation for the other works and characters who referenced the lines from the novel and in the case of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, the depth of what they were saying by using these references.In all, I wanted the feeling of accomplishment for reading a classic that is so frequently referenced and I can say definitively that I have that. It was an amazing month long journey through a book that I fear will pass into unreadability because of it's archaic nature and we would be all the poorer for it."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Overall, I liked this book, which I got on my Kindle. But, it had parts that were pretty boring, like when it would get off of the story line about the whale and go into how the rope was made, etc. I wasn't so interested in rope and wanted to get back to the story. But, I stayed with it due to the book being a classic."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"I never had the privilege of reading this book prior to this year, and i wish i would have read it years ago. The wit and exquisite use of words by Melville makes this an easy book to bury your nose in for hours. You will be completely immersed in the 19th century whale fishery in all aspects and follow detailed human struggle of revenge. This was such a good read that it has now put me on a classic kick searching for more novels that capture the imagination like this book."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"If you are interested in hearing Moby Dick rather than reading this very long book, this book on CDs is for you. The price is more than reasonable and Anthony Heald has a wonderful voice quality that keeps one's interest even through those dry passages. Recently my family took a cross-country road trip and listened to most of the 24 hrs of discs. We very much enjoyed listening to this Melville classic."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"I somehow managed to get through seven years of English higher education without once picking this book up. I wasn't deliberately avoiding it either, it just never came up. (Of course, I do have a bit of a prejudice against American literature, so that might have been part of the reason.) In any case, I'm kind of glad, because it allowed me to discover this book on my own.My first impression of this book was that, to my immense surprise, the first chapter is very funny. I admit, it's not clutching-my-chest, oh-God-I-can't-breathe funny. It's definitely not the moronic Family Guy/Will Farrell style of funny so many people are enamored of these days. But there is a powerful wry wit in Ishmael's voice, and although it's not the main focus of the book, it never entirely disappears.Before you start to doubt my honesty (or sanity) I will confirm most of the dreadful things you have heard about this book. There are entire chapters devoted to obscure aspects of nineteenth century whaling. Depending on your frame of mind, these can be mildly interesting or crushingly dull and obstructing the main story. The narrator occasionally wanders off on some theological/philosophical ramble which, again, can sometimes grow annoying.Despite all of this, I deem this book eminently worth reading. Yes, it is probably the definitive novel of man vs. nature; and yes, it shows the defiance and resilience of the American spirit; and yes, it's a powerful picture of the venomous strength of hubris. But frankly, forget all that, what captured my attention, and what I hope will interest you, is the characters.Melville births an amazing variety of characters in this novel, each of whom lives, breathes and struts across the stage of these pages. Stubb, the second mate, drolly jokes even while shouting orders to a boat crew chasing and stabbing a beast two hundred times their size. Fedallah, the Indian harpooneer of the captain's, gives grimly encouraging prophecies, something like the witches of Macbeth.Even the minor characters gleam with life: the ship's cook scolding the sharks shredding the whale chained to the boat, the carpenter complaining as the peg he crafted for Ahab snaps, the ship-keeper Pip, whose sanity snaps when he's left alone adrift for hours in the endless sea.And of course there's Ahab himself, maniacally pursuing this one creature literally around the entire globe in vengeance for the injuries done him. He is both grand, and, at heart, utterly mad. He shows the best of human resilience and industry and the worst of human hatred and obsession. He hides away in his cabin for much of the story, but when he is present, he utterly dominates the story through sheer force of personality.If you were forced to read this for class, I hope that did not ruin the book for you. If you haven't read it yet, go pick it up now. Yes, there are parts which are plodding drudgery, but the rest of the book more than redeems them.Go whale hunting today."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"This book has the momentum of a cracking whip. The struckture, almost post-modern in its rambling complexity, moves almost sideways as it speeds up and in the last twenty-five pages suddenly snaps in a bonanza of rich, delicious action.Nay-Sayers seem not to appreciate the substance all the slow, informative chapters give to the final actions of Ahab and his crew. I personally love this book."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"hard book but all the more rewarding. the narration in itself is part of the melvilles point. moby dick reads as a organized history and methodology of the whaling industry and is often times drawn out and dull. but this narrations illustrates the point of mans obsession of understanding the universe. ishmael is by no means a definite resource on whaling as is shown by his constant interjections of myth and exaggeration. ishmaels narrations goes on to illustrate man's nature to intertwine emotion with reality, thus proving the futility of understanding the world.the obsessive pursuit of something larger than what men can understand in their finite knowledge is accumulated as the arrogance of ahab. ahab shows us that we are emotional beings who cast aside all rationality for ones personal gratification. it is an allegory of mans futile pursuit of understanding and commanding the world, ultimately, ahab shows us that man cannot escape his arrogance/ignorance.Moby-Dick or, The Whale (Penguin Classics)"},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Simply put, this is a must read. Herman Melville's _Moby Dick_ received largely unfavorable reviews at the time of publication, and it never brought Melville literary acclaim during his lifetime. It was not until critics rediscovered the novel in the 1920s that it began to be viewed as a masterpiece and the apotheosis of the Great American Novel.My own reception of the book, back in my high school days, paralleled its treatment by the literary establishment. While I enjoyed portions of the text, I could not really get into it and actually ended up abandoning the story a few chapters shy of its conclusion. When I later picked it up again, though--out of curiosity rather than necessity--I was hooked. Whether my own maturity or the motive behind reading it were more influential I cannot say, but I suspect that many who find this novel difficult at first will eventually find it a rewarding and noteworthy read.New readers face three key challenges with this text: fears about its length and complexity, discomfort with Melville's loquacious writing style, and confusion over the juxtaposition of plot, factual discourse, and philosophical musings. These are easily overcome if one reads at a comfortable pace and allows oneself to become acquainted with Melville's language, which is at times reminiscent of the learned style employed by authors like Edgar Allen Poe. A wonderful way to understand the nuances of the text and truly \\"get into\\" the novel is to listen to the audiobook version, narrated masterfully by Frank Muller.Reserve this book for a time when you can read it without pressure and expectations. Allow yourself to become immersed in Ishmael's world. Re-read passages that confuse you, and don't be afraid to skip ponderous chapters like \\"Cetology\\" if they will prevent you from completing the novel. Whatever you do, though, be sure this is one story you allow yourself to complete -- you will be rewarded as you do so."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"A magnificent book. It's about so much more than just a whale and a captain. It's an encyclopedia of whaling. The story is told in such beautiful prose that many times I found it hard to believe that an actual person wrote it. The only challenge is the very complex writing structure. I've never seen so many semicolons."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Many of us have studied this book as a supplementary read. The book had been somewhat an adventure but also a serious learning at times. However, what is so good about learning Supplementary reading is using the Language as a tool of thought, the usage of grammar skills and answering tactics.Moby Dick has been one of the great novels in Literature. The story of the hunt for Moby Dick, a fierce white whale supposedly known to sailors. Captain Ahab, the captain of the whaling ship Pequod who lost a leg in an earlier battle with Moby Dick, and is determined to catch the whale. Born of 1st August, 1819,Herman Melville is the author of this brilliant novel that describes the dangerous and often violent life on a whaling ship and contains information the the whaling industry and nature of whales. Moby Dick is a deeply symbolic story. However, often ignored or misunderstood by critics and readers but later on, this American Author was finally recognized as a genius and his reputation spread throughout the world. Many of Herman Melville's works are literary creations of a high order - blending fact, fiction, adventure and subtle symbolism. Melville's wealth of personal experience in far away places was remarkable even in the footloose and exploring world of the 1800s. He brought vivid imagination, philosophy and American English touch.Pip the Sailor had ever been my fav and so, when it comes to seas and ships or the like - ever it's adventure and no wonder, Moby Dick is a good read.- ilaxi patelJaws (Widescreen Anniversary Collector's Edition)(A fav pick)"},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Just a brief comment - Melville's book was based at least in part on an actual event. The incident occurred off the coast of South America in the South Atlantic. A sperm whale attacked a whaling ship out of New England and sunk it. The actual story was far more horrible than Melville's tale as cannibalism occurred among the survivors of the wreck."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"This is tough novel: big, confusing, it leaves you wanting to re-read it.If you wanted to know the difference in structure (as opposed to scale) between a short story and a novel, Moby-Dick (or, The Whale) is probably the as good an exemplar one would find of the novel form. Where a short story focuses on a single event, action, or mood, a novel tends to take the air a bit more -- perambulate, follow its own muse, wander. And wander Moby Dick does. It goes and goes and goes. Melville wrote that he had written a wicked novel. I wonder if that is perceptible to a 21st century sensibility. Melville knows that he's depicting characters who have abandoned critical parts of their pasts, their society, and their souls, parts that many of us today no longer recognize, let alone miss. He strolls through various modernisms: pantheism, Kantianism, indifferentism, relativism, pessimism, Romanticism. Ahab -- what to make of him: sacrilegious, demonic, monomaniac, striving. A shadow of Christian belief, of Calvinism, no longer sufficiently vital to bring salvation, but more than adequate to reinforce notions of depravity and condemnation, hangs over the novel.On a lighter note, Moby-Dick will give you a new appreciation for Star Trek. The episodic nature of the novel makes possible a bunch of self-contained mini-plots, each of which could be spun into its own little story. There's the encounter with a ship that has been taken over by a charismatic preacher and his converted followers. There's a ship in search of an abandoned crew, and one that is filled with bon vivants, appropriately named \\"The Bachelor.\\"There's undoubtedly a lot more than I can write about in a tiny review like this. Like a whale, this novel's soul is submerged most of the time, only occasionally spouting or breeching to reveal awesome and fearful sights."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"I bought this as a student. It was a cheap publisher's sell-off so I thought i'd give it a try, it being a classic and all...It's not easy. It changes pace and you have to be prepared to change the attitude with which you're reading it as you go. Some of it is adventure, some descriptive and some informative. It has many vignettes of the day-to-day whaling life. Interleaved through it is Ahab's single minded purpose of revenge, and the way it destroys his humanity, but makes him an icon to his crew, if not to his more rational and educated officers.It is so many things. A study of dictatorship. A study of the nobility of humanity educated and 'civilised' or not. A discussion of men supporting each other in a world where there's no other support to be had.And Melville did one more thing. He can lay claim to the best opening line of all time!"},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"I have the first Norton edition--and it is wonderful. It includes Melville's &quot;Reviews and Letters&quot; as well as numerous critical essays. Though at times rather elementary, the footnotes are nonetheless occasionally insightful."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Talk about what \\"a good editor\\" could do is silly where MOBY DICK is concerned. I'm on my fourth reading, but from my first I saw one thing: if you don't like the book page by page, you don't like the book. Reading it for the story is a doomed enterprise, even though the story is very good.The book is like a sermon, and there's a real live sermon in one of its earliest chapters. The preacher of that sermon has a style like Melville's, and his preaching shows the kind of thing Melville is trying to do.Melville's long descriptions of how, for example, a whale's body is beheaded while the whale hangs off the side of a whaling ship, are informative and make moral points all along the way. These may be, as many reviewers say, \\"the hardest parts to get through,\\" but every single page of them is funnier and deeper than any NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC article you ever saw. If you are reading these pages just to \\"get through,\\" you're missing how wonderful a stylist Melville is.Isaac Asimov wrote science-fact articles for twenty years before he turned back to science-fiction. Asimov fans like both his science-fact and his science-fiction books, because Asimov is always the same charming writer. It's the same with Melville. He writes whaling-fact and whaling-fiction, only he does both at the same time. His most factual chapters draw moral lessons, and when in one chapter the narrator and Queequeg assemble to work on the whale's body, that chapter is a story and a documentary all together.The book is about a voyage that is intended to take years, and does. Letters are delivered from one whaling ship to another so old and mildewy that it looks, says Melville, as if death itself had carried them. Is a book that makes a point like that supposed to be fast-moving?If you can't read good non-fiction, you can't read MOBY DICK. For that matter, if you can't read the Bible, which also has a lot of non-fiction in it (and some say equally out of date non-fiction) you can't read MOBY DICK.Take a deep breath. Slow down. Read a page at a time. When you're bored, quit and come back later. You probably know the story already anyway. Find out if you can get to know the book a page at a time."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"-- by that I mean, our 'book of books.' I first read this in college: assigned reading for a course. For once a chore turned into a joy from the first page to the last. I was already an avid reader of plays from Aeschylus to Pinter (and especially O'Neill), and I had read the four Thomas Wolfe novels in high school, so length was not an issue. But how strange and wonderful to plunge into a book that seemed to be novel, epic, tragic poem, divine comedy, and moral philosphy all in one.Melville was a century before his time. I am surprised that Hawthorne wasn't able to do more for him. I wonder if Linclon ever read it; I have not found any evidence that he had, since he was fond of quoting favorite passages of what he had read. I have read this great book three times over the past 40 years, and I still have and treasure the Modern Library Giant with the Grant Wood drawings that now seem so much a part of this greatest fishing story ever told. When all is said and done, it is a story about the one that got away."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Moby Dick is a very deep thoughtful book about life and its choices. Ishmael is the average human and his voyage on the sea is the voyage of life that we all face in our daily existance. His friend Queqeg is the goodness in humans that we all fight to have. Ahab on the other hand is the inate evil that all humans naturally lean towards in life and we have to fight to keep ahead of everyday. Moby is the thing that drives the yearnig to get money or happiness. When Moby crashes into the ship and it starts to sink with all who aren't out hunting is the wakeup call to reality that we all need sometimes that says we are going in the wrong direction and need to choose whats important to us and what's not.

It is more than a mantra. It is more...To those who are willing to accept Melville's invitation into the world of Captain Ahab and the human struggle, the work operates as a masterpiece of masterpieces. Besides the story being a captivating tale of a madman and the now extinct world of whale hunting, the metaphors that lie deep beneath Melville's ocean and spout from the furious blowhole of Moby Dick himself are poetry to make all men weep and contemplate emotion and existence. To those who are willing and able to take Melville's vogage: after you return, you shall never be the same. The novel's literary and poetic merit place it amongst the best books ever written by mankind. Read it, live it, and enjoy this gift."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Herman Melville's &quot;Moby Dick&quot; is a rich, stirring tale of courage, loyalty, revenge and adventure, told with a great deal of irreverence and dark humour. Captain Ahab is one of the most endearing of literary creations, the peg-legged skipper hell-bent on punishing the whale that cost him a limb. The mighty prose shows Melville to have been deeply influenced by Shakespeare, and in some passages, his love of Shakespeare elevates him to heights of emulation. Never has blank verse resounded more potently in a prose-work!"},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"This book basically has a good plot and climax, but until you get there, OY, all the boredom in the world comvbined under one cover. Good historical background in it but once again, too many details. There is a whole chapter about the captain's hat and about the captain's pipe! This was the second most boring book I have ever read."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"'Already we are boldly launched upon the deep; but soon we shall be lost in its unshored, harborless immensities.'Be warned land lubber! So too, shall you become lost when you make your first 'lowering' into Moby-Dick! Full of grandiose digressions and pages of speculation, finishing Moby-Dick can be like hunting down the White Whale itself! But take heart! Any attempt to penetrate the inscrutable imagination of Herman Melville and plunge into the pinnacle of nineteenth-century American Literature will be time well spent. Consider its American Renaissance context: written in the age of Emerson, Thoreau, Hawthorne, and Poe, Moby-Dick has been read as Melville's critique of the Transcendentalist movement. In one fascinating passage, Ishmael describes the time spent by a 'young Platonist' whale-watching up in the mast-head: 'lulled into such an opium-like listlessness of vacant, unconscious reverie... at last he loses his identity; takes the mystic ocean at his feet for the visible image of that deep, blue, bottomless soul, pervading mankind and nature... .' Sounds like Emerson's 'transparent eyeball.'All well and good, yet, as a harpooner notes, he hasn't raised [spotted] a single whale!Or consider the exquisite peculiarities of the Pequod and 'her' crew. There are no females on board. Are any feminine aspects then, more forcefully present for their absence? Yet, culturally, the ship contains a vast array of nationalities. Melville's own time spent on South sea islands surely plays into his inclusive view of foreign tribes. Ishmael and Queequeg's relationship demonstrates just such a view. Ishmael quips, 'I'd rather sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian.' Later he states, 'to landsman in general, the native inhabitants of the seas have ever been regarded with emotions unspeakably unsocial and repelling; though we know the sea to be an everlasting terra incognita, so that Colombus sailed over numberless unknown worlds to discover his one superficial one.'Clearly, the cultural explorations allowed by this novel are vast.Lastly, consider that Moby-Dick is what many critics call an encyclopedic novel--meaning that it attempts, in its own obscure way, to contain everything, in some form or another, between its covers. Incredible ahead of its time, Moby-Dick points forward to behemoth works such as Ulysses and Gravity's Rainbow, to name only a couple. Of course, the encyclopedic novel, like Moby-Dick, is long and daunting. But do not depair! It takes many 'lowerings' to fully appreciate the brilliance of this novel. In the meantime, savor the Shakespearian prose as it drips off your tongue like honey! Revel in the breakneck speed of the final chase! See for yourself why it's so hard to believe that Moby-Dick is an almost forgotten text, rediscovered in the 1920's in an attic. Remember: 'in a matter like this, subtlety appeals to subtlety, and without imagination no man [or woman] can follow another into these halls.'"},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"I first read Moby Dick in high school.

The ship is commanded by Ahab who is determined to kill Moby Dick, the whale that took away one of his legs. This book picks up momentum as you getter farther into it, building up anticipation until it is almost too much to tolerate. This book is well written and is one that I would recommend."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"This book moves along at a pretty slow pace but at the same time manages to keep you stuck to the pages somehow. If you've got the time and the vocabulary then i suggest picking up this classic novel."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"I thought Moby Dick was a great novel, and I liked Herman Melville's style of writing. The overall plot is great. The book starts out with a very famous line,\\" Call me Ishmael\\" read by the main character of the book, Ishmael. He is the narrorator of the novel and I think he is a very interesting guy to read about. He is a sailor who has sailed a lot, but never on a whaling ship. Then he stays at a whaler's inn, and rooms with a harpooner from the south pacific named Queequeg. He was my favorite character in the book. He is covered in tattoos and has strange habits and rituals. When they first meet, Queequeg is very hostile, infact the first words he says to Ishmael are \\"Who-ee debil you?\\" \\"Speak-ee, or dam-me, I kill-ee!\\" when he doesn't know that Ishmael is sleeping in his hotel room. But through out the novel Ishmael gets to know him, and learns that Queequeg is a very nice guy and they become very close friends when they decide to look for work on the same whaling ship. There are many other character in the novel, especially when they go out to sea, on the Pequod ship. That is the whaling ship they join, led by captain Ahab. He is the ship captain; he lost his leg on his last journey to sea, in a situation with a sperm whale. His peg leg that he uses to stand on is made from the bone of a whales jaw. He explains with saying \\" Aye, it was that cursed White Whale who gave me this dead stump I stand on now. And I'll chase him round the Cape of Good Hope and round Cape Horn and round the flames of Hell before I give up. And this is what ye have shipped for, men, to chase that White Whale over all sides of the earth until he spouts black blood and rolls over! What say ye, men? Are ye brave enough to join hands in it now?\\" This speech gets everyone on the ship pumped up and ready to kill the whale. The rest of the book is great, they hunt the white whale with many turns and subplots.

All though I had to high of expectations for the book, which made me not enjoy it as well as I thought I would. All though the sensational job of Keir Dullen the narrorator made me feel that I was on the ship, and that I was actually along side Captain Ahabs hunting the white whale. Through out the whole book captain Ahab's and his crew is in search of Moby Dick the white whale. They travel half way around the ocean in search of him and hopefully can hunt and kill him. All though you don't actually read about Moby Dick being seen in the book till the end which emphasizes his presence a lot more and make's it more interesting to read, and also more exciting."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Aside from a lengthy digression on whale types, this is epic novel writing at its very best. The real theme here is that of obsession and how it can destroy people. The bitter Captain Ahab is a tragic Shakespearean character who instead of destroying the great whale, he self-destructs due to his blind obsessional pursuit. Despite being of prodigious length, the book is well-paced and moves along nicely except for the odd insertion mentioned above. More than 150 years since its first publication, this work is as alive and entertaining to readers now as it was then. Few works truly deserve the label 'classic', however this is one....Call me f____n' Ishmael!"},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Why review Moby Dick? Hasn't enough been said?If you've not read this novel yet, then obviously not. Don't miss it.The average reader today will be put off by what seems to be a laborious 19th Century style. Long words are assembled into long sentences, there's not always a lot of dialogue, and not a single glib pop culture reference. Surely a dated work.Here are a few secrets -- you won't find these heavily discussed -- to help you read this novel:1) It's the first modernist work. Yes, though it looks old-fashioned, \\"Moby Dick\\" is anything but. The whole novel is conscious of the fact that it's a novel -- Melville assembles bits of other works (real or imagined) and plays with form in a way we normally think of as the contribution of later writers.2) It's got rhythm. The book moves from action piece to digression back to action in a regular pattern. The tempo of the novel itself suggests the motion of a ship on the sea. So when you're reading one of the long digressive passages, remember that it's just there to rest you up.3) It's funny. Why doesn't anyone mention this? It's true the book concerns some serious themes -- it's not just a whaling novel -- but Melville has a sense of humor. The whole of the novel is over the top with solemnity and scholarliness. If you think he's entirely serious, you're being far too literal minded.So take your time, don't be put off. Melville has an odd style, but once you recognize that it's deliberate, you'll see he has a sense of playfulness. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"One thing that is rarely mentioned about this book is the capicity it has to make one laugh. The humor is just so profound, I think I must read it again to recapture an example. Also, some of the chapters are very short, and thus it makes excellent nightstand reading.

This book is awesome, but I recomend that you get the abridged version if reading is just an extra end-of-the-day-right-before-I-pass-out-from-exhaustion activity. I gave it four stars because, while the style of the writing is unique and very interesting, and the storyline is the cooooolest, there were times when I felt my mind beginning to wander. There were a couple of times where I just had to put the book down and go do something else. I think it was because this book was written in the mid 1800s, and the way they spoke back then was just odd, with all the &quot;Ye land lubbers&quot; and &quot;Avast ye maties.&quot; If you despise the old English way of speaking that is used by the Nantucketers (there are thousands of them in this book, they're everywhere) then I suggest you read the Cliffs Notes and get the jist."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"When you read the book you'll find passages that are so perfectly written they easily rival shakespeare in their power. The book is like a poem in so many ways...it is very poetic...I did a critical review on Ahab, about what the main critics thought about him, and that gave me an even more greater respect for Melville. Ahab is an incrediable character---possibly the greatest and most complex in literature. He fights against fate and/or God.....he wants to assert himself--he wants to be in control...instead of being a thing or object, he wants to be in control...and so he trys to trump himself as a God....His fight to assert himself past his humanity--so he is more then just a man--is seen in everybody. He wishes he were something more then he is. But he keeps having to deal witht the fact that he is mortal...In the end, Ahab is seen really as a tragic hero...a good guy sorta...The reader starts to root for him. No movie can even come close to capturing the power of the book...it is too poetic and philosophical...Melville's ramblings in the middle of the book can seem tedious but add to the book greatly. They give the book so much depth in which to look at it...the world is seen as an ocean...on the ship are the earth's inhabitiants....they all try to figure out the purpose of existence, but with no shore (or landmarks) in sight, they all shoot from the hip, and each one's personnel view about life is as good as someone elses since there is no roadmap (very Hamlet like). Ahab's view of the whale as being the transcendese (sp--who cares) of evil is as good as Starbuck believing the whale is a dumb animal. The Doubloon in my eyes is one of the greatest chapters in the book....Side note: Melville himself said that he had written a &quot;wicked book&quot;---one that shows how life can be seen in so many different ways by different people and be correct, and Melville was a christian...hmmm...he also noted that the theme can be derived from the ship's cooks speech to the sharks.... In summery, one awesome book....SUPER deep and insightfull....reality is questioned thourougly...however, the book seems to indicate, if you stray to far from reality (whatever that is), then you'll fall of a crow's nest and die (you'll understand when you get to that chapter)....."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"I despised this book from beginning to end, this is the most torture I have ever had, and I love to read!

Don't read this book if you don't have to, and if you have to read it..get the cliff notes!"},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Moby Dick is a classic, of course, and for good reason. The story is an exciting one, and the theme is complex. Symbolism abounds, which makes this an excellent book for anyone to study. However, my review does not end there.Had Moby Dick been just a story, I would have enjoyed it. It was not just a story. Instead, half of the book was devoted to educating the reader on whale anatomy and whaling. Frankly, I don't really need or want to know anything about either of these subjects. I could have gotten just as much out of the book if Melville would have briefly explained how the whalemen extracted the oil from the whale, instead of devoting entire chapters to discussing each part of the process.The last three chapters of the book were good, and scattered chapters in the middle were also good. Unfortunately, that is all I can say about what a &quot;great classic&quot; this is. I gave 3 stars for the story-telling sections, but I took away 2 stars for the te! xtbook sections."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Why are school kids tortured with doorstop classics like this? It's no way to spark that love of reading in them, and it's a male-driven book, with rare mentions of women in 600 pages. I read this for my own good pleasure, on my own good time, and with that in mind . . . I loved \\"Moby Dick.\\" This was no torture, but a triumph!Based loosely on actual events from the early 1800s--the sinking of the Essex after being rammed by a whale, and the numerous whaling encounters with a monstrous whale nicknamed \\"Mocha Dick\\"--this classic novel is an epic tale of the sea, of the men who lived and died on ships, and of the leviathans that provided them sustenance and danger. Melville creates a cast of memorable characters, seen through the eyes of Ishmael. We meet a goodhearted cannibal named Queequeg, a driven and vengeful captain named Ahab, his shadow named Fedallah, and the voice of reason named Starbuck. These men and many others take sail on the Pequod, a sturdy whaleship, and roam from Nantucket across the world's vast oceans. The further they go, the more they realize they are at the whims of Captain Ahab, who wants not just any whale, but specifically Moby Dick, the huge white whale that cost him his leg in a previous misadventure.Melville does a great job of transporting us to the mid-1800s, into the lives of memorable and colorful men, and onto a ship with all its gory whaling work. His chapters on whales and the art of whaling are nearly encyclopedic, but if read leisurely, they can be very entertaining and educational. This world of whaling becomes fantastical, almost larger-than-life, and I was enthralled. Along the journey, the Pequod encounters other ships as well, and we feel that the noose is slowly tightening as the whalers hunt down their near-mythical prey. Yes, Ahab and his men go whale hunting in small boats quite a few times, giving some high-seas drama throughout, but it's the final confrontation with the great whale that provides the best suspense.This book is pretentious and overwrought at times, but it is filled with so much life, with bits of humor and comedic hyperbole, with amazing descriptions of the sea and sky, and with keen insights into human nature. As it spreads its sails in the gusting wind, it filled me with wonder and bracing sea-salt air. It wowed me with passages of allegorical depth. I savored it a long month, and when it was over, I felt gorged on one of the richest literary feasts I've ever experienced. This is truly an epic tale, and a great look back at some of our country's history."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Herman Melville dedicated \\"Moby Dick\\" his 1850 epic masterpiece to his good friend Nathaniel Hawthorne. Like that Salem sage, Sailor Melville was a man of dark brooding genius. Both of these men were opposed to the sanguine philsophy of transcendentalism whose chief exponents were Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau. And as Joseph Conrad explored the dark side of the human heart in \\"The Heart of Darkness\\" so too does Melville takes us to the hell of a demented captain's monomaniacal pursuit of Moby Dick the great white whale.The long 600 page novel is narrated by Ishmael a sailor on the Pequodcaptained by Captain Ahab. As his biblical namesake was a wanderer in the wilderness being forsaken by his father Abraham so to does sailor Ishamael consider himself an orphan abandonded to the winds, storms and high seas of lonely life on a whaler. The Pequod whaling ship is named for a village of Pequod Indians who were massacred by white settlers. Thirty men are aboard the doomed vessel which is symbolic of the thirty states in antebellum America. The novel says Andrew Delbanco, in the introduction to the Penguin edition has many symbolic resonances with the then current political scene. A wigwam is built on deck symbolizing the corruption of Tammany Hall in New York politics. Pip the African-American cabin boy is used as a slave by Ahab reminding readers of the Compromise of 1850 which made the fugitive slave law a reality. Throughout the book we see Melville portraying how humankind wantonly kills animals, descretes nature and practices a survival of the fitness amorality.The Pequod is a microcosm of America and also the world. We see all types of humanity portrayed among its crew from the savage Queequeg to the humorous Stubbs and Flask to the rationalistic first mate Starbuck.Towering over the pages of this monumental work of genius is Captain Ahab. His leg was severed by Moby Dick and he may also be sexually impotent. He is driven to the killing of Moby Dick forsaking his young family and driving his crew in his relentless quest to wreak revenge on the great whale. Who is Ahab? Like the biblical king of that name he worships an idol which in his case is the dream of revenge against Moby Dick. Delblanco points out that he closely resembles Senator John C. Calhoun of South Carolina who was a staunch advocate of chattel slavery and an ardent opponent of Daniel Webster and Henry Clay. Ahab is a devlish fiend of a man whose quarter deck speech in which he enlists the crew to join him in hatred of Moby Dick reminds us of dictators skill at crowd manipulation and oratory from Hitler to Stalin to Saddam Hussein.Moby Dick has been interpreted in countless ways by literary critics. His whiteness may represent the nothingness of nature and the indifference to human suffering seen in a godless universe. Moby Dick stands for any idol we humans worship in our hearts and heads.The vision of life painted by Melville is harsh, bleak and pessimistic. Perhaps by clinging to the coffin of his Indian friend in the epilogue Ishmael is giving us some hope for resurrection. Pick your own interpretation.Moby Dick contains many chapters dealing with the life and anatomy of whales, life on a whaling boat, the tools used in the whaling industry and other materials which may bore the reader. I, however, found these chapters fascinating as Melville opens our eyes to this vanished way of life.It is hard to believe the book was published so long ago! In it you will find existentialistic despair, poetry, song, psychological plunging into the depths of the human soul as well as Melville's thoughts on various subjects and ways to view life.\\"Moby Dick\\" is a big shaggy dog novel which may well be the best novel ever written by an American. No one aspiring to be a literate reader should refrain from devoting the time and energy required to complete it. Herman Melville deserves our respect and appreciation for inviting us to voyage across the seas with him and mad Ahab!"},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"This great American novel of the 19th Century, like some of the great novels of the 20th Century, is at times unreadable. Long riffs about whale biology and whale trivia made me put down this book when I tried to read it many years ago. I got through it this time, with the help of Frank Muller's classic reading on audiotape. Don't bother with anyone else's reading -- go to the library and check out Muller's version. He is one of the top readers and does justice to the poetry and great language of this novel.The book is not told in the way we would find conventional today -- a fast paced narration of the adventures of men at sea. Melville clearly wants to tell the tale in the epic style. He writes in very short chapters that resemble Biblical passages, both in the poetic use of language and in addressing the most elemental themes of good vs. evil, man vs. nature, and the human condition. In the end, even the whale trivia serves the epic purpose in driving home the extraordinary courage and heroism of these whalers.I don't buy the idea that Moby Dick, malevolent as he is, somehow represents evil. The sometimes destructive and overwhelming force of nature is more likely the right allegorical symbol. Evil for me is Ahab, given the truly heartless choices he makes in his obsession for the White Whale -- and given what happens to a man after 40 years at sea.The most attractive characters are Ishmael and Queequeg, Ishmael's cannibal friend. Each demonstrates the best quailities of human nature --companionship, courage, acceptance of their lot in life. Given the racial turmoil of the 1850s, Melville may have been making a political point by portraying the nobility of the dark-skinned. I don't buy the idea that the allegory was any more elaborate than that, though it's clear to me that the novel is a gold mine for all sorts of Ph.D. thesis topics.In the end, I do think that the great themes explored by Melville are more effectively explored less allegorically and more through character development and moral choices. For that reason, I'd say that Huckleberry Finn is the true Great American Novel of the 19th century and that the great Russian contemploraries of Melville wrote better books. But this certainly is a classic work worth the effort."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"The strangeness is what makes Moby-Dick so exceptional and an indisputable classic. It was quite a difficult and long read, but upon completion, it was, without a doubt, completely and utterly worthwhile. The characters were some of the most unique in all of fiction and each of them is leaves their mark."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Moby Dick, by Herman Melville, is a four star book.I gave Moby Dick a four star rating for its eciting and adventurous plot. Its a quest for revenge on the dreaded white whale, Moby Dick. The book gives details about what it is like on a whaling ship, like how they hose down the barrels of oil. The conditions and why certain things are done to keep the cargo safe are described perfectly. The way Herman describes how they hunt the whale down and how the whale is killed is grueling but true. When they make the oil come out of the whale's body is described some horrifying, disgusting way. With a few sudden twist in events, Moby Dick is a book anyone can read.Ishmael is a young school teacher who is seeking adventure out on the ocean. When he meets an cannibal indian at a local inn named Queequee, they become the best of friends. They now are going to sign up on a whaling ship in Nantucket called the Pequed, whose captain is the mysterious captain Ahab. Altough the crew knows many things about whaling, trouble still finds them. Through te sea they meet other ship who have fought the white whale. It all comes down to this, a duel between Ahab and Moby Dick. Who will win? Read this exciting book and see.Other tittles I reccomend are The Adventures of Tom Sawyer & The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. I am a seventh grader at Harris Road Middle School."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"This University of California edition of Melville's classic is the one to own, if only for the beautiful woodcuts by Barry Moser interspersed every few pages throughout the text. The typeface is a beautiful retro font. No scenes from the novel are illustrated; just depictions of Melville's detailed cetological descriptions, nautical terms and objects, and whaling processes."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Already, some 100+ other readers have reviewed this book, and I can't hope to add much of substance. I would like to say, though, that we have lost something. To engage this book, you need to be able to still yourself, to get beyond this ever-growing need to be &quot;entertained&quot; constantly with immediate, easily consumable forms. Written in this day and age, I suspect Melville would be accused of gross self-indulgence at the expense of the reader; that is a sad commentary about what type of readers we have become.Melville writes a small chapter just on &quot;the whiteness of the whale,&quot; whereas even a string of adjectives in any modern literature is often seen as needless.But, the writing, in the end, is the opposite of self-indulgent. Melville gives, to anyone who can quiet themselves enough to recieve it, a huge gift. To be sure, the vision given is harrowing and dark, but for this reader at least, it also deepens the experience of life itself and what it means to be a self-conscious skin of bark floating on Being itself."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"It took me a month to work my way through the Blackstone Audio Books unabridged version of Moby Dick, and I thoroughly enjoyed the voyage. The narrator did an outstanding job of using distinctive voices for a whole host of characters (though I did get confused between mates Stubb and Flask).The complaint most often lodged against &quot;Moby Dick&quot; is that the narrative wanders, with long digressions into philosophy, attempts to categorize whales, and the like. Here, the audio format shines--you can listen intently, or fall into a somewhat distracted brown study, much as Melville must have during his time on a whaler. When there is action, though, Melville is riveting enough to keep you listening, even with the week's groceries doing a meltdown in the back seat."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Well, it took me 3 tries and 32 years of livin' to finish off this Whale of a Tale (couldn't resist that)... really, if questions of Fate, God, Good &amp; Evil, etc. hold no interest for you, then you'd better be pretty darned interested in the 19th C. whaling trade. What's the hurry, put it aside, and try again in a decade or so, it'll be waiting.I read it on the subway! It's perfect for that, since the chapters are short, and the actual plot is thread-thin...As dense with stuff as the Bible, as filled with symbolism (which, if it doesn't clobber you over the head, then just keep goin', I probably missed half of it, and this sort of thing is purely subjective).Also may I suggest &quot;Narratives of the Wreck of the Whale-Ship Essex&quot;, where Melville copped the plot: nowhere near as profound, but a shocking collection of vintage memoirs of the ship that was actually &quot;Stove by a Whale&quot;, as they said in those days. Worth it for the last sentence alone, which is profound... (tease!), it enhanced my Moby experience considerably..."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"I would like to believe that Melville was years (maybe centuries) ahead of his time, but more than likely he was just plain nuts, apparently stalking Hawthorne and who knows what else. This shouldn't stop you from enjoying the fun though! In MD we basically have two ideas going on, with Ahab's whole monomaniac pursuit of the whale bookending hundreds of pages that essentially capture Ishmael's (sun)baked thoughts during his three years or so on board the Pequid. This middle section will either bore and repel the reader, or suck them in, resembling some post modern-ish films like Satyricon, or perhaps the writings of some lost beat author. This middle section is a detailed narrative of every thought that strikes Ishmael's mind as he is immersed in what must be a remarkably dull setting. So instead, his mind wanders, seeing analogies in every bit of rope and whale tissue to the relationship between man and God, man and nature, man in society, etc. The idea is so absurd and executed so bombastically that it works. Had the man he dedicated this book to (Nathaniel Hawthorne) wrote MD instead, it would have been awful, but Melville can write about Ahab's pipe with enthusiasm, and put that very same pipe into a mythic perspective! Of the outer story, what is there left to say? Only an American author could take the standard tragedy of man bested by the fates and turn it into man bested by the fates/decides to hunt down and kill God! An absolutely fantastic and unforgettable book, but I would have enjoyed more ramblings from Ishmael. I'm serious!!!"},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"At last! I have finished my journey with the Pequod! I actually enjoyed this book, whereas other people in my class did not or did not read at all. I liked this book!"},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Moby Dick is not an adventure story - it is an allegory of the human condition amidst the setting of the whaling profession. Mankind's varied quest for greed, lust, longing, vengeance and fulfillment. Moby Dick is all of these human yearnings and more in one book. If you want an adventure story there are other books out there that will quench your thirst, but if you approach Moby Dick the same as most unwilling High School students do. You won't even get a 100 pages into it and will become disillusioned and discouraged because it wasn't quite the adventure story you were hoping for and the end result, You Will Never Finish It! Leave your expectations behind. Moby Dick is great Literature! But it isn't the formulaic rhythm we find in today's bestsellers. In fact in 1851 it wasn't the normal piece of literature people EXPECTED it to be. Cast aside these expectations, and take your time. This will not be a quick read. If it takes you a couple of months or a year, stay with it. In fact read other books while reading Moby Dick. Like I mentioned before, it is not a quick read, it will be one you savor and slowly digest. Think of a glass of fine Cabernet. You sip that glass, you don't gulp it. Just keep reminding yourself when you come to certain parts of the book that doesn't seem to have anything to do with the overall narrative thread of the story that Moby Dick is an allegory of the human condition of greed, lust, longing and vengeance. This piece of literature is an overall experience that will linger with you for years to come - if you allow it to do so."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Perhaps the greatest story I have ever read. The characters come to life and seem to jump right off the page. A must read for anyone interested in classic literature."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"When Herman Melville first sat down to write Moby-Dick he had been scorned by many and praised by similar amounts for his outlandish texts Typee and Omoo. Both were decidedly anti-Christian and what seemed to be pro-cannibalism. A weaker mind, a lesser person, might have turned tail at such notions and collapsed into himself, but not Melville. Instead, he wrote a tour de force book that has become increasingly popular (unfortunately for Melville since this occurred after he left the physical world) as the years progressed. At first, the novel was hardly a hit, but after his death a revival took place that has continued up until the present day. This book, the Norton Critical Edition, is a perfect gem for those of us that wish to know more about Melville, his life, his past works, and the critical analysis of the text.Most already know the story of Captain Ahab and his obsession with revenge upon the White Whale, the infamous Moby-Dick, and how Ishmael, along with the rest of the crew, get snatched up into Ahab's whirlwind, monomaniac obsession with combating and destroying this one-of-a-kind beast. The story itself could be condensed down into a much smaller text, but Melville's own obsession with the giants of the deep along with his passion for sailing shines through in long winded chapters describing details that the common reader may not care to know. That being said, it is often a difficult read because of the way it is structured, along with the Shakespearean language and heavy handed motifs. However, the darkness, the depth, the absolute diabolical complexity of the story consumes the reader and draws them along just as inexhaustibly as the Pequod under Ahab's ruling thumb.The novel is an absolute gold mine for critical analysis. It can range from the forces of nature vs. mankind, the expansion of technology upon nature, the terrors of obsession, the heathenism of reality vs. that of cannibals, perhaps the conflict between rationality and obsession, Christianity and the Devil, etc. Well beyond his time, Melville provides the future world with an intellectual cacophony of thought not yet met in American literature during his time on earth. It could be argued that he put American literature on the map for the rest of the world (especially the British juggernauts) and defined the literature that would proceed in the following years once the world caught up to Melville's way of thinking and courageous action of putting it down in typeface."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Such a boring book. I learned things about whales that I didn't want to know. Finished it, and was glad that Moby Dick won!!!"},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"I hadn't read Moby Dick since college, many years ago. Sitting on a plane in August, I glanced over at the book in my seat mate's hand. He also was reading Moby Dick! What are the chances of such a thing happening: two individuals, one in his twenties, one in her seventies, each reading for pleasure a book published long ago?Although there are long passages of the book with more detail than I perhaps wanted to plow through, the characters are marvelously drawn, the plot is famously wonderful, and there is even a good bit of humor. Moby Dick is still a great read."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"What worthwhile thing can be said about Melville's \\"Moby-Dick\\" that hasn't been said before? Some love every ounce and letter of the novel, down to the last tackle, harpoon, and halyard; others could do without the lengthy elaborations on whaling's intricacies contained within the intervening quarter of the book. Some may feel put off by Melville's literary mannerisms; others may consider him on par with the greatest literary minds of the English language, citing men such as Shakespeare as the only real comparison. Regardless of either of these opinions, one thing is certain to anyone who truly delves into the matter: taken by itself, Melville's \\"Moby-Dick\\" is without question the greatest American novel, and one of the greatest works of fiction ever penned. An ambitious claim for a book? Yes. An unmerited one with respect to \\"Moby-Dick\\"? No, and without a shadow of a doubt.To begin with, take the style of \\"Moby-Dick.\\" A prose so descriptive and bursting with meaning that, indeed, we have to look to the other masters of the English language to find comparison. Melville's ability to devote an entire chapter to explaining the symbolic meaning of the \\"whitish color\\" of a whale while managing to both pull it off beautifully and weave it seamlessly into the story is a meritorious achievement in and of itself. Indeed, those who talk of F. Scott Fitzgerald's color symbolism in \\"The Great Gatsby\\" as being without parallel should take a closer look at \\"Moby-Dick,\\" specifically observing what Melville does with the simple color white. Sure, it's \\"white,\\" a color which most people, if questioned, would arbitrarily assign the symbolism of \\"purity,\\" but when taken into the hands of Melville and woven into the tapestry of \\"Moby-Dick,\\" it becomes something altogether more mysterious, menacing, ancient, and spiritual. Melville's language gives the novel a grand stage, making the story (and I know thousands of others have said this before me) more than a simple fight between a man and nature; it is Melville's superlative language which gives his story many faces, making it broadly relevant. Indeed, it is this broad relevance which, among other things, gives the expertly written whaling-oriented \\"middle chapters\\" of the book their hidden meaning, and makes them necessary to understanding the rest of the novel. However, even without this extra aspect, the middle \\"whaling\\" chapters are so beautifully written that they are a treasure unto themselves.But there is so much more on so many more levels in this novel. Only in the setting of \\"Moby-Dick\\" can passages like Captain Ahab's perennial exhortation to \\"strike through the mask\\" in the great struggle of life reach their full realization and achievement. This is perhaps the greatest thing about this great novel; just when you believe you've found the hidden meaning, just when you think you have a particular passage sorted out, a new interpretation, a new facet of understanding, will occur to you, and force you to consider the novel under an entirely new light. This is the same reason why \\"Moby-Dick\\" both remains relevant and stays relevant; it is so multifaceted and so adaptable to the human condition that its near universal interest and usefulness are virtually endless; it can be applied to any subject and can be used to make any point. In effect, \\"Moby-Dick\\" itself is like a great ocean with an inscrutable whale swimming in it: its every aspect is filled to the brim with manifest meaning and important commentaries on life, which can be duly observed, noted, and utilized, but it will always carry an indecipherable air of mystery, transforming to deliver each of its messages with the same force, but also with the same strange combination of direct meaning and vagueness. It is such a great literary masterpiece, and such an important contribution to the Western canon that everyone should read it at least once. And, on top of all of that, it's an extremely engaging and dramatic adventure story. You will be guided through a literary journey of such brilliance, beauty, sublimity, and yes, action, that you will never look at life the same way again; you will not be disappointed by Melville's \\"Moby-Dick.\\" It is a work with a multifarious and profound meaning which also manages to be the all around perfect adventure story. Now that is the mark of a true and enduring classic.***I appreciate my Barnes & Noble Classics edition very much (although many feel the Norton Critical Edition to be the best; I can't opine on that, as I don't own it). The Barnes & Noble Edition is packed with interesting commentary, historical notes, a helpful dictionary of sea terms, the thoughts of contemporaries, and a great introduction, all of which helped me in my first reading of \\"Moby-Dick\\" and enhanced the novel's self evident beauty and importance.***"},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"It's great to have this classic in digital form.

It was consider being one of his best books he ever wrote. Moby Dick is a book about revenge. Better yet, it is a book that shows that revenge can and most of the time will come back to haunt you. This theme of the book kind of goes back to a quote from animal farm, \\"Absolute power corrupts absolutely\\" This quote can be tide with the theme of revenge in Moby Dick. Revenge and Absolute power is an idea that never comes true. Absolute power and revenge never come true, because as soon as you think you reach them or the point that is best; it all comes crashing down. Like in animal farm, Napoleon tried to reach the point of having absolute power, but every time he thought he had it, he had to do something, or something had to happen which would keep him from reaching it. An example would be that he had to keep wrecking the windmill to keep that animals busy, so they would not question him. Another example is that even though Napoleon had the dogs, someone, or in this case an animal, had seen, heard or thought something that they did not like or were curious about, dealing with Napoleon.

Ishmael goes to a whale inn because he wants to go on a whaling trip. He gets stuck in the same bed as a strange, cannabalistic-tatooed man named Queequeg.

Unless your life goal is to go to Borneo college and study squid fishing, or you love to spend every weekend fishing so you can study the fishes every movement and physiognomy, then you'd love this book.It's got everything you'd ever want to know about whales. Their skin, face, blubber, signifigance in history, classification of whales (whole chapter dedicated to it), symbolism of their whiteness, etc. If you're not into that,you should read the book for the fun of looking up biblical references of which are many.There are a few good points to the book. (1)It makes you feel like you are really part of the whaling crew with it's through chapters on things whale related.(2)It feels very realistic (3) There's so much symbolism and analyzing. (4) it has atmosphere that humans are insignifigant to God, nature, and greater powers and make you feel like there's more out there.But if you want to appreciate this book, I suggest that you take your time reading it. To me it's one of those books that's completely over rated just because it's a classic. There's no real interest for people who don't like to analyze books and write term papers on the symbolism of it all.

I was expecting a novel of tremendous stature to justify its legendary reputation. However the story drags on and on. Worse, it seems that Melville is so in love with the whaling industry that he feels compelled to give the reader a lesson on whale anatomy, the different types of whales and the differing types of blubber they produce. Interesting? Not for me.Most surprisingly, I found the story to get boring once they went to sea. At the beginning, while at port, I found the characterisations and the discussion about the whaling communities to be interesting.Bottom line: I can't understand how anyone could like this novel. It was a PAINFUL read."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Before reading \\"Moby Dick\\" I considered \\"War and Peace\\" the worst book I had ever read, but compared to \\"Moby Dick\\" \\"War and Peace\\" is a light, fun read where your eyes just fly across the page. It's almost impossible to acurately descibe how bad of a book \\"Moby Dick\\" is. First of all, classiflying it as fiction is a mistake. Probably a good 60% of the book is non-fiction - chapter after chapter dedicated to every imaginable detail of the biology of the whale and every imaginable nuance of whaling. These non-fiction chapters are made all the more unbearable by the style of writing, which is so pretentious, poetic and over the top that at times it actually made me laugh out loud. Almost every sentence is 100 words long with 10 commas. And the over the top writing is not confined to the book's non-fiction chapters, it's just the opposite - it gets even worse when Melville switches over to the fiction. Especially in the many and endless soliloquies. The ridiculous writing style completely crushes any chance the book might have had of actually telling a story. Finishing the entire book is something that I'm proud of myself for having done, which is never the mark of a good read. I would suggest that unless a person wants to torture themself, read something else. Although I do think there is some value in setting your mind to reading the worst book ever written from cover to cover, and acomplishing that goal.

When I think of anyone being FORCED to read this novel (poor students, whereever you are) I want to fall on a harpoon. Ray Bradbury, who wrote the screenplay for this novel, (a la Gregory Peck) couldn't even finish the damn thing! He too just read bits of it, and gleaned the importance thereby. He recognized it's inner greatness, its actual grandeur absolutely mired in prose that makes you want to gnaw your foot off...or feed it to Queqaig (sp?).

Based on what I have read, except for Billy Bud, I cannot and do not consider Melville an author of classic literature. Granted, Typee and Omoo were apparantly at the time condisered travelogs. I hope so because there really isn't much story in either of them. 98% of what Melville writes in any of these stories is purely descriptive, describing how natives lived, what an island looked like, what parts of a ship are for, on and on and on. For example, if there is a legitimate need to mention a particular type of sail or mast on a ship, he will then take the next 10 pages describing what all the other sails and masts on the ship are for, even if they have nothing to do with the story. Boring, boring, boring!!! If Moby Dick had been written as a short story, as was Billy Budd, it could have been a masterpiece. As a novel, however, I was so irritated with all of the unnecessary, page-filling blabber that I considered it a total failure. In fact, I was so disgusted and wanted to be done with it that I almost missed the most important part, the climactic scene with the whale. I know that Melville has written many truly short stories and, in the interest of fairness, I will probalby some day give them a read.

I had the misfortune of listening to it as a book on tape, and let me tell you, of the 27 hours of narration, I would estimate that only 4 deal directly with Character or Plot.The rest of it is a grab-bag of whaling industry history, exacting description of whaling technology, inexact biology and philosophical musings that wander far, far afield. After reading Mark Twain's hilarious dissection of \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\", I can only imagine what he would do with \\"Moby Dick\\".The London Literary Gazette, December 6 1851, review of the newly published Moby Dick sums up my feelings:\\"This is an odd book, professing to be a novel; wantonly eccentric; outrageously bombastic; in places charmingly and vividly descriptive. The author has read up laboriously to make a show of cetalogical learning.... Herman Melville is wise in this sort of wisdom. He uses it as stuffing to fill out his skeleton story. Bad stuffing it makes, serving only to try the patience of his readers, and to tempt them to wish both him and his whales at the bottom of an unfathomable sea....The story of this novel scarcely deserves the name.... Mr. Melville cannot do without savages so he makes half of his dramatis personae wild Indians, Malays, and other untamed humanities.... What the author's original intention in spinning his preposterous yarn was, it is impossible to guess; evidently, when we compare the first and third volumes, it was never carried out....Having said so much that may be interpreted as a censure, it is right that we should add a word of praise where deserved. There are sketches of scenes at sea, of whaling adventures, storms, and ship-life, equal to any we have ever met with....Mr. Herman Melville has earned a deservedly high reputation for his performances in descriptive fiction. He has gathered his own materials, and travelled along fresh and untrodden literary paths, exhibiting powers of no common order, and great originality. The more careful, therefore, should he be to maintain the fame he so rapidly acquired, and not waste his strength on such purposeless and unequal doings as these rambling volumes about spermaceti whales.\\"That was written before the book gained its 20th Century Reputation, one I sadly feel is undeserved."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Moby Dick is a classic....a book that you'd have to have lived in a cave on a remote island for your entire life to have not at least heard the name of.The book has sat on my bookshelf, as part of a series of classic novels I had been given, for some time now.

There was much question of what would happen to the United States and Herman Melville wrote his prophecy of the it through this book. His thoughts of what would happen to the US were all hidden as different characters and events in the story. For example: Captain Ahab could have represented the Radical Abolitionists trying to demolish slavery, which was represented by Moby Dick, the great white whale.

What does it do? Why, it tells you how to gain happiness and eternal fulfillment, and illustrates the consequences of those who follow those rules. Yes, it examines the state of those who disobey, but its focus is on the reward for action.Now look at Moby Dick. What does it do? Why, it tells you how to destroy your life. Page by excruciating page, it dissects and exposes the annihilation of Captain Ahab, a man destroyed not by a whale, but by his own consuming hatred and obsession for revenging himself upon his perceived &quot;enemy&quot;. The final state of Ahab is no surprise; indeed, with his carcass lashed to the monster, Ahab merely assumes in reality the position he had occupied already for years.Horrific and powerful. If the Bible doesn't convince you to return good for evil because it's the godly thing to do, perhaps Moby Dick will persuade you to abandon your revenge fantasies out of simple self-preservation.PS For those who throw hissy fits over Melville's classification of whales as &quot;fish&quot; -- get over it. The book is not a scientific treatise, and in any case the specific definitions of &quot;fish&quot; and &quot;mammal&quot; weren't well-established or recognized when Melville published the book. So, using the definition of the time of &quot;fish&quot; as &quot;sea animal&quot;, Melville was correct. Your criticism is anachronistic"},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Moby-Dick may be American literature's most famous work; only The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn even rivals it. It is the kind of book with such a reputation that it is impossible to read without a host of preconceived ideas. One need not even care about it, much less have read it, to know the outline and perhaps much more. Many judge it before reading, if they ever read it, based on what they know - or think they know. This inevitably carries over to reading, often making a self-fulfilling prophecy. Though perhaps inevitable, this is unfortunate, as it prevents nearly everyone from reading critically and seeing it on its own terms; since it has been called a masterpiece so long, most feel compelled - perhaps even subconsciously - to agree, regardless of what they really think. Its near-unquestioned status is in large part a corrective reaction to the contempt in which it was held for the first seventy or so years, but the pendulum has swung too far the other way. Moby-Dick is good, arguably even great, but does not belong with literature's best works. As nearly always with extremes, the truth resides between its superlative current and former wretched state, and it is easy to see how both arose. Another reviewer notes that the consensus about Herman Melville is that he was a flawed genius, and so it is with this. If anyone ever needed an editor, it was Melville. Moby has moments of true greatness comparable to literature's greatest heights and at least as many moments that are superfluous and borderline plodding. The book has the potential to be truly great and perhaps would have been if trimmed somewhat. Melville seems to have known this as much as anyone but, like some of the truly sublime writers such as Fyodor Dostoevsky, his genius is simply unimaginable without rough edges. We must take him as he comes, for better or worse. Lack of perfection may bother some, especially those who see what could have been, but most seem willing to take Melville with proverbial warts and all. Everyone should of course read Moby - and practically everyone does who reads literature at all -, but the day when both its strengths and faults are admitted is still not even foreseeable.Moby does many things well. On the simplest level, it is a rollicking sea adventure of the sort that made Melville's name. Anyone who likes the picaresque sea tales in which the nineteenth century was so rich can easily appreciate this. It also has much historical interest. The first part in particular is steeped in contemporary New England life, giving a good idea of how those in the region lived and thought in the early to mid nineteenth century. The rest of course does the same for sailors and particularly whalers; we learn an astonishing amount about ship life's pros and cons. It was very different from shore life and almost literally a self-contained world. This way of life is now gone - was indeed gone to a large extent even at publication due to steam power's rise -, making the historical and cultural value all the greater. Melville also goes to considerable lengths to ensure that we learn much about whales - but more on that later.The book is also important, interesting, and influential on more technical levels. The first person narrative, complete sailing jargon and some distinctly American touches, is an important milestone in the development of a truly American voice. Ishmael's narration is distinct and unusual, a curious mix of erudition and vernacular - often imitated but never equaled. Moby was not popular enough to have the kind of influence that writers like Mark Twain soon had, but it has since become an American classic, influencing untold numbers of American writers and becoming an important part of the country's world canon.Perhaps more notably, Moby can be legitimately seen as both an exemplary realist novel of the kind made famous and immortal in the nineteenth century and as an ambiguous, highly symbolic work that in many ways anticipates Modernism. The former is achieved via narration and a generally documentary-esque style. Much of Moby reads almost like a diary, a near-exhaustively personal account of a whaling expedition and the events leading up to it. We get not only the high points but also detailed descriptions of mundane things like eating and sleeping. The book has a grand, epic sweep and does a very convincing job of vividly and memorably portraying a world unknown to many at the time and to all now. It is almost as if we lived it ourselves, always the mark of great realism. Melville wrote in part because he thought whaling's wonder and excitement of had never been adequately conveyed, and he succeeded so well that further attempts were unnecessary.But the book would be little more than a historical curiosity without the other aspect. Moby is one of those works that nearly everyone agrees is profoundly meaningful though few agree on the meaning. Melville was an inveterate allegory lover, and most of his works are clearly allegorical even if the allegory is not always clear. Moby on the surface seems a great exception, but we must not be fooled. Melville was not just writing an adventure story or a historical romance; Moby is indeed one of the most densely symbolic pre-twentieth century works. The most obvious allusive layer is Biblical. Many characters have Biblical names, and there are several story parallels - some well known, others more obscure. Names often give a clue to the characters and are important in foreshadowing, while parallels serve various functions. The Jonah parallel is the most explicit, even forming a sermon text; one may think Melville pushes this too far, but the point is well made. Many annotated editions are available for those who may miss the references. The most detailed versions will be too much for the average reader, but getting one that at least has basic footnotes is essential in order not to miss what Melville is trying to say.This raises the inevitable question - just what IS he trying to say? I recommend getting an edition that has only brief, explanatory footnotes restricted to facts unless one wants an exhaustive critical edition, because critical approaches are so many and various that it is easy to be overwhelmed - and, more importantly, all should decide for themselves. In my view, Moby-Dick, especially the title whale itself, darkly symbolizes the vast percentage of existence that is not only unknown to mankind but beyond its control. Though not misanthropic, the novel has little faith in amelioration, and the ending shows a very grim view of our ability to make any kind of meaningful change. All human endeavors to conquer the unknown and truly become the masters that we have long thought ourselves seem doomed. Some see the whale as a symbol of evil, but I feel this misses the point. It is not that evil triumphs over good; it is that the vast unknown forces that are immensely more powerful than us - whether we call them luck, fate, chance, or whatever - are forever beyond our reach. I think it is best to think of them as simply neutral or indifferent. We continually strive and alter; they are eternal and unchanging, which is why we cannot gain on them. As all this suggests, there is a large fatalistic streak. This runs counter to the existentialist element dominating later literature and thought, but Melville makes a powerful and dramatic case for a concept that held much sway with nineteenth century writers and thinkers. We should keep it in focus even if we can do little or nothing about it in any case.The biggest reason for Moby's continuing popularity, though, is probably its unforgettable characters. Characterization is not one of Melville's top strengths, but these creations are so picturesque and finely drawn that few can forget them, and many have become archetypes. They are interesting enough to carry almost any book. This is all the more remarkable in that none are really sympathetic, especially in conventional terms; we essentially get a cast of eccentrics who fascinate almost against our will. Ishmael is a memorable narrator but perhaps the least interesting major character. His friend and partner Queequeg is certainly unforgettable, one of American literature's most distinct and evocative characters. One can easily find elements of racism and ethnocentrism in his depiction and he is an important early entry in the dubious American tradition of ethnic sidekicks, but the truly notable thing is the essential sympathy with which he is drawn. He is the most likable character, the most talented and able, and probably the closest to sympathetic. Despite attributes - including cannibalism - that the Western world finds shockingly primitive, his many admirable qualities are on full display, and his multiple advantages over condescending and supposedly far more enlightened Westerners are undeniable. He has the genuine sincerity and selflessness virtually non-existent in the West, and his true friendship with Ishmael is a striking instance of hybridity so rare in an era where American slavery still existed. It is startling to realize just how cosmopolitan ships were in contrast to the lands that sent them, especially considering the remarkable harmony and coalescence. Ishmael at times has a near-sociological view of Queequeg, and though he is not meant as a depiction of any single race or culture, the frequent contrasts between him and all he stands for on the one hand and Western culture on the other are engrossing and often insightful. The discerning will see some of Melville's darkest commentary here as well as some subtle satire.There are many other memorable characters, not least first and second mates Starbuck and Stubb, who show contrary poles of human nature and thought while their antagonism provides some comic relief. Even many minor characters, particularly the preacher and Elijah, are quite vivid and memorable. However, the most legendary and unforgettable is surely Captain Ahab. One of literature's most famous characters, he has been often and variously portrayed and frequently imitated, but the original drawing is still the best. It is curious that he is commonly depicted as thoroughly comic, aloof to the point of absurdity and a target for mocking laughter, because the original is darkly tragic. A brooding, foreboding figure, he is both larger than life and hardly of it - a highly eccentric man driven to obsessive frenzy and ultimate doom by a force he can neither control nor understand but is unable to resist. Ahab is a stunning instance of just how low human nature can sink - literally and figuratively. A warning to all, he shows the folly of letting hubris and ambition overcome the truly meaningful; there comes a point when we must let the unknown remain unknown, lest we end up like him.Then there is Moby-Dick himself. He is mentioned many times over the course of the book, and looms over the whole like a vast but unseen presence, but is only visible very briefly and remains mysterious. This has not stopped him from becoming world famous - indeed, has only added to his mystique. He is deliberately vague, which not only drives Melville's symbolic purpose but also, like the unseen aliens in 2001: A Space Odyssey, makes him more powerful and all-encompassing than he could ever have been otherwise. Melville sketches the outline, and imagination fills in the rest; this works perfectly, as we make him stand for our own fears and repressions. The novel thus successfully accomplishes one of art's rarest and most notable achievements - striking at human nature's dark heart by indirection. Moby-Dick may mean many things to many people, but his dreadfully imposing presence continues to haunt the collective psyche. Here, at least, Melville's artistry could not be bettered.All this is more than enough reason to read the book. It has plenty of conventional qualities to attract and keep a wide variety of readers, encompassing everything from pathos to humor: tragedy, adventure, suspense, history, philosophy, political commentary, and more. Some may be scared off by its fearsome reputation as a long and difficult read, but like much else about the book, this is greatly exaggerated. It is about four hundred and fifty pages long - practically miniscule by nineteenth century standards -, and chapters are very short, which keeps the pace fairly fast and makes for reading ease. The large number of sailing/whaling terms, as well as some regionalisms, can make the reading hard going, as can Melville's style generally. He was an autodidact and self-taught writer, and it shows; his prose is very unusual, full of rare words, unusual phrasing, and occasional rough-and-ready grammar. He was not an easy read even then, and dramatic style changes over the ensuing century and a half have only made him harder. However, as in nearly all such cases, this gets easier as one goes along, becoming almost second nature by the time one is well into the book - especially with footnotes. Those who have read Melville before will also have an easier time, as the prose is more straight-forward than in most of his major works.Yet Moby is far from perfect; indeed, it has faults numerous and significant enough to kill a lesser work. The main problem is sheer inclusiveness; Melville could easily have cut one hundred pages, or even half the total, without losing any actual story and very little else. There are many points where he seems to forget he is writing a novel and goes on long tangents about various whaling aspects. Virtually no dramatization is attempted here; it is almost like reading a textbook. Melville mercifully spreads this throughout rather than throwing all out at once, but it still becomes tedious and sometimes interrupts narrative flow, which is particularly annoying to many. Some devotees treasure these sections, and they are integral in a certain sense - Moby would certainly be a very different book without them -, but most readers will be highly turned off. Many will skip them, which will cost them little, but quite a few may give up altogether. This last is a true shame, not only because they will miss many positive qualities, but also because these sections do have a certain purpose, however overblown. They contribute significantly to the documentary feel and thus to the realism, substantially helping achieve Melville's goal of bringing whaling's ins and outs to the masses. We must also remember that scholarship is one of the book's themes, and the depth and breadth of knowledge is indeed impressive, especially considering that Melville had very little formal education. One can learn quite a bit in addition to the fictional aspects, giving unusual value and appeal. That said, nearly all will agree that some discursions are just too detailed and minutia-focused; only those who truly love the subject could really care for them. We can thankfully never accuse Melville of being didactic, a fatal flaw for most artists, but he can be pedantic. He simply did not know when to stop. Perhaps more importantly, the vast knowledge increase has made much of this outdated and/or inaccurate; some was indeed inaccurate even then. Most glaring are constant references to whales as fish; Ishmael mentions in passing the then relatively new idea that they were mammals and laughs! The fact that some will go away from the book thinking false things severely undercuts its value here, underscoring inclusiveness problems. There are many abridged versions, but it is probably best to read Moby as intended, for better or worse, and decide the merits for ourselves.There are some problems that editing could not fix, namely the abrupt jerk and overly marked contrast between the pre-ship section - about twenty chapters, eighty pages - and the rest. A good example is how Ishmael, despite being narrator and participant, fades into obscurity. The first section is all about him: his thoughts, views, actions, etc.; everything is shown through his eyes. However, as far as I can recall, no one even talks to him on the ship. He has very little interaction with the crew and relates many events, including lengthy full conversations and apparent monologues, without any explanation of how he has the information. Narration also switches to different voices on occasion; this does not come off as deliberate, like the Modernist narrative experiments that it pioneered, so much as if Melville forgot his plan. He seemed to write one book and begin another, tacking the latter on when the former should have been rewritten; the transition is messy and the whole ill-fitting. Most scholars think he drastically changed his plan, and it certainly seems so. The first part gives no idea what to expect from the rest. It is almost a comedy of manners, near-Dickensian at times, with some sharp social observation and more than a little humor. This is a stark contrast not only to the rest but to nearly everything else Melville wrote - interesting enough in itself in this but hardly inherently great. Even taken on its own terms, it is hardly his best writing; there is little art and none of the remainder's grand sweep and tragic overtones. It is unfortunate that he did not drastically rewrite or even drop this, as it is a significant stylistic limitation. Coupled with the many non-narrative tangents, it pushes Moby too far from the technical and stylistic elegance necessary to truly great literature in most eyes.Still other plot problems exist, though perhaps less important and arguably subjective. First, aside from the possibly excessive detail and focus on trifles, the initial section simply goes nowhere fast. One keeps wondering when the actual story will start, as popular depictions almost never use this section, and some will probably give up before the ship is even boarded. The section does have some value in adding to the realism and giving some now interesting historical background, but the fact that the rest is practically a separate novel truly makes it seem useless.Discursions aside, the book will pick up for most people once onboard, but even here the essentially episodic plot will bother some. The biggest surprise for most will almost certainly be that Moby-Dick does not appear until the last ten or so pages. Popular depictions often give the impression that the book is a series of Moby-Dick chases, but those who actually read it may well wonder if it will ever occur. It does, and Melville plays it up quite a bit, offering possibly more action in the last few pages than the whole book previously. Even so, it is hard not to see the long delay as anti-climactic; some may even be so let down that it significantly lowers their view of the whole, perhaps even ruining it for a few. It is indeed curious that Melville has the whale mentioned so many times but keeps delaying the inevitable. This was presumably mainly for suspense, and it indeed does much in that way, but whether it is worth the wait is highly questionable. Symbolically, of course, it works very well - is indeed inevitable if Melville's tragic vision is to be fulfilled, but this will do little to satisfy those let down by the narrative anticlimax.A final problem is the short closing chapter, which is necessary in order to show how Ishmael is able to tell the story but very perfunctory in execution. This is so much so that Melville may have been better off omitting it. The British first edition did just this by mistake, and this is the version read by D. H. Lawrence, who first brought Moby into vogue. Narrative implausibility was after all present in many prior instances, and a final one could hardly be fatal. Besides, one might add, if it did not bother Lawrence, who thought Moby a first-rate masterwork, why should it bother us? Either way, this is the kind of imperfection that will greatly irk some but that should not keep us from reading and appreciating what is a very good work in many respects.All told, Moby is simply one of those classics that everyone should read; it may run quite contrary to some tastes, and those looking for a true masterwork will surely be disappointed, but there is more than enough to make it worthwhile.As for this edition, it is ideal for most because it is not only inexpensive but has both versions of the story; an excellent introduction with substantial background on Melville, the novel, and the historical context plus some initial analysis; and useful notes. Some will want more supplemental material, but this is perfect for nearly everyone else."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Moby Dick Moby Dick is a novel written by Herman Melville.

This book is about how fishermen go out o sea to kill a big white whale that has been killing and eating people for years. The main characters are Ishmael and Quee-queg and the setting is in a bay. The main point of the book is the whale. Like tha time when the group went out to kill Moby Dick because he was causing many deaths toward innocent people and hurting children severely. One of the characters stabbed him in thye side and another, Ahah, stabbed him in the jaw with a spher. I think weak points of the book are that some of the scenes are unexplainable, like the times when Quee-queg gives Ishmael an embalmed head and sometimes what happens dosn't make sense. Strong points of the book are very good punctuation and descriptions on what is happening at certain times. For example, there really isn't much description with the giant squid that tries to eat the people. I would recomend this book because it's exciting and sometimes funny."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"First, let me tell say that I began this book with high hopes since it considered a masterpiece. However, not 100 pages into the book, I kept asking myself why this book is considered a masterpiece. After finishing it, I am still asking myself that very question. I don't have an answer since this book was certainly not worth the time and effort to read it.I entitled this review \\"Call me Ahab\\" since after getting 300 pages into it, I became obsessed with finishing the book. I was not going to let the White Whale beat me. I was not going to let that fish cause me to put down the book (even though that is what I wanted to do). I was not reading this book because I was enjoying it. I merely finished it so that I could say that I finished it and the White Whale did not win.There is a reason that the most famous line in the book is the first one. Of the 135 chapters, there are maybe 20-25 that are worth the reading. Of the 725 pages, maybe only 150-200 are worth reading. I was not too terribly concerned about knowing the anatomy of whales, the different types of whales, the skeletal system of whales, or knowing about whaling in general.Throughout the book, you may read one chapter with some action only to be followed by 5 or 6 chapters of tangents that are not necessary to understand the story. This also happens within some of the chapters that have some action. In the middle of a chapter with some action, Melville may go off on some tangent for several paragraphs and then come back to the storyline.If you like a story with nonessential information and an author that is entirely to verbose, then this book is for you. Also, if you have only one book and way too much time on your hands, this would be a good book. However, if you like a story that has some continuity to it and a good storyline, this is not the book for you.I think that Melville's plan was to have his writing be the White Whale and the reader as Ahab to determine if his writing would cause the reader to become obsessed just to get through it. If this was his thinking, then it worked on me.There are so many more books that are much, much better than this one. If you have many books that you want to read, read them first and always place this book at the back of the line and read it when you have no other books you would rather read.Take my advice - read another book. If not, then be prepared to become obsessed with finishing it since that may be the only way you will get though it.My apologizes to all those that I may have offended with this review."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Long, yes. Difficult to understand, yes. Good, yes. To those who rated it one and two stars, go read your comic books."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"It's an allegory. No! It's an encyclopedia entry! Herman Melville tells a gripping, affecting tale of an obsessed Captain's quest for a white whale. Told by Ishmael, a member of Captain Ahab's crew, the novel recounts one man's obsession with a whale. However, the philosophical implications of his obsession soon become evident. Whiteness is equated with purity and goodness, as well as absence and death. Ahab's quest for revenge eventually causes his destruction as well as the destruction of those on board the Pequod. Did God send the whale to tempt Ahab, or save him? Is Ahab Jonah, waiting to be swallowed whole and reborn? Is the whale God? Is the whale Satan? Ahab and Ishmael grapple with these questions, and Melville challenges the reader to do so as well.All of this sounds like a compelling read; it is. However, it is only half the story. The other half, unfortunately, comes in the form of more information than anyone ever wanted to know about whales, whale hunting and whale habits. In one chapter, types of whales are chronicled. In another, the method of collecting ambergris from whales is detailed.The information, while presented well, is completely out of context. It would have been better suited as an appendix or introduction to the novel. Instead, it breaks up the flow of the narrative and pulls the reader out of Ahab's thrall. The story of Moby Dick hypnotizes and captivates us as surely as it does the Captain, but Melville is not content to let us drift along with the Pequod. Instead, we have to endure an Encyclopedia Brittanica full of information on whales.Moby Dick is a great novel and it is a fascinating factual chronicle. Unfortunately, the two do not peacefully coexist. I emerged from my reading experience frustrated. Melville could have easily given us the best of both worlds. Instead, he chops up Moby Dick and feeds him to his readers in bits and pieces, causing us to shift gears continuously. Keeping us on our toes, perhaps? Maybe, but it does not q!uite work. I only wish that great literature had a fast forward button."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"This is, without question, the greatest American novel. Through the eyes of a young sailor named Ishmael, we witness the decent of a once great man, Captain Ahab. This is an adventure novel, but it is so much more than that. It is about pride and obsession and futility. After the loss of his leg, Ahab spends years chasing after the whale that dismasted him. But if you think about it, what the hell is he doing this for? Even if he kills the whale, what's the point? All he's done is waste his life, his very soul, hunting after something that is worth nothing. All the while his wife and son are waiting for him at home, wondering if they will ever see him again. This book makes us question our goals and our desires, and to appreciate what is truly important in life. If you have never read it, you are missing something spectacular."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"I must admit, somewhere after the 400th page, I was getting mighty impatient for the great whale to rear its ugly head. Majestically descriptive as to give life to planks of wood and historically fascinating, \\"Moby Dick\\" is god-like in its ingenius narrative of man and whales and sometimes tiresome in its detailed descriptions of everything under the sun and aboard the whaling vessel, The Pequod. More than being a great book, I came away with a hunger to learn more of its fascinating author who remains a marvel of history and literary wizardry."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Moby Dick is a tough book. I will not for a minute pretend that I understood much of what lay below the surface of this story,because I was reading it for pleasure and did not bother to give it the time necessary to truly appreciate Melville's genius. Onthe other hand, even giving it only half my attention, the book was still entertaining. Ahab's obsession, the action on the high sea, and the battle with whales were all intriguing and griping. I also learned a tremendous amount about the whaling industry and lifeon the sea in the 19th century. There is tremendous depth to this book, but even if you only scratch the surface it is worth the time and effort to do so once. I wouldn't recommend this book to someone who does not like 18th century literature (it can beextremely wordy and dull at times), but for anyone who has an interest in maritime novels, Melville, or is just curious why thereis so much talk about Moby Dick, I would advise you to give it a chance."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"After getting through this monumental work, I was amazed at the rather blunt way Melville got his point across. The foreshadowing was less than subtle, and the characters almost transparent. But I guess the point was not about the characters, but about ourselves; the real monster is within us, not outside. I found the commentaries on the whalers world view to be quite entertaining, as was the layman's taxonomy. The book lived up to its reputation as a true classic."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"I give this book a rating of seven because it is well above average, but it is certainly not close to being the best novel I've ever read. From the memorable first line, &quot;Call me Ishmael,&quot; the tale and quirky characters hold the reader's attention; but parts of the book are SLOW (including a very long and dreary chapter on cetology.) It's a good book to read once, but it doesn't encourage repeated readings."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Full of vivid desciptions and symbolism, this book has earned its reputation as a classic; however, this is actually the revised Moby Dick. The first draft was never read because Herman Melville burned it in a fire after inspiration from his neighbor Nathaniel Hawthorne.Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote many classic short stories but the one that inspired Melville to completely rewrite a novel was \\"Young Goodman Brown\\". This is a very short story packed with hidden meaning....for starters the SEVENTH word is sunset which was not an accident. Anyway, this short story reveals itself many times in the style of Melville's Moby Dick and in fact a whole chapter is dedicated to answering Hawthorne.Read Young Goodman Brown, by Nathaniel Hawthorne and then read chapter xcvi, THE TRY-WORKS. This will help you understand it Much better."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"If you can't bear to hear someone say bad things about an alleged classic of American literature, do not read this review.This is, without a doubt, the single most overrated book in the English language. Granted, this doesn't mean that it is completely valueless, but considering its exalted reputation, it's amazingly close.On the plus side, the basic plot is certainly a classic plot; &quot;normal fellow sails with compulsive maniac of a sea captain in hunt for killer denizen of the deep, and is the sole survivor of the experience&quot; is, after all, essentially the plot to &quot;Jaws&quot;, as well, so clearly, this novel has had major, long-lasting literary effect. And Melville starts well; the first 3-4 chapters are a delightful bit of lighthearted scene-setting and character development as we meet Ishmael and his new buddy, the harpooner Queequeg. And the penultimate three chapters, &quot;The Chase, days 1, 2, and 3&quot;, are exciting enough. And I won't deny that there are some interesting literary devices applied between these bookends; periodically, Melville interrupts his attempt at writing a treatise on whale hunting in the ninteenth century to slip in a bit of character development or plot foreshadowing. But only occasionally; most of this book is only of value if you're interested in knowing all there is to know about the technical aspects of the whaling industry in the ninteenth century; then it's absolutely invaluable. Meanwhile, Melville's style is horribly obtuse, over-wordy, and convoluted, to say nothing of pretentious. As an example, in the chapter, &quot;The Whiteness of the Whale&quot;, Melville spends 7 1/2 pages, including a 469 word sentence that takes up just ONE of those pages, saying nothing more complex than that, although white is frequently considered a GOOD color, in the case of Moby Dick, it is a BAD one, because instead of being reminiscent of purity, it is reminiscent of spectrality. Seven and a half PAGES, to say what I, a mere reviewer, can say in 31 words. The whole book is like that; he never uses one word where ten will serve.Mind you, I'm not some high school student forced to read this book for a class, unable to appreciate classic literature. I'm a very well-read 42 year old, who read the book on my own initiative because I felt that I wanted to make my own decision about it. I believe in speaking my mind; if I was any more complimentary about this book than I have been, I would be being intellectually dishonest.Astonishingly, there are those who consider this &quot;The Great American Novel&quot;; if you like pretentious writing and writing that can't keep to its topic but rather keeps wandering off at tangents, I suppose it is. I suppose it IS rather amazing that he was able to keep his syntax unscrambled in the above-mentioned 469 word sentence, but that hardly qualifies it for the title of &quot;The Great American Novel&quot;. For my money, that title should go to &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot;, but there are certainly any number of good candidates for the spot. This book is NOT one of them."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Moby Dick is one of those classic books that is actually several simultaneous books rolled up into one; each a level below the other. At the most superficial level, Moby Dick is an adventure - drama about a male albino sperm while of the same name that roams the open oceans while being chased by a crew of whalers on a sailing ship named the Pequod. The ship is captained by Ahab, a man who has lost one leg in a previous encounter with the great whale. The book progresses thru various chapters. The initial and final chapters are the story itself; the chase of the whale across the oceans. The middle chapters provide a thorough and detailed examination of various facets of whales, sailing and the whaling industry.If this book was only an adventure story on the high seas; it would probably be unknown today for it is long and quite boring with a lot of pages devoted to dialogue and description. But, at a deeper level this book is a careful study of the vast range of human emotions. The terror of the sailors facing the great whale, the agony felt by survivors of crashed boats, the vengeance that drives Ahab, the comraderie between members of the harpooning team, the rivalries between the different harpooners, the suspense of the lookouts trying to get the first glimpse of whale or land... the vast range of emotions that man can experience are experienced on the Pequoud's journey. Key to this study is the fact that the ship's crew forms Western literature's first, truly multi-racial cast of characters. Names like Queequeg, Ishmael, Starbuck, Tashtego, and Daggoo represent the various races known to white man during the time of this book's writing.At the most basic level, this book, like all other classics in the western genre, is a commentary of human society. Here, the theme is mankind's destructive behavior, its attempts to control nature, and the ensuing wreckage that nature can bring forth onto man. Interestingly enough, the two leaders of the great quest are Ahab, an American, and Flask, an Englishman. At the time of the book's writing, America and England were in the throes of the Industrial Revolution. A visitor to the cities of either country at that time would be repulsed by the smokestacks, pollution, dirty streets, and factories. Both countries were undergoing large-scale transitions from societies that lived with nature to those that destroyed nature. The four harpooners are from native tribes in various parts of the world. As harpooners, they are the ones who will kill the whales. As an allegory, the represent the fact that in many lands, it was the natives who first showed the encroaching white man how to feed of nature's bounty. Ishael of course is Jewish. And it is the sole Jew on the boat who survives the onslaught of Moby Dick. This parallels the Bible, where the Jews are those chosen by God.I read this book when I was in my late teens and found it quite challenging. I only finished it with the help of reading aides and study guides. I would not recommend attempting to read this unaided, for it can be quite boring and challenging."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Moby-Dick is one of my favorite novels so, no, I'm not taking issue with that. But with all the hype about this special new edition, I expected to be blown away by the illustrations. Instead, I found that there aren't that many, they're quite small and, except for two or three, not that impressive. (The one on the cover is probably the best of the bunch.) Perhaps the orginal, limited edition priting of this book looked better, as opposed to this paperback version. Given my choice of illustrated editions of Moby-Dick, I would stick with Rockwell Kent's."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Moby Dick is a very difficult book to read. I suggest you give the book a shot but if you find yourself losing track watch the movie with Patrick Stewart it stays close to the book. Melville has a very unique style of writing and for me and others I know it was difficult to understand the message being sent."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Moby Dick by Herman Melville stands as one of the greatest American novels ever published.Bleh!How often have we heard that syllogism in classrooms and critic's circles nationwide? It's statements like this that actually turn people off to reading great books. As Mark Twain famously said, \\"A classic is something that everybody wants to have read and nobody wants to read,\\" a good majority of the American public approaches literary classics like taking strep throat medication. It might taste awful in your mouth and it might be a challenge to get through, but it's good for you so don't argue. Moby Dick has gotten a fair amount of flak because a lot of people are forced to read it. Of course, I'm no different from thousands of English teachers in the sense that I made my students read it. Of course, most didn't like it. Melville is hard to get through at times.What makes the book a challenge is sadly what makes it a great read: the author's wide vocabulary. Moby Dick and Shakespeare's plays have a lot in common in the sense that they are extremely dense. When you're used to reading Stephen King, J.K. Rowling, and Stephanie Meyer, Melville's language can feel like being dropped into the Amazon after a week at Jesus Camp. You're totally unprepared. But there's a richness here that's unparalleled in contemporary fiction. One facet of Melville's writing that he excels at is metaphor and simile. If you want a crash course in how to write good similes and metaphors, read Moby Dick. Also of note is the extreme attention to detail, which effectively creates an authentic setting. This is the quintessential novel of \\"write what you know\\" since Melville was on a whale ship earlier in life.As part of my personal preference, I also appreciate the consistent allusions to history, philosophy and theology. This book is so symbolic, it's as if the author is creating a contemporary Bible story.The characters are extremely deep and complex, not to mention unforgettable. Captain Ahab stands in my book as one of the most interesting and morally ambiguous characters in all of fiction. But there I go again with hyperboles.Read this book. Slog through it slowly if need be. Put it off till adulthood if you're being forced to read it now and don't appreciate it. Yes all the critics and teachers praise the book, but for all it's worth, they're right on this one."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Rereading Moby Dick after several decades is an extraordinary privilige. How wonderful Melville writes and relates to life experience now logged. And besidesthe story we also can see his story...and what American stories were told in thefirst half of the 19th century. Now, 170 years later many are chilled by thedesecration of whales..as we no longer seek to conquer nature but to sustain it.Yet,one can fully understand - once transported backe to the whaling days of Melville's time the struggle for that harvest and the battle with the great white Leviathon. This is a marvelous edition that brings all the context and allusionsfrom Melville scholarship right to the reader in footnotes and appendices.It is no small triumph.George Rosenbaum"},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Moby Dick is one of the great American classic novels. Although it sold very poorly when first published and damaged Melville's established reputation as a writer of exotic novels it has rightfully assumed its place in the canon of great 19th century novels. I won't repeat the story here. Who doesn't already know the plot (which is based on a true story of a whaler rammed by a whale and sunk)? Check out Nathaniel Philbrook's In the Heart of the Sea for that. But the atavistic battle between the monomaniacal Ahab and Moby Dick is unique in fiction. The Nantucket whalers are among the great American heroes in Melville's vision and the voyage of the Pequod is a microcosm of the world swept by fate along treacherous seas. Yes there are boring chapters about the details of whales and whaling. But even these contain tidbits of humor, and are the basis for both the heroics of the whalers and the magnificence of whales, especially Moby Dick.This edition is beautifully bound with quality leather. The paper is thick and the text large and readable. The illustrations are good. For the price this is a fine edition of this timeless novel."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"My title might imply that I didn't enjoy this... certainly Moby Dick is a daunting book to pick up, and it's very easy to catch your eyes skimming rather than reading... but I would have to say, once read, it is easy to figure out why this book is a classic.Sure it took me a while to get past my knowledge of whales, the fact that they aren't fish and that they are intelligent animals. And having been out of school for several years now, it took a bit to knock the cobwebs out of the brain to read the writing style of the time. But in reality this is a fantastic story on so many levels. The meaning and the subtext are brilliant. For those of you who have spent your life under a rock...Moby Dick is the tale of Ishmael, a teacher turned whaler who joins the ship the Pequod to sail in search of whales for the oils, blubber and meat they contain. If you are not sure how whaling works, don't worry - Ishmael is going to give you an entire tutorial on the topic. You will also learn the history of the whale, and all about it's anatomy... or what they perceived these things to be at the time the book was written. So Ishmael sets sail to learn that his new captain - Ahab, is a little bit on the OCD side... you see he's recently lost a leg to this huge white sperm whale the sailors call \\"Moby Dick.\\" And well, Ahab took this as a personal slight so he's out to capture and kill Moby Dick.Because this is a review and not a term paper I am not going to go into the deeper meaning of everything, instead I'll just say that yes, this is a daunting book to pick up, but it is also a wonderful read.So why not 5 stars? Well mainly from personal taste... I liked the story of Ahab, the ship, and the hunt... but Ishmael won't stay on topic and keeps going on and on about the size of a whale's jaw or how the Kracken was actually a whale, or that St. George actually killed a whale and called it a dragon. I found myself wanting to shake Ishmael and tell him \\"Enough of this, get back to the STORY!\\" But as I said... this was just personal taste, egged on by the fact that I REALLY liked the story part of the book. Now I had read the childrens version of this back in the 3rd grade, and it was my favorite classic for years. I had always dreaded reading the full version, but in reality it didn't take me more than a week, and I wasn't trying all that hard. I would highly recommend that any avid reader at least give this a try. It is truly a classic for a reason."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"A few years back I made a conscious decision to read (and in some cases re-read) a number of books that fall into the category of \\"classics.\\" The books that stand the test of time the best have an uncanny ability to feel modern and relevant no matter how long ago they were written. It's almost as if there is a certain current that runs down through the years that flows with a permanence that most don't. If a writer can tap into this current, their writing can be timeless; a classic.Herman Melville tapped into that current in spades in this story. Despite this book being over 150 years old, the themes Melville selected from many obviously available to him are themes that are just as relevant an engaging today as they were in 1851. Further, Melville somehow had a handle on using language that would not seem outdated even after a century and a half.What you get is a great story about a revenge-obsessed man, characters to whom you can easily relate and colorful descriptions of the life of a whaleman. It all comes together beautifully.Any drawbacks? Sure, Melville's story slows in the middle of the book as he goes into a deep examination of the physical characteristics of various whales, but it's still interesting and it's just not enough to take away from the rest of this novel.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Though you'd probably never guess it from reading my reviews, I'm actually an English major, and I've read quite a bit of 'literature' in my day. As an English major I've lost the natural adolescent tendency to denigrate and despise the supposed classics, though I'm generally not 100% sold on them either. They're usually pretty good, interesting, though probably not as deep as they're made out to be. 'Moby-Dick' is one of the few classic novels I've come across that's truly deserving of its legendary status. Now I'm not gonna lie to you; there are a great many portions of this novel that I don't understand, or, more precisely, don't understand why Melville chose to include them. His virtual lectures on whales and whaling and whatever are generally reasonable interesting, even though I don't necessarily understand why they've been included. How the novel really works for me, however, is just as pure story. Most significantly, Ahab is just the greatest character in American literature. He's the archetype of the vengeful man, imitated countless times but never matched, much less surpassed. The major passages where he speaks are just spellbinding and he's just such a great tragic figure, particularly in a late chapter where mourns his long life on the sea and all that he's left behind in his quest for revenge. All this combines to just make the final few chapters of the novel unbelievably intense despite the fact that it's pretty much impossible for a contemporary reader not to know the basic events. (And Ahab's final monologue is sheer brilliance.) I dunno what else to say. It's just all got an amazing impact."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"This is the greatest novel ever. Of course, I can't be sure of that, because I haven't read every novel ever written. But Herman Melville's book is an epic masterpiece, and one that kindled an interest in classic American literature for me...even if it took me 5 months to finish it.I think the basic plot is very good, Ahab searching for the whale, and all...but I never got to deep into wondering what Moby Dick represented or what Ahab represented. But I got a lot out of the middle section, which examines Man's place in the grand scheme of the world.This novel is really great--I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"I just picked up the book one day and said &quot;why not?&quot;.What it comes down to is this: The first few chapters are incredible. Much of the middle reads like an outdated whaling textbook, but there's also a lot of symbolism, philosophy, and once or twice I caught some humor. Then from chapter 99+ it returns to the vivid characterization of the early chapters.These early and later chapters are what make the book truly great, and some people tend to miss the subtlety of the middle sections . ."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"To ask someone who has never read Moby Dick what they think it is about, they would probably tell you what I used to think, &quot;It is about a white whale.&quot;. Surprisingly, very few of the numerous chaptors were devoted to that particular leviathon. Instead, Moby Dick himself is the climax of a book that puts you on the ocean in the mid-19th century with a rather interesting crew and captain. You do not only read about a singular chase of a brutal (not all white) beast, you learn what whales are made of (at least what they knew back then), how the crew was hired and paid, the complete workings of the ship from the owners down to the carpenter, and how dangerous a vocation this really was. Symbolism abounds, and quite honestly I ignored most of it and chose instead to just enjoy the scenery. Take what you will, but Moby Dick is well worth it."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"A while ago I made the decision to read my way through the classics of Western literature, and for a while the going was relatively easy: Austen, the Bronte sisters, Dickens and Thackeray were all enjoyable, though time-consuming. Then I hit Herman Melville's \\"Moby Dick\\". With its long complicated sentences, huge digresses away from the main plot to discuss seemingly irrelevant material, chapters made entirely out of dialogue, characters that are introduced only to disappear and a climactic moment that lasts one paragraph, it was with more relief than relish that I completed the challenge of reading this one-hundred and thirty-five chaptered novel.But read it I did, and I'm glad I did, and perhaps one day I'll even read it again with a greater appreciation for its quirks. Till then however, I have to base this review on my own experience this time around, and the truth is that I found it an incredibly difficult book to read.Ishmael is a young man who has taken it into his head to travel aboard a whaling ship and in doing so explore the oceanic parts of the world, joining the crew of the Pequod. Exploring the island of Nantucket and meeting the heathen Queequeg (who carries his god around with him in the shape of a small idol), Ishmael is soon on board and under the captainship of the infamous Captain Ahab. Ahab commands his entire crew with an iron fist in order to fulfil his obsession in killing the legendary Moby Dick, the White Whale.It all sounds more exciting than it actually is. In between these fast-paced and interesting \`action-sequences' are entire chapters that discuss the apparatus of the ship, the different species of whale and its usable parts, and the representations of whales in art, literature, history and science. Truth be told, it is quite tedious - though at times little nuggets of information that emerge can be both enlightening and fascinating.The centre of the novel is undoubtedly the somewhat deranged Captain Ahab (Moby doesn't show up until the end), and the best reason to endeavour to read \\"Moby Dick\\" as he's one of the most famous characters in literature. He is nearly driven mad by the thought of Moby Dick, given that years ago he lost his leg to the mighty leviathan and now must do with a whale-bone leg in its place - a neat conceit considering Moby Dick still carries the Ahab's harpoon in his fin. Ahab's quest is what drives the crew into deeper and more dangerous waters, after the commercial venture in whaling for blubber and oil gradually turns to one of vengeance. Despite being described as \`monomanic', Ahab wields enough power and charisma over his crew to override the protestations of ship-owners Starbuck and Stubbs when his own vendetta takes over the ship's mission, steering them through storms, pods of whales, ill omens, deaths and pleas for help from other vessels in the hunt for the White Whale. He's an unforgettable character, and one that you're likely to have heard of even if you've never picked up \\"Moby Dick\\".Ishmael is an amusing first-person narrator, youthful, eager and more nave than Melville himself, and it's a shame when he \`disappears' halfway through the novel, making way for a more omnipresent narrator who we can only assume is a more detached Ishmael. More amusement stems from the fact that Melville is the king of the understatement (often he discusses raging storms as if they're everyday occurrences) and of grim irony (at the same time he describes the sentimental sight of mother-whales and their calves, he adds as a footnote how good they taste when cooked).\\"Moby Dick\\" is often considered the first - and only - American Epic, and for that historical literary importance I am glad I read it. But it is a struggle, and so this review should serve as both encouragement and warning for those approaching \\"Moby Dick\\" with no idea what to expect, as it's a tricky book to complete."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"This book is not for the faint hearted, but if you truly want to learn to read, this is the book for you.Melville starts with the bones of a good story, adds the meat of interesting characters, and then augments that with layer upon layer of detail and symbolism, each of which is as rich (and as hard to bring home) as the whale oil the characters seek.If you love MTV, you'll hate Moby Dick; it is not easy to get through and find the plot. But if you like poetry and enjoy searching for symbolism in deep details, you will ultimately enjoy this book.My advice to those who are looking for quick gratification and have been assigned this book for an English class: read the first hundred or so pages, then skip to the last fifty. This will give you the basic plot and let you enjoy the action. Then go back to the center pages you skipped (if you don't you will be doing yourself no favors) and read those pages as you would poetry. I must admit that I wish I had done this the first time I read it: I spent a good long time wishing Ahab would please hurry up and catch his silly \\"fish\\" instead of listening to the language as I ought to have done.So read this book and savor it. It isn't the action-packed adventure about a man and a whale that one might expect from the movies. Instead it's a thought provoking work about the nature of man."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"&quot;Call me Ishmael&quot;. With these words so begins this epic tale. Melville's words are many, rich with meaning and flow from his pen in torrents, using the character Ismael as the narrator. The plot surrounds Captain Ahab who is obsessed with killing the white whale, Moby Dick, who has cost him his leg on a previous whaling expedition. But this book is much more than this simple plot.Moby Dick is about whales. And there sure is a lot about whales --more about whales than I ever thought I wanted to know. It's as if every single legend, every single description, and every single fact ever known about whales is included in this book. Melville writes in a wordy archaic style; his sentences are long and complicated, his references are often obscure, he goes off on tangents that are hard to follow. But yet I found myself getting caught up in the complex rhythms of his language as I would pure poetry -- just for the sound of the words.Although the character of Ismael is forever in the background, we are treated to a long line of lively characters. We meet the tattooed Pacific Islander Queequeg who Ismael thinks of as a cannibal and who is one of the three dark skinned harpooners. We meet the First Mate Starbuck who is a voice of reason. We meet the carpenter and the cook and the young cabin boy who loses his mind after of act of cowardice. And of course there is Captain Ahab in his madness.But even though all the characters are richly drawn, I felt they were mere players, creating the stage setting for the detailed grueling descriptions of the whales. The reader joins the men on the whaleboats for the kill. We feel the highs and lows of joy and disappointment and fatigue. The danger frightens and intrigues us. It is an adventure as well as a gruesome murder of the whale.Most of all, I felt sorry for the whales. Melville does a lot to humanize them. They become more than just beasts of the sea which will bring wages to the crew. By the end of the book I was rooting for the whales. Of course by this point I had struggled through hundreds of pages of excruciating detailed descriptions. I knew all about the oil, the blubber, the bone, the brain, the skin, the eyes, the sprout, the tail. I knew the different smells of different parts of the body from perfume to rot. I admired their strong fighting spirit. And I deployed the brutality and wastefulness of their slaughter.The pace of the book is very uneven. Sometimes it's even hard to remember the plot. And in addition to all this whaling lore, Melville goes off on long wordy philosophies on the nature of man and the meaning of life. His themes are repeated over and over and sometimes it seems that he never gets to the point. By the end of the book, the actual search for the white whale and the inevitable conclusion is simply a punctuation mark to finalize Melville's thoughts. And it spite of the book's length there are just a handful of pages devoted to it.Of course I recommend this book. It's an enriching experience. But it is certainly not for everyone, especially if you like clarity, conciseness and focus in your choice of literature."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Few modern characters can compare with Melville's creations in Moby Dick: Ishmael, Starbuck, Queequeg, Stubbs, and of course, Ahab. Each one is a work of art. The story is gripping and Melville's use of foreshadowing is masterly. From the early chapters as Ishmael reflects on the inexorable pull of the sea and finds himself in Coffin's inn, The Trap, bunking down with an unkown cannibal, to the very end as each character realizes that he is caught in the grip of Ahab's unrelenting monomania, the book has an hypnotic power that keeps readers immersed in its spell. Anyone who thinks they know the story of Moby-Dick but has never read the book should think again. Reading it is an incredible experience that shouldn't be missed."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"About a year ago I was talking with a good friend about the books we'd each been reading recently, and the topic of Moby Dick came up. &quot;What!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;You've never read Moby Dick? You've got to read it! It's great! And it has all kinds of geeky stuff about ships and whaling that you'd like.&quot; I made some excuses about it being archaic but she browbeat me into agreeing to check it out.I found a number of editions at the local bookstore but this edition, with the Rockwell Kent illustrations, caught my eye, so that's the one I bought. As I was paying for it the clerk at ther register said &quot;That's my favorite book!&quot; Maybe my friend was on to something after all.I started reading it that evening, and you know what? This *is* a great book. The language may be a bit flowerly and long winded for those raised on post-modern New Yorker short stories, but it's a very vivid language that makes characters and scenes come alive. Melville's narration of both the external world of the shop and the internal world of the characters is compelling in a way that few if any modern authors can acheive.Moby Dick is a classic for reasons that go beyond having been assigned as school reading since the beginning of time. If you never got beyond reading the Bartlett's Notes when Moby Dick was assigned to you in high school, this is as good a time as any to dive into the real thing."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Run -- quickly --- jump aboard! Or the Pequod will sail without you! The things you'll need while aboard: a brain (one in good working order); a soul (for that is what this books is about); patience (the Pequod does not sail in a straight line, and neither does the narrator); popcorn (always eat popcorn while reading this book); a bookmark (you will NOT be able to read this book in one sitting, and I don't care HOW fast you read) Now be off! Off with you now!!"},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"All that most maddens and torments; all that stirs up the lees of things; all truth with malice in it; all that cracks the sinews and cakes the brain; all the subtle demonisms of life and thought; all evil, to crazy Ahab, where visibly personified, and made practically assailable in Moby Dick. He piled upon the whale's white hump the sum of all the general rage and hate felt by his whole race from Adam down; and then, as if his chest had been a mortar, he burst his hot heart's shell upon it. --Chapter 41 (Moby Dick)The awesome power of the written word to conjure in the mind a reverential awe for a world you've never experienced is nothing short of miraculous. And nowhere is the wizard's wand better wielded than in the pages of Moby Dick. I agree with many of the reviewers in stating that for those uninitiated in the reading of classical literature, this is going to be arduous, and simultaneously the most superlative literary experience you will ever know."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Ahab chases a whale. That's my plot summary. Really there's not much more to this book plot-wise. The narrator takes aboard a whaling vessel and goes off to sea and learns that his captain is obsessed with killing the white whale that took his leg.You don't read Moby Dick for the plot. You read Moby Dick because of Melville's complete command of the poetry of language, his mastery of the subject matter and his ability to inject philosophy and humor into the strangest places.I find Moby Dick to be more of a reference book than a novel. I'll pull it down from my shelf and flip through it and enjoy a page or two about the morality of different kinds of chowder, or immerse myself in a page-long sentence describing the skeleton of a sperm whale.Ahab chases a whale, that's really all that's going on. But that doesn't convey how spot on Melville's musings about man's connection to the sea are or how you can feel the harpoon rope draped across your shoulders when Ishmael takes to the long boats.Sometimes, when Melville breaks for two chapters to give you a history of the biology of various whales, you might think, like Ishmael, that you're in the hands of a madman. But at no point do you doubt that you're in the hands of a poet."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"From its 'Great American Novel' rep I expected Moby Dick to be stodgy and slow: I was thinking 700 pages of Henry James (ugh). But Melville's book is anything but stodgy. Insane, maybe--passionate, surely--original? Well, very similar in style to Scots Enlightenment, let's say Carlyle's romantic musings plus Stevenson's adventure plus a working-class ethic. But, yes, American. And damned original.Passages in this book are written as a play. Passages are written as a history of whaling. All the characters have the same ecstatic inner monologue, and this is only intermittently broken by Melville writing directly to you without the subtext of a plot. The book is constructed in a way that makes Faulker look tame: it sprawls. No wonder it didn't make a dime when it was first published--if it were published the month after Ulysses, it'd still raise eyebrows.This book isn't stodgy. This book is revolutionary. This book is very, very strange.For those kids having to write book reports on Moby Dick--give up. Read Jack London's Sea Wolf. Come back after you've tangled with the Leviathan."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"I just wanted to put in my two cents here. If you are perusing these reviews under Moby Dick in an effort to see whether or not it is worth reading (which is why I personally scan these reviews) let me just say emphatically that it is. But... I would suggest that you not pick this book up lightly. It is a very stubborn work that in many ways is a precursor to the 20th century's flirtation with high literature. In many ways this book can be compared to the more stubborn works of Pynchon and Joyce in that you can read it over and over again and find an entirely new perspective in which to appreciate it every time.I picked Moby Dick up several times only to be frustrated with its seemingly antiquated cadence and structure. Luckily for myself I found a reading group a few years back that was delving into some classics and Moby Dick happened to be one of these works. It made all of the difference in the world to have a knowledgeable leader of a reading group opening up discussions after every few chapters to discuss what we had read. After undergoing this experience and finishing the book I was and still am in awe of the majesty Melville attained in these pages.Please, even if you are sure of yourself as a reader and scoff at my suggestion to use a reading group or class structure to enjoy this work, find a copy that will have a comprehensive \`readers guide' in order to cast light on some of the complex and arcane references. This will be helpful if only to note how uniquely Melville manipulates the focus of his story and the characters contained with in.Enjoy this book, and please don't open its pages on a whim unless you have plenty of free time, patience, and a curiosity to uncover ideas or meanings that might not be so apparent at a first reading.------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Moby Dick is a tribute to craftsmanship; Melville's writing craftsmanship's drawing from his former experience in the whale fishery to paint a vivid picture of the lives and toil of thirty men in a deranged quest for revenge on a \\"dumb brute\\".Each one of the crew members holds a special pride for its own mastery of the many trades combined to make Nantucket whaling so dominant. We see the pagan harpooners, the cook, all the mates, the oarsmen, the carpenter, the blacksmith... The only crewmember that takes pride in having no pride is Ishmael.Towards the end of the book Ahab cries at the height of his 58 years, 40 of it dedicated to whaling. He thinks of how little he has enjoyed of life, thinks about his young wife whom he seldom sees, thinks about how much more he could have reached if he only could have aspired less. Isn't this the age old paradox of capitalism? Till you get to be captain, the higher you rise the harder you toil, and after you become captain things do not improve much.This is why Moby Dick is so hated by high school students. You have to toil away on your monkey-ropes before you can truly appreciate it. I just finished reading Moby Dick for the first time now that I am 37 years old. Thank you Herman Melville.Leonardo AlvesBelo Horizonte MG 2009"},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"I have been re-reading some of the classics recently, and decided to read Mellville's masterpiece again. I last read it when I was seventeen, and it's even more wonderful than I remembered. This is action-adventure at its best. I think every fiction reader and writer should take a trip with Captain Ahab and his crew. I hope at least some of us writer wanna-be's can reach his level."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Like others this was my second trip through Moby Dick. I am glad I chose this narrator. He brought out the wit and humor of the story - plus more irony and social commentary than I expected. I am sure many readers assume that Melville is wholly dark, sonorous, grave, and somehow \\"important.\\" There is that, of course, but on the whole I found the language of the story consistently lighthearted - even breezy at times. This narrator captured it all - the highs and lows, the humor and the pathos, plus a rich and diverse assortment of memorable characters. When I originally read the book, I eventually began to feel that finishing it, alone, would be the reward. There is a brightness and spirit in this audio version that was lacking in my own head as I read the pages. The story came to life for me, and I was rewarded with every chapter."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Is not the main character. You meet Ishmael at the beginning and at the end.

I just didn't believe the hype. When I finally picked it up in the summer of 2010 I was hooked from page 1. Melville was at the top of his game while writing this novel. And while i don't care for the whaling history chapters it doesn't detract from the sheer genius of Melvilles writing. His portrayal of a hysterical Ahab is brilliant and insightful!!! get this book and read this book!!!! and witness what it truly means to be driven by some \\"inner urge\\"!!!"},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Even now, this novel rings true to the experience of the American way, but the wonderful thing is that it includes characters from everywhere in the world. The human inclination is to conquer nature, and this novel expounds on that theme.

It is a miracle that we have any whales left, given the way they were hunted for so many decades."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"This Herman Melville guy can really write! This book is great.

Everyone should read the tale of captain ahab and the whale at least once in their lifetime"},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Moby Dick is the greatest of all novels. Other works may be more refined, or ask less of the reader and perhaps, give more in return to those who peruse a book casually, but The Whale, is not that kind of work. It is a testament written in blood, and in turn, demands blood from the reader. You must devote yourself to The Whale, sign on to The Pequod and give yourself tooth and nail to an adventure without equal. Do not, be discouraged by the difficulties, but instead look for the subtleties. This is not simply a book about a man's obsession, it is more particularly, Ishmael's story, and he is a SIddartha to Ahab's vengeful old testament God. A man who finds himself in the mists and foam of the fitful seas rather than the whirlpools and harpoons of Ahab's longing. It is a work without equal, that rewards every reading with new insights into what it means to be human. Superb. Truly a classic."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"I've always loved this book.

I have heard many great things about this book, and will take their word on it, I personally could never come to like it. I have read many contemporary books for classes and found many to be entertaining, but more often than not, the books themselves ramble on about a minor, insignificant point. For those books, I would only give them 1 star. Moby Dick deserves at least 3, primarily because the author is able to make his points despite many of the cultural conventions of writing of his time.One major aspect that helped me to enjoy it was the knowledge that the author had a personal struggle in writing the book, oftentimes not sure if his characters were good or bad, even remarking when finishing that he may have created something terrible.

Many of you who are reading this are at least familiar with the title \\"Moby Dick\\" or \\"The Whale\\", and if you have read this incredible and penetrating book, most of you (I hope) will be in awe from its memories: fearful, heavy, and strange. For those who say the book is too \\"wordy\\", then you simply don't understand style and taste. Melville manages to go from an incredibly tight narrative at one page to something distant and spacey the next page. Indeed, it is a magical novel or as many call it a \\"masterpiece\\". Since most people - from what I have gathered here alone - review this book splendidly, I will not spend much time writing about it. In fact, it is best one digests this book arbitrarily, otherwise its weight may not be as profound. There is much speculation one may collect, I imagine, when thinking of this book in deep introspect.\\"Penguin Press\\" did an excellent job compiling this book. The back features very detailed diagrams and sketches of equipment and atlases. There is also an appendix for those who are not very familiar with boat terminology. The introduction is engaging and very helpful for those who have not read the book."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"I really enjoyed this classic tale as one whose descriptive imagery of the high seas forced me to reminisce about my times out on the ocean and my love for ships. Herman Melville's, Moby Dick captures the audience from the beginning with a dark cast on an ocean adventure. The setting is old fashion and language is old-time mariner speech bordering on pirate lingo. Melville carries the audience through this strenuous adventure, an American classic in many respects; Moby Dick is filled with much dialogue and character interaction. This tragic filled adventure speaks to those who enjoy long encased novels. There is much devotion to the main characters such as Captain Ahab, while being narrated by character Ishmael, the thoughts and first hand accounts of whaling and the culture of whaling is well detailed."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"it, a masterpice that needs to be collected by anyone outher it is one of the best books i have ever read."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Wow, what can I say, this book is a classic!

From such words as &quot;trash&quot;, &quot;Call me Ismal..call me boring&quot;, and &quot;too much&quot; I am shocked. This work has been around for one hundred years! If it's so boring, and Trashy how can it still be around? We have become a country of TV and Movie Theaters, we used to be a country of books. See way back when..belive it or not....there we no computers, no radio, no movies and people used to read, Moby Dick is a pure example of how people got their entertainment. This was one of the ways people learned things, went places and enjoied themselves. Melville wanted to take them on his adventure, let them meet the people, get to know them. The only way people could understand what Whale Hunting was all about was to experence it, the only way most people wanted to experence it was through reading. This book is a clissic and it should be treated as such, it has earned it's place as taking us places before TV, Movies or computeres. Have some respect."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"This is an amazing metaphor for good vs evil, one of the best I've ever seen. The insane drive of Ahab, his refusal to listen to Starbuck or anyone else who tried to turn him away from the darkness of the water, his moment of tragic truth and his final destruction are all elements that make Melville's masterpiece's consideration as a classic deserved.My favorite aspect of the book is Fedallah, Ahab's Psychic Friends Network, who is always just standing around, saying something foreboding or looking at us in a way that foretells Ahab's doom."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"This edition of Moby Dick is so beautiful! The first copy I owned had tiny print, narrow margins, and small pages. Luckily, I lost that copy and bought this one. The creamy pages and hand-set type do this story justice!

The care and love for the story is obvious. Well worth a few extra dollars for a nice edition."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"On one level, this is &quot;Everything you always wanted to know about whales but didn't know enough to ask&quot;. On various other levels it's the story of man consumed by avarice and vengefulness (Ahab), another who finds himself struggling with his religious beliefs (Ishmael), as was the author himself. This is NOT the &quot;Greatest Novel of the 19th Century&quot; (Bleak House, War and Peace and others are better), but it is right up there. The prose is at times beautiful, although there are many chapters devoted to whale science (cetology) which some might find tedious. I thought they were interesting. The book's real merits are on an allegorical level and for someone who's not afraid of &quot;Big Books&quot;, this one is well worth a read."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Moby Dick could easily be broken into parts and studied over a full semester in a college class and still that would only break the surface - and that is how it should be approached by the reader as well, I think. This is not like a Steinbeck or Dickens novel which can be thoroughly enjoyed without necessarily interpreting it. The whole point of Moby Dick is the search for the deeper meaning - by its characters and by its readers. Let me put it this way - if only the \\"action sequences\\" of the actual search for the whale where cut out and put together as the only part of the story, it might be 50 pages instead of over 500. Maybe 150 pages, but you get my point.Told from the perspective of one of his crew, the Pequod sets off on a whaling voyage under the enigmatic Captain Ahab. Ahab, maimed by the white whale on his previous voyage, has sworn himself to vengeance on the whale. He proves an inspiring captain in the beginning and the crew takes an oath to find Moby Dick with him. But as the omens mount up and additional reports of the whale's ferocity, it becomes clear that this obsession could take everyone to their grave and that Ahab would have his vengeance even at that expense.There is no doubt in reading this that it is a masterpiece and, overall, I enjoyed it. I found it very slow going though. There are a couple of reasons for this, I think. One, most of the chapters are very short - maybe one or two pages in some cases - so I stopped reading more often than I normally would. Secondly, Melville digresses from the actual story line of Ahab numerous times to go into depth on the types of whales there are, what pictures/paintings of them have been made throughout time and how close to reality they are, why the industry of whaling should be considered more glorious and honorific, how the whale line is secured, and specific anatomical descriptions of the whale's head, spout, flukes, etc. This occurs more in the first half than the second so, naturally, the first part seemed a lot slower (I also nodded off quite a bit in the first part). However, all of this is necessary for the proper interpretation and experience of the novel - they aren't side rants!I was surprised to find so much humor in the book, both situational comedy and literary sarcasms. On the allegorical level, I don't think I can fully grasp the whole scale in one reading. There is a whole chapter on the significance of Moby Dick being white but there was also a sentence in there poking fun at those that would attach too much meaning. Amid constant references to the deity like qualities of the white whale, I at times was not sure if the whale personified God or the Devil."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"It took me three tries in as many years to finally settle down and read this book, but I'm so glad that I finally did it. I have two copies of this book - the luxurious and delightful Arion Press edition, which I must recommend to anyone who loves the look and feel of a good book, and the Norton Critical edition. The Norton helped me get through the rough spots (and made toting the book around much easier), and the Arion Press edition reinforced the fact that Melville's Moby-Dick is pure poetry, a cerebral treatise on the nature of man, the state of 19th century society, and the meaning of madness. It's more than that, though - it's also a hilarious and engaging tale, as anyone who has read of Ishmael's first meeting with his savage friend Queequeg could tell you (I laughed until I cried!). Melville wrote with excellence on so many levels that I could continue to expound on the virtues of the book for days... but I won't. A great companion to this book is Ahab's Wife, which adds an emotional richness and helps a floundering reader sympathize with (or at least, reflect upon) Ahab's dangerous and heart-breaking quest to find his whale."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"It is like if it were scanned from book with a very bad recognision of the text.

Moby Dick is an exciting adventure story about a man named Ishmael who wants to go out to sea. He's a very poor man and he finds this hotel and he shares a room with a hooper. Hoopers are people who kill whales. Ishmael becomes friends with the hooper. One day the two friends found a boat owner and they asked if they could go to sea with the captain of the ship. The owner said, \\"why should I let you go?\\" Then the hooper showed the owner a target and used a rock to show how he could aim. The owner was so amazed at how good the hooper's aim was that he told them they could come on the ship. He said they should be there the next day. Later that day a man came up to them and he told them that the captain only wanted to kill one thing - Moby Dick.In another part of the book, the crew killed a whale and they made oil from the whale's blubber, or fat. Another time Ahab, the captain, and his crew saw another boat that had no oil and they lended them some oil. Captain Ahab asked the captain of the other crew if he had seen the great white... The other captain said she had not seen anything. Another time, Ahab's crew saw another boat and Ahab asked them the same question. The captain of the other crew said that he had seen him in the east. Ahab told the crew to head eastward.This book was one of the most exciting books I have ever read. Before I read this book, I didn't really like reading at all. After I read this book, I totally changed my mind about reading. This book should be a great book if you like adventure and the sea. This book keeps you very interested and you always want to know about Moby Dick or Ahab's crew.This book is similar to other books that tell adventure stories. Some of these are written by the same author who wrote Moby Dick. Some of the books are Treasure Island, Ten Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, and Peter Pan.If you read this book, you will learn a lot about Moby Dick, Ishmael, the hooper, and Ahab. You will also learn what you do when you go out to sea and are hunting whales and living on a boat with your crew. I suggest this book for young and old readers of any ages. They might find the book interesting or find it a little boring. To me, I would think they wouldn't find it boring.

There's never been another American novel like this. The Pequod contains all we know of the world, and the sea itself contains all that lies beyond our senses. That is the grand 'stage' of Moby Dick, which Melville fills not only with existential searching, but rich, colorful characters, and ever-increasing dramatic tension. It may sound grandiose, but I believe that a good reading of this book can you a more intelligent, more thoughtful human being.

However, as one of the other reviewers put it, it is not for everyone. Even some people who are really &quot;into&quot; literature may not care for this fine novel. That is simply because never has a book been written that has pleased absolutely everyone, without exception. But, I think the biggest reason many people don't care for Moby Dick is due to the fact that so many these days have short attention spans &amp; prefer fast-food type novels whose plot can be summed up on the back of an envelope. If that is your type of book, carry on, sailor - this book is NOT for you. On the other hand, if you have an inquisitive mind that enjoys powerful allegories, then this book is for you! I like to think of Moby Dick as an Americanized re-telling of Milton's Paradise Lost. However, the best thing about the novel is not whether I'm right or wrong so much as the extraordinary range and scope of interpretations that are possible. If you read one single novel the rest of your life, read Moby Dick. If you read more than one novel the rest of your life, read Moby Dick first."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"This is the best book I've read in my nearly 40 years, with the possible exception of the Oxford English Dictionary, and easily warrants a ***** rating. But the version I read was the earlier Penguin edition, the one annotated by Prof. Harold Beaver. Why Penguin would discontinue that fantastically thorough effort, and replace it with this utterly barren one, I really cannot fathom."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Haven't read for years but this classic is one of the great sea adventures. It should remain mandatory reading for all school students."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"this book is a true classic in every sense of the word. melville had a way with words that no one else can replicate."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"On one level, \\"Moby Dick\\" is a story about a monomaniac who sought to wreak vengeance against the whale that took his leg. However, on a more symbolic level, the book is really about a man who became tired of being pushed around by a supernatural force that would not be retaliated against. Well, as Melville shows us, Ahab wanted to reverse that situation by settling the score.Ahab thus states his position to God while watching a beautiful sunset over a calm ocean (Chapter 37): \\"I will not say as schoolboys do to bullies, - Take some one of your own size; don't pommel *me*! No, ye've knocked me down, and I am up again; but *ye* have run and hidden.....Come, Ahab's compliments to ye; come and see if ye can swerve me.\\"Those are mighty big words, considering whom Ahab was daring. And if you consider in the first place that Moby Dick bit off Ahab's leg as an act of self-defense, then it would seem that the real bully in this situation was the captain himself. But he had it in his head that Moby Dick was a supernatural agent carrying out God's divine will. So, Ahab's real vendetta was not with the White Whale, but with God. As we find out in the story, this was a battle that he could never come close to winning.If you really think about it though, Ahab really wasn't such a bad guy. After all, he was attempting to champion Man's rights before God and to protest the way Man seemed to suffer from God's unpredictable will, and these are all ideas that we as human beings can identify with. Nevertheless, such a challenge undertaken by Ahab was too much of a burden for him to handle, and in the end it consumed him spiritually.I really thought \\"Moby Dick\\" was an outstanding read. It was unsettling at times, especially in describing the practices of a mid-1800's whaling ship, but which made it all the more brilliant for how Melville used this material to fuel his metaphysical exploration. If you decide to read this book, be sure to have a dictionary handy, because Melville exercises the English vocabulary in all its diversified glory."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"What in our own lives is a monster whale? What would we foolishly die for?Those and other ponderous questions are the drive of Melville's message.Summed up? Big whale. One man chases whale, bringing others with him. Catches whale, but not until after whale rips apart boat. Problem is whale is stronger than the man and drags him into the sea.I've given away nothing. The suspense is not in not knowing what will happen, but in how Melville tells it.Readers without the patience to enjoy an active psychological drama will be bored, but try to see past the drudging of sea life and into the souls of each character.Man vs. man? Man vs. nature? Man vs. God? Hard call which this is, but it is all of those conflicts wrapped into one.I fully recommend this book.Anthony Trendl"},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Quite simply this is the greatest book ever to come out of the USA, and none has matched it since. In some ways it can be read as a tragedy or a gothic novel. It can be hard going, with in depth chapters on various details on the lost art of whaling and whales themselves. Melville worked on whaling ships for many years and had first hand experience of what went on, so too he heard the stories. Although some people I know don't like this approach to novel writing, I think it fits very well into the whole.Melville's novel is almost manichean in its nature. Ahab is a blasphemer, and a Cain like wanderer in quest of the monster that took his leg. It shouldn't be forgotten that Ahab was the king in the Bible who helped lead his people into idolatory against Elijah. Many of the epic motifs are here- the futile quest and dangerous obsession, man's struggle and sometimes hatred of the force's of nature, the danger of following the mad leader and so on. There is also a hint of almost black magic in parts. Most of the book is concerned with the ship and its crew and the sea and the White Whale, the two are pitted against each other. It is a book of the Elements. But whereas Ahab does not forgive the white whale, the sea &quot;forgives&quot; Ishmael, who survives to tell the tale symbolically by holding onto a coffin as the ship goes down.I think its message about leadership is important. Ahab's obsession is what kills his men. Moby Dick is merely defending himself. But his men could have easily prevented their deaths had they taken the step of mutineering early on.There's a lot I can't say here, because I'd just be repeating what other people would say better. Don't forget this isn't the only book Melville wrote- his short stories are amongst the best in early US fiction."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Some books need to be read in hardcover. Moreover, some deserve the loving attention and craftsmanship that have gone into this reissue of an original American printing classic. I lingered over this novel, twice, relishing the handset Goudy Modern type, and the illustrations, and the smell of the paper albeit typographic reproduction of the original,and I will return again. On entering the fantastic ( I use that world advisedly - eg, as in visionary, extravagant)world of Mr Melville's version of 19th century whaling on the one hand, and the mind of Captain Ahab through the eyes of Ishmael on the other, one is driven relentlessly forward to the inevitable battle between man and nature and man and himself. Startling imagery, evocative detail, and narrative drive seem to power the story off the page into one's mind, indelibly. A great story lovingly retold in this fine edition."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Very enjoyable classic. Great sea tale. Does have some long technical sections about whales that the author uses to bridge from action to action that are tedious. Just read around them if you want."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"This book has many interesting well-known aspects (e.g., it's indeed long and often boring, or at least prone to digression; but it is also a great American myth that gets better and better as it goes along and peaks in the bravura last 30 pages; and it is heavily and positively inspired by Shakespeare's best work.) Most of these facets are covered in other reviews that you'll read at Amazon and other places. But one aspect that is not really touched on in much detail by other reviewers is how very GAY it is.I assumed before reading it, that there might be some homoerotic overtones to a book about men who spend a year together out at sea. But what I didn't expect was how much the mythological aspect of this odyssey is tied to the philosophy that men are most fulfilled and find greatest meaning sharing their lives, bodies, and souls exclusively with other men. Not that there's anything wrong with that. But as a heterosexual, I was stuck by how much of the art and psychology of the book seemed to be cryptically but persistently gay-oriented.By the end of the book, after reading about Ishmael sleeping with and then ritually marrying a fellow whaler (admittedly without any sex explicitly mentioned), and chatting excitedly in the same bed together all night with him; and later seeing how much Ishmael notices and comments on other men's bodies; and culminating in a later chapter that describes Ishmael's near-ecstasy while running his fingers through the Whales 'sperm' while touching the fingers of other whalers doing the same with Ishmael gazing into their eyes, it made me wonder what Melville might have been trying to imply.When I finished and closed the book I thought that the artful and fantastic philosophizing of Melville, along with the originality with which he picks up the style and substance of Shakespeare's soliloquies to make his own points, mixed beautifully with the building adventure story to make a great statement about human beings' tragic universal struggle against fate and mortality. In the end this superseded and redeemed any distracting subtexts, and turned a rambling tour de force into a great work of art. But those subtexts are such a huge part of this book, that I cannot help but wonder if at its core -- at the emotional level -- the book is nearly as much about struggling with one's sexuality as it is about man's search for meaning in the highest sense."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Moby Dick was yet another shocker, the story was so much deeper than I expected. Even in areas you would not think, here is an example:-And Heaved and heaved, still unrestingly heaved the black sea, as if it's vast tides were a concience; and the great mundane soul were in anguish and remorse for the long sin and suffering it had bred.-You just don't find that in most modern writings! Every word has power and meaning. Every characters action has purpose. So if you want a deep book, and have a little time on your hands -the mountain of pages can intimidate some- sit back and enjoy a great story."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Moby Dick is not at all the book I thought I remembered from high school, when even the short excerpts we were assigned seemed over-long and intimidating, and the English teacher encouraged us to see the book first and foremost as an allegorical work. Reading the book now as an adult, I'm surprised at what an easy, engaging novel it really is.The most striking thing is how funny the book is. This completely escaped my notice in high school. (And the humor is certainly absent from any film adaption I have seen.) Ishmael's thought-provoking narration is full of droll, gallows humor, coupled with witty and erudite references to everything from the Bible to classical Greece. At times the action on-board the Pequod borders on slapstick (for example, Queequeg's rescue of Tashtego), yet the narration maintains this dryly humorous air that in all is much closer to Mark Twain than to Nathaniel Hawthorne. Imagine John Houseman giving the play-by-play to the Three Stooges, or Nicholas Cage's voice-overs in \\"Raising Arizona.\\"I could go on and on, but the basic point is that Moby Dick in the hands of an adult reader is a treat: exciting, interesting, thought-provoking, and often funny.

An exasperating tale - yet one worth reading in the final analysis."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"This book opens our eyes for different views; for maritime landscapes as well as for observations into the the darkness of the human mind and soul. There is a lot about agony and pain in this work, but never in excess, it simply belongs to the trade and the trip. Through the whaler we get insight to all the contemporary navigation, well to that of days passed, too; and through the spermacetti whale we get insight to the maritime life in general. The voyage goes more or less round the world, the crew is international and meets ships wearing different flags. In due course the reader perceives the inevitable final catastrophe but remains spellbound because he cannot guess how it is going to happen. Sometimes the book seems to be too demanding, asking too much of the reader's - but then one has just to remember how much it must have required from its creator. In a book like this there is a danger of repetition but quite as no day at sea looks like some other pelagial day, no passage of the narration is in any way a copy to some previous one."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Moby Dick was a wonder to read.

Read it slowly, like poetry. An epic tragedy that is either loved or loathed, it may speak best to those who have known obsession, those who divine the many biblical allusions scattered through the pages and those who have an ear for the dated cadences of 19th Century prose.The reader can't help but be awed by the maniacal Captain Ahab, who challenges God and nature, casts away all navigational aids, forges his own compass and ultimately relies only on his own cunning and instinct to search the untracked seas for the one thing in the world that consumes him, the White Whale.The imagery is rich. At one point Melville describes a deathly still sea as a great magnifying glass and the sun overhead as the searing point of light gathered and focused by that glass.A gold mine for the imagination, this book can be read once as a tragic quest, once as a work of poetry and once again as a huge metaphor or allegory.

It is a very long book which contains almost too much incidental information about whales but it is fully redeemed by its intriguing characters and realistic descriptions of whalers in action.The two main characters are Captain Ahab of the Pequod and Ishmael who is the narrator of the story. Ahab is obsessed by a desire to hunt down the giant whale Moby Dick which cost him his leg during an earlier voyage. Ishmael is an experienced young seaman who is new to whaling. The tale focuses on the Pequod's long hunt for the huge sperm whale.Melville is an elegant writer. I recommend MOBY DICK mostly for that reason.

I will not for a minute pretend that I understood much of what lay below the surface of this story, because I was reading it for pleasure and did not bother to give it the time necessary to truly appreciate Melville's genius. On the other hand, even giving it only half my attention, the book was still entertaining. Ahab's obsession, the action on the high sea, and the battle with whales were all intriguing and griping. I also learned a tremendous amount about the whaling industry and life on the sea in the 19th century. There is tremendous depth to this book, but even if you only scratch the surface it is worth the time and effort to do so once. I wouldn't recommend this book to someone who does not like 18th century literature (it can be extremely wordy and dull at times), but for anyone who has an interest in maritime novels, Melville, or is just curious why there is so much talk about Moby Dick, I would advise you to give it a chance."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"This is one of the great novels I have ever read!In the middle of a suicidal depression, Ishmel (Ishmael means \\"outcast\\") embarks on a spiritual voyage of self discovery (\\"some men look at a ball and pistol- I take to the sea\\").

Rather there was a later, more brutal injury that occurred when Ahab's new whale bone leg shattered and he fell on the jagged shard and it peirced his groin- you have to be sharp to catch this, but it is a key to understanding Moby Dick that almost no one spots.

Yes and no. This is not a book to be skimmed through as if it were the a new Grisham novel or the latest &quot;Left Behind&quot; installment (I confess I stopped reading &quot;Left Behind&quot; after the first). No, its words are poetical and poetry does not reward the skimmer. Don't just read for the story but for the prose itself. It is beautiful. That being said, I do appreciate the difficulty of the read. It took me about 10 weeks to finish. There are some bits maybe Melville could've trimmed up a bit. Six (count them, six) chapters comparing the heads of the Sperm Whale and Right Whale are more than enough. Also, the chapter or two devoted to different paintings of whales seem a bit much. The Reader's Digest version would, no doubt, keep the first fifty and the last seventy-five pages of the novel and hack away vigorously at the middle four hundred. But despite all this, if you do read this book, please finish it. It rewards the constant reader with a spectacular conclusion. It's worth it."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"After writing many works that discredited him, such as Typee, Omoo, Mardi, Redburn, and White-Jacket, Melville wrote Moby Dick as a way to redeem himself. Hawthorne roughly stated that Melvilles' writing of Moby Dick was a last attempt to regain his popularity with the public. However, many people took him as a fool. He would be doomed to spend the rest of his life as a failure. As previously stated, Herman Melville was discredited by all of his writings before Moby Dick. As a way out, he wrote Moby Dick, a story about whaling and a possessed man named Ahab. Ahab was the captain of a whaling ship named the Pequod, and seduced the crew into his twisted ways. This actually happens today with employers and their employees. Ahab lives on this quote from the 35th chapter titled the Masthead, &quot;Roll on, thou deep and dark blue ocean, roll! Ten thousand blubber-hunters sweep over thee in vain&quot;. The hatred of Ahab that drives this ship will also lead to the death of it and its crew. Thrusting his steel into the whale for three days at different times led to his death. On the third day Ahab thrust the steel into Moby Dick and the whale &quot;flew forward; with igniting velocity&quot; and the rope &quot;caught Ahab round the neck, and voicelessly as Turkish mutes bowstring their victim, he was shot out of the boat, ere the crew knew he was gone.&quot; Turning to leave, the remainder of the small boats' crew turned to return to the ship &quot;and now, concentric circles seized the lone boat itself, and all its crew, and each floating oar, and every lance pole, and spinning, animate and inanimate, all round and round in one vortex, carried the smallest chip of the Peqoud out of sight.&quot; The story line of Moby Dick was rather spelled out. Man meets man, they become friends, depart on whaling voyage, and one of them dies. Reading this book these days, might bring the younger less educated reader to the conclusion that this book is useless and is of no other purpose than to read for a class project. This is actually a well-written book by a well-lived man. Hawthorne states that &quot;When he pleases, Mr. Melville can be so lucid, straightforward, hearty, and unaffected, and displays so unmistakable a shrewdness, and satirical sense of the ridiculous, that it is hard to suppose that he can have indited the rhodomontade to which we allude.&quot;"},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"About 200 pages into the story, it is thoroughly enjoyable.

There are many biblical, historical, and mythical allusions in this book so I didn't understand alot of it. Herman Melville was a very intelligent man and I think one of the most accomplished writers in history. For someone to really enjoy this book, I think that one must be a big fan of literature and open-minded. If you're far from this, this is still a somewhat enjoyable book.

It is very dark and gothic and I wasn't surprised at the many references to Coleridge's \`Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner.'It's a book that I can say I have read but it was tough going and I wouldn't recommend it."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Moby Dick is obviously a rich and complex novel, a hallmark in the American literary canon and an important evolutionary step. That is why I recommend (unlike a previous reviewer) reading this book in an academic setting so that background and context can be elucidated for you. I am not one to wax pedantic, but serious books deserve serious reading. If you want to let loose, pick up Mary Higgins Clark.The book may have something for everyone, though perhaps not for me. Melville was doubtless a pioneer in his bold digressions from such banalities as plot and dramatic buildup to such quirky and informative sections as a detailing the sperm whale's sperm or the individual anatomies of the dozen better known varieties of whale. There is only so much whale I can take. It matters little that the whale himself is perhaps not as important as what he represents or what the human characters see in the whale.Still, there are enough beautiful passages full of poetry, adventure, and vitality to enchant your mind in between the tedious whale biographies. There is indeed enough weirdness in Moby Dick and Shakesperean structure to celebrate the beginnings of serious American writing. What most interested me in Moby Dick was the language, the inaccessible songs, monologues, and various allusions made in the darkness on the ocean waters. So wipe the spermacetti off your face and do a close reading of the text."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"A challenging novel, MOBY DICK is considered a so-called classic. Melville's musings on morality and depiction of man's search for the un-attainable, certainly, redeem this novel--as much as it can be redeemed. Were it not for his sophisticated style, this piece would virtually disappear from bookstores' bookshelves.For a novel to be considered a classic, it must contain universal themes; while we can relate to man's helplessness in the face of nature's cruelty and ultimate power, we struggle to relate to Ahab's dedication to defeating Moby Dick. Even more, we suffer through tedious passages about whales' physical traits, locations, lifestyles, etc.I am a patient reader and even enjoy the writing of Nathaniel Hawthorne--the man to whom this book is dedicated. I enjoy intellectually stimulating books and purchased this book for just that purpose. However, when it takes 495 pages (my edition was 521 pages in total) for the climax to unfold, I lose all interest--and hope--in a story. I was committed to finishing this book, and now that I have, I can declare--honestly and sincerely--this book is overrated. I respect others' admiration for this work of literature, but I believe bookstores need to move aside MOBY DICK and make room for more riveting literature."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"What a terribly dry book. I cannot concieve how this book has become a classic. The author could not have written a more boring book.The action is slow if existant at all, and written in a way that you would think if it was narrated you would think a sermon was being given.I picked this book up with the greatest intentions. I never read it in High School. Now I know why, my English teachers were sparing me the trouble."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Through these readings of Melville's Moby Dick, I find the study of human development starting with the ardent and aggressive male and finally when age advances, the older but wiser male remains to teach the young to avoid his pitfalls and follies. Even in the whale families, nature seems to follow a plan and sticks to it; and the young eventually follow the same path as their older and wiser teacher followed when he was young. All of the community of nature evens out in this process and the survival of the race continues. Men react differently to situations compared to women. Melville illustrates this in the whales by suggesting that if a male whale is attacked, his fellow mammals quit him and leave him to his fate; but if a female reserves a blow, all her female mammals gather around to help her, even to letting themselves be put to risk. In human society, men are usually more self-centered and independent while women can be nurturing and caring. But new ideas change the world and these features become universal in both men and women. Still I believe that qualities of independence coupled with nurturing combine to make a fully-rounded individual. I can see how my own children and grandchildren adapt innovative attitudes in husband and wife chores. Today both the husband and wife work and each one shares the tasks of caring for the children and the home. Usually the woman finds herself still being the central figure in nurturing and household work.Melville examines the whales and laws concerning them, and compares them to us. In this world, we have givers and takers. The Law protect the givers from the takers. But sometimes the two get so intertwined, the Law can be interpreted to let the takers take all and the givers end up with nothing. When Rights can be denied to one person, what can we do to protect this person? When do Rights become wrong? We must examine our lives and determine how we can help to make this world a better place and develop laws to protect the weak who can be left without succor.I enjoyed the trickery employed by Stubbs and his interpreter to the &quot;Rose-Bud.&quot; And I see the irony in finding the treasure of ambergris in the heart of the decaying fish. In life, we find treasures when we dig deep into our inner souls and bring forth truth and spirit. Our lives can be filled with treasure if we throw away the decay of sin and dying thoughts and expose ourselves to the light of higher aims and goals, to our ultimate destiny. Corruption of spirit can hide values that we need.I found so much hidden meaning about Life when I read the &quot;Castaway.&quot; It seems to tell such a powerful and moving story. First of all, the story centers on a lower class young black boy who ends up cut off from his boat, along in the savage and unfeeling mother ocean. When we feel that we are alone and deserted in Life, we know the pain that Pip must have felt. What helps us keep centered and sane when we are lost in the oceans of trouble here? Do we have an anchor and keep ourselves focused or do we aimlessly bounce around and end up lost and castaway? God helps me in my time of troubles and prayer keeps me anchored on the ocean of Life. When &quot;Pip&quot; turns mad, he becomes filled with heaven's sense, celestial thought free from mortal reasoning. He reaches out for God and finds Him indifferent to him. How sad this belief can be? I wonder if Melville sometimes had these same thoughts as his &quot;Pip&quot; does. This chapter made me think of how many times in my Life that I have seen people as castaways and I hope that I can say that I turned to them and helped them find their way back to security and love.I find a kinship to the chapters that Melville writes about human feelings and cautions us about being aware of our surroundings. . I feel that he wants us to know that we should be in control of our inner resources, giving love and warmth to our fellow men and he shows us the way through his mini-chapters on caring. When words fail, human actions make better communication. A hand held in warmth and companionship makes a lonely, forgotten human ready to participate in the circle of human kindness. I happily agree that squeezing can be fun, and it can also release stress! I have a little soft toy by my computer and when I get the tightness in my fingers from typing on the computer, I squeeze the little toy and what a difference that makes to my whole body. When he writes about squeezing the warm globules of spermacetti, I can understand exactly how he felt. Everyone needs hugs and squeezes!Melville exhorts us about being grounded and not looking too long into the face of the fire. We can get blinded by our own ambitions for gold and power and material things. We must search for understanding or become as dead wood, ready for the fire. Like Ahab, who centers his search for the white whale, he focuses on light, the gold doubloon. Only &quot;Pip&quot; says that &quot;I look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look&quot;(475). What could he be saying? But we all look and do we find what we are looking for? On the Pequod, the men are looking for the white whale and the golden doubloon stands blazing in their eyes to remind them. The doubloon remains a symbol of their pledge to Ahab to follow him in his monomaniac search. So who will get the gold? No one knows; but they are all looking. Pip speaks the truth from his madness; he forecasts the ending of this mad search.What an interesting allegory in the skeleton of the great whale found covered with Nature. Melville again uses the weaver in this story. I think that he wants us to look around and see how God covers the world with beauty. He creates a lovely paradise for us when Spring comes and surrounds us with blossoms and grass. He covers the dark and dreary world with new growth. He weaves for us a tapestry of Artwork unrivaled by any artist. Even in the skeletons of death and decay, he can recreate Life and flowering fields."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"A few years ago I spoke with one of the historians at the Mystic Seaport Museum of whaling abourt the Robert W Morgan, the ship used in both of the epic Moby Dick films. He explained to me that particularly for the 19th century man, a whaling voyage was one of the most horrible experiences anyone could imagine. The historian confessed that except for the top echnlon of ship's officers or highly skilled sailors who received significant portions of the voyage's profits \\"no one with common sense who had been on a whaling voyage would ever do it again.\\" Yet, Melville sailed several times as a common sailor on whaling voyages!Besides the personal and existential issues that this book poses, we have to also look at this as a book about the first invasions of the global personally indiscriminate capitalist economy into the early 19th century world of Ishmael. The New England villages which he comes from are small collections of independent producers who know each other, following trades or farming earth their parents have passed down in. Barter on most things was just replaced in the crisis of monetization of the New England economy that followed the American revolution which led to the armed revolutions and state civil wars in New England that forced Washington and the other \\"founders\\" to establish the constitution and a strong federal government to crush the rebels who wanted to go back to the demontarized past.Melville's character comes from a world where by and large everyone works for themself, their family, or perhaps someone they know.Yet, Ishmael is thrown into a new world, where he is simply an employee in one of the first world industries, the whaling industry. Rather than his own master, or learning to become a master in a trade, or learning to run the family farm, he is thrown into a new world where the world market for whale oil, whale ivory, and other products command him. Instead of the regular unfolding of crops on the season and trade activity reflecting that, Ishmael's voyage follows the whales around the globe, and its end is not regular.The author's use of Ahab and his arbirtrariness and the device of the great white whale, impose these new conditions in a way that emphasizes them and makes them stand out. Beyond the person issues, they represent the subjection of Ishmael and more and more of the world economy to blind, irrational to the average person, forces that will continue to conquer the world from Melville's time to ours, throwing us into periods of boom and bust, depression, recession, unemployment, insecurity, and world wars and rivalries.Melville's fascination with whaling is also shown by the many chapters which simply relate the many traditions and experience from the ancients until his day of whalers."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"This &quot;classic&quot; book was not what I expected it to be, it was very boring and kind of hard to read.

The type is large enough to read (unlike some other Modern Library volumes), the binding is sound, it's small enough to take anywhere but looks good on any shelf, and it contains original illustrations by Rockwell Kent. This is a REAL bargin for the price. This book will last you a few generations, unlike those disposable paperback versions with dense introductions by academics looking to pad their resume. This is the way an American masterpiece should be treated. This is as good as American literature gets, and this volume does it justice."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"In the first two pages of getting to know the Pequod, the description has circled the world, with references to (in order) France, Egypt, Siberia, Japan, Germany, England, Iceland, Ethiopia, Cannibals, Tartar, and the New World. Like the crew that the Pequod carries, the ship itself comes from all around the world, like the composition of the American demographic.This description leads to the \\"ship as state\\" of \\"ship as society\\" metaphor. If Melville did have the metaphor in mind, that makes the name Pequod even more interesting. He gives the name of a Native American tribe to the ship. By putting the white men, Ahab, Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask in charge of the ship, the whites have taken control of a ship that really doesn't belong to them. Also interesting, the grizzled ship, aged \\"more than half a century,\\" (67) is the same age of America as a nation when Melville wrote Moby Dick in 1850. Using the ship of state metaphor, the destruction of the Pequod would mean that the state destroys itself by its own ambitions and values. The implication is the self-willed extinction of the state. Like Starbuck, even if the destruction is obvious, men will not mutiny against the likes of Ahab or Captain Mason. Starbuck struggles but ultimately follows: \\"I think I see his impious end; but feel that I must help him to it\\" (148). The leaders are too powerful to stop. Even with awareness, the dutiful state will sail on to destruction. This image of destruction appears again in Chapter 96:\\"Then the rushing Pequod, freighted with savages, and laden with fire, and burning a corpse, and plunging into that blackness of darkness, seemed the material counterpart of her monomaniac commander's soul\\" (354).This passage conjures the image of a ferry descending into hell. The \\"rushing\\" Pequod seems to plummet instead of sail. \\"Freighted\\" gives weight to the ship. All hands on board get bundled into one word, \\"savages,\\" as if the ship has a bill-of-lading or manifest for when it arrives at its destination. Like a fireball or meteor, the ship is \\"laden with fire.\\" The devilish activity of \\"burning a corpse\\" reinforces the notion of savagery. The ship rushes and \\"plunges\\" into darkness, with dark being associated with the unknown or unholy. The last part of the passage contrasts well, as Ishmael compares this damnable ship to Ahab's soul. As counterpart to his \\"soul,\\" the savages relishing in fire, death, and darkness, seem to move toward destruction.Melville uses a complex metaphor in this passage. He foreshadows the ultimate demise of the ship, but also creates an image reminiscent of the Pequot War, particularly the burning of the Pequot Indian fort. Captain Mason reveled in the terror of the burning corpses. Hell, Ahab, industry, and darkness writhe together like an unstoppable juggernaut toward doom. Also, the fact that \\"savages\\" carry out Ahab's madness shows that the Pequod, perhaps like America, requires mad workers to perform the mad will of leadership.The passage on the \\"rushing Pequod\\" comes from a chapter that focuses on fire and industry. Chapter 96, \\"The Try-Works,\\" reeks throughout with burning whale flesh, and this passage climaxes with comparing the harvesting of the whale with the madness of the commander. As a captain of the whaling industry, the intangible \\"monomania\\" of Ahab's pursuit for greatness gets compared to what the workers consider a normal day's labor. This could be read as part of the national allegory in Moby Dick, because a leader can order men to whatever ends he pleases. Collectively, the workers enjoy a kind of frenzied monomania, and will carelessly work toward self-destruction while losing themselves in the joys of labor and camaraderie. The fiery ship plummets and rages with such zest that the thrill of the hunt and the kill seems to unite the tribe of men on board beyond any notion of forced duty.When Melville decided on the name \\"Pequod,\\" he might have intended to create an epic name for a significant event in Western civilization, as the Pequot War has the unfortunate distinction of being the earliest Indian massacre on the mainland. Also, Melville spends a chapter predicting the extinction of whales. Chapter 105 is titled, \\"Does the Whale's Magnitude Diminish? Will he Perish?\\" Ishmael frets while \\"comparing the humped herds of whales with the humped herds of buffalo, which, not forty years ago, overspread by tens of thousands the prairies\\" (383). He adds morosely, \\"the hunted whale cannot now escape speedy extinction.\\"The word Pequod drags with it the millstone of colonialism and the history of violence in early America. In Chapter 24, while defending whaling as an honorable trade, Ishmael says: \\"Whaling not respectable? Whaling is Imperial!\\" (Melville 101). Here we can see the difference between the word empire in 1850 compared to today. Ishmael touts whaling as the scout of Western civilization. The whaleship \\"cleared the way for the missionary and the merchant, and in many cases carried the primitive missionaries to their first destinations\\" (100). With the Pequot War being one of the first brutal Indian removals, the progress of America and the cultural monomania of Manifest Destiny gets projected onto the ship."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Most readers of Moby Dick seem to praise it for the wrong reasons and some miss the boat completely.Criticize all you want of Melville's scientific inaccuracy, wandering themes, or even his improper punctuation. The guy wrote this thing in a year - not enough time to refine it, and it was a book he knew would not sell.Underneath a mess of useless whaling information and Ishmael's rambling are ideas and questions that most people don't dare think about. Unlike Charles Darwin, Galileo or the fearless Ahab, Melville hid safely behind his metaphors and guided the careful readers to draw their own conclusions without completely leading the way.Let me explain.While to Ishmael, Moby Dick is nature's wonder and to Starbuck is just a whale, to Ahab Moby Dick is God, with his infinite power.There are some disturbing things in the universe begging for an explaination, such as why one person is rewarded with happyness while another punished in suffering. There are feel-good answers, like the idea that the score will be evened in the afterlife and there are humble answers, like the book of Job, which suggests that man has no right to complain or question God. Melville's Ahab takes this to another level when he asks why man needs to be God's puppets. Ahab is insulted by God's creation of man, letting man live in suffering, &quot;with half a heart and half a lung&quot;.The bewildered God-fearing masses will not comprehend the depth Melville trys to take them. This most important theme was written for the pursuit of truth, not happyness. This book is not for everyone, and a lot of chapters are better off skipped, but those with enough empathy for Melville will find an emotional and intellectual adventure."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"i'm only 120 pages into this, but totally capitvated. my question is this- how could someone create this immense work at a mere 31 years of age?melville's use of language is initally a bit jarring, but once you get into the rythmn of things, it soars like poetry.structurally moby dick is easy to digest. yes there are almost 140 chapters, but they are mostly short and largely self-contained.crammed with... well everything, moby dick is a staggering work of imagination, intellect and insight."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Reading Moby Dick for the first time should make us realize that English is a real language, and not just a verbal substitute for flag-signals. I know how this must sound for an English speaker - no offence intended. People with a bilingual upbringing, with Russian, German, Spanish, French at the side, know what I mean. It is the gift the mono-lingual is taking for granted. Multilingual people probably can never grasp what it means to completely saturate your temperament and persona in the verbal magic of linguistic perceptions. But they may have traded it for a heightened awareness of the complexity of linguistic interfacing with our world and our ideas.Even people who introduce themselves as professional writers sometimes complain of what they perceive as Melvilles cloying style, especially in the chapter on the Whales whiteness. But there is a lot more in it than &Ograve;that, although white is frequently considered a good color, in the case of Moby Dick, it is a bad one, because instead of being reminiscent of purity, it is reminiscent of spectrality on no less than seven and a half pages, including a 469 word sentence.&Oacute; With all due respect, if cut and dry &Ograve;message&Oacute; is all there is to imaginative literature, than it would not be worth bothering about. Forget the lengthy reflections, forget about plot interest, the Anglo-Saxon readers favorite obsession, even leave the character cast alone, they are weirdos anyway, every single one of them - Moby Dick is not the kind of book where these things matter.Instead focus on the intensity of a dream. Accept the exotic symbols of an alien world, as alien as the Planet &Ograve;Shakespeare.&Oacute; Accept the warped logic of a nightmare. Yet this is not likely how the product of an American high school education is to receive Melvilles gift to his nation. Not before somebody points out the similarities between Melville and Kafka. For such reader, literature hasnt moved an inch since the Vikings had landed at the shores of Newfoundland. But should you feel ready to commit yourselves to Rabelais, then you are ready for Melville, because you have reached the point where opinions are no longer taken seriously. Only the mentally adolescent is opinionated, and literally billions of adolescents crawl this plants surface, like lice on a bald midget. Opinions are cheap, everybody can share from his haversack.However there are things even I rather not see in a book of this nature. Sensitivity, style, rhythm and visualizations are the meat of a poem, great ideas are hogwash. Moby Dick is a prose poem, not an investigative report on the whaling industry. But Melville does not always exactly know where he is going. We know from his letters and messages to Nathaniel Hawthorn, that at times this book had carried away the author. Automatic writing is not exactly my cup of tea, and I suspect, Melvilles absolutely stunning stylistic abilities, cover up a lot of this sort of thing, and I am troubled by Melvilles archaisms. It can be as irritating as in Kiplings &Ograve;Kim.&Oacute; I just cant see people talk like that, at least not people of that period. As a biblical flourish, this kind of rhetorics is just preposterous.So what is going on here? An Einsteinian time dilation between (former) colonials and motherland? Or a case of Shakespearean intoxication? And yet who fails to be charmed by: &Ograve;Twas rehearsed by thee and me a billion years before this ocean rolled;&Oacute; (task: design at least two or three alternative and complete cosmologies to fit this sentence) or: &Ograve;All wars are boyish and are fought by boys, the champions and enthusiasts of the state;&Oacute; or the almost Virgilian &Ograve;Charmed circle of everlasting December&Oacute; that continues to &Ograve;going through young lifes old routine again;&Oacute; and notices that &Ograve;... on the heel of all this ... a cluster of dark nods replied&Oacute; to &Ograve;bisons with clouds of thunder on his scowling brow&Oacute; - if that can leave you untouched, go shoot yourself.If an entire universe can be captured between two book-covers, this is it. A fairy tale, cruel, heroic on the verge of the burlesque, full of hidden gateways to a different matrix in the configuration of things. The whale hunt and Ahabs hunt for revenge are really the least interesting aspects in this book. But of course one has to know where to look, and I am afraid few are prepared for such examination of the unexpected. Melville was not the type of writer who speaks in bumper stickers nor did he spew fortune cookies (apparently the language of democracy these days.) This accomplishment he left to giggle-peppered sitcoms and squeal-fests with a sprinkle of - whats the word? - &Ograve;spirituality,&Oacute; such as Oprahs show.Oh, and &Ograve;Call me Ishmael&Oacute; is the most perfect opening sentence of any novel. Nothing ever has surpassed it. Melville gave us the bible of symbolism, but when we try deciphering, we find ourselves confounded by tantalizing signals from deep space - sometimes garbled but always of an overwhelming beauty. This is the word BEFORE the beginning, and before it became flesh."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"If you care at all about this vital novel, don't purchase the audiocassette version of Moby Dick read by Burt Reynolds. I could hardly bear it after listening to the first tape. Reynolds' accents--often what come across as drunken rants--are sometimes impossible to understand, and he makes Ishmael sound like a silly old salt o' the sea. A great work brought low."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"There certainly seems to be a strong polarity on this page about whether this book is or is not deserving of its legendary status. Both sides have strong points to consider. If you watch MTV on a steady basis and think that Shakespeare guy was a dull card, don't even bother. If you are delving into the realm of classics and want a good challenge, this might be the place to start. But then again...Ignored or scorned upon its release in 1851, Moby Dick didn't achieve fame until the mid 1920's when professional writers and scholars 'rediscovered' the book and, impressed by the sheer volume of ideas and symbolism, gradually forced this monstrous text into the popular consciousness. Who doesn't recognize the words Moby Dick or Cap'n Ahab? -- though I'm sure the familiarity comes from watching one or two of the numerous movies based from the bare-bones plot rather than actually sitting down for a good breeze through Melville's incredibly convoluted prose. No one that I know of *really* reads a book like this for enjoyment; it's the academic masochist's delight, the forging ground of literature. If you can endure this, Faulkner and Dickens et al are cake in comparison.Well, OK, Moby Dick is not entirely without merit: several passages are extraordinary in design and achievement, notably 'The Whiteness of the Whale,' 'The Pacific,' and a few other random gleams of astonishing prose &amp; profundity. But then there are the endless days at sea described all too well. And the insomnia-curing Cetology section. And the character ambiguities and obscure symbols and layered subtexts all drained of power by a turgid style and a general inability to get to the point. Seriously folks, I'm an avid reader who averages 10-12 books a month...Moby Dick took me five months to slog through.This isn't quite as unfathomable as, say, the last works of James Joyce-most everything here is understandable. But, as has been proven time and time again, intelligent writing is not necessarily great, or even good, writing. To be blunt, Moby Dick is overwhelmingly boring, a self-indulgent mess.Is it worth it? If you are simply interested in the story, that of a man driven to insane lengths by an unfulfilled passion, go rent one of the movies. If you are interested in learning about human existence, I could recommend a thousand other classics to start with. If you love whales, I mean if you are _endlessly fascinated_ by the mysteries of the abysses and its myriad denizens, go ahead and give Moby Dick a try. If nothing else, finishing it is certainly an accomplishment to be proud of."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"The recent television film of MOBY DICK has fired an interest in Melville's classic, and that is a good thing.The unfortunate reality is that the book itself is a mixed bag.Never Melville's most &quot;popular&quot; work in terms of sales, MOBY DICK or THE WHALE is now his most famous, a reputation based upon (at least in part) John Huston's classic film version...AND the Patrick Stewart remake. Distilled from the novel in both versions is the exciting story of Ahab, maimed by the infamous White Whale, and bent on revenge.Readers coming to the book after seeing the film(s) are often disappointed by the fact that this story is almost incidental, buried amidst chapter after chapter of whaling minutia, outdated science, fractured drama, and long-winded philosophy. Fully three-fourths of the book is over before the actual story REALLY begins. And the titular whale himself, for all his fame, has something less than a cameo appearance.And yet, Melville's detailed descriptions--even in the most painstaking recreations of sailing life--are often quite beautiful and allegorical, though tedious. The fact that they stop the story dead for chapters at a time is sure to annoy the modern reader.In short, MOBY DICK is an &quot;important&quot; book that should be read, but the parts are far more interesting than the whole."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"This book, quite simply, is the greatest American novel ever written, and a contender for the greatest novel ever written. I defy anyone to read just the first chapter \\"Loomings\\" and not be caught up with the book's incredibly profound meaning, which is already evident there in the first 3 pages. Truly a masterpiece and worth every bit of fame it has."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"'Call me Ishmael' - thus begins a novel that the author describes thus: 'It is the horrible texture of a fabric that should be woven of ships' cables and hawsers. A Polar wind blows through it, and birds of prey hover over it.' Perhaps the first sentence is better known than the novel, perhaps not, but either way, Moby Dick is a sprawling epic on life in the 19th century, whaling, religion, good and evil, and more.The story is familiar to even those who have never read it: The whaling ship, the Pequod, led by the obsessed, monomaniac Captain Ahab, are searching for the Great White Whale over the oceans of the world, in part to avenge the loss of one of Ahab's limbs, but also because some other force drives the Captain, a dark force to his mates, but to him, the obsession that pushes him to chase the whale over half the world is nothing short of divine.The novel is broken into three rough sections. The first introduces us to Ishmael, and for the first hundred pages or so, we are firmly ensconced within his head, seeing what he sees, doing what he does. We meet Queequeg and board the Pequod, and for a time, all is calm, serene. The second section - called boring by many - focuses on the day-in day-out life of a whaling ship, with lengthy discourses on whales, how to kill them, the spermecetti that they produce, etc. In this day and age, with whaling illegal in most places - and even if it wasn't, the call for sperm oil has markedly decreased with the discovery of crude oil - the essays (as essays they are) on the facets of whaling life were interesting, if only because it is a life that neither you nor I will probably ever experience first hand.The third section, the final hundred pages or so, is the final climactic struggle with the whale. Moby Dick himself does not actually appear until the last forty pages, but he hovers like a spectre throughout the entirety of the book, always there, present, waiting. For the more aware crew he is a shade over their heads, a folly they cannot understand. For the pagans on the ship, the whale is an adventure, a rollicking good time that could very well net them the gold doubloon Ahab has nailed to the main mast. But for the captain, it is an obsession that overshadows all else, often to the exclusion of another man's life. The final section of the book in punctuated with lengthy monologues from Ahab, detailed, insane ramblings of a man who believes that his ever action is foredained, that the clash between the whale and his harpoon has been decided a 'billion years ago'.An interesting writing technique that Melville uses is having Ishmael slowly disappear over the course of the novel. At the start, he acts and reacts to events, speaks to people, visits places, but once the whaling begins, he assumes the task of learned scholar imparting his wisdom, lecturing on the ins and out of whales. By the time the hunt really begins, Ishmael hasn't been mentioned in hundreds of pages, becoming more of an omniscient narrator than a whaler on board the Pequod.Many, many biblical and historical references are littered throughout the book. Many things have obvious symbolism, and with a greater knowledge of the Bible, I wouldn't be surprised if I would've picked up on more. At times, Ishmael will discuss the impact of whaling, the virtues of good and evil, the horrors of the colour white, and more; this is no simple book about a man chasing a whale. It has staggering depths and dizzying highs, and while only a very few characters have been fully fleshed out - though I dare say Ahab is one of the better characters I have read in recent memory - the book transcends a mere ship adventure, instead trying to - and in some ways, succeeding - encompass the entirety of morality and logic. Tremendous."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Reading this book made me realise why such books are called classics. They survive time and all kinds of changes in the world because they are forever.

Otherwise a great reading experience."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"I am in my sixties and had never read Moby Dick. When I finished, my friend said, Did Gregory Peck really get swept away by the whale? Shows you how some people think they know what a book was about by the movies or what they had read in a review. I had no idea that Melville was so funny, so ironic and it makes me want to investigate what else he wrote. I loved the first-hand experience of what it was like to be in a fragile little boat racing with sail and oar to stab a whale upon a heaving sea! The technology of whaling was every bit as intriguing as the tale of the mad Captain Ahab pursuing his nemesis. Was fun to research what we know today about whales and compare it with Melville's accounts."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"If two novels should be taken apart as the highest achievements of the 19th century American literature, I'd choose Moby-Dick and Twain's Huck Finn.Herman Melville's tale of the White whale and Captain Ahab is not just a great American novel, but one of the greatest novels of the whole World literature. Still, I would not recommend it to everybody, as it requires quite much from its reader - mostly patience, as it can be even quite tedious at times. But the same goes also with Russian great novelists, Dostoyevsky and Tolstoi. In the end, though, with this kind of literary giants, you get the feeling that you have just finished a great work of art.Considering that Moby-Dick was written over 150 years ago, it's astonishing to find out how Melville has understood and foreseen the mechanisms of the 20th century totalitarian societies. For that's what the ship Pequod, with its strictly organized hierarchy and the complete despotism of its lunatic leader, Captain Ahab, represents. Completely ignorant to the opinions and wellbeing of his crew, Ahab, with his obsession to kill the White whale, is destined to take everybody along with him to total destruction. And this is, of course, exactly what happened in the Europe some 90 years later.There are so many levels within the text of this novel that it's impossible to put it all here. You can read it for its beautiful, poetic language, for the symbolic meanings that Melville has embedded in the story, for its highly exciting and tense storyline, culminating in the final battle between the Whale and Ahab (minus the long chapters that Melville concentrates on telling of the facts of the whale-hunting business, which aren't so exciting...).Moby-Dick is definitely NOT a book for you, if you like light and easily digestible prose. But if you want some heavy literary stuff of the highest class, you may try it out. Like all the greatest art, Moby-Dick is a work of a genius mind. As such it's a rare treat, even more so in today's consumer-like literature business."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Moby Dick is much more than a novel about a whale hunt; ultimately, like the mysterious designs on Queequeg's body, it becomes \\"a mystical treatise on the art of attaining truth\\" since, as D.

Of the numerous interpretations of Ahab's heroic quest for the White Whale, McKenna's seems to me to be the most convincing of all.As for the present handsome and wonderfully readable University of California Press 1983 paperback reprint (ISBN 9780520045484) of the famous Arion Press edition, it offers a beautifully printed text on excellent paper with generous margins and with 100 interesting wood engravings by Barry Moser of places, sea-creatures, whaleboats, and the processes, implements and tools of 19th-century whaling life.

This is one of the indispensable books for any good home library and, while I love my Kindle too, I'm old enough that holding a thick chunk of a book brings a real satisfaction that the Kindle can't just quite capture."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"I just finished Herman Melville's Moby-Dick yesterday. I read the Barnes & Noble Classics edition, which I found to be fine and had no complaint.As far as the work itself goes, I think it is most adequately summed up by a passage from Roberto Bolano's 2666, which I read over the summer and which inspired me to read Moby-Dick:\\"Now even bookish pharmacists are afraid to take on the great, imperfect, torrential works, books that blaze a path into the unknown. They choose the perfect exercises of the great masters. Or what amounts to the same thing: they want to watch the great masters spar, but they have no interest in real combat, when the great masters struggle against that something, that something that terrifies us all, that something that cows us and spurs us on, amid blood and mortal wounds and stench.\\"This truly encapsulates the experience of reading Moby-Dick. It is not at all what you will have expected, neither the linear whaling narrative nor the reductive \\"pursuit of the white whale\\" allegory of which you have always been told. Its excellence is far more in how different it is from other works, and in the continual meditation that it inspires on whatever it might have been that Melville's true goal was. Bolano is right, and the reader can truly see Melville struggling with something, which puts in place that rare feeling one gets when the author becomes a vehicle for a message that is not his own, but grander than he is.The narrative starts off in a straightforward manner, and lasts as such for the first 100-150 pages, at which point 5-25 page asides concerning the inner workings of the whaling industry begin to punctuate the story. Many readers consider these passages to be boring, frustrating, and beside the point, which at times they are. However, they offer to the inquisitive reader an easy opportunity for a fascinating long at an otherwise foreign and uncontemplated subject, especially in today's world. These passages can be viewed, on one hand, as simply moments of learning, in which the old adage that everything one must know can be found in literature still rings true.On the other hand, these passages also inspire that feeling that made films like There Will Be Blood great, and I think that any man today will feel a nostalgia for the time when physical frontiers really existed, and men abandoned civilization for that same pursuit of something dangerous and grander than themselves. So the book evokes that notion on two levels, which is part of what helps to create a veritable world into which the reader can step and, for a couple weeks, feel that he too is a strong armed member of the whaling industry.This book is, like Bolano says, a struggle against something dangerous, and the reader feels that throughout the entire, boding work, even if they might never find exactly what that something is. Don't be too quick to buy into the psychological interpretations of the book, for they are relevant but, in the end, i think severely underwhelming. The greatness of this book is not in the message, but in the body of it itself, and the way in which it must have been written."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"It really is an amazing novel. True, it takes time, dedication, and a vast vocabulary to read it. However, it is funny, touching, engaging, and insightful. A groundbreaking work of fiction."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Herman Melville, the author, shares many witty and serious insights about life and the foibles of human actions and beliefs in Moby Dick. It is not just about whaling, but a commentary in general about humanity. The description of whaling processes give the reader an insight into not only the methods of whaling, but the cruelty and savagery of killing such beautiful creatures. Even a person such as myself, who is against any whaling in this day and age, can appreciate Melville's commentary about whales, their personalities, their rights as fellow creatures to live on this planet!"},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"What can you say? It's Moby-Dick. The Barnes and Noble edition of Moby-Dick comes with a handy dictionary for all of us landlubbers and Carl F. Howde's footnotes flesh-out the Melville's esoteric references."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"This is a long, wandering read to be sure, but also beautiful and rewarding. But I couldn't stop wondering how much of this book, if forced to adhere to the more streamlined conflict/resolution editorial standards of today, would've been left on the cutting-room floor? In its pared-down form, would this still be the classic we hold it to be? Probably not. The Sperm Whale might be an endangered species, but books like this one are altogether extinct."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"I am one of those who firmly believes that Melville's non-fiction is superior to his fiction. &quot;Typee&quot; and &quot;Omoo&quot; are more to my taste. &quot;Moby Dick&quot; contains any number of memorable characters, scenes and philosohpical speculations, but, unconfined by the autobiographical incidents that formed his early work, Melville's mind and his syntax here ramble all over the place. It's interesting to note that this novel was resurrected from obscurity by Hollywood in the 1920's when it was adapted as a vehicle for John Barrymore."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"I had read this book before, but I just finished it for a literature course. I never realized how much symbolism there is in this narrative. It is extremely moving. Queequeg can represent Christ and Ishmael the common man. Many biblical/Christian themes are represented here--salvation, redemption, resurrection. Everyone should read this book at least once!!"},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"&quot;Moby Dick&quot; combines a rouser of a good adventure story, deliciously laden with profound symbolism all over the place, with many amusing digressions about cetology and the science/art of whaling. Some modern readers are not too taken with the latter, but I think each little jewel of a chapter is almost like its own essay, as Melville's thoughtful misungs paint a vivid portrait of things we can only imagine today. One should also not imagine that this is a humorless book, for Melville's wit is often prevalent among the perfundity."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"The whale. Herman Melville's whale. The whale of Ahab's tortured monomania. The appalling white whale that confronts you, tears your limbs, terrible in his wrath, imposing his power, his beauty, his wickedness, his divinity. Of course the whale is a symbol. But of what? So many things it is impossible to pigeonhole. Ishmael says several times that &quot;the whale has no face.&quot; The whale is like looking at a blank wall. It is a tabula rasa, a mystery, and throughout the tale affixed so many explanations that in the end he defies definition. Subjectivity reigns. Just examine &quot;The Whiteness of the Whale&quot; and &quot;The Doubloon&quot; chapters. Myriad ambivilant meanings abound. And this is what makes Moby Dick so great.Stylistically, the rhetoric soars. Contorted and ornamental, sentinous and profound, Melville's dark prose is masterful. Towards the end of the book the descriptions of the hunt, the chase, the horror, the madness, the violence, the destruction, the death, all transcend to a fury of grand, operatic scale. The prose moves like the Catskill eagle in &quot;The Try-Works&quot; chapter &quot; that can dive down into the blackest gorges, and soar out of them again and become invisible in the sunny spaces.&quot; Mellville's prodigious creation is realistic and romantic, turbulent and symbolic. It will last. Moby Dick is an epic of the sea such as no writer has equalled."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Having reached the mid-life point, I didn't \\"get around to\\" reading MOBY-DICK until just recently. I'm certainly glad that I finally stopped putting it off. Herman Melville's work is truly one of the most amazing books I have read. As others have pointed out here, it's not always an easy read, but it is well worth devoting time to. Indeed, I approached it as if it were an artisan cheese or a fine glass of wine; I ingested it slowly, savoring it over a period of months.MOBY-DICK is told (mostly) through the eyes of a seaman (\\"Call me Ishmael\\"), beginning with his journey to Nantucket to find a job on a whaler and then continuing with his voyage on the Pequod. The initial chapters (minus the introductory matter) are somewhat misleading in that they employ a traditional narrative structure--quite amusingly describing Ishmael's first encounter with the cannibal harpooner Queequeg--and the unaware reader who enjoys this initial rollicking ride may be disappointed with the \\"digressions\\" that follow.Once the Pequod sets sail, the narrative adopts the rhythm of a voyage, i.e., long days at sea, labor-intensive with respect to the upkeep of the vessel, but otherwise dull, interspersed with heart-stopping whaling and welcome encounters with other ships. This pattern of life at sea is reflected in the book's structure in this way: the long, uneventful days lend time to the narrator to present the history, science, and art of whales and whaling, while the whaling and ship encounters brings the narration back to a more-or-less (and often less) traditional narrative structure.The core story is well known, and would be familiar even to those who haven't much other knowledge of the work. (Anyone who's seen or read JAWS would recognize the story.) A psychologically scarred and physically mutilated man, Ahab, the captain of the Pequod, is obsessed with exacting retribution against the highly dangerous white whale that made him a cripple, not to mention killing many other men. His loyal first mate, Starbuck, tries to reason with him, but Ahab is unable to respond to reason; Ahab feels that he is acting out a preordained role.MOBY-DICK, which was first published in 1851, is a surprisingly modern work. Melville explores the story using multiple perspectives and various literary devices, most notably inserting chapters written as scenes in a play. An example of this can be observed beginning with Chapter 36, \\"The Quarter-Deck\\": This is a seminal chapter in that in it Captain Ahab explains the Pequod's true mission--to kill Moby-Dick--and his personal motivation for doing it: \\"Aye, Starbuck; aye, my hearties all round; it was Moby-Dick that dismasted me...\\" Chapters 37-40, which are given sequential temporal titles (\\"Sunset,\\" \\"Dusk,\\" \\"First Night Watch,\\" \\"Midnight\\") provide reflections on Ahab's speech to the crew from the perspective of three of the main characters, Ahab, Starbuck and Stubb; these are followed by a chapter written like a script of a musical play and which involves a number of crewmen. There is, in short, considerable exploration of and experimentation in narrative forms.What I found particularly moving were the small, almost painterly touches in Melville's writing, such as the image of a hawk in the far distance dropping Ahab's hat into the sea (Chapter 130, \\"The Hat\\"). Also delighting the reader are the intensely cinematic moments, e.g., Starbuck, standing outside Ahab's door and full of angst, ponders murderous thoughts while handling a musket (Chapter 123 \\"The Musket\\"). MOBY-DICK is a fabulous piece of art and is veritable literature worthwhile reading."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Moby Dick by Hermann Melville is considered by many to be the greatest American novel ever written. To come up with such credentials is no meek achievement for a novel, that was floating in wilderness for the first sixty years of its existence. The 1851 novel was at best ignored by readers and critics alike, till in the beginning of twentieth century, D. H. Lawrence declared it to be \\"An epic of the sea such as no man has equalled.\\" Thereafter two critics, Carl Van Doren (1921) and F. O. Matthiessen (1941) managed to convince the generations that followed that Moby Dick was not only a great novel, but perhaps one of the greatest work of fiction ever written.My only intention to quote this history before I write my own review is to point out that this whale of a book comes with contexts and content that make it a remarkable study. If I were to judge the book with dead objectivity, I think I would have sided with the reception this book got in the first sixty years of existence. Now I am burdened by the biases created by people in the last hundred years. But in what follows, I will speak my mind, in spite of what impressionists, critics, symbolists and literary hoi-polloi might infer due to an imposing reputation that this novel has begun to acquire.Moby Dick is an encyclopedia on whaling. It is an almanac about how the products that can be extracted from the body of a whale. It is a tome that contains endless entries about ships, whaling, oil business and zoology of a whale. As an epic, which it is touted to be, it cannot light a candle to the epics of the ancients, say Homer or Ved Vyas. There is an obsessive Ahab, captain of the ship Pequod, whose only motive is to kill the white whale, Moby Dick. He sets out on the journey with a set of \\"barbarian\\" harpooners. The book presents the imperialistic (White Man's Burden) thoughts of the age in the portrayal of the non-white races. The ocean roars in the background and there are sharks that chase dead whales. The hunting of the whales is described without creating much sense of adventure. There are innumerable notebook entries about this or that.The story in itself can be told in a few lines, but Melville choses to take us on an endless journey. Every now and then interlocking ships converse to fill in the interminable sailing time. For all the diversions and digressions into the plethora of facts and rumors Melville manages to supply us with, I would have liked him to put little more effort into those celebrated elements of novel as a form of fiction: plot, characters, story, climax and drama. The characters are \\"flat\\", i.e. they don't get altered by experiences. If I would wish to read a fable, I will always prefer the ones by Aesop or the ones by Vishnu Sharma (Panchtantra).On the whole, Moby Dick is a readable book, for it does contain some remarkable passages. With some editing, it could have risen in my estimation, and fared better in the era before symbolists explained that what is presented is not as important, as what metaphors, what allusions, (what illusions) it can inspire. Since the book is sold as the battle between the whale and Captain Ahab, I must add that the face-off between these occurs only in the last thirty pages of a six hundred and fifty-five page version I read. The build-up to the battle begins so far into the novel, that by then most people would give up. By the end of it, the reader is as exhausted as maybe Melville was when he brought his epic struggle of writing this to an end.Surprisingly, while I did find that I had marked at least hundred pages as worth revisiting (and that in my typical estimation makes it an awesome novel), I was more disappointed than not, after finishing the novel. Even in translation, the Russians and the French find favor from me and I feel transformed after reading them. I prefer and prescribe Lawrence, Maugham, Hemingway, Nabokov, Victor Hugo, Virgina Woolf, Dickens, Joyce, Marquez, Tolstoy, Tagore, Dostovesky, Prem Chand, Pamuk, Gogol, Austen, Forster, Rushdie, and many more over Melville. Be it for entertainment, word play, historical or mythical content or for sheer imagery or all together, I will recommend at least a hundred novels that must enter your reading room before this Whale rams its way there."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Melville's Moby Dick tells the story of Captain Ahab and his unwaivering obsession with finding and slaying a gigantic white whale of almost mythical proportions. Throughout the story, the reader is emersed into life on board the whaling ship, the Pequod, told through the eyes of Ishmael.The story goes from Ishmael's befriending of Queequeg to their trip to Nantucket where they are hired for whaling on the Pequod. They eventually learn that Ahab's agenda runs further than the usual run of the mill whaling expedition; he wants to find and kill the great white whale, Moby Dick. In response, the crew of the Pequod are coaxed and almost hypnotized into joining his dangerous hunt for the reward of a gold coin. Will the crew and their driven captain succeed or will their own greed and stubbornness yield an unfortunate fate?In my opinion, the early and end chapters are the best part as well as Father Mapple's sermon. While the tone and setting established by Melville certainly pulls you into the world of whaling, the middle chapters are full of side stories, whale lectures, and transcedentalist self indulgence which grows a bit old after a while. There is even some racial intonation: characters such as Queequeg, Daggoo and Tashtego at times are subject to racial commentary by Ishmael (who at times can be mistaken for what I believe to be Melville writing through himself). But, wheher Melville is a racist is honestly neither here nor there.The book can be interpreted in alot of ways such as the tragic consequences of man's greed or the relationship to God and man and nature. In fact, everytime I ponder it, a new interpretation emerges. Perhaps, that is the book's real beauty.There is really no other book like it. Some chapters for instance are literally a sentence long. Others don't seem to end. Melville even changes his style from time to time within the book. I guess, in the end, you not only read it, but also experience the book for what it is. A memorable read which anyone who finishes it should be awarded a medal for. Save a part of this country's history and read it."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Perhaps no other great book suffers to the degree that Melville's classic does from the tendency to abridge the Great Books for easy consumption by High School students. Sure, when you read it, in 10th grade or whenever, you get that essential tale of Ahab's monomaniacal pursuit of the White Whale, but you don't get much of the fascinating detail of the whaling industry nor much of the symbolism that makes the book one that rewards repeated readings.In fact, Melville's fiction is so densely packed with symbolism and allusions that it's sometimes hard to believe that he has any central message. This is particularly noticeable in the great short story Bartleby, the Scrivener. One finishes the story with no idea whatsoever why Bartleby has stopped working and given up on life, but the story is so open that you can give it any number of meanings and argue them all plausibly. Moby Dick is similarly amenable to many different interpretations. After initially being understood as a tale of the struggle against evil, it is now taken, mainly in the academy, to be an indictment of capitalism and industrialization.Personally, I like to think of it as a joyous answer to the dour Existentialists, with their insistence that life is meaningless drudgery. It is a curious thing that we should so admire men like Ahab, clearly grown demented in his pursuit of Moby Dick, or even a character like Don Quixote, whose immersion in the fiction of chivalry has obviously left him brain-addled. What is it we find so compelling in such figures ? I think it is their unalterable sense of purpose, however deranged. What after all is Existentialism but an expression of the desire that they too were guided by such a singular vision of the purpose of life ?We easily recognize that this is not the vow of a well man, but it's awfully hard not to get caught up in the passion, and the absolute conviction, that he evinces. To me it suggests that any man's life can be made heroic by his devotion to a noble purpose; though, as the tragedy that ensues makes clear, this devotion is best tempered by some sense of perspective.In the end, perhaps what Melville is best at isn't conveying a conventional moral or a message; perhaps what he does best is to tangle the reader up in the psychological mood of his central characters. Though the novel incorporates many classic themes--particularly the Biblical themes of crucifixion and resurrection and the great American theme of men fleeing the suffocation of civilization--it is truly unique. If you haven't read it since you were a teen, give it another try now; you'll be surprised at the complex and multi-layered tale you'll find in these pages."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"This review is written for a young person who either has been assigned Moby Dick in school or simply has heard or read about it and thinks to read it.I want if I can to help convince you to read this work.Like all great works of literature it works on more than one level. In one way it is an adventure story about whaling .In another way it is an encyclopedia that will tell you more than you want to know about the whole business of whaling. In a third way it is a story of revenge of the main character Captain Ahab's desire to ' revenge himself upon a dumb creature' who in a previous voyage was responsible for the Captain's loss of his leg. In yet another way it is the story of the whole human race as Melville gives descriptions of a great variety of characters of different nations and races. It is still another way it is about the whole question of the meaning of the universe, a question which is really investigated in the subject of \\" The Whiteness of the Whale\\" It is yet another way it is the portrait of American society at a certain time of its development. It too is many other things, including a drama in which conflicting characters play out their own special roles. One of the major delights of Moby Dick is its language which is so rich and so filled with interesting metaphorical language .The book is very long and it has long boring stretches and at times you may wonder what has happened to the plot , and if there is any really. But in the end the great adventure story does come to a remarkable and in some ways enigmatic solution.It is a challenge to read Moby Dick as it is to read all great literature. But in taking on you will develop your own powers of understanding and observation. So I suggest you go with it all the way to the end. And once you have done that maybe ' War and Peace' is next."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Just as I had figured out all the mythical symbolism, man vs nature, religion etc. Melville interupts to mock my pretensions and tell me that the story is perfectly true to life, it's all about killing whales for money, and not some &quot;monstrous allegory&quot;. But I can't believe that. The message of the book is not handed to you on a plate, you have to figure it out. The author speaks with lots of voices. This book left me deeply confused. I can't pretend to have understood most of it, but I want to read it again"},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Herman Melville's Moby Dick stands in relation to the American idea as Virgil's Aeneid does to the Roman idea. In this epic masterpiece, Melville tells the story of the tormented and obsessed Captain Ahab's pursuit of the white whale, Moby Dick, who maimed him once on a whaling voyage and has since come to represent to him the whole unresolvable problem of evil, human suffering,and the heartlessness of nature, the universe, and ultimately God. Ishmael, the narrator of the tale, follows Ahab's doomed quest and interprets philosophically the story of which he has become a part, seeing in the search for the white whale a microcosm of the state of humanity in general, and of modern, naturalistic America in particular. The beauty of the language mirrors the beauty of the world which Ishmael sees and interprets, and which so often seems deceptive in its promises of peace, friendship, and certitude."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"This classic story is one of the best books I have ever read, but not the best.

No other novel questions our existence as living, thinking human beings better. Though true that the plot chronicles the quest of a mad captain seeking vengeance upon a beast that maimed him, the book's deeper meaning of our relations to the universe cannot be ignored or the literal magic is lost. The novel addresses themes our of souls, relationships with each other, religions, morals, and ideas with such purity and genius that no other medium but the written word can convey it so beautifully. Moby is God, Ahab is Man, Starbuck is caution and religion, Stubb is ambivalence, Queequeg: trust, Fedallah: the devil.

His pseudo dialect is almost beleivable, however he is way over the top emoting and blustering through the dialogue. Then he continues on in the same monotonous bombast to read the prose sections as if they were also dialogue. The problem with this is an extremely irritating sing-song pattern, combined with his squeeking, yelling, and mumbling. It lacks all respect for the dignity of Melville's prose. Buy the unabridged version read by Bill Bailey. It is not exciting, but it is not irritating and does not get in the way of Melville's prose."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"This review pertains more to this particular edition of Moby-Dick than Moby-Dick itself. The story needs no summary or introduction. It's great and I would assume that by browsing here you have already expressed interest in the book, and so you should!However, the Modern Library Classics publication of Moby-Dick is subpar when put side by side with Penguin Classics, Oxford World Classics, or the pentultimate Norton Critical Edition. The particularly nice part of this edition is the original woodcut illustrations of Rockwell Kent. While this is certainly a nice touch, it does not help the reader as much as better explanatory notes would. Moby-Dick is a book saturated with symbolism and copious references to Biblical works. While there is a very sparce selection of explanatory notes in the back of the book, many difficult passages or more obscure references go completely unnoticed by them. The introduction by Elizabeth Hardwick is really no help at all and comes close to approaching the incoherence of rambling enthusiasm.Much of what makes Moby-Dick the amazing work of literature that is will be missed by a casual reader if he or she selects this publication. It's a truly American novel and one of the first to come out of the American Renaissance that asserted American writers were of equal, if not better, ability with their European contemporaries. It's an experience that should not be missed, but should be experienced with a better publisher."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Skimming some of these reviews I see a lot of descriptions of 'Moby Dick' as being \\"grueling,\\" \\"confusing,\\" and even downright \\"boring.\\" I don't deny that Moby Dick is all of these things, at times. Conversely though Herman Melville's masterpiece also contains some of the most beautiful writing that one is ever likely to come across. This is no doubt at least a small part of why this novel is one of the most divisive in American literature and why there are still such widely diverging views as to its meaning. Either way you don't get to just cop out and write this one off simply because there are sections that are difficult to sift through.The cast was, I believe, intended to be symbolic of the American idea, the American dream. The crew of the Pequod is sort of a rag-tag hodgepodge of folks from all corners of the globe. It's a ship where folks who had maybe gone bankrupt or previously experienced failures and hardship earlier in life can come to start over again. Ishmael perhaps representing the archetypical American \\"cowboy,\\" joining the Pequod without any real purpose other than for the adventure, the freedom afforded by the open seas, and the excitement of venturing out into the unknown.More than this was intended to be symbolic of the changes going on in American society the Pequod's expedition was, I believe, intended to be deeply representative of the issues that are at the heart of man's place in this world. While ostensibly the story is about whaling, it is more symbolically a story of each man's personal odyssey to give purpose to his own existence amidst sneaking suspicions (brought on by science and philosophy) that this life might ultimately be meaningless. The frequent encounters that the Pequod has with other ships reminds me of what Karl Barth called \\"sign posts\\" which are more or less symbolic events in our lives that point to something further, that beckon us to continue on our path. The captains of other vessels mention having heard of the \\"White Whale,\\" so there are signs that the Pequod should continue though the general sense amongst all with the exception of Ahab is that they're chasing a phantom, a myth, nothingness. With God in exile and religion out of most peoples lives there has been a similar feeling by many that life might be pointless. That all of our daily toil and efforts might be for nothing all the while never falling quite so deep into despair as to give up on this world completely.Ahab shows the most obvious manifestations of some people's growing mistrust of technology. Of how science can quantify our world without really telling us anything meaningful about it. His rage at having lost his leg is a reflection of the growing sense of despair over what seems to be the sheer randomness of events in our lives, at the way nature seems to act without reason, and how the most terrible tragedies can befall us without any provocation. Ahab's futile attempts to kill the White Whale are violent lashings out at the world, at nature; they are frustrated and misguided attempts to push back on the forces acting on him. This is an intrinsically human reaction, namely we seek to destroy whatever we can't bring under our thumb.Obviously this book is just loaded with symbolism and allegory so there are many ways in which to interpret this book. One shouldn't forget this fact because Moby Dick is a book that was meant to be read more than once. I personally have only read it once but it is a book that begs to be gone over repeatedly in order to get the most out of it and I do sincerely hope to read this wonderful book again someday.What probably prevents alot of folks from going over it again are the seemingly endless descriptions about whales and the 19th Century whaling industry. Like, about half this book is a treatise on whaling. It's difficult to understand exactly why this is done. I'm guessing one reason could be that this was written at a time when alot of folks didn't have things like \\"Free Willy\\" or the Discovery Channel that would allow them to truly appreciate the majesty of the whale or even what a whale was or looked like. Another reason could be that this whale chronical may have been another way to show how we can quantify nature, we can describe it, but we still end up powerless against it in the long run.Whatever his reason's for adding this I don't think Melville made his novel any more compelling or meaningful with all the whale talk. To be perfectly honest it can be a real chore to get through some of those parts. Still, I'm giving this book a 5 because of it's exquisite imagery and because of its incredibly insightful look at humanity, at our contradictions, and how the intensity of our desires seems to blind us to how fragile and vulnerable we really are. Melville is able to express modern man's confusion and despair without leaving the reader in a state of hopelessness. Quite an incredible accomplishment really, something few philosophers seem capable of. Also, I would think the collective weight of the world academic community outweighs alot of these negative reviews.Classic."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"There are aspects of this story that are awe-inspiringly brilliant. \\"To the last I grapple with thee; from hell's heart I stab at thee; for hate's sake I spit my last breath at thee!\\" What a line! Khan would have been so boring without it in Star Trek II.On the other hand, the chapters about knots and ropes, etc. are extremely tedious. Unfortunately, that accounts for most of the content.If you take on the challenge of reading this book, you should understand that the novel itself may become your own white whale. Completing this book can become a nearly impossible task.Remember, though, that Moby Dick's close affiliation with Trek's Khan has inspired many young trekkers to slog their way through this book. If you can't finish it, you might just become known as someone with less intellectual fortitude than a Star Trek fan. Do you really want that?Finish the book. It'll be good for you....like brussel spouts.Note: No offense is intended to Star Trek fans. I claim the distinction of being one myself."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"What I thought was great about this book was that it teaches you to not get carried away with what you want.Sometimes if your not too careful it may even lead to death.(just like what happened to Captain Ahab)"},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"I can't believe I reached my 30's (even majored in English) without reading Moby Dick. I was turned off on Melville during college when an overzealous teacher assigned us what he called Melville's &quot;worst book,&quot; Pierre, Or the Ambiguities. I still don't remember WHY he chose that one, but it was not particularly good. So, while I hunted down many classics, this was not one of them. Then, after finding an old edition in a library sale for $.10, I decided it must be a sign. I was completely enraptured from the beginning. The opening chapters that describe Ismael and Queequog's relationship are stunning. Then, the focus shifts and like the crew, we become accustomed to life on the ship. In fact, the process of reading Moby Dick mirrors the process of getting your sea legs. The years at sea drag on almost as long for us, but I don't mean this in a bad way. I found the whaling chapters fascinating although I did expect to be bored by them. Looking back, it's interesting that Ishmael becomes so secondary in the middle of the book we feel a kind of literary illusion that he disappears until the end. Instead, we take on the characteristics of the crew watching with horror as fixation takes over Ahab. My favorite scene takes place when Ahab is so crazed in his single minded pursuit that he turns down the captain of the Rachel's request to look for his lost son. Though reading Moby Dick is a struggle, lots of great literature doesn't come easy (Magic Mountain comes to mind) -- if you're up for the challenge, go for it. It's infinitely rewarding for a strong reader. Plus, you can always rent the movie with Gregory Peck which is pretty damned good and much shorter!"},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Many of the so-called &quot;literary&quot; types will scoff at the title of my review, stating that anyone who doesn't appreciate Moby-Dick must be uncouth and un-intelligent. But I beg to differ. Any novel, no matter its reputation, should be challenged rather than be blindly accepted as a masterpiece. I proceeded to do so with this novel, and I was surprised by the outcome. To be blunt, this novel was hard to follow, with its numerous mythological and Biblical references, along with its difficult vernacular and extremley long sentence length. The story underneath all the surface is interesting, but even that couldnt overcome the weaknesses. I valiantly tried for two months to finish this book, but I couldnt get into it at all, so I finally gave up. Maybe somewhere down the road I will try again, but the point is that nobody should accept things because of what the status-quo say is correct. Give it a try and form your own opinion. You may agree with the multitude, or you may agree with me."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"When I first read Moby Dick, I'd already seen the movies that were made about it. I thought I knew what the book was about.I was wrong.Moby Dick is a great classic American novel about a whale hunter. Yet it hinted at some ideas that are not easily rendered, and many times can best be communicated with metaphors.On the surface, we have the story of Ahab, as narrated by Ishmael; Ahab was the captain of the whaling ship that was driven mad after the White Whale bit his leg off. A classic example of obsession. Yet if we look deeper, the book has very little to do with \\"monomania\\" and everything to do with understanding one's true nature and purpose in life - and doing it to the exclusion of all that isn't your own purpose.The whale itself is - among other things - the constant opposition that we face in order to achieve the fullness of our being. This struggle never ends. It cannot be defeated in this earthly existence. It is entropy which we struggle against, and only in dying do we conquer death. \\"And that the great monster is indomitable, you will yet have reason to know\\".Ahab wasn't so crazy as most people would have us think. His \\"monomania\\" was simply the focus upon a purity of purpose. Like when you throw a punch; you think of nothing but the punch - if you think at all. Zen and the Art of Face Punching!! The old Buddhist saying \\"Never whistle while you're pissing\\". But even this hints at a greater reality, that all that exists is the manifestation of God's Will. Not in some vague Christian sense, which can contain no real meaning. But in the sense of what it actually is. \\"Is Ahab, Ahab? Is it I or God that lifts this arm?\\"And there is within this the inescapable truth that we ourselves must strive toward the purity of purpose. We cannot know anything unless we immerse ourselves in it. But doing so will always change us, forever. I am not the same musician I was 20 years ago. I am trying to face truths about music that I couldn't even imagine back then, and dared not contemplate at the time. So it is with all things we do when we're in this earthly life. The old jazz musicians; they pursued their own White Whales; at the risk of everything. And they paid dearly for it, and were rewarded dearly as well. \\"So there is no earthly way to know what the whale really looks like. And the only way in which you can derive an even tolerable idea of his living contour is by going whaling yourself; but by doing so you run no small risk of being eternally stove and sunk by him. Wherefore it seems to me that you best not be too fastidious in your curiosity concerning this Leviathan.\\"These greater Jihads, these inner struggles, are the only thing that truly make us noble creatures; for without them, we are less than primates. \\"From beneath his slouched hat Ahab dropped a tear into the sea; nor did all the pacific contain such wealth as that one wee drop\\"Have you ever noticed how in may Buddhist paintings, the Boddisattvas are always standing in hell?If you look at the chapter \\"the Symphony\\", which precedes the Pequod finding the Whale, you'll realize that it was in that chapter when Ahab won his inner battle. It was when ultimate Truth finally came to him. It was the supreme moment of realization in the same way that Arjuna in the Bhagavad Gita faced his own moment when he stood on the battlefield and fell to the ground because of the truths that Krishna had revealed to him. The greatest warrior in the world was defeated by a truth larger than his heart could contain. It was too much for him to bear; and he could only bear it when he went through that transition. His own soul had to evolve: and that evolution was not slow and easy: it was cataclysmic. An apotheosis. Same thing with Jesus telling his Disciples that he had many things to tell them, but they couldn't bear them yet. The last three chapters and epilogue of Moby Dick were the inevitable result of accepting that truth; and the Flow taking him through to the next phase.Ishmael! Strange that the narrator should have that name! Ishmael was one of Abraham's sons, as you know. And despite what Jewish and Christian fools claim, the Book of Genesis made it clear that prophecy and a mighty nation was promised to him. The Biblical Ahab was a king who was killed and dogs ate him. Again, going through a trial by fire, and emerging transformed.And here's another thought: could it be that Ishmael was not a member of the crew, and that he was actually Ahab who survived the encounter with the whale, and was transformed by the \\"transitional phase\\" of his death? He spoke rightly of Ahab in the second person because he was no longer that person. Ahab \\"died\\" and emerged a different person. You'll also recall that he used Queequeg's coffin as a boat to make his way to land. Why do you suppose that its; because it floats?The \\"old\\" self dies and a \\"new\\" self is born - another painful experience. The ego protesting against its own growing pains. And all this is driven by the soul's desire for union with Divinity: an act of love. The erotic is the same primordia as spiritual ecstasy vibrating at a lower frequency. All this, ironically, the base part of our being struggles against. \\"He knows himself and all that's in him, who knows adversity. To scale great heights, we must come out of lowermost depths. The way to heaven is through hell. We need fiery baptisms in the fierce flames of our own bosoms. We must feel our hearts hot - hissing in us. And ere its fire is revealed, it must burn its way out of us; though it consume us and itself\\"There are kinds and kinds of deaths! Have you forgotten the Sufi idea of \\"death before dying?\\" \\"Glimpses do ye seem to see of that mortally intolerable truth; that all deep, earnest thinking is but the intrepid effort of the soul to keep the open independence of her sea; while the wildest winds of heaven and earth conspire to cast her on the treacherous, slavish shore? But as in landlessness alone resides the highest truth, shoreless, indefinite as God - so, better is it to perish in that howling infinite, than be ingloriously dashed upon the lee, even if that were safety! For worm-like, then, oh! who would craven crawl to land! Terrors of the terrible! is all this agony so vain? Take heart, take heart, O Bulkington! Bear thee grimly, demigod! Up from the spray of thy ocean-perishing - straight up, leaps thy apotheosis!\\"Have you noticed that people often think struggle and suffering are the same thing? You think pain and misery are two words describing the same experience? Ah, my dear readers! Meet the little \\"whale\\" hidden within linguistic constructs that bites off our legs again and again!Ahab's place in the flow was to meet the whale and conquer it. To face that \\"whale\\" was the only right choice he could make.Do not think Moby Dick was only about a whale that bit off Ahab's leg, then he lost his mind, and went fishing. Killing the whale in a mad act of revenge is the last thing Moby Dick is about. People have been making that mistake for a century and a half. The obvious is in front of them and they miss it. They see only the surface; and are blinded by what they see. Its no wonder Moby Dick was unknown for decades and Melville died in obscurity. To this day, only a handful of people understand the books' real message."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"When one looks over the vast array of American Literature, there are but a few books that are ranked in a class by themselves. They include such novels as \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\", \\"The Scarlet Letter\\", \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\", and \\"The Jungle\\". In any \\"greatest list\\" I've seen, \\"Moby Dick\\" always shows up. In fact, only Huckleberry Finn draws more support as the Great American Novel. With this in mind, I decided that it was high time I read \\"Moby Dick\\". In doing so, I was prepared to appreciate a classic with my only misgivings being my tendency to get bogged down in the tedium of the 19th Century style of prose.I admit that I was fairly satisfied with the first part of the novel and I was proceeding along fine until Ismael turned into the world's greatest authority on the subject of whales and whaling. I may have missed a point or two but I was sure that Ismael's self-introduction identified him as a merchant marine who was embarking on on his first whaling voyage. He must have been doing a lot of reading on the voyage because he proceeded to tell me more that I ever wanted to know about whales and whaling.I read \\"Moby Dick\\" to enjoy a story; not to engorge myself with, for me, uninteresting trivia. The facts overwhelmed the story and I was losing interest fast. I finally started to speed read my way through the final 50 pages and all of the accompanying \\"Billy Budd\\". I have seldom been so happy to finish a book and I even entertained the thought of just chucking the book and not even finishing it. I realize that there are many thousands of people out there for whom the sea is an enchantress. I also understand that Captain Ahab's maniacal search for the great white whale has allegoties about ourselves (although I wasn't all that motivated to dwell on that subject).\\"Moby Dick\\" is not the first classic to fall short in my estimation and I'm sure it won't be the last. I mentioned above that I don't care for 19th Century Literature in general (Henry James \\"The Turn of the Screw\\" put me to sleep). However, Mark Twain is my favorite author and he seemed to be able to communicate his stories in an enjoyable yet profound way. Oh well, to each his own."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Seen through the eyes of one Ishmael, this is the story of Captain Ahab's obsession with the white whale, Moby Dick. Having lost his leg to the whale, Ahab is now on a mission of revenge upon this mighty leviathan. The whale exhibits odd intelligence and ferocity, having evaded hunters and taken many a man's life. While the book is exquisitely written with intriguing characters, the author tended to slip into page upon page of explanatory notes. This breaks up the story line and is a distraction. The story itself however, keeps you reading. Complete with all the gory descriptions of the whaling business, Moby Dick is a good book, but a slow read. Call me what you like, but not Ishmael..."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"I first read \\"Moby Dick\\" many years ago in high school and hated it. I thought I would give it another shot to see if time and age had changed my perspective. Well, sort of. I had always liked the basic storyline - that of Ahab's relentless pursuit of the great white whale and how (his) obsession, taken to extreme, ultimately destroys. But there were still a few things that kept me from fully appreciating \\"Moby Dick\\" as a great novel.I am still not a big fan of Melville's writing style. I found his writing to be erratic - very slow in some sections then very rapid in others. And the manner in which he switches from Ishamel's first-person narrative to third-person narrative was somewhat awkward. Then throw in a couple of chapters that are scripted like a stage play and you have a book in which I could not find any true cadence. I found myself battling (then and now) through the chapters futilely trying to get into a flow where the pages would just sweep me along.Secondly, as noted, many chapters were devoted to describing the whaling industry and the whales in great detail. I understand that in Melville's time it was common to write novels that educated as well as entertained. But the extent to which Melville elaborated in those chapters really disrupted the storyline's momentum which had to be kick-started in later sections. The transition from a fictional narrative to a lengthy non-fictional discourse was a little too stark.Finally, Ishmael's/Melville's continual philosophical meanderings were somewhat stretched. As Ishamel stands upon the mast-head relating the operations of whaling with the whole history of mankind or when during a thunderstorm Melville draws parallels between the unrest in nature with the unrest on the Pequod.....well, those seemed to be a bit of an overreach.There was much about \\"Moby Dick\\" that I liked and there is much about this Melville work to be admired but I still found it to be a labor to read. Better the second time around. For me, \\"Moby Dick\\" is good novel but one in which I could not find greatness."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"This is a story of a man with a painful soul who hunts god/whale and the sacrifices made by fate to save this one soul. It is amazing writing, I was surprised in the begining with the sense of humor, and I love the struggle to understand something higher in this book."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Let me open by saying I am usually quite skeptical of \\"must reads\\" from the literary canon by \\"dead white males,\\" so much so that when I started this book, I fully intended to not like it at all. This book truly belongs in the top five of most important novels in American Literature (as an aside, I would put Beloved, Scarlet Letter, Huck Finn, and probably Invisible Man as the other 4.) One of the things that I did not expect is how downright funny parts of this book are. Look for the scenes when Ishmael meets Queequeg, and the truly lowbrow humor in the discussion of the bishoprick and the pythagorean maxim (why high school teachers don't focus on these parts to get students interested is beyond me). The novel also speaks to America as a nation at a time when we were still trying to figure out just what America was in 1850; it also makes subtle references to how the western world interacts with non-western people (e.g. the name of the ship they were on). It also speaks heavily to psychological issues, mostly involving Captain Ahab--not only his obsession with the whale, but how he keeps his hold over the crew when other crews would have mutinied. The middle parts of the novel, where Melville lifts pages whole cloth from whaling books, are the only reason I couldn't give the book 5 stars. It truly is a must read--and I don't say that lightly--both for its own intrinsic value and for its role as one of the core metaphors for our society."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"The story of Moby Dick, the elusive whale, and Captain Ahab's constant quest for him is one that has been around for a long time, and it has been assimilated into our culture. The book is more than just a quest after a big whale. It is a complex tale that Melville brings a number of disparate elements to. It is an adventure romance, an epic quest. A Faustian bargain and a psychological tale which delves into the mind of Captain Ahab. We see how this quest affects his mental stability, and we see to what extent he will go to achieve his goal. I did find the novel rather long though. Perhaps there was too much moralizing and philosophizing. But it is still an important novel, and should be included in the list of classic literature that should be read."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Man, lots of the reviews on here are pretentious, talking about all sorts of hidden messages of the book that don't exist. Herman Melville was a whaler, and wrote a very long and boring book about whaling. Seriously, this book is not an adventure. It is 540somepages of boring whaling details. I don't think half the chapters (there are about 100 some chapters, most about 2-20 pages long) are necessary to the story of the book, but are just filler about whales and whaling because the story is lame. I suppose perhaps not much happens at sea from day to day.This book is over rated, and shouldn't be as well regarded as it is. Read something fun like Dostoevsky instead."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"This book is HORRIBLE! Classic, my eye! I would love to know what's so great about this book.

I was FORCED to read this while finishing college, and the Professor (if that's what he should be called) went on and on about the symbolism, the allusions, etc...it is the WORST BOOK I have ever read. Honestly, Over 400 pages devoted to killing a whale because it ate your hand? Come on. When Melville wrote this wannabe classical crap, it was shunned by the readers of his day and was poorly reviewed. THEY didn't even like it! Also, I've read short stories by him too...and they all suck! He is probably one of the worst \\"classical\\" writers ever!

I like this book very much. I enjoyed reading it. This book is written using the 1st person point of view. It's like reading someone's journal.

You have to think about it and even maybe you have to learn them carefully.This book I recommend to everyone to read because I think this book is suitable for youngsters and also for adults. For those youngsters, you guys have to be patient during the reading because this book is somewhat heavy for us.

All other symbolic books or classics are held up to Moby Dick and normaly receive an unflattering comparison. Hearing all this wonderful dogma, I went out to read Herman Melville's MOBY DICK. I found it dry and inconsistent.Moby Dick is a sea-faring tale by an author who adamently denied any symbolic inflection whatsoever in his book. I found it very jumpy, whereas Ishmael would divulge his thoughts on many and varied subjects such as the nature of whales. Suddenly, you find yourself a month ahead of where you thought you were. The insigts on Ahab are masterful, however, as well as the symbolism. (Melville would kill us all.) That is the only thing that saves this book.If you will take some advice from a fellow bibliophile, don't bother to read this &quot;book to end all books.&quot; It's not worth your time."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"A group of diverse men risk life and limb and are required to commit morally suspicious acts to provide for society's energy needs.Sure, this work is a classic for a number of reasons, but I don't have the credentials to speak to that.

Slaughtering a species to near extinction for candle oil was only a precursor to pumping the world dry of crude oil.Also, while Ahab's war on Moby-Dick and George W. Bush's against Saddam Hussein don't line up perfectly, one clear message from this novel is that unilateral decisions based on vengeance usually don't work out so well.I'm taking a star way for that whole middle section with the blubber.

Set in the 1850's, this story tells of Captain Ahab and his passionate quest to get his revenge on the whale which severed his leg on a past sea-voyage. The story is told by Ishmael, who along with his newly-found friend Queequeg, embark on this most fateful journey.This book really expresses the heart and soul of men who spend many years of their lives away from their loved families and friends to pursue and kill the proud sperm whales of the deep blue. When reading Melville's description of life at sea, you really get a feeling of a sad dignity to the whaleman's life as he travels the globe. This novel isn't so much about a whale, but about one man's intense sorrow and desire for vengence and the lengths to which he'll go to acheive his victory over a foe which seems almost to exist solely to torment him. It's a book rich with commentary on the depths of one's soul.Although this story is told by Ishmael, much of it is written more by an omniscient narrator. Certainly, there are many scenes which are described in detailed which Ishmael's character certainly couldn't have been present for. In fact, Ishmael himself hardly seems to play much of a role in the events within the novel. But, he does spend many chapters describing the sperm whale, such as it's dimensions, eating and travelling patterns, the various goods its body produces, etc. He speaks of this so much at certain points it's almost a little too much. But, he gives wonderful details which suggest Melville really did some in-depth research for this novel.I can certainly see why this is a classic. It's so very well-written and reading it made me wish so much I had this type of literary talent. The descriptive language is very beautiful. The characters all seem so real, particularly Captain Ahab, who's seems to be burdened with a good nature, but heavy heart. Although the novel may seem a little slow or long at some points and the lengthy description of the Sperm Whale can become tedious, it's well worth wading through these low points to enjoy this wonderful tale. I think this is really a great book and certainly worth reading."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"This book surprised me. I mean, I knew it was a classic, but it isn't structured like any other book I've read. It starts out as a conventional story about this guy names Ishmael, it turns into a recasting of the whole whaling tradition in terms of American enthusiasm and resourcefullness, and then finishes as pure drama. Yes, there are some slow parts, but they seem real. As if Ismael/Melville is trying to convince the reader, a landlocked American in 1851, that being a whaler is interesting, understandable, and as stark a struggle with nature as the life of any frontiersman or explorer."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Quite apart from, some might say in spite of Moby Dick's label as &quot;a classic,&quot; it has become one of my favorite novels. It breathes with a life that the rest of Melville's work (with the possible exceptions of &quot;Bartelby&quot; and the &quot;Lightening Rod Salesman&quot;) lacks.The reason I'm writing a review of the book (my voice has little to add to what others have already written about the text) is to encourage readers to pick up the modern library version. The illustrations add so much texture to the story. They are not imagination robbing images, their semi-surreality expands rather than narrows mental freedom. Get it.

For those of you that were wondering, the biblical references and the protracted prose are all parts of a much larger, grander scheme, and if you wail and knash your teeth at these alone, it just shows you didn't really understand what the book was about. If you don't try and enjoy it as both poetry and prose, you will fail miserably at enjoying it - it is an immersion completely unlike anything else. And if you spend a lot of time at it and eventually put it down without finishing, thinking it stupid, you obviously didn't try very hard to understand it.

Captain Ahab is both King Lear and Iago incarnated together in one body, there is a part of him you dislike, and a side to him you love, and he is neither hero nor villain, and ultimately human.

To say it is my favorite book is an understatement.I will not spend the time talking about the character of Ahab, the symbolism of the \\"Gams,\\" the story of The Essex (the real ship that sank when attacked by a whale), or the meaning of the whiteness of the whale.I will mention the taste of clam chowder for breakfast, clam chowder for lunch, and clam chowder for dinner at the Spouter Inn; and Queequeg kicking away with his barefeet the sharks who come to feed upon the dead whale they have lashed to the side of the Pequod.(Ernest Hemingway copied this scene from Herman Melville in \\"The Old Man And The Sea.\\" See my review on that book.)I will talk about how Ahab tries to stand in the row boat in the first \\"gam\\" and suddenly grabs the hair of the oarsman to keep from losing his balance with his wooden leg and to keep from falling out of the boat. Ah, the mighty Ahab. We watched from the ship's deck the little Ahab down there riding the waves.I will talk about the sound his wooden leg makes as he walks the deck above while I try to sleep; and the life threatening tendency to fall asleep while on watch up there on the tall mast head on those calm sunny days.I will talk about the beautiful calmness of the ocean. And I will mention that little known fact that while Ahab is seeking Moby Dick, Moby Dick is also stalking Ahab. Moby Dick lures Ahab to his killing zone and takes Ahab under beautiful calm waters beneath a beautiful quiet blue sky on a perfect stormless day."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"This is a notice, not a review.

Wait till you see the cover illustration, the original of Queequeg!"},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"What a waste of time! This book is very, very boring. I've said it &amp; I'll say it again: this book is very, very, extremely, boring. I refrained from giving it 1 star to the fact that yes, it has its good points...if you ever get to them."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"I didn't enjoy reading this book, apart from a few brief snatches. I finished it more of a sense of not wanting to leave anything undone.One of the first reviews (by Henry F. Chorley) of the book puts it very succinctly:\\"This is an ill-compounded mixture of romance and matter-of-fact. The idea of a connected and collected story has obviously visited and abandoned its writer again and again in the course of composition. The style of his tale is in places disfigured by mad (rather than bad) English; and its catastrophe is hastily, weakly, and obscurely managed....\\"I couldn't hope to do any better than that but I can try to extrapolate. There is no cohesive narrative. What little there is is broken up by chapters on the particulars of whaling. Or on the philosophy of whaling, in particular or of life in general.I'm not saying a good job couldn't be done with any or all of this but I just don't see it here. It's too disjointed and Melville's style of prose is awkward and protracted. Someone famous once said \\"brevity is the soul of whit.\\" Melville either never heard it or ignored it.There isn't all that much character interaction either. Ishmael, the narrator, for instance, starts out as a palpable presence in the book, a real character. Once he sets sail on the Pequod, however, he disappears into the background; he becomes a \\"mouthpiece,\\" as another review put it. He interacts with no one, such that you might have to remind yourself that he, not Melville himself, is the actual narrator. Other characters get chapters devoted to them, but the results are uneven and again, it's all broken up by all the passages on technical details or philosophical musings.Even some of the particulars are dubious. Melville refers to whales as fish throughout the book, which might be expected considering the period, but Melville makes it a point to reject the idea that whales are anything other than fish. He even mentions Swedish biologist Linnaeus' declaration that \\"whales are separate from the fish\\" and the various reasons given as to why. Melville doesn't attempt to counter any of these arguments, but merely declares Linnaeus' declaration to be \\"humbug.\\" Wikipedia argues that this use of the word 'fish' is an \\"ad hoc\\" definition meant to describe an animal that dwells in the ocean. If so, would this then mean that Linnaeus was under the impression that whales don't live in the sea? Somehow, I doubt it. Also, would this \\"ad hoc\\" definition not also include the squid, octopus and sea turtle, to name some examples?Anyway, to summarize, Moby-Dick wasn't an enjoyable experience for me. Obviously, mileage varies. There seems to be a very sizable and fiercely loyal following for this novel and I almost wish I could see what they see. But I just don't have it in me to make the effort again. Life is too short as it is."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"This book is a must if you wanna lull yourself to sleep. The opening was great, but then all these horrendous allusions kept popping up. I mean: pages devoted to the act of just plain sleeping, and then more pages devoted to eating? I guess Melville should have decided if he wanted to write a book about hunting for whales or scientific stuff about them. Then the book would have been better."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE FULL UNABRIDGED EDITION:If I could get by with giving this zero stars, I would. OMG, this is tedious and torture to read. I don't care how many times people say this is a \\"classic\\" and a \\"must read\\", that doesn't make it so. The book was based on two real accounts, both of which are much more interesting and easier to read than Melville's overly verbose tome. I slogged through this and forced myself to finish it and even the last three chapters, which is the only part of the 135 chapters (yes, I said 135) that even concerns itself with actual encounter with Moby Dick, are not that great. I actually could not stay awake through most of it and it took me a lot longer to read it because of that. If you want the true story, read the account of Mocha Dick and/or the Shipwreck of the Essex. Those are what Melville based his book on. I have read plenty of classics, including Robinson Crusoe, most of Dickens, Dracula, etc. These are all written either earlier or about the same time as Moby Dick, but they were interesting and readable. Not so with this book."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"I read this book in high school and have been smitten with \\"Moby Dick\\" ever since. With this undeniable classic, Herman Melville set the bar ferociously high. It's a monster of a read, but so worth it. I can't even imagine how someone could even craft a book on this level. It's mind-boggling really. Oh, to only be inside of Melville's head to take this journey with him as he wrote. He took his mind on an incredible trip. It's a master work of literary art. You just have to read it."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Moby Dick is a wonderful book with a lot of intense action that can keep you reading it, but other times the book is dull and dragged down with too much description. Ishmael is a very interesting character who is very deep thinking and observant. Queequeg is another colorful character who is a pagan, cannibal, harpooneer, and Ishmael's best friend.After they sign on with the Pequod, who's captain is Ahab, they soon become swept up in his monmania. His leg had been bitten off by Moby Dick a year before their voyage begins, and his real purpose for their voyage is for Ahab to take revenge.I started this book in March and finished it in May, which is very unusual for me, usually I finish books quicker than that. Whenever there is a whale hunt, this book is thrilling and intense, but after the whale is dead, the book goes on and on about stripping the blubber and the anatomy of the whale. If you like that sort of thing go right on ahead and read it, but if not, an abriged version might better suit you."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Has a great theme or moral: people, through ignorance and insufficient independence of thought, allow themselves to be drawn away form the true needs of their life, family, and community; often, by delusional leaders. This theme is undermined by the suggestion that too much reliance on reason can lead you away from common sense.Perhaps the most interesting aspect of Moby Dick is that there are no heros, nor villains, in the usual sense. There is not even a natural disaster or danger they are forced to deal with. There is only a group of self-deluded men creating danger for themselves. Ahab is in error and his influence corrupts the others to his delusions, but he is not out to harm them or take advantage of them. This is analogous to supposedly benevolent leaders of religion and their followers. The whale (reality) is simply a dumb beast (objective fact) behaving according to its nature. Dealing with it requires science, not mysticism. The actual action of the story is much the same as for any whaling voyage, only pursued foolishly.Sometimes the reader gets the feeling that Melville couldn't get to the point if it were at the bottom of a gorge and he were falling. I lost interest in the narrative. At times Melville is reminiscent of Shakespear with soliloquies and clever, insightful comments and metaphors, but with Melville these are too isolated from the action and fail to further the story. I never had any real interest in any of the characters or their fates.There are a good many interesting facts and mini-essays related to whales and whaling throughout. However, these have little to do with the story, making the insertions boring. Melville is an insightful and powerful writer at times, but not every observation and incident is worth reading.Ch.10, On Queeqeg's appearance: \\"You cannot hide the soul.\\" While there is some truth to this, it depends on who is observing and for how long.Ch.16, On inconsistencies in one's life: \\"...pious Bildad...very probably he had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a man's religion is one thing, and this practical world quite another.\\" A good observation on the result of conflicts in many people's hierarchy of values and the fact that they renege on the effort of trying to resolve them.Ch.36, \\"All visible objects are masks for reasoning minds behind them.\\" Here the whale is depicted as the physical form of some \\"inscrutable malice.\\" This false (religious oriented) view of the world allows for hatred of things that thwart or harm one, a desire for revenge against inanimate objects or dumb animals -- and hatred of reality itself.Ch.45, Claims it is necessary to present all the encyclopedic facts about whales and whaling, else people are apt to \\"scout at Moby Dick as a monstrous fable, or still worse and more deplorable, a hideous and intolerable allegory.\\" In other words, Moby Dick, the whale, is just a whale. But, of course, Moby Dick, the novel, is an allegory - a powerful one; which makes it interesting.Ch.73, On balancing the ship with a whale hoisted on one side and then another on the other side: \\"...by the counterpoise of both heads, [the ship] regained her even keel; though sorely strained, you may well believe. So, when on one side you hoist in Locke's head, you go over that way; but now, on the other side, hoist in Kant's and you come back again; but in very poor plight. Thus, some minds forever keep trimming boat. Oh, ye foolish! throw all of these thunderheads overboard, and then you will float light and right.\\" Lock (modern Aristotelian), a deist, championed empiricism, arguing that all knowledge must come from observation and experience, but ultimately relied on innate emotion as the source of the moral impulse. Kant (modern Platonist), deeply religious, championed rationalist-subjectivism, arguing that all experience is false and emotion/faith is your ultimate source of moral knowledge.Ch.74, \\"It is not the size of the eye or ear that determines the keenness of sight or hearing. Why then do you try to \`enlarge' your mind? Subtilize it.\\" Suggests that it is a waste of time to expand your knowledge if you do not fully integrate and evaluate the knowledge.Ch. 78, \\"How many, think ye, have likewise fallen into Plato's honey head, and sweetly perished there?\\" Keen insight on Plato's twaddle and influence - a seductive corruption of reasoning and morality.Ch.90, A sarcastic comment: \\"And thus there seems to be reason in all things, even the law.\\" The use of \\"seems to be\\" rather than \\"is\\" makes the point.Ch. 99, Ahab, while looking at the images on the coin: \\"There's something ever egotistical in mountains and towers, and all other grand and lofty things; look here -- three peaks as proud as Lucifer. The firm tower, that is Ahab...\\" Here the author suggests that pride is Ahab's sin, but I would say it is that Ahab substitutes his emotions for objective reason.Ch.124, Ahab, after fashioning a crude compas: \\"Look ye, for yourselves, if Ahab be not lord of the level loadstone!\\" \\"...you then saw Ahab in all his fatal pride.\\" Accepts the Christian view that pride is the greatest sin.Ch.135, Starbuck: \\"I disobey my God in obeying him!\\" [meaning Ahab] He has seduced them away from rationality and morality by his passion, charisma, and false view of the world. He leads them, and they willingly follow, to their destruction. In the final battle, Moby Dick is seen to be simply a whale fighting for its life. It is Ahab's misdirected passion and misinterpretation of reality that has led to their destruction. Ahab can be compared to racists/religious leaders promoting group superiority over others, and political/social leaders promoting nationalism and collectivism over individuality. Melville suggests that cannibals, etc., are as moral as Christian civilization - both are kind to children and befriend strangers, yet are easily roused to killing and eating their neighbors."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"As a bastion of Western Civilzation (and the &quot;DEEPEST AMERICAN NOVEL&quot;), it's easy to forget what a treat this STORY is!

It's wonderful, a revelation, a beam of white light piercing through the darkness of our souls. Ah, Melville, that great artist who aimed so high and found his mark with this awesome tale of the seas. Sure, it's an adventure tale, filled with action, danger, mystery, but strip all of that away and what do you have? MAN striving to get GOD to acknowledge HIM. Ahab(man), crazed by the injury caused by the Whale(God), his whole life reduced to the manic pursuit of that which eludes him. What a stirring metaphor. What a grand, operatic, messy, sometimes-overwritten, yet never boring novel. Great works are not perfect. Their very imperfection renders them great, for in the attempt at the sublime, the metaphysical, the ALL, they achieve an awe that stills the soul. And in the end, we have Ahab, glorious Ahab, unbowed, enraged, shouting his impotent rage at the Whale, as his life is swallowed away. Who's listening? Who's there, but the solitary narrator to witness the cataclysmic waste of it all? It's a difficult book. It's a slow book. It's a book that builds towards its climax with a stolidity that implies overwhelming confidence. But it rewards unlike any other book in American history. It's a matter of degrees, of first among equals, between this and LIGHT IN AUGUST, but MOBY DICK is the greatest American Novel."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"the modern library classics version is far superior !!!! for the amazing illustrations by rockwell kent truly enhance the experience (as does the font size and spacing)"},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"&quot;Call me Ishmael.

These elements are amply present in themes exploring man's battle against nature (and fellow man), the self-destructiveness of hatred, the bounds of loyalty, commitment to family and the need to revere God. The richness of Melville's prose pours out like thick cream from an iron pitcher. Haunting phrases and word-painted, wild scenes are mixed with weird images and symbolic poetry. In that wild, beautiful romance, Melville seems to have spoken the very secret of the sea, and to have drawn into his tale all the magic, all the sadness, all the wild joy of many waters. It stands quite alone; it strikes a note no other sea writer has ever struck.

Like many people who tackled it with an open mind, I loved it. But the first time reader who approaches it without warning will often abandon ship before they get very far on the voyage. Its easy for readers of modern fiction to make the relativily easy transition to the 19th Century literature of Mark Twain or Charles Dickens, but woe unto them who are unprepared to navigate the rocks and shoals of Melville's oceans! To appreciate Moby-Dick you must love the English language with a passion, for no other book demostrates better what can be done with it. Moby-Dick contains an ocean of ideas, many of them so subtle you won't see them on a first time reading. So, plan you voyage carefully, or else you might get stove in by Melville's whale and abandon the hunt for truth and beauty far too early."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"This a challenging read, but with film, audio and interpretive editions there are an embarrassment of riches that make it a lot easier. Here is the strategy I followed: 1) As background readingIn the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex(2000) recounts the real-life story that inspired Melville to write \\"Moby-Dick\\", and gives a good background on Nantucket and the whaling industry. It provides needed historical context for the modern reader, it was after reading this that I was inspired to read \\"Moby-Dick\\". 2) The2005 audiobook version narrated by William Hootkins(25 hours unabridged; also on audible dot com for much less) - Hootkins should win an Oscar for his performance. I'm an audiobook junkie but this is one of if not the best audiobook performance I've heard, his reading is perfect for the book. I never would have picked up the amount of humor, satire and sheer emotion without his professional interpretive skills, every character sounds different. 3) Read along the audiobook version with theNorton Critical Edition(2002), which contains plentiful explanatory footnotes and other material such as contemporary reviews, pictures, maps, criticisms, etc.. 4) See the1956 John Houston movie. It's 90-minutes and is a spoiler (save it for last); the sets, acting, costumes, accents all bring it alive in glorious Technicolor, the film is a classic in its own right. For example Pip and the tambourine seems incongruous in the book but makes sense in the film, and the preachers pulpit visualized with Orson Wells delivering \\"The Sermon\\" is as good as it gets.The novel is written in the Romanticism tradition (cf. Lord Byron, Sir Walter Scott, \\"Les Miserables\\") and the language is full of symbolism and subtle layers of meaning. Yet, strangely, Melville turned this emotional, poetic style to a near documentary treatment of what is otherwise a fairly dry subject in minute detail. It's like writing poetry about the details of the nuclear power industry from backhoes to graphite rods to cooling ponds. Yet somehow it worked, the immersion is so complete, the details so real and \\"true of the thing\\" (Melville) that the main storyline becomes all that much more credible and powerful. The story its self is not that complex or even original (it's based on a Shakespeare tragedy) but the symbolic depth of the language, truthfulness of the details, and mythological power of the characters (Moby Dick and Ahab in particular) combine to make this \\"strange sort of a book\\" (Melville) a canonical work."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Readers say it's far too long, the cetacean history is tedious, who the heck cares how to best prep a harpoon line?

Its subject is whaling, of course, but its theme is the much broader topic of man's motivation to do desperate and destructive things.Ishmael is a seasoned sailor who decides to try whaling, so he goes to Nantucket Island with a companion, the noble savage Queequeg, to look for work on a suitable whaling ship. They end up on the Pequod, which is captained by a badly scarred old salt named Ahab. Ahab has one obsession: to find and kill Moby Dick, the legendary great white whale that bit off his leg in a vicious melee.The 135 chapters of this novel are divided between narrations of the Pequod's whaling voyages throughout the world and technical discussions of cetology. Ishmael tells you everything you wanted or needed to know about whales and a lot more -- skin, bones, jaws, eyes, spout, tail; swimming, feeding, breathing, mating, nursing; the hunt, the harpooning, the towing, the uses of the whale carcass and its oil -- every conceivable aspect of whale culture is covered, until you start to feel that the book itself is somewhat of a whale. However, these extensive lectures are necessary in order to lull the reader under the book's spell; Ahab's hunt for Moby Dick wouldn't mean anything unless you felt like you were part of the crew.Ahab's fixation with the great white whale can only be described as monomaniacal, as Ishmael refers to him many times. For much of the story, Ahab remains in the shadows, silently nursing his hatred and anger. There is always a creepy foreshadowing of impending doom, that he will stop at nothing, not even the death of his crew and himself, to achieve his bloodthirsty goal. The Pequod encounters several other whaling ships, and on each one he feverishly inquires of the captain whether Moby Dick has been spotted. At the end, he finally does get the chance to meet his natatorial nemesis, and his fate is an example of what can happen when a man lets himself be consumed by his hatred.&quot;Moby Dick&quot; is a classic because it has a haunting insularity -- it seems to exist alone in a world of its own creation, one that no other novel is able to penetrate, although many have tried. Consider the originality of its characterization: Its titular antagonist is a silent, elusive demon, and its protagonist (Ahab) is a bitter wretch, someone we don't ever want to be even though we all have felt his level of anger at some time. In the world today, there are plenty of Ahabs chasing great white whales; those who are innocently trapped in the middle, like the crew of the Pequod, are often the ones who suffer the consequences."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"I've read Moby Dick twice. The first time, no one forced me to, I just picked it up and read it [I was in eighth grade]. I hated it! It was one of the most aggravatingly tedious books I'd ever read. I didn't have anything good to say about Melville after that. I was required to reread it as a senior in high school, and then I began to understand my earlier frustration. Melville tells an excellent compelling story which draws the reader in. He also, however, gives an in depth description of every obscure detail of whaling. So, while the first 70 pages or so are interesting and even amusing to most readers [Fr. Mapple's sermon, Ismael's befriending of Queequeg] once the voyage gets underway, Ishmael drops out of the story, and the story itself is continually abandoned in favor of a description of the finer details of turning blubber into oil. But most aggravating of all was the fact that nothing was seen of Moby Dick for the first 500 pages. While this is supposedly building suspense, and preparing the reader for the predictable, but unexpeccted ending, it can be nerve-wracking at times. If I weren't so interested in the story, I wouldn't have minded. Basically, Melville is a brilliant story teller, but reading the whaling scenes in Moby Dick is like reading the lists of fish seen in 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. I do think the story is worth reading, though. So, if anyone can tolerate three chapters of &quot;whales in art&quot;, then, well, they willl be rewarded by 25 pages of wonderful action and suspense in the end. Whether this is worth the time or commitment, I leave to the reader. There is much more in the book than the movie, but essentially all the action has been carried over into the movie w/ Patrick Stewart as Ahab. Nevertheless, the book is still, strangely better. No one should ever be forced to read Moby Dick. Most people hate books they are forced to read and it's easy enough to hate Moby Dick w/o that. If you are interested, try it, and remember that the story really picks up on page 500. Also, the themes are very interesting, adn some scenes, such as Starbuck's debate w/ himself over his duty to dispose of Ahab, and some of Stubb's monologues are very memorable. I don't like reading abriged versions of anything [except Princess Bride]. Some people consider this book a classic, for the content and the poetry, but I completely sympathize w/ those who have difficulty wading through the volume of unrelated matter, such as why whales are fish, not mammals."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"It looks as if the free Kindle version of Moby Dick has been improved. Earlier reviewers remarked that the free version lacked a working table of contents, and/or the etymological extracts about whales prefacing the text. Also, Fr. Mapples' sermon passage was reported to be missing from Ch. 9.Thanks to the Project Gutenberg volunteers, for as of when I uploaded this six weeks ago, the text looks intact. Of course, without footnotes being a public domain text, this will remain daunting to newcomers. Melville's range of references and his style may not please today's impatient readers. I recommend using a free version in tandem with a volume with more guidance, such as the Norton Critical Edition.Still, it's convenient to have this to dip into and search within on a Kindle platform, gratis. I had to read this in college and grad school, but I found myself returning to it for the pleasure of it a while ago. Now I am also starting \\"Redburn,\\" one of his now overlooked, but more accessible, earlier tales. That free text was not directly downloadable via the Amazon link when I tried, but go to gutenberg-dot-org and you can find that file easily transferable for a Kindle device. So are all of his stories and his novels, so enjoy the easy search for your seabound quest."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"What a completely weird book this is. Moby Dick seems like it could have easily have been just a conventional sea-faring adventure, it's full of really cool set pieces and (surprisingly to me) a really keen sense of humor. It can be a very boisterous book, which is good because when it isn't it kind of scared the crap out of me. Melville is just so fixated by whales, by their size (huge), their behavior (impenetrable), and by the arcane, terrifyingly violent history that humanity has foisted on them (We boil their bodies down into oil. OIL.). He's able to weave this bizarre, pseudo-mystical rumination around them that reinforces the narrative and at the same time gives it an inscrutable, portentous sense of menace. The two main aspects at work in Moby Dick slowly bleed into each other, so that by the end the human beings are trapped in a... what exactly? A Trajectory? A Plateau? A Downward Spiral? At any rate, some kind of primordial doomed place. And the whales, the sharks, the ocean, hell, even the seagulls, just sort of become something else, lurking and attacking out of some other creepy aesthetic/naturalist dimension that might be totally sybmolic or might be totally real, or might be both. Or neither. I wonder if H.P. Lovecraft had this in mind when he wrote some of his tales. Because the weird, metaphysical terror vibe you sometimes get from his stuff is out in full force all over this book. Forget the Great American Novel. Moby Dick is the Great American Freak-out."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Call me Horseman. Some years ago I took a job managing a group of editors at a corporation. In order to make a point and to check out my qualifications to manage him, half seriously - half jokingly, one of these individuals asked whether I had ever read MOBY DICK by Herman Melville. Surprised by the question and what it had to do with my qualifications, I forthrightly answered in the negative. Very quickly the editor said, \\"Well, get back to me when you have and we'll talk.\\" I went out that very day, bought the book and discovered what I have come to believe is, arguably, the greatest novel ever written. I just completed another reading of this wonderful book and found it as intriguing and enchanting as ever.But what is so great about a book about whales? Aren't some of Melville's statements and observations dead wrong according to modern whale experts?Doesn't it drag on and on in boring writing that has no appeal today?Remember that most of us usually encounter MOBY DICK as students in high school or early in college. As such it's difficult to remain truly objective in our views. The major mistake that most readers of MOBY DICK make is looking at the book as some sort of a scientific or zoological treatise on whales. Yes, Melville based much of the book on actual personal experience and on the accounts of others. But the beauty of this book lies almost totally in its wordsmithing. Melville is the master of putting together sentences, paragraphs and chapters that beautifully and eloquently draw the reader into his world. The author employs an extensive palette of words to paint a picture and to express a message about life. In the latter there is no greater allegory of life than Melville's masterwork.And isn't that what reading a book like this is supposed to be about? One does not read LES MISERABLE to get an engineer's view of the network of Paris' sewers; neither does he read A TALE OF TWO CITIES to learn about the mechanics of the guillotine.MOBY DICK, then, is more than a story about whales and whalemen. It is, in the end, a statement about the destructiveness of out-of-control obsessions and of vengeance run amok. It is a masterpiece that speaks to every man or woman in whatever walk of life they might pursue. Indeed, every one of us has chased or is chasing our own white whale or whales. And the truths taught here haven't changed much in over 150 years. As such MOBY DICK is as applicable to today's society and its concerns as it must have been to Melville's antebellum nineteenth century America.In short, if you're looking for a quick, entertaining read, try one of the Harry Potter books.

This is simply the greatest work of American fiction and one of the finest pieces of literature ever written. Of course, that said, it is not a simple read, a mere entertainment. It can best be compared to reading Dante's &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; or Milton's &quot;Paradise Lost.&quot; You've got to get ready to take your time, think carefully, study a lot, read slowly and with the intent to savor, be humble and receptive. The prose is daunting, but Shakespearean in its greatness. No one short of the great Willy Shakes himself has approached the brilliance of Melville's poetic style. The novel is a quas-allegorical epic tragedy, if that makes much sense to those who haven't read it yet, and you must come to it ready to put yourself through such a monumental task as grappling with it. Ahab is the great madman pursuing his blasphemous goal, Ishmael the gentle searcher caught up in the terror and attractions of that purpose, and Moby himself the great mystery of evil and God and nature, &quot;the monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious agencies which some deep men feel eating in them til they are left living on with half a heart and half a lung&quot;. Hey, I could go on and on about this, about symbols and meaning and fate and evil and God and revenge and madness and hope. But what's the point? There are so many facets to this book, from farce to fate, that it would take me days to cover it all. If you want to read something great, this is what you should take in hand. By the way, the &quot;message&quot; of MD is extremely important in our day and age, in my opinion. This is not just an empty academic read, but a profound exploration of the meaning of life and the broadest, deepest questions of moral and spiritual purpose. The same themes haunted Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Camus, Satre, Becket, Graham Greene, Shusaku Endo -- the list could go on and on and on. But none of them reached as high as Melville in this work. You are welcome to write me to discuss MD any time, or to get pyshced up about reading it, or about unlocking some of its intricate and dense symbolism."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"I became interested in Moby Dick after watching \\"Star Trek: First Contact.\\" Toward the end of the movie Captain Picard refuses to let go of his anger with The Borg and another character compares him to Ahab. This leads to an emotionally charged moment where Picard quotes Ishmael, \\"He piled upon the whale's white hump the sum of all the general rage and hate felt by his whole race from Adam down; and then, as if his chest had been a [cannon], he burst his hot heart's shell upon it.\\"Naturally, I had to look up the quote on the Internet, and in the process I began to read some comments and reviews about Melville's classic. From what I was able to glean, many people consider Moby Dick the greatest American novel ever. And I respect Melville for his accomplishment through hard work as a self-educated man. Another of his famous quotes from this autobiographical novel is, \\"A Whale-ship was my Yale College and my Harvard.\\"This book is filled with intense drama and action interspersed with large chunks that are essentially non-fiction about whales, the logistics of whale-ships, and the whaling business. These non-fiction sections can be tedious, but it is well worth it to trudge through them and to read this tome as a whole, in order, cover to cover. Unfortunately, contemporary publishers would not print a novel like this one. They opt for shorter, fast-paced books.I actually bought several versions of this book from several different publishers and sat down and had a go at them each to see which one I could best sit down with. I chose the Penguin Classics paperback with the introduction by Andrew Delbanco and notes and explanatory commentary by Tom Quirk.I spent a week or two reading Moby Dick, several hours at time, and I ended up so engrossed in it that I took notes in the margins, bracketed some of my favorite sections, etc. This novel is the best work of literature that I've ever read and my recommendation is in the form of a comment: If you don't read it, you'll do yourself a great disservice."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Now in my fifties I'm slowly cycling through various classics I was assigned to read in high school. Moby Dick was one such beast. I remember \\"reading\\" it in cheap paperback edition as a sophomore. I was a better reader at that age than many, but still it was completely beyond my capacity to appreciate it. Why do they assign works like this to teen-agers! At this stage in life though, it's another story. What a difference. What a magnificent novel.So I say this to the kids assigned Moby Dick, who take their anger out on the book--it's BORING, too much about whaling, it goes off on tangents, too many words! Et cetera. I have sympathy--but don't blame the book! Get through your class with SparkNotes or whatever, then have another look at this when you're old. It may still be a drudge, but at least you'll have a fairer shot at it. If you've spent a lifetime reading, and accumulating experience with older texts (it's like building a mental muscle), you may be able to appreciate it. The language that seemed only boring can take on a power and grandeur like none you've encountered before. Maybe, maybe not. But keep an open mind about the possibility. Write a note to your future self saying, consider having another look. Also, reading it with a group of people also interested, can help a lot. Of course Hemingway could have written this as a short story, but it's not just about the \\"story\\".Coincidentally I heard Wynton Marsalis recently on a documentary about Jazz, talking about the difficulty of appreciating Be-Bop. He said something like, great art, Shakespeare, Picasso, Mozart, doesn't come to you. You must come to it.Finally I was going to agree with reviewer Jake Barnes (1/9/2007) who said \\"buy this version of Moby Dick\\". But the edition I read wasn't the one he read. Note that these reviews are listed under the same title regardless of the edition, so it's not apparent which edition you are talking about. I had the Everyman \\"cloth\\" edition, that had no footnotes. After the fact I looked at the footnotes in the Norton edition, but if I were only going to own one, I'd prefer the Everyman. Good paper, clear readable print, strong binding and cover, looks great--an excellent value."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"This may be the most difficult review I've ever written for Amazon.com. I mean, this is Moby Dick, after all. So many have already written about it, and so many people have preconceived notions about this book, even those who know little about this masterpiece of literature. I will say I tore into this book with an Ahab-like vengeance, and finished it in a mere four days. I broke away only for sleep, food, and work. I actually started this book before I made my final assault on Oswald Spengler's \\"Decline of the West\\", a book that has provided its own difficulties. As usual, while taking a break from one difficult book, I decided to read one of the most difficult novels ever written!There is no denying it; Moby Dick is a challenge, albeit not as severe of one as some would make you think. Since almost everyone has a general idea of the plot, let's focus on what people detest about the book. First, many seem to have a problem understanding Melville's symbolism. Symbolism is often difficult, and I'm under no illusions that I picked up even half of Melville's symbolic usages. What is important to remember about symbolisms, however, is that only the author knows for sure every symbolic stroke of the pen. The rest of us have to do the best we can. Take Queegqueg's harpoon, for instance. He carries it with him wherever he goes, so it must mean something. Since Queegqueg is non-white, and this book was written as the United States was embarking on its last hurrahs over slavery before the Civil War broke out, is Melville trying to tell us something? Maybe Queegqueg's harpoon is his defense against any threats he may receive as he makes his way through white territory. Or is it a phallic symbol? Who knows? Don't be intimidated by the heavy symbolism. It is still possible to get so much out of this book without worrying about arcane references. Many times, Melville hits the reader as hard as he can with symbolism, so that it is easy to get the reference. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out what the substitution of the coffin for the life buoy means. I do hope any who read this book are at least somewhat familiar with the Bible, because scriptural knowledge will help immensely.Secondly, some have criticized Melville's prose, claiming it is \\"turgid\\" or overly wordy. This is such a wrongheaded criticism that it makes me wonder if the people who make these claims have ever read anything written before 1980. Quit trying to superimpose modern literary style back into the 19th century. Instead, try and get a feel for the time in which the work was written. Life moved more slowly during the 19th century, and brevity was not considered a necessity in writing. I'm often saddened when I read modern literature, which is such a vacuum of description that most of the books churned out today lack the majesty that the English language can often summon up under a brilliant pen (such as Melville). Melville's prose is eye candy, although I do think that Thomas De Quincey is even more spectacular (a quick plug for \\"Confessions of an English Opium Eater\\"!). Take this quote from the final showdown between Ahab and the whale:\\"Towards thee I roll, thou all-destroying but unconquering whale; to the last I grapple with thee; from hell's heart I stab at thee; for hate's sake I spit my last breath at thee. Sink all coffins and all hearses to one common pool! And since neither can be mine, let me then tow to pieces, while still chasing thee, though tied to thee, thou damned whale! Thus, I give up the spear!\\"This is brilliant stuff! I get chills by just rereading this! Does it not show the absolute depth of hatred that Ahab has for his foe? It sure beats, \\"I'll be back\\" any day! Moby Dick contains some of the best prose work ever written. Learn to appreciate it!Finally, I'm now at a loss when I read reviews that say the 400 or so pages in the middle of the book are boring, useless, or just plain unnecessary. This is just wrong. Many argue that these pages are loaded with scads of cetology and minutiae on the whaling industry. While there is some of this to be found, Melville often takes us back to the Pequod. Who can say that the Town-Ho story is boring? Or that Tashtego's mishap in the head of the whale is totally without interest? I just don't get it! I say it clearly so all can hear: most of the 400 or so pages that make up the centerpiece of this book do not concern whaling minutiae or useless description. There is some, but it is important to know it to understand the unfolding plot. Personally, I found his descriptions of whales interesting and I loved his historical examinations of the whale. Can Moby Dick be read without reading this central section? Yes, in that you will get a bare bones account of a whale hunt led by a crazy old coot named Ahab. What you won't get is why this hunt occurs, and you won't see the gradual disintegration of Ahab as he drags the Pequod and all on it to their doom.I see Moby Dick as a universe, a total macrocosm in which only those who lead the life can understand this universe. This world has its own laws, its own religions, and its own meanings. Melville wrote this book so that the outsider, the \\"landlubber\\", can get a glimpse into this world. What most saw as a somewhat seedy profession, Melville saw as an all-encompassing worldview. Even this short description does not do this book justice because there is so much here. Maybe that is why teachers force this book on students. It is easy to take any method or system and find evidence of it here. I pity those who are forced to read this book. Forced reading is always a chore, and Melville should not be a check mark on a laundry list of literature. Read this because you want to read it, because you want to see into another world, because you believe your horizons will be expanded. It will make all the difference!"},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"It was interesting to read the number of reviews on Melville's work, credentials unknown, as a piece of literature. There is no question or debate about whether this book is one of the great classics of American literature, or literature in general, of all time. There just isn't. So the 1-star or 2-star, or even 5-star reviews of the book as literature are not actually pertinent. It's like a debate about whether the Hope diamond is a really big jewel, or Handel's Messiah is an important piece of music. You may or may not like or appreciate Melville's work as a reader, but the only way to really find out is to read it. As far as this edition for the Kindle, it has a working table of contents and very readable formatting, and I recommend it as an addition to your classic Kindle library."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"I had heard lots about this book: some said it was 600 pages about whales, others said it was their favourite novel of all times. The first usually were teens and the latter were usually my literature teachers, or writers I read.To be fair, yes, there is a lot about the whales; but that is not boring, Melville always manages to connect that to many other things (example: the head of the whale and the face of God) and whatever happens, his style is always witty and fun. I can never quite believe what I read in Amazon reviews; honestly. Some have said this novel is dry. I'm sorry but this book is so thickly rich of everything that I can hardly perceive how it could ever be dry. As to being boring or slow-paced, the fact that the whole novel is divided into over 100 short chapters does speed up the dynamic as short chapters always do.It is true that you should not expect a \\"classical\\" novel in the classical sense of being \\"usual\\", for Moby Dick is not your average novel. It has a narrator who is a character in the story, but he is nearly inexistent as such, and seems to melt in the universe he describes for us. The text itself moves from the story to encyclopedic entries on whales, and back to the story proper. Personally, I never minded that, and quite enjoyed every chapter of it; but it's likely that some don't appreciate that sort of narrative freedom.It is beyond me, too, that one should \\"need\\" a year to read this book. I read it in two weeks, and was by no means reading everyday. The first chapters are really funny, I thought. I was expecting something terrible, given what others had warned me of, but really it was fun. It sure is a demanding book, but then, great books require great readers. And by demanding, that can mean just being curious and/or interested.This novel is a true hybrid of sorts, combining elements that aren't usually thought to cohabit very well; you could perhaps consider it a patchwork, but for all one can say on it, it remains a cool read! I don't suppose I'm in the majority, but that's really how it felt to me: quite a cool read. It made me curious about the whaling industry and how exactly humans did to kill those sea giants; it may not sound thrilling to some, but if you pause and consider the animals concerned and the sea, and all that, then you realise (I think) how deep this all is. I believe you probably need to be on the same wavelength as Melville to enjoy his book; if the sea evokes nothing to you but tons and tons of water, then you may not revel in the reading of the novel. On the other hand, if the sea seems to you some metaphysical poem, then you will most likely appreciate Melville's grand effort."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"As a reader who loves History, I go through phases.. Civil War, Revolutionary War, The Cruisades, Scotland, etc etc.. A few months ago, I got into a nautical disaster binge and read the following: (almost all of which are highly recommended)Neil Hanson's Custom of the SeaGregory Gibson's Demon of the WaterGlyn Williams' The Prize of All the Oceans (my favorite of the group)Mike Dash's Batavia's GraveyardCaroline Alexander's The BountySir John Barrow's MutinyNathanial Philbrick's In the Heart of SeaDavis Shaw's The Sea Shall Embrace ThemSebastian Junger's The Perfect StormDoug Stanton's In Harm's WayWhat a lot of them had in common was some reference to Melville's Moby Dick.. So I figured 'Hey why not'?After finishing it, I was left with a feeling of wanting more, yet wanting less...I wanted more.. more of the final battle between Ahab and his demon (Moby Dick).. More of the beautiful writing as in the case where Melville describes the 'whale's eye view' of the shadows cast by the whaling ships... More of Melville's almost prophesizing about the hunting of whales to extinction (when he compares them to the buffalo).. although he predicts that this won't happen to the whales..But yet I wanted less... Less of the frustration caused by Melville elluding to things, and then not answering them until later, or not at all. For instance when he writes about the size of whale fossils and skeletons that have been unearthed. He mentions one found in Mississippi without giving its size, yet he does it in a way that has the reader pleading to know the demensions.. Finally a chapter later, in an 'Oh boy the way' remark, he tells us.I also wanted less.. Less of the characters that he introduces, only to ignore for the rest of the book.. I wanted less, less of the descriptions of all of the various species of whales. Less of Melville wanting to be a historian, a biology expert, a whaling expert, a psychologist and a novelist all rolled into one.The book is essentially hundreds of pages of build up to an ending that encompasses 40 pages. This book was NOTHING like I thought it would be. If you are looking for an action packed book of man vs whale, this isn't it. You can do better with other books on the above list. This 'novel' is however, a detailed, if not sometimes tedious descritption of the whaling industry wrapped around a man fighting his demons.Will you like it? It depends on what you're looking for. If ou want a lot of action, see the list above, if you want a sometimes beautifully wriitng book, based somewhat on fact, containing a lot of detail about the whaling industry, this is it.Oh yeah, and I agree with the reveiwer who said that there are better editions. Once again, Penguin doesn't treat its classics like a classic. The notes in the back of the book are pathetic, and aren't even alluded to in the text. You literally have to page back to the notes once in a while and see whether there are any notes for what you are about to read.. This is inexcusable. If you want to read this book, don't get the Penguin edition."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Easily one of the greatest novels of all-time. Ignore the stereotyped responses by reviewers who complain about Melville's odd writing style, the length of the novel, or its circuitous nature. And don't get caught up in the \\"symbolism\\" of it all either. That'll come later. My suggestion is that you read Moby Dick for the shear thrill of the hunt. Melville has created a very strange and surreal book, which is a must read for anyone serious about American literature. In my case, I don't think I'd have been able to get through it before now (I'm in my early thirties) and I'm very glad I came back to it. That said, Melville's many chapters on early 19th Century whaling, and the whalemen themselves are interesting in and of themselves for both the historically curious, and the adventure seekers among Melville's readers. On the whole, Moby Dick is constructed like a great tile mosaic; or more precisely, it has the \\"counter-pane\\" structure of the Quaker bed-quilt he describes in Chapter 4 (there are many references to cross-hatched patterns & weavings throughout the novel). Moby Dick, the White Whale, is Ahab's bane. We meet neither Ahab nor Moby Dick until we've been taken far out to sea. This slow build-up is Melville's divine plan. He entices us throughout with brief essay after essay on all subjects and objects and personalities related to the Pequod, whaling, and Nantucket whalers, and whales themselves. If at first you have trouble with Melville's writing style, read on and you will find yourself soothed by his unique poetic sermons. The combination of these many short, sometimes non-sequential chapters all forged together, creates a rhythmic ebb and flow of diverse ocean tides, rising and falling waves, and rapidly changing weather. There are squalls, rushes after whales, followed by dead calm and placid tranquility. One forgets what and where he is going on this strange voyage. It becomes difficult to tell whether or not the story is beginning, ending, or somewhere in between; or, if it's a \\"story\\" at all! Very odd indeed (unlike any other novel I've ever read). And then we hear a voice; a harsh voice. It is Ahab, stumbling on deck, reminding us exactly what we're in for: vengeance and hate. Pure and simple. Forget \\"Cliff's Notes\\" or lame \\"abridged\\" versions of Moby Dick; listen to Ahab speak himself: \\"He tasks me; he heaps me; I see in him outrageous strength, with an inscrutable malice sinewing it. That inscrutable thing is chiefly what I hate; and be the White Whale agent, or be the White Whale principal, I will wreak hate upon him . . . I'd smite the sun if it insulted me\\" (Ch. 29). These are some of the most amazing lines in all of literature. Ahab continues: \\"For could the sun do that, then could I do the other; since there is ever a sort of fair play herein, jealousy presiding over all creations. But not my master, man, is even that fair play. Who's over me? Truth hath no confines. Take off thine eye! more intolerable than fiends' glarings is a doltish stare!\\" With this Ahab avoids mutiny. With this he binds First Mate Starbuck and the rest of the crew to his purpose. Who's over me? Who and what exactly is Moby Dick? Who is Ahab? Read, enjoy, and go with the flow, like Ishmael following his passion out to the intrepid sea and away from mundane land-lubber life. Let yourself drift with Melville for a few weeks, slowly absorbing his amazing prose, letting yourself dissolve into his infinite, timeless ocean, watching, listening, and observing old, mutilated Captain Ahab, peering out to sea, and up into the three tall mastheads at us - his crew - all on the look out for . . ."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"I am alternately overjoyed and dismayed when I read the reviews of _Moby-Dick_ here. It's wonderful to see that people are still reading it and even better to see that they're enjoying it and it affects them in such a way that they feel compelled to share with the rest of the world how great a book it is. To fellow Melvilleans and Dick-Heads, I say: right on!I can't help but feel disappointed, though, when I see reviews that fault it for being too long or having extraneous details in it. It kills me when people advise skipping the cetological passages. If you read the book and feel this way, then you've missed the point completely._Moby-Dick_ is much more than a tale of the whale-fishery. It's an epic. There's a reason behind the cetological chapters. As Van Wyck Brooks wrote in an article about his third time through the book:&quot;It seems to me now less chaotic, better shaped, than it seemed at first: nothing surprised me more than to discover how conscious Melville was of what he was doing.... It seemed to me intolerable that he had not removed the chapters on whales in general, on whaling, whales' heads, pitchpoling, ambergris, the try-works, etc., and published them separately: they were glorious, but I could not believe that they had been deliberately introduced to retard the action. It struck me that the action should have been retarded as it were within the story. I do not feel this now. The book is an epic and an epic requires ballast.&quot;Many people are put off by those very things. Try to imagine, though, where _The Iliad_ would be without the large catalogue of ships, or where _Paradise Lost_ would be without the large detailed list of all the fallen angels. Without the encyclopedic passages (which are well-written to boot, and a shame to skip), _Moby-Dick_ becomes nearly as banal as every other sea-story that came out at the time, saved only by Melville's extraordinary talent with a pen.Melville had a reason for doing everything he did in the book. Earlier in 1850, in his essay &quot;Hawthorne and his Mosses&quot; (easily one of the most wonderful examples of a writer writing about another writer -- find it using Google and enjoy it), Melville bemoaned the lack of a national literature and said that he would stand by Pop Emmons' &quot;Fredoniad&quot; (a so-so American epic poem, modeled after European epics) until a better epic came along. By casting _Moby-Dick_ in such a manner, it seems to me that Melville was making a deliberate attempt to create that &quot;better epic,&quot; and in doing so helped to establish American literature as a separate entity from English literature (for more on this, read F. O. Matthiessen's _American Renaissance_, the Bible of American studies).In creating this epic, nothing is expendable: the cetological passages are just as important as the soliloquies.Besides the critical aspect as to why they're important, they also serve a commonsense function. Recall, those of you who have read the book, the chapter entitled &quot;The Town-Ho's Story.&quot; Ishmael is telling the story of the Town-Ho to a bunch of guys in Lima, Peru. A number of times, he mentions things they're not familiar with: the Great Lakes and canallers (the men who work in canals). Each time such a topic comes up, the narrative is interrupted and Ishmael has to explain to the audience what these unfamiliar things are. By the time he gets to the final digression, he decides to have fun with it, and rhapsodizes on canallers, figuring that even digressions can be an interesting and artful way of telling a story.That chapter provides the layout for the rest of the novel, with Ishmael as the storyteller and YOU as the audience. Each time he digresses about the various species of whales, or their heads, or their tails, it's for YOUR benefit, so you get a more complete picture and aren't left in the dark as to what's going on when the men are &quot;trying-out&quot; the blubber or when Tashtego is working with a &quot;pitch-pole.&quot; Beyond their explanatory function, they are also beautiful passages of writing (reread the chapter about the tails, if you don't believe me; Ishmael's love for the beauty of whales is dripping off the page).Yes, it's a long book, but it's anything but boring. If you find the cetological passages boring, try a few things: 1) keep in mind that they provide the &quot;ballast&quot; for our first indigenous epic; 2) try to appreciate the beauty of the prose, and don't get bogged down in its being solely focused on whales and whaling; 3) see it as a story being told to you by a very conscientious narrator who is intent on having you understand everything about whales -- this last point is quite important, especially when you contrast Ishmael with Ahab. They are both obsessed with whales: Ahab through action and Ishmael through words. The cetological passages are Ahab's monomania wearing off on Ishmael, save for in Ishmael it manifests itself in worship for the beauty of the whale; 4) think of the above 3 points and appreciate the skill and artistry it took to weave all of that into seemingly innocuous passages about whales and their parts.When I finished the book, I only had two questions: &quot;How did he? And why can't I?&quot; I was consumed with jealousy(!) that Melville could pull something this amazing off, and I later learned that William Faulkner felt the same way: &quot;Moby-Dick is the book which I put down with the unqualified thought, \`I wish I had written that.'&quot;I am amazed that everyone doesn't feel that way."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"Moby Dick is written in a style that hasn't been in style for over a hundred years.

They said it was... too deep, no pun intended. Back then long books weren't popular, short stories were, so his publisher told him to stop writing books like this - books that are full of allusions, metaphors and all that good stuff. Melville said, in essence, screw you guys. I like writing like this. And so he was all but kicked out of the literary world. He stuck around, don't get me wrong, but no one would read his works. Now of course Moby Dick is considered the greatest book in American literature. So should you read it? Yes. It is a great book; very well written; well planned.

When I got my new Kindle Fire HD for Christmas, I decided to download this free version of the book to read on it.A nice feature of this product is that you have a nice built-in dictionary feature. When Melville uses one of those out-of-date 19th century words, or some naval term I'm not familiar with, I just put the cursor on the word, and an explanation pops up. Very handy. It is also easy to bookmark pages with the Kindle.So far, I am enjoying Moby Dick again."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"I'm sure that this is a good book and that it is so famous for good reasons. And I do like reading classic authors and long-winded novels. But this one was soooo boooring! I tried and tried and tried, but eventually, after 200 pages or so, I gave up. Maybe too much testosterone ..."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"I know, people are forever saying that Moby Dick is one of the greatest novels ever written, well it isn't. The story is fantastic but the book itself can be so boring that you end up skimming through chapters. Give me a break, how many chapters should be devoted to the differences between the types of whales? It is an old classic though and prior to Hemmingway many writers, not all, devoted a multitude of pages describing minutia but Melville goes beyond that. He is like Dickens. I'm really happy that I saw the movie which is devoted to the story line and not the book. If you are considering Moby Dick I suggest you put the book on your shelf to impress your friend and buy the movie for your enjoyment."},{"Title":"Moby Dick","review":"The English is sometimes difficult, but mostly understandable. This is not the movie and you will learn a great deal more about early whaling than you have any desire to know.

It works. Beginning with -Reiki The Ultimate Guide, he teaches his students about the Reiki sacred symbols & attunements and becoming a Reiki Healer. I received my attunement for 1st Level Reiki from Steve's DVD program. After that I went on and received attunements for the 2nd Level, & read his books - Reiki Ultimate Guides 2 & 3. Steve Murray's method of explaining the sacred symbols and attunements makes it easy to understand and he hides nothing from his students. His book Reiki False Beliefs Exposed For All shows how honest he is with his students. I have bought his DVD and received the attunement to becoming a Reiki Master, but waited until I felt ready. First I bought the DVD's Reiki 1st Aura and Chakra Attunement and Reiki Healing Attunement - Heal Emotional - Mental - Physical - Spiritual Issues and received these attunements. Afterwards I felt ready, and received the Master Attunement by Steve's DVD program. Steve's program is thorough and easy to understand, and his unique way of teaching is effective. The knowledge and attunements have been very helpful for me while on my own spiritual journey. I would recommend Steve Murray's program for anyone that is interested in becoming a Reiki Healer or expanding their own knowledge and intensifying their own abilities as an energy healer. Steve Murray leaves no stone unturned, and will leave you feeling enlightened, and stronger as an energy healer."},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"After being attuned to the 3 Reiki DVD's, I tried it out on 1 of my massage clients. He was more than willing to be my Guniea pig. I asked him not to tell me if anything was wrong, I wanted to see if I could figure it out on my own. While i was performing the session, i felt tingling going all over my hands & going up my arms. I wasn't sure if it was the Reiki or if my hands were falling asleep from holding them up for so long. They tingled all over his body. When our breif session (maybe about 15 minutes) was over, I asked him if he was sore all over. He responded, \\"Yes! How did you know?\\" I told him, \\"I just knew.\\" Still not sure if it was the Reiki, his wife, who is a dear friend, reinforced it for me. She said, \\"He said he NEVER felt anything like it in his life. He never felt such heat generated from something that wasn't touching his body.\\" I believe this is proof that the Reiki Steve's teachings and attunements work.His books are so helpful in answering questions that he didn't have time for on the DVD's. So far, my favorite is the \\"False Beliefs\\" book. I started out with that book. The others reiterate it & therefore, I believe make the Reiki stronger because you can understand it better. Steve is a wonderful teacher and is so helpful in answering your questions. There is no doubt in my mind that he is an even better teacher in person. If I had the money to visit him in California, I would. He is a very special person.

I took a lesson for one and two attunments. But I get more out of Steve Murray's information. I have all of his books, DVD's, CD's. I can go back at anytime to study the information. This way I learn it even better and grow with it. I can't go back to a class unless I pay BIG DOLLARS!!! This is well worth it, it teaches you the same thing a class does. When I did the first attunment I truly felt something, more than I did at a class. It give me more consentration being by myself so I get the real feeling. It's amazing.

The Reiki symbols are discussed and presented straightforwardly. I was particularly impressed by Steve's presentation of information adapted for the different Reiki Level I, Level II, and Master Level Reiki practitioners, with pictorial illustrations for the Attunements.Anyone wanting to learn about, or fine tune their understanding about Reiki and healing methods should buy this book. This tremendous resource will be used many times over and referred to often by myself and others. Steve has a very straightforward manner of writing that explains the basics, and takes the reader from student to master levels in Reiki with clear explanations and illustrations to guide the reader. My sister and I took two Reiki courses from someone else, and were amazed at how much more Steve Murray's writings filled in the gaps.I highly recommend this, and the companion books to anyone new to Reiki, or experienced. Wow!"},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"After doing the first attunement I was literally walking off the ground. The energy was incredible! Is a Reiki Attunement able to be given thru a video? YES!! I immediately went ahead and took the next attunement. It's amazing how many friends and family members start lining up once they know you've been attuned! Thanks to the books and DVD's I was able to channel the energy. I even gave myself the Reiki Aura Attunement for smoking and I'm happy to say that I've been able to drastically cut back! The Master Attunement was the icing on the cake. Steve's attunements are GREAT and I highly recommend that anyone interested in persuing reiki healing read his books and take his attunements. There is no reason to spend hundreds of dollars for an attunement all anyone needs is Steve Murray's Course (Books and DVD's)."},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"I enjoyed this book.

I enjoyed it very much and the attunements on Dvd works perfectly. The Book \\" Reiki the Ultimate Guide Volume 1\\" and the book \\"Reiki the Ultimate Guide Volume 2\\" are perfect for learning Reiki secrets and symbols and how to practice Reiki on yourself and others. These books are also perfect for learning how to attune other people in order to teach this beautiful and powerful energy. I also purchased all the attunements Dvd and I was amazed with the result. The \\"Reiki 1st level attunement\\" on Dvd was fascinating. I felt a tingling effect in my hands and crown chakra. I also felt a strong hot sensation like I was on fire. When viewing the \\"Reiki 2nd level attunement\\", I felt the same tingling sensation, but no warm feeling this time. The Dvd was very good. For the \\"Reiki Master level attunement\\" Dvd, I felt the same tingling sensation in my hands. I started practicing Reiki on myself, on friends and family members. Amazingly, they all felt the energy in their bodies even if I wasn't touching them at all. I was surprised that I was able to learn the Reiki techniques and to be attuned from a Dvd. But it sure works and I strongly recommend all of Steve Murray's products to everyone since Reiki can be learned by anyone. AAAAAAAA+++++++ to Steve Murray and thank you for making Reiki available to everyone."},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"I'm brand new to Reiki and reading the book was a bit informative, but the reviews were right--what the book claims to give on the back cover, doesn't pan out. The book says you'll learn why intent is so important. He just states that your intent is important...but there's NO EXPLANATION!Now here's a couple of specific problems I have. On page 142, the book states that Steve does the 1st level attunement in only one attunement instead of 3. (The book explains that there are 3 parts to a first level attuenment and it describes each step along with photos.) I assumed that this is what is happening in the DVD, but when looking at the steps illustrated in the book that the student is performing and that Steve is describing, then comparing what's happening in the DVD, it's just not possible. There are several repeated hand movements that you DON'T do in the video, so are we just getting ONE PART of a first level attunement? If so, then you aren't receiving a complete first level attunement. Also, and this is one of my biggest concerns, on page 156 it shows Steve guiding the students hands back into a prayer position (from having them previously open), blowing on them, THEN on page 157, the photograph shows the student still having her hands in the open position while Steve draws the long distance symbol in front of her third eye. Wait a minute! Where was the instruction of guiding the student's hands back to the open position? Or was the instruction for closing the student's hands at that point an error in the book? The book had been thorough in all of the steps until that point, which leads me to believe that there's an error. Or maybe it's all a bunch of crap. I've got questions and if I have doubts, then this Reiki DVD will not work. It probably wouldn't anyway. Yep, that's negative, but when you see something that's just not right, you become skeptical.Also, I have a hard time believing that Steve is doing a COMPLETE first level attunement on the DVD, especially after reading what is necessary to receive a first level attunement.And I have to admit, when visiting his web site, there's a lot of neat stuff, but it's very expensive! If you have a couple hundred dollars, go for it."},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"This is a good book, very informative and good value for money.

He has expanded the Usui oral tradition into the written word and beautiful video and audio experiences.

Even after becoming a reiki master, the questions remained. Either due to secrecy, or they themselves just didn't know. Since I was a young boy I have always wanted to know more about becoming a healer. It seemed with every turn came a hefty price or a brick wall. How does one explain a healing procedure, when your not sure of the answers yourself. It was like having an owners manual with most of the pages missing. Needless to say my reiki practice was limited to animals and close associates. Hey...at least the animals didn't ask questions. lol. After hearing about Steve Murrays Ultimate guide, I was skeptical. I did research and found all the wonderful things that was said about him and his reiki guides. My instincts kept telling me to go for it. To take a chance. So, in a bold endeavor for answers, I purchased all 5 volumes of Steve Murrays reiki guides. Plus, his book Reiki False Beliefs Exposed. His 1st, 2nd, and master reiki attunement dvds. Psychic and chakra attunement dvds. And his Animal Psychic Communications book. I'm here to tell you, it was one of the best investments I have ever made!! From the time I opened the first Ultimate guide. Answers came faster than I could have ever imagined. Through the straight forward and concise information in these materials, I have a renewed confidence. With the first book, I have learned more in one sitting than I had in several years of questioning. A special thank you goes to Steve Murray for his outstanding work."},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"Reiki the Ultimate Guide help me get started with Reiki.

This as a great way to become a Healer."},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"I ordered this book with hopes of understanding Reiki. To my pleasant surprise, this book exceeded that. Included in this book are reiki history, what reiki is, how reiki can be used, reiki symbols and how attunements are given (illustrated steps).

This is an excellent book to have in your reiki library."},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"This book is wonderful for someone who is learning Reiki. It has been invaluable to me. Steve has some different ideas from some of the other Reiki people I have read, and everything he has taught has worked really well for me. I have gotten all the attunements and have used them, and they work beautifully. They are relaxing to do, and make me feel very peaceful and calm and balanced afterwards. I try to do an attunement every week, as I feel it helps my Reiki get better every time I use it. I am just starting with Reiki, and have already helped several people and animals with it, as well as helped myself MANY times with it. Reiki is wonderful! Steve's books are easy to understand and apply, and are very practical. Another thing I really love about his books and DVDs, is the fact that he has answered all the questions I normally have that I can't get answered. It's like he has really considered all the things that might come up, and covered them so you're not left hanging. His style is simple and down-to-earth. He is just excellent at instructing on Reiki.

It is a very good book to have. It tells of things that most reiki masters omit or dont know. The section on protecting oneself against negative energies is worth the price of the book alone. It also incorporates other less known ideas on healing and sealing auras and other energy work associated with reiki.This book may be upsetting some reiki masters, but in this day and age , reiki and healing should be open to everyone.All through the book steve tells you that you still should be attuned by a master and this is the truth ,but in this book he shows how to do things,how to access others, what to do in certain healings,and how to protect yourself."},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"I have been a Reiki Master for years now &amp; read many books.

And that would be a devastatingly painful condition of the testicle that lasted twenty four hours a day, accompanied by equally terrible rectal pain. I was twenty something, just bought my first house, just married, just promoted to running a large retail store in town, and life was supposed to be grand. And except for working seventy hours a week, things were ok. I felt like I needed something exciting in my life, something thrilling. So this translated to buying a Racing-type street bike. I had a bike as a kid, so I already knew how to ride, and I had really enjoyed it, and missed the thrill of the wind and the speed.This desire for the exotic would be my ruin. After riding only a couple of months, I think the strain of working so many hours, plus all the heavy lifting I did in the stockroom, plus the notorious strain put on the groin area by the nick named \\"crotch rocket\\", it was just all too much. I developed not only pain but down on your knees pain, and had to continue working seventy hour weeks, it was retail, merciless. I kept going back to my urologist and he just could not figure it out, dragging out the damage and pain further over time. Finally after it had got to the point of me having to take a sauna bath before and after work, I was able to diagnose my self. After about twenty minutes in the hot water I realized that my right testicle could spin completely backwards like a face turning all the way around to face the back. That is not physically posible, and that is called a Tortion of the testicle. A tortion of the testicle which spins more than a 360 on it self can kill a testicle in a matter of minutes, completely cutting all blood supply to the testicle. I think mine had only gotten to 340, so I just had the pain, and the nerve damage and all the strange effects of letting that continue unchecked for six months.So, after I diagnosed myself to my doctor, I made perhaps a fatal flaw. I allowed him to do the surgery. He needed to basically sew it in place, that was it. But perhaps by that time so much damage was done to the nerves, I was beyond true surgical solution. I had the surgery and my allotted one week recovery time, yeah, one week. And went back to a downward spiral of blinding pain, emotions way out of control, so many different prescription drugs I know they have taken years off my life, divorce, bankruptcy- for medical costs, foreclosure, fighting the state system for disability, fighting my insurance company for my disability long term insurance, monthly prescription costs that look like a New York penthouse rental, to having to move back in with my folks, God bless them.Now that sums up the past eleven years and I tell you, I have really not had any good news since, I even developed a skin type condition on the scrotum area, probably from nerve damage, that required steroids a couple years ago that probably was going to cut my life span in half. But Reiki has completely healed that skin condition, in just a matter of a couple months, and I no longer have to use steroids and just that alone is a miracle to me! The deadly effect of steroids on the body, the heart, is infamous. And taking them through the skin on the scrotal area is the most direct way a man can take steroids. This is actually how the first steroid s were abused by the first bodybuilders and atheletes. So it is definitely a date with a casket in a hurry. If this is the only thing this program heals for me, it has already more than done what Western medicine could not. I would like to add that this was a condition that I developed a couple of years ago, three years after securing permanent disability status. So this was on top of that agony, life seemed to be getting darker by the minute.For the first time in over a decade I can cut back on the meds enough to keep my head clear enough to read and learn again, and that is a miracle to me! I am not stupid by a long shot, I have a Bachelor of Business Management from a major University, an IQ of 160, carried mostly A's and B's, but I am on so many different prescriptions for pain, at such high levels, I have trouble seeing the text on the page, much less concentrating! Reiki has helped me concentrate, memorize, and focus as if I am not taking anything but aspirin, amazing! I know that I will be able to reduce the doses of my medicine with close supervision of my physician. Reiki does not tell you to throw away all of your prescriptions. It recommends a sensible combination of traditional medicine augmented with Reiki. But I think since we are all different everyone will have some kind of Grand Unique Improvement in their lives either physically, mentally, emotionally, or spiritually. My eyes focus fine now, and I don't have trouble seeing any print now no matter what the size is.Reiki seems to really be helping me in every way, I am using it in every way I can to heal physically, mentally, emotionally, and most importantly, spiritually, because I have been bitter. I think years of pent up churning anger can rip you apart from the inside out, and I have the scars to prove it. I have experienced positive rebounds in each of these areas in just three months, if you put faith in the system and just let it work, you can literally cure yourself. Anyone who has read the \\"Secret\\" knows that healing with the power of the mind has been discussed as a real mental phenomenon, this is more like the \\"Secret\\" on Steroids! And no, this program has absolutely nothing to do with the book, the \\"Secret\\", I was just making an analogy.Reiki connects you to a sacred source that I can only compare to God, and promotes strong fast healing on all levels. And Reiki is also a system that allows you to direct the type of healing you most need and where you need it, it is hard to explain to those hearing about it for the first time. Usually you get the look. But you have to accept that this system works, there are forces in the Universe greater than humans and no, they don't have to answer to us.My dream would be to completely heal myself 100 percent, and then find employment using this wonderful system, I will keep using Reiki to try and make this a reality. By making this amazing system available to the average to more than average down trodden Joe, Mr. Murray has taken a self-less path of spreading this powerful knowledge to the masses, instead of those who would keep it a secret and sell it for a fortune to a fortunate few. This is a spiritually enlightened man who recognizes that salvation of a generation is worth more than salvation of a federation.Without Steve Murray's Reiki Program, I would still be declining in health, barely holding on to life, just barely.I can not honestly say I would be alive right now, had I not found Steve Murray's Reiki Books and Attunement Dvd's.Steve, Thank you does not seem like enough."},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"Only students that have not studied Reiki before will gain from Steve's books. Reiki is so much more than what is in this book. If you have been trained properly and really know about Reiki, you can see Steve Murray's limited, insufficient knowledge about Reiki fully exposed. Even some of the symbols are not entirely correct. I think it is a horrible and disgraceful publication that does not give Reiki any real credit, but rather promotes Steve Murray. The book contains very little useful information other than the pictures of himself. Prospective students think it is ok because Murray is a Reikimaster - but any fully certified and qualified Reikimaster will agree he is not a well trained one. This book proves the saying \\" that you get what you pay for\\" cheap bad quality and insufficient Reiki in paperback. I much prefer and would recommend anybody learning Reiki in other ways where you will get real personal attunements and practitioner information that make Reiki more powerful. Be it in class or online training. You can find many Reiki teachers and books that are much better than Murray's so why buy into all the hype?Think for yourself. Murray seems to be only publishing so called secrets to make bucks on Reiki. Reiki is sacred and one of the most beautiful, amazing self help tools in the world, but this is just not a way to give Reiki real credit. Or yourself the Reiki attunements and training you deserve. To be able to fully understand and use Reiki, you should think it over before you buy into his socalled Reiki teachings and books. I really think Murray should be ashamed of the way he is abusing Reiki in order to have a publishing business."},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"I have read four of Steve's books and used his DVD series for attunements. (These were in addition to previous attunements that I had experienced \\"in person\\".) My strong feeling is that Steve's video attunement was purer than my prior in-person attunements. There was no hidden agenda and no personal dynamics playing into the attunement. His intention is clear - to share Reiki energy and attunements with all who wish to have them. A major difference for me in receiving the Reiki attunements in this manner is that I, as the one seeking attunement, had to choose to completely own the energy & responsiblity that comes with an attunement. With my face-to-face attunments, I could let the Master do her thing, and she is the one who said, \\"you are ready\\". With Steve's attunement, I had to be introspective and explore my own beliefs and get to the point of self-empowerment where I was the one who could say, \\"I am really ready\\".Steve's Reiki guides are all packed with readily usable information - and for those of us who are visual learners, he has photographs for every step of Reiki treatments, attunements, symbols...for whatever the topic of his book is. A bonus is that there is a quote from a wise person preceeding each chapter - Rumi, Buddha, Confucius, etc.In addition to the valuable written/video resources, I have found Steve to be accessible (via email/phone) and a person of integrity (he refunded my overpayment on PayPal without me asking).I highly recommend his books & DVDs for those new to Reiki, and to those who have Reiki experience - this is great tangible, clear, complete reference material."},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"I've been a reiki practitioner since 1998, and just recently became a reiki master. My levels 1 and 2 classes were \\"bare bones\\", so I've sought out more information through a half-dozen or more books, and through several websites and their e-publications. Steve's books -- I own and have studied the trilogy -- are among the best i've found. He writes clearly and practically, the text is well edited, and i like his humble \\"take what you want from this\\" attitude. He shares what HE does, and how, but does not insist upon any rigid discipleship. I find that attitude most compatible with the nature of Holy Spirit (or Reiki) Itself. There is some repetition among his 3 books, but that's not necessarily bad. And indeed I have found some things more helpfully resonant with my own beliefs than others. But I'm pleased to own each book, and if I had had the opportunity to preview them before my purchase, I would have bought each one. I've had only one occasion to ask a specific question of him, by email, and I reveived a personal response from him late on the evening of the same day. So, at least in my experience, Steve DOES answer his mail! And that is a good thing!"},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"After two years of attending expensive Reiki classes with a local Reiki master, I discovered Steve Murray's books and DVD's. I was very skeptical at first, as I was told that Reiki had to be taught in person, distance attunements were not effective, Reiki symbols were secret, it takes years to learn to give Reiki attunements, and many other false beliefs. I purchased Steve's first book and attunement DVDt hinking it was a scam, certainly too good to be true. Now, I can't begin to tell you how wrong I was! The first book not only explained everything I had learned in two years, but it also debunked all the false beliefs that Reiki was a long, complicated, and costly process. It also explained how to pass the attunements, which most Reiki masters will not disclose. The attunement DVD was awesome. I will never question the effectiveness of a distance attunement again. I am not a very religious or spiritual person, so if it worked for me, it can work for anyone. Since then, I have purchased all 4 of Steve's books and all 5 attunement DVD's. Steve has truly made Reiki available and affordable for everyone! The attunements are powerful and the books get right to the point, covering an amazing amount of material in a short time. Without these books, it would take many years of research to learn all of this information. Everything you will ever need to become a Reiki master is packed into these books. They are a must read for everyone interested in Reiki healing. Whether you are a beginner or a Reiki master, these books will enhance your abilities. I believe they will be the best investment you will ever make. I wish I had known about Steve Murray's books and DVD's a long time ago."},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"I just finished reading all three of Steve Murray's Reiki Ultimate Guide Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 & 3 ...Vol. 2 & 3 go deeper into using Reiki via Chakras, and the Aura...These books don't just talk about Reiki they teach you how to apply itand in several ways, so you can treat those you love, or your clients in a way that is suited to their needs... I wish I had come upon these books first as they are really all that is needed in any Reiki book shelf.Not to mention once you are a Reiki Master you have his first book thatteaches you; with easy step by step (photos included) on how to pass theseAttunements to others, so you can become a Reiki Master/Teacher as well...I'm excited to try all the new techniques I've learned - and there are many within the pages, and best yet there are photos with detailed information embedded in them to better help you perform your Reiki Sessions. Another thing I love about this series is you will never get bored of Reiki as your not doing the same thing for each person - which is how it should be in any healing technique.Steve Murray also teaches in a simple to understand manner and thereis no arrogance involved. I feel his books are inspired to help those ofus that are having trouble finding a Reiki Master or learning Reiki, as heis open and upfront and doesn't leave anything out.I bought his DVD's as well, and they are state of the art - so if your having trouble finding a Reiki Master (like I did), then this series isexceptional. I've been attuned in person by a Reiki Master and via: SteveMurray's DVDs--and I can say I wish I had found Steve Murray's first as it would have saved me tons of money. Not mention I have the books to refer back to without wondering after My Reiki Master leaves the house, what I'm supposed to do with all the information (and unanswered questions)...Plus you can get your certificate through his program, and I still don't have mine from my Reiki Master, nor is it easy to reach her as a lot of people seem to have this trouble - making it another great reason to Turn to Steve Murray - as the answers are always there and he has a great support website and even answers my e-mails... And the bonus is; the Certificates really do arrive...I've enjoyed these programs and I truly believe I was brought to them via\\"Divine intervention\\" which paved the way for me to find what I was searching for... Whatever you decide in your search for Reiki and it's teachings, may the Universal Life Force energy grace your path..."},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Volume 1 &amp; Volume 2I have never come across a guide like this! It is a must have for any level Reiki Practitioner. Steve Murray truly takes the time to guide you through the Reiki process. It is a wonderful guide for both beginners to Reiki and Masters as well. In this first volume Steve covers what Reiki is, what attunements are, how to prepare yourself for attunements and what to expect. For anyone who may have fears about Reiki, this will put you at ease. This book also erases the confusion some may have felt by teachers of Reiki in the past. The step by step guide shows how to place hands, give and receive a Reiki attunement, and shows you the Reiki sacred symbols.In Volume 2 Steve guides us through using Reiki with Chakras as well as using Reiki for specific physical ailments. He expands on many more techniques for healing with Reiki and gives step by step instructions. This is a wonderful addition to the first volume and helps understand chakras at an eye opening level, making this and the concept of Reiki more understandable ands so much more accessible to everyone. Both of these books are clear, concise and make one feel at ease with learning and using Reiki.Also, I highly recommend the attunements series!"},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"I just got your book yesterday and it was very well thought out and written, making it so much easier for me to understand. I really enjoy it as it is really helpful for me to see how things are done since I am a very visual person. I had felt I was fumbling thru the healing sessions and so on and now with your book, it gives me a clearer picture of what to do."},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"This book gives you the step-by-step processes for giving Reiki. For a newcomer, Reiki The Ultimate Guide provides the student with everything necessary to learn and give Reiki. The detailed photos make learning the Reiki Attunements effortless. For the more Reiki educated, such as Reiki Practitioners and even Masters, Steve's Reiki the Ultimate Guide provides the missing pieces to the Reiki puzzle - he brings light to the dark in Reiki. I use Steve's methods for grounding and clearing before I leave our home, or before important meetings, as well as before giving Reiki of course, and find that my mind is very calm and clear for whatever I am about to do. This book is a must-buy for any serious Reiki Healer at any level, and the next two books in Steve's Reiki Guide series, Reiki the Ultimate Guide Learn Reiki Healing with Chakras and Reiki the Ultimate Guide Learn New Reiki Aura Attunements, are even more powerful and exciting."},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"Up until a few months ago I had no idea that I could learn Reiki because of the price many were charging. I had all but given up hope on ever affording to learn this healing modality. I had heard from friends who learned Reiki about the PRICE [$$$PRICE$$$] they payed to learn Reiki. Ouch! I basically had forgotten about wanting to learn Reiki (because of sticker shock) until I came across on Amazon.com Steve Murray's attunment videos and guide by accident. Let me tell you this mode of getting the attunments REALLY WORKS!Another Reiki Master doubted the ability of getting the attunments via a VHS or DVD, but I was open minded because of all of the spiritual seeking and experiences I have had in my life. The Reiki Master discouraged me and like reverse psychology, I went ahead and purchased them anyway. I guess No means Yes to me.My experience with the attunment video's were VERY POWERFUL. I felt like I was in a trance (I am sure I was) and the room became very bright white and cloudy. It felt as if an Ascended Master could have walked right in the room with me at any moment.I could most definitely feel the energy!By the end of the attunments it felt like I had slapped my hands together so hard and could feel the energy, tingling and heat in my hands and even in my feet. Purchasing the guide book is really something you should do if you are going to get the attunment video's or DVD's. They go hand in hand. Money well spent!I have since been using Reiki on myself, my son and even a wild bird who flew into my sliding glass door. I have also done a session on my Mom who was sick in Brazil on a trip while I was at my home in California and also to a sick friend in Arizona.Owning the attunment videos is so wonderful because I can reattune anytime and as often as I like.Thanks Steve for being a Maverick and making it possible for me and others like me to afford to learn Reiki!!!Love and Light to all!Kim"},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"It seems thru out history, that when things get off original intent and become less pure, is when things become too rigid or fanatical. And the healing arts is no exception to those possibilities. When others are charging an arm and a leg for Reiki training, attunement and the information, Steve Murray clearly stands by his vow, stated in his book, THE ULTIMATE GUIDE TO REIKI and he brings clarity, integrity, simplicity and freedom to Reiki and those desirous of learning it. Steve has written the Reiki Bible, in my opinion, I highly recommend THE ULTIMATE GUIDE TO REIKI.It set my mind at ease.Nancy Glasgow"},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"\\"Reiki Master Attunement Become a Reiki Master DVD\\", along with the book, \\"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know\\" was a powerful and rich experience. The guides help make the attunement process clear and easy to follow. I especially appreciated reading of Steve Murray's personal journay, through the pitfalls and roadblocks associated with becoming a Reki Master. Reiki is something that needs to be shared."},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"Having exchanged emails with the author, Steve Murray (who never hesitated to answer my questions ), I am absolutely convinced of his sincerity. After you read this book, you will be too.Reiki is Divine--but anything Divine that has to go through human hands can be held back, held up or withheld when factors such as money--or pride, in some cases--are allowed to get in the way. It can be frustrating when a sincere seeker earnestly tries to gain access to the very thing that can help him/her the most.Steve Murray refused to give up on his search and eventually found the training and answers he sought, and he has made a great effort to aid those others who seek Reiki healing and training but cannot find a teacher, a practitioner...or the mega-bucks it can cost to receive the Attunements...he created this new text to compliment his well-received series of Reiki videos and DVD's.Now, Steve will tell you this is NOT a &quot;History of Reiki&quot; book and encourages the reader to continue to read and research Reiki on their own, as well as to discover new ways to use the Reiki energy for the betterment of all. Personally, I highly recommend that this book be used in tandem with any or all of Steve's first rate video/DVD Attunement programs--I have used all but the Master Attunement (I have it but want to work longer with the Symbols before I choose to take the Master Level training)and have found them first rate on all counts. They work--without question.I have been involved in the Healing Arts and metaphysics for over 30 years, starting back in the 1970's. I have taught courses, lectured in many cities and had the pleasure of listening to and studying with teachers from a wide range of spiritual disciplines. To be blunt, I was born a skeptic and a cynic--I know a con-game when I see one--and again, I say that Steve Murray's earnestness as a Reiki teacher is straight from the heart.Steve Murray--and those who walk the same Maverick road--are to be applauded for putting resources of healing into the hands of those who need it most. Shanti!"},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"I really love this book. It is really great to see someone open up in this selfless way to offer what is rightfully ours as humans, a way to heal ourselves. The world can use as much love as it can get, and it is time to get the ego out of the way. Reiki was meant to be free, not only for the wealthy, or to make people wealthy. Yes, I believe that a person's time and effort should be rewarded by an exchange of energy, but $10,000 is way beyond.It is like charging money for air...Along with this book, I also recommend Weave's Reiki cds. He has released the first three symbols in musical form, using sacred geometry and ancient tunings to represent each symbol. Each cd is very beautiful. They are wonderful during Reiki treatments. Each one resonates the vibration of the symbol in a way that only music can do."},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"As a recently attuned level I practitioner, I hoped for some good, solid education on the actual practice of Reiki. Instead, more than half of Steve Murray's book concentrates on full-page photos of himself doing attunements or drawing symbols over his clients' heads. The very few actual instructions he gives are wishy-washy (do it this way, unless you want to do it another way). I did enjoy the (very short) chapter, with no photos or illustrations, on using Reiki to contact spirits.In general, I think this book is a list of very vague hints about the wonders of Reiki, each of which might be expounded on in another, and then yet another, of Mr. Murray's books or CD's or videos. I won't buy any more of them. I've found infinitely more helpful information in a Yahoo group devoted to Reiki."},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"This book should be called the Reiki Masters Ultimate Guide. This book does not give any information on hand positions or administering self Reiki. It's all about attunements, which is no good unless you are a Reiki Master. Level I and II's, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"Having bought several of Steve Murray's books and DVDs - I have yet to be let down. This book is truely the \\"Ultimate Guide\\"I will probably never read it from cover to cover in sequence, but in the month that I have had it, I have turned many of the pages for that 'just right' bit of information that I needed NOW.Thanks again Steve"},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"The Gift I was given by Steve Murray when I read his books, is a gift that I plan to pay forward. This Reiki Master gives so much to each reader. My life was enriched by his first two books: Reiki The Ultimate Guide-Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know and Reiki The Ultimate Guide Vol. 2-Learn Reiki Healing with Chakras, plus New Reiki Healing Attunements for All Levels. The illustrations and instructions are excellent. I have experienced all three Reiki Attunements on DVD, Reiki First Level Attunement, Reiki Second Level Attunement as well as the Reiki Master Attunement and I found that the enhancements each Attunement brought to my practice of Reiki to be amazing. This has been a wonderful experience for me. I found that I will use the books daily and the DVD's over and over for many years. I would recommend these wonderful programs to anyone on the Reiki path."},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"Before finding Steve I was a Reiki II Practitioner and spent $300 on that training. I was seriously considering paying the $500 to become a Reiki Master when I came upon Steve's DVD's on netflix. I am now a Reiki Master through Steve's Reiki Master DVD and have recently begun teaching Reiki Classes. It's been one of the most amazing experiences of my life. I have a master's degree in education and am a former schoolteacher and absolutely LOVE Steve's work and his simple, straightforward presentation style. My students love his books and the Dvd's provide excellent reinforcement in the classes I teach. As we move into the 21st Century I believe it's crucial to spread this work as far and as wide and as QUICKLY as we can. It's a shame if this amazing healing technique has been kept from anyone because of the cost of classes. Raising the consciousness of this planet should be everyone's priority and learning Reiki is one way we can effect a massive shift for many. My blessings go out to Steve for being a true maverick in this field and letting spirit lead him."},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"This book is one of the best I've read in my 10 years of non-stop study in the healing energy arts, especially Reiki. Steve's approach is open, honest and straight to the point. Sure with different Reiki teachers you are going to get some different minor points here and there. This is the nature of Reiki at it's core anyway. We are all connected to this great source of healing energy, and we all have a different use and way of reaching for it. The good part is simply to take that reach. Steve's entire course is hand crafted to spell out the knowledge and give the guidance needed to heal yourself and others. So many Reiki books are packed with information that while interesting and good to know, don't really help you get into the healing aspect of Reiki. Within pages you'll be on your way with his Books and Dvd's. I still suggest reading Reiki History for your own sense of knowledge, not trying to be \\"instant Reiki\\" about my review, which is something Steve suggests we all do too. I highly and with pride say to each and everyone of you, take the chance to read his work - you only have healing growth to achieve! Only YOU can stand in the way of what his books and Dvd's have to offer. And I say that because I stood in my own way for years and years - so glad I finally opened my heart & mind and moved out of my own way!"},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"I must admit this is the first book I bought on the subject and remains my favorite because it really is the ultimate guide. The author doesn't hold back on anything that can be of help to the serious student of Reiki, which is a Japanese word for the Universal Life Energy that is available to all of us to use for healing any situation as well as an aid to healing the human body. Each attunement is explained in full along with its proper symbol, giving the reader a complete view on the power of Reiki. I love this book!"},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"This book was a quick read, since there are many full page illustrations. I have revisited the book often, and consider it a valuable resource for years to come.I admit to being skeptical when I purchased Steve Murray's products: How could a Reiki Master justify passing the secret Reiki symbols on to the general public? But I feel that we live in different times now. To coin a phrase by Caroline Myss, there are now many \\"Mystics without monasteries.\\" I am grateful that Steve has made attaining higher levels of Reiki practice available to those who cannot afford to go the traditional route."},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"I would like to thank Steve Murray for providing these Reiki attunement programs. I have received 1st and 2nd degree from his products and also from a live class. The experiences were very different but both were wonderful. I have not been able to raise the $1,000 required for my Masters Attunement from the organization that I received my live 1st and 2nd from but Steve has made it very affordable to receive the attunement. I have read some of the reviews and see that one or two have been upset because they didn't feel anything. I don't know what they expected to feel but Steve does explain that if you can't feel anything it does not mean that you did not receive the attunement. I have definitely been able to tell that I have received the Master Attunement even though I didn't \\"feel\\" that much while receiving the attunement.I definitely recommend that anyone taking his attunements also read his Ultimate Guide Trilogy. They are so packed with information about Reiki that I feel so much more prepared to be a Reiki healer than I did prior to reading them. They are truely wonderful and his A Reiki 1st, Aura and Chakra DVD is very helpful in showing you how to perform your own attunements. Reiki False Beliefs Exposed is very good in answering questions you might have about things you have heard about Reiki and setting the record straight in many areas. I also have had Steves Psychic attunement and the wonderful thing about his programs is that you can take them over and over again and that is something you can't do with a live attunement. Of course, you need to follow Steve's cautions in waiting three days between pschic attunements. I believe that taking the Reiki Healer attunements over and over can continue to improve my abilities to be a better healer."},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"Kudos! Steve's Reiki book is supercalifragilisticexpealadocious!!!Clear and concise, an easy, excellent read with awesome attributes. I read it cover to cover as soon as it arrived and read it again the next day. As a result, I ordered all Steve's Reiki DVD's, for important instructional use in my work. Thank you. Beneficial for the beginner or the Reiki Master.The Reiki community is richer for your informative and creative contribution."},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"I strongly believe that anyone giving Reiki should have this book as a constant reference guide. It answers any questions about Reiki, its uses and what is happening during an attunement.I, like many others, took Reiki level 1 &amp; 2 withoug many of my questions being answered. I went away from the attunements without much physical support in the form of how the symbols were drawn and their specific uses because we were not allowed to keep drawings or any written information regarding the symbols. Everyone's life is very busy and unless these symbols can be regularly reviewed they will disappear from personal use. Therefore I was absolutely delighted to discover this book and have been devouring its contents ever since receiving a copy.This wonderfully informative book has led me to Steve Murray's excellent attunement DVDs. His manner of attunement, via DVD, really surprised me with marvelous results. The attunement experience is ver personal and wonderful and I have noticed a much stronger flow of energy and an quicker healing response with Reiki sessions on myself since taking the level 1 &amp; 2 attunements and using the symbols.I personally recommend &quot;Reiki The Ultimate Guide&quot; and Stever Murray's attunement DVDs as an excellent support for any Reiki practitioner or anyone interest in Reiki."},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"I read The Ultimate Reiki Book. Wow, I could not put it down, did not put it down until I read the whole book. It paints a clearer picture of what your are receiving. I have since read it again. I use all reinforcements available.Now I figure I am ready to start taking Steve Murray's 1st Reiki Attunement DVD. I became one with the crystal and Earths crystal at the core. I could feel the huge crystal in the earth pop open and spin, the light energy came right on up the central vertical body current and through the top of my head past the crown several inches. Again I start releasing junk. So I go with it embrace what's is happening and go back to my cocoon to process. This time I feel the heartache I have had just float away, and light energy filled my heart.Steve's 2nd Reiki Attunement was very subtle, and soft. I know there were cellular changes, I didn't crave the foods I feel additive to, the desire to smoke has faded. I could also feel the crystal energy passing my Central Vertical Body current, up the feet, out the crown, then from crown back to earth.Nothing like liquid light cleanse!When I did the Reiki Master Attunement.I felt information coming through every cell in my body, I couldn't understand what the garble was, could feel my ears and sinuses open and receive, could see little light orbs swirling about, I felt my hands, crown and base start to get warm and by time the attunement was over I had so much heat radiating through my body, it was like seeing the heat waves coming up from a hot black pavement in the summer.Since then I have been able to pick up on friends in need of love, kindness, sympathy and be able to call them tell and ask what is going on, how can I help, that I feel they need soothing. I have been right on every time. This happens even to people I have a casual relationship with. People I am close to, well it \`s almost like telepathic energy. I don't dare let my shields down or l feel all of their pain or suffering, I let in the joy, but I won't allow myself to be a sponge.Reiki is a beautiful gift and everyone would benefit by it.Thank you Steve Murray for doing your part in loving the human race and sharing this gift.Blessings and Peace to All,Marcia Gunning"},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"I am impressed with the quality of Steve's new book which is filled with much informative information. It's easy to read and understand the how to picture attunements and symbols, as well as secrets of Reiki which are important to know.His book and video series has empowered me with more knowledge of Reiki (a gift from God), which helps assist others in need of healing. I have witnessed these powerful results.You're a blessing Steve! Thank you for caring and sharing your heartfelt insights on the wonderful world of Reiki."},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"Steve's book gives a very honest look at how some Reiki Masters view the symbols as something only to be shared with someone who is willing to pay for the knowledge. I believe the Masters that would be angry with Steve's book, are totally missing the purpose behind why we are called to healing in the first place. We who heal, do not do it for the glory for ourselves, but to give glory to God who uses us as an instrument of healing. God knows there are so many that need healing. If some Masters become angry, well they will have to contend with this self- created negativity and I feel sorry for them. The Guide has proven to be an excellent reference book for me. You won't be sorry that you made this investment."},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"I like this book because it is written by a man who truly believes in Reiki and what Reiki can do. There is no elitism here or orthodox viewpoints which interfere with your absorption of the material. Steve's introduction is quite honest and I admire him for his dedication to making Reiki affordable to people.What The Ultimate Guide can give you is a working knowledge of how to draw the symbols and the process of attunements. This is great if you got your Reiki via distance or via informal training. The pictures are very easy to follow and detail hand positions and how and where to draw the symbols for passing on attunements.It doesn't give you a broad range of techniques, so if you are looking for more extensive information on how to do specific techniques like karma clearing, releasing emotional trauma, or manifesting abundance, this isn't the book for you. It's a very simple bare bones kind of book. It will get you through the basics, but is not intended for the advanced practitioner.I also wouldn't recommend this book if you have a traditional approach to Reiki. Though chances are that if you do, you probably aren't even looking at this book (unless you've never heard of it before). Many Reiki practitioners do not want the symbols published and widely distributed even though some of these symbols have been used for centuries in other cultures that do not necessarily practice Reiki. Buddists have not been harmed for being exposed to some of these symbols, so I don't think that practitioners should freak out if non-Reiki people see them.If you are receiving treatments or are thinking about becoming a Reiki praticioner, this book may give you some basic information so that you can understand what is happening during your session and why. It will also explain what happens during an attunement, which is the initiation of the Reiki energy."},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"After taking class in reiki 1 level, I was having lot of questions about symbols, attunments and wanted to have first hand informations ( which is normally not revealed) and was surfing amazon.com (USA \\\\) and saw this book which I imediately ordered. This book is in so simple and lucid language that when you read it feels like Mr. Murray is talking and explaining it to you standing in front. Mr. Murray has very remarkably driven the point home that Reiki is a divine energy and there is no secret what so ever a layman should not know. In fact before deciding to take attunements each individual should read this book so he knows exactly what is what. Fears that opening all the secrets symbols and attunements process will harm Reiki principles is baseless since one needs to practise with real devotion as explained by Mr. Murray to expereince Reiki in its full power. ( Its like Reading a cooking book does not make one a cook unless lot of practise goes in the process of learning)I wish to congratulate Mr. Murray and eagerly waiting for his second book.(...)"},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"I am an Usui Shiki Ryoho Reiki Master and shamanic practitioner. Everyone has the power to heal and none of us need Reiki or any other method to do this. An example of our own healing is power is the placebo effect. Does anyone need to know anything or receive any attunements to heal themselves with their own mind during the placebo effect? I don't teach and I am currently doing energy healing volunteer work so I don't have any financial interests in selling or not selling any books or materials and only offer my experience and opinion for the consideration of others thinking about taking Reiki or purchasing any healing books, DVDs, and training/classes.I had one on one training from a Reiki Master with Karuna training. Can you learn such practices from books and DVDs? Sure, but the in person training from someone who has genuine interest in these practices can't be replaced and the ongoing relationship and guidance from the Reiki Master who taught/attuned me has been extremely helpful. Unfortunately not everyone is a good and dedicated teacher and some are caught up in ego and making money rather than being of service to others. And perhaps some have not put in the work to learn what they should to be effective teachers and advisers. I have met healers who are certified to teach in their energy work method and when I ask about their experience they have actually only worked on a relative small amount of people and don't have much actual experience using their method on people. The person who attuned me through the Reiki levels up to Master has been practicing for 11-12 years and had the Karuna training about 8 years ago. She has also put in her time treating others and was able to give me some good guidance. The comments about secrecy also appear to be rather dated. Reiki symbols can be found easily these days and I was taught the purpose of not showing the symbols is a practice of respect not secrecy.I was already able to heal before I took the shamanic workshop and Reiki training/attunements and I am clairsentient so perhaps this has influenced my experience. Before taking the Reiki Master attunement I was curious about the Reiki Master attunement DVDReiki Master Attunement Become a Reiki Masterand purchased it. I didn't feel anything after watching it and receiving the DVD attunement. In the attunements from the Reiki Master I had experiences that simply did not happen with the DVD. The distant/DVD attunements probably work, but I feel these attunements are of lesser quality. Perhaps that is why some of the comments are that they feel more power, etc. when they repeat the attunements. A search of the Internet will bring ups distance attunements for free or fees as low as $10 and there are some videos on YouTube offering free Reiki attunements and other Reiki info so you might also explore these if they are still available. I have never had the need to repeat an attunement, but again, because I already possess healing and psychic ability I may differ from others. I know some Reiki Masters have taken classes from other Reiki Masters to learn new techniques, but don't know if any repeated attunements do anything extra.I have purchased Reiki, The Ultimate Guide volumes 1 & 5Reiki the Ultimate Guide Vol. 5 Learn New Psychic Attunements to Expand Psychic Gifts & Healing (Reiki: The Ultimate Guide)again out of curiosity. The attunements differ from what I was taught from William Lee Rand's books (I didn't see the Master Manual currently listed in product links)Reiki, the Healing Touchand have read a few other Reiki books. For teaching purposes I believe William Lee Rand's books to be better since they contain more information on healing sessions. This is not to say Mr. Murray's books aren't of value and certainly you can get a different point of view. Since I don't teach and have not performed any attunements I cannot comment on the quality of the attunements in Mr. Murray's books. The pictures clearly illustrate Mr. Murray's system and the majority of the books are on the various attunements. I differ with Mr. Murray on some of his teachings/statements; however, overall the books do contain quite a bit of information although some of it is very short given the attention to the attunements versus healing sessions. There is little on Reiki hand positions for healing sessions and the difference between using touch versus holding the hands above the person receiving the treatment. The explanation of the chakras could be better/fuller and there is no mention of the potential release of kundalini. His section on beaming only shows beaming from the hands. The Reiki Spirit Board is a Ouija board with Reiki symbols on it--not sure why that was included in the book when you can just buy a Ouija board and put some Reiki energy into it and symbols on it. I haven't done any of the psychic attunements so I can't comment on whether they would expand my psychic abilities. Perhaps there is more information on healing sessions, etc. contained in his other books and DVDs. I plan to try the self attunements from Vol 5 and will report my experience. You can see some clips showing William Lee Rand on YouTube put there by his publisher Sounds True showing him giving a healing session, etc. by searching on his name if you are interested in his style versus Steve Murray or want to learn something more about Reiki. The videos are from the DVD inThe Reiki Touch: Complete Home Learning System.Mr. Murry uses attunements for his healing process and I don't disagree they work, but they more appropriate if you have a private Reiki practice. Also, I would think it would be wise to still know how to give a \\"regular\\" Reiki treatment this may be necessary even after the attunement. As I do healing as a volunteer in local medical facilties attunements aren't practical. It's tough enough to get the patients there to try energy work without offering attuments which I am sure would bring up more issues then help patients. Also some of the patients are trauma patients and it would be difficult to do an attunement on them. I also don't know if it would be appropriate on someone who isn't conscious."},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"Steve Murray has brought Reiki to those who can't afford to spend the big bucks for spiritual lessons/meditations, and healing (hey, didn't Christ do that?) I believe in Reiki and I believe that the here and now IS the here and now. Steve Murray is right on about channeling energy through the distance, we are one, we are connected, whether we think good or evil, we are all connected so it makes sense that you would be able to send energy this way, I know I listen to Orin and DaBen tapes all the time that are phenomenal at doing this. We all have the spiritual potential to heal others and saying so and making it easily accessible puts Steve Murray high on my list. Reiki Master and Ethical Master is what I say."},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"I have bought Steve Murray's book \\"Reiki The Ultimate Guide\\" and all three attunement DVD's and have found them to be the answer to my prayers. Steve made the unprecedented decision to offer attunements to the world, either via his DVD's or by phone. This decision has meant many people like myself, a single parent with a small bank balance also have the ability to learn and give Reiki. It has been suggested by some Reiki Masters, that those not attuned in person, are in fact not attuned at all. Well I beg to differ.My sister gave birth to twins, Tyler and Ethan in August 2003. They were born premature, and while in special care contracted the deadly MRSA virus. Their two week old veins were pumped with every antibiotic, and their recovery hung in the balance, however eventually they both pulled through.This poor start to life has meant they are susceptible to any viral infections going around, and when one gets ill the other one soon gets it too. Tyler was very ill with a chronic chest infection, it was 3 days before his temperature finally dropped to normal on the Friday. The Saturday I took my Level 2 attunement, which enables you to send distance healing. My sister called me on the Monday to say that Ethan was very poorly with a high fever. That night I sat quietly after my meditation, and sent Reiki to Ethan. I visualised Gods loving light entering and surrounding his little body. The following morning I called my sister to find out how Ethan was, she told me when he woke that morning his fever had gone, he was alert, and was taking fluids and had breakfast. That is the power of Reiki, and the gift that Steve Murray has given me and my family by his selfless generosity in giving Reiki attunements to everyone. God bless you Steve, and thank you."},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"This book comes with me wherever I go. It is a great quick reference guide for the symbols, how to give an attunement, and answers any questions you may have. After reading this book, I was able to give myself Reiki with a renewed belief and spirit. After purchasing this book, I purchased Steve's DVD's. I highly recommend all of the Reiki programs Steve Murray has to offer. They are indeed awe-inspiring."},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"Steve's book is very fresh and very open - pure. It is written from a truly spiritually perspective, does not discount other methods of healing and therefore is very secure and mature in its beautiful clear writing. I appreciate the fact that Steve says Reiki can be used with other modalities of healing and does not try to take away or compare Reiki with other sciences. This book rises above the level of human insecurity and competition and strife and takes the shroud and mystery away. It is written on a humble approach and is very honest. It has what I believe to be a truly spiritual approach because of these inner qualities that emerge in the material. It is no wonder so many people are attracted to his wonderful material. Steve explains the reiki approach, the use of the symbols, and the attitude and intent of the healer. I am also a healer and minister and appreciate Steve's approach which is that the Universal power, (I call the God power)is a divine gift for all people to be shared for the betterment of all. Steve's book and videos and DVD's are based on these true healing principles. I think anyone who gets the book and videos and DVD's will appreciate their value many times over."}]`),S={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},E={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],H={key:0},W={key:1};function R(n,o,s,u,r,i){const c=y("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",E,[(e(!0),t(f,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),g(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",W,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",H,"See more"))],8,x)):b("",!0)])}const q=d(S,[["render",R],["__scopeId","data-v-a55de1ef"]]),O=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/21.md","filePath":"quotes/21.md"}'),N={name:"quotes/21.md"},P=Object.assign(N,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[p(q)]))}});export{O as __pageData,P as default};
