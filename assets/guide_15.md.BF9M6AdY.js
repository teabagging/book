It is a good business writing manual, but to an English student and editor, it falls rather short. For example, Sabin's advice on generic pronouns and gender may suit a business proposal with \\"his or hers\\" and \\"he or she\\" littering the page, but in the humanities, this is becoming less and less acceptable.

There are few examples, and the ones that are there, are poorly explained. There is a severe lack of organization - he just seems to spew information. At times he shows us his humor - not very funny, but the most readable part of the book.He spends too much time bashing C and C++. (Does he think it makes him look smart?) I want to learn Java, not compare it to other languages and think how great I am for using it (like he does). One has to know C++ to understand what he's saying.

(Who said I think too much about the variables? Again, the standard is to put the variables at the top).I don't even think this book is good as a reference, too disjointed, not structured enough to find info quickly. On top of that, there's an incredible amount of basic stuff left out.Too reiterate, this is absolutely the worst Java book I've read.

Sure, if you read the book cover to cover you won't remember everything at once, but each section is very clear, the progression of sections is logical, and the chapters are just long enough that you feel you've learned something without being overwhelmed. Beginners can reread chapters, intermediates can bowl right through, and advanced people should be buying books that aim at advanced programmers, instead of complaining about the level of this one. I originally tried to learn from &quot;Java for Dummies&quot;, which is a terrible book, and I'm very glad I found Van der Linden's book. Worth every penny for me."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"This book was my pick based on the reviews. I know how to write code in VB, and Cobol. I was wrong in getting this book though. The author feels a good way of teaching Java is to relate everything in terms of how it was done in C, and how its done &quot;now&quot; in Java. This really bugs me. Not only that but the fact that he does this &quot;some light relief&quot; at the end of hard to understand sections. This really bugged me. Not only does he not explain the stuff well, because he wastes time explaining how its done in &quot;C&quot;. But then wastes space telling stupid stuff i didn't pay for. If i wanted to laugh i would have bought a delbert book. Through the whole book there were area i didn't understand anything, and then he made it worse by giving examples in C. I got the feeling that if i didn't know C i was not in the crowd he was talking to. I wanted to just focus on learning Java, not learning C and C++ also. It made my head red angry trying to figure out what was going on some times with all these C examples. I talked with a friend who already knew C, and it made sense to them. So i guess if you already know C, this is going to be your book for learning Java. But if your new to this stuff i would buy a much better book like, Beginning Java 2, which is more complete, and starts from the bottom line. The pics in this book are good. Thats the reason i gave this book a 2 star, thats all i got out of it."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"I loved &quot;Just Java 2&quot;, and found it a great tutorial on all the key aspects of Java. Unlike what one other reviewer wrote, there is no assumption of C++ (It amazes me that people who read a book so superficially feel free to share their wrong assumptions about it). Just Java 2 is well written and easy to follow. The examples are interesting, and the source, the Java FAQ, and a wealth of other info and compilers is on the accompanying CD. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"This is not a good Java book. It goes too fast over topics that should be covered in more depth, lacks examples, mentions concepts never explained before, and the teaching style is horrible. If you want a thorough introduction to Java, with plenty of examples, and a well-organized method of teaching, do not buy this book, instead get &quot;Beginning Java 2&quot; by Ivor Horton. &quot;Just Java&quot; seems like was written to simply let you know that the language exists and it has this and this feature, but it doesn't teach how to use them. I don't even see it as being a good reference book.

IGNORE MY PREVIOUS POSTING BELOW, IT'S USELESS WITHOUT THE TABLE!I've written a comparative review 0764580302).Look up the review of the five books from Amazon - I had to remove all the columns of the other 5 books from the table below b/c Amazon's HTML parser doesn't understand table tags. In order to get a clear, (hopefully) objective view of all the books,I've also read Jamie before the test, but, as the book is only intended for experienced programmers interested in additional and enterprise APIs and not for beginners, I dropped it from the test entirely. It would have been unfair to test such an expert-only book in a review of beginners' books.Peter comp.lang.java.* newsgroups. He's the Java author in this test that posts the most to these groups and helps the Java society even in E-mail (he answered my first mail in 2 hours, for example). In addition, he maintains an extremely well written Java Usenet FAQ (www.afu.com). I, too, use this FAQ and recommend it to my students at my courses - just after showing them the best books to learn Java from and how the API docs should be used. In a word, this is the Java FAQ on the Web that is the easiest to use (to search in) and most up-to-date. Also, he set up the Usenet Java newsgroups in their current form. He does not only help the Java people on the Net, but also donated 20% of the book advance to computer related charities and to the Gnu organization.The book is especially intended for the beginner. This means it doesn't cover less important or special interest topics, the two main ones being JNI and reflection (see the table below). Reflection is of interest mostly to systems tools writers (I don't teach it either - I'm extremely proud of actually making my students learn practical programming in a week by only choosing things that can be understood and learnt in such a short time), and JNI only to those writing non-100% pure Java code. Core Java does cover all these but you have to buy and read both volumes. Furthermore, Just Java has been written in a way that is not only easy to comprehend but also tries to keep the reader's attention. Each chapter ends with an interesting anecdote from the industry. There are stories about a contract programmer who went broke (with his real name and current location - I wonder if Linden gets lynched by all the people he wrote an anecdote of - after all, real names are mentioned in every story), Miniscribe, who started shipping bricks to boost their sales, the phantom Windows memory and 286-turbo software etc. So, you will be entertained during reading.This is also the only book in the test that uses the old, well-known explanation of the C++ - to - C-mapping used in the better C++ textbooks. Though, with some additional work the book could have been made even more comprehensive.The layout of the book, on the other hand, is below expectations. Other books DO try to save paper and don't insert page feeds where it isn't necessary. Linden's book is different. There're a lot of occasions when with a bit better editing tens of pages could have been sometimes doesn't adhere to the Java naming conventions. Both other 'killer' books don't have such mistakes.The CD coming with the book is a gold-mine, too. It has over 600MB of Java compilers (every version, even the early betas! It's indeed a very wise move from Linden). It also includes compilers for a dozen other languages (TCL, Perl, Sather, Eiffel, etc) so programmers can compare Java to these other languages (not that a language can be learnt from using this without some real books, but it's still nice to have this CD around with a lot of stuff like this).Having said this, the strengths and weaknesses of the book is mostly explained - refer to the table below to see if a particular subject is touched upon.What did I compare?I tried to evaluate each book in a comparative fashion. Unfortunately, when it's time to evaluate a book's being comprehensive AND discussing / mentioning everything with ONE rating, it's hard do decide which to prefer. Should we give a better mark to a book that is more comprehensive but less wide-reaching, that is, lacking the discussion of some features of the language? Should we do the opposite? Fortunately, there weren't many cases where this caused me headache, as, in general, the books are both comprehensive AND fully discuss everything. Nevertheless, I included a row in the table. This row evaluates each book's being both beginner-friendly (that is, whether it's intended to a newcomer) and discussing everything at much higher depth than the API docs. The higher the mark, the better suited for the target audience (beginners or the experienced) the book. These two ratings, of course, don't have to be equally high for a good book - for example, Java in a Nutshell, an outstanding reference, would hardly get a rating higher than 2 when evaluating its suitability for beginners. A book, on the other hand, that receives ratings that are both below 3, isn't intended for outstanding, far better than any other bookReferences in italic Is it a reference for the experienced or an introduction for beginners?5 Basics of procedural programming (w/o OOP)5* (2) OOP comprehensibility5/0 Threads / 1.2 thread deprecation5 Exceptions, error handling5 Packages4 AWT 1.0 event model4 (no GBL) Layout managers5 AWT 1.1 event model3 Basic Swing widgets3 Advanced Swing widgets5* 1.1 I/O4 java.math - BigInteger, BigDecimal4 - no UDP Java.net5 Collections5* inner classes5* JDK 1.2 security0 1.1 clipboard handling4 Java Beans4 RTTI, Reflection, Class4 CORBA et al (DCOM etc)4 RMI0 i18n5 JDBC3 Comparing Java to C++4/3/0 Object serialization / versioning / object file format0 JNI5/0 Applets / conversion to applications and vice versa5/3 Describing / Using naming is by far the most comprehensive in this book; introducing subclassing is also very cool (it doesn't use the usual Employee - Manager stuff); visibility is discussed (and depicted) very well. All in all, the comprehensibility of OOP's discussion is outstanding in Just Java 1.2. All the other books are far worse in this respect. If you don't understand a word of the other 4 books' OOP chapters, give a try to Linden's book. Unfortunately, Linden's book is far more superficial than either Core Java or Thinking in Java. It's its being extremely comprehensive that makes it as far as Swing widgets are concerned. The only exception is Core Java. This book doesn't cover many widgets (only the basic ones), but is very thorough. Let's hope vol2 will cover all the missing widgets.There is no clear winner. Core Java, Just Java and Thinking in Java are all great for a beginner. Core Java is more of a reference, so you are not guaranteed to understand OOP from that book - a reason for getting Just Java as well. Just Java, on the other hand, is a bit superficial and terse - a reason for getting the other two books. Also, as can be seen from the table, these books are strong sometimes in entirely different areas. Just Java's strength lies in its comprehensibility, while it's not suited for the experienced. Core Java is much harder for a beginner to understand, but is a great reference. Thinking in Java excels at some areas, while there are certain subjects that the books just suck at. You indeed should get the book, but don't expect to become a Swing programmer after reading it. The same stands for the emphasis on the 1.0 event model - most AWT components are presented using the 1.0 event model. It's indeed a bad move from Eckel. Nobody wants to learn / code the old event model any more.Rather than trying to say which is the one perfect Java book, I recommend that readers look at the strengths and weaknesses of each, and choose from any of the 3 excellent books according to their needs. For example any"},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"I'm a graduate student in CSE, adept in C and familiar with C++. I got collossially lucky by picking this book to learn Java. The explanations were almost always exactly the amount of information I needed. The parts of the syntax that were similar to C++ were easy to skim through and find the differences; the examples were informative. The chapters give you enough knowledge that you have a solid idea how a certain thing works in java (networking, file I/O, swing), so that you can learn details from the API documentation, but not so much that it's hard to read. Excellent starting point."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"After having just completed a junior college course in JAVA with an absolutely horrible textbook, I found this book to be what I had wished our textbook was. This author uses just the right combination of code, text, and graphics and tells the truth about JAVA itself. For example, he comes right out on page 49 and states &quot;Static is a crummy name.&quot; How true! He then offers alternative names that better describe the situation. Most books on JAVA are extremely abstract and abstruse; this book isn't. It's great. The CD alone is worth the purchase price. It is full of intriguing examples and applets. This should be required reading. I simply can't say enough good things about this book."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"This book does not treat any topic in detail.

Not to worry, there's 130 or so more pages of it -- Prentice-Hall is just getting more frugal with their paper.More important than the 130 more pages are the many many more that are corrected, expanded, or rewritten from scratch. A disappointing number of computer texts, especially those concerning fast-changing languages like Java, get only quick licks and promises when new versions come out, but not this one.It's very clear that Mr. Linden loves programming and relishes sharing that joy in his books -- this is an important book in the Java corpus.The CD is -- well, there's a lot of it, and somebody will like each eccentrically selected bit.

It's probably the only entertaining programming book I've ever read.The author does a great job of giving an overview of the Java language, touching upon each individual section of the language in the book's 22 chapters. This book might be too much to handle for the uninitiated; but for intermediate to advanced programmers, this book is great for getting you started with Java programming.

When it came to learning Java I was puzzled with the dozens of Java books filling bookstore shelves. I first picked up Java 1.2 and JavaScript for C and C++ Programmers by Daconta et al. as the title seemed a perfect fit for me. I was disappointed by that book. Then I looked at several other books including Core Java, Java in a Nutshell, Teach Yourself Java in 21 Days, and Thinking in Java. After spending a few months with these books I can confidently tell that although others have their own merits, this book (Just Java) is absolutely the best introduction to the language. For an introduction it has very good coverage and an examplary pedagogical style. Whenever I needed an explanation, it was right there where it was supposed to be. The diagrams, the arrangement of topics, the depth, ... in short the book shows on every page that the author loved what he did and wanted to be proud of it. I just wish I had books like this for other languages that I had to learn: &quot;Just C&quot;, &quot;Just C++&quot;, &quot;Just Perl&quot; ,... If you are a beginner, you don't need to spend any money or time with others. Go for Just Java. You will love it."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"This book does not have any order, take a look at the chapter &quot;FILE I/O&quot;, after reading that chapter the only program you can write and test is only a lame example of how to copy 2 files. After reading other books and references I found that explanation in this book about streams character-based and byte-based is totally confused and mixed, there is no explanation about high level or low level streams and everything is so confused if you have not done anything with Java. Other subject is Exceptions, how come 10 pages of text (with listing examples) is going to explain exceptions, just showing a chart of the class is not enough. I think this book does not help anybody who wants to learn Java or to someone who is doing some programming on java already , because there are better sources that this one."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"My background is VB, and no Object Oriented, and I found it a snap to learn from this book.Whenever it mentions a similarity with another language, the topic is usually so simple that you get it anyway. E.g. &quot;case statements in Java are like C - you switch on the value of an integer and branch to the corresponding case.&quot;Not only is the book clear, it is easy to read, and I found myself looking forward to the software &quot;war stories&quot; at the end of each chapter.Just Java is a great book, but it does assume the most basic knowledge of programming.

The best example they have is displaying a jpeg file extracted from a jar file. When am I ever going use that? Try putting together an useful applet for your web page from reading that chapter -- I know I couldn't. Fragmentation and lack of good examples occur through much of the book.Don't be fooled.

It's that good."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"I have been studying Object Oriented Programming for years and Java for about a year with pretty good understanding but a lot of fuzziness. Peter cuts right through the tangentials and explains the essential concept with precision. Several times on every page.

I'm an avid reader, but this is the first programming book I've looked forward to reading since Nailing Jelly To a Tree. Thanks Peter!"},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"I had some tough deadlines to learn Java quickly. &quot;Just Java&quot; was exactly what I needed = all the key information, none of the fluff or timewasting. All written down in a compact easy to follow format. Good use of illustrations, great examples all the code compiles, and a CD with loads of the latest software.Peter maintains the Java FAQ on Usenet, and often answers novice questions there. I recommend this book fully, and advise you to read it, enjoy it, learn Java from it."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"This book is well-organized, and covers all you need to know to start using Java effectively. You do NOT need to know c++ to use this book, c++ is hardly mentioned. But you do need to know how to program in general. I knew VB before reading this book, and it was fine for me.I liked the easy style, and the number of compilable examples. All the code is on the CD, along with compilers for Windows, linux, Mac, Solaris, etc. Great book!"},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"I loved this book -- it explains Java deftly. I am something of a beginner when it comes to programming. I know a little VB and other Microsoft products. This book really brought me up to speed on Java, and now I am a Java supporter all the way. The explanations are interesting, and the CD has all the sample programs already typed in, several Java compilers, and a lot more besides. One of the best Java books I know of. I recommend it unhesitatingly."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"The code examples are great, some short ones, some longer ones, and some complete programs and applications on the CD. The subjects are well-organized and well explained, using terms that are familiar to people who already know how to program.I think some of the negative reviews are from people who don't know any programming. There are other books for total beginners. This book is well suited to the average professional or comp sci student who wants to learn Java."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"This book may be good for people with prior expereince in any OO language. I had bought it after seeing the review that it is very good for people who start from scratch. Definitely it is not. Also it has many unwanted lines taking digs at other languages and some dry humour. The examples given also are cryptic and will be difficult to be understood by beginners. The only place in which it scores over other books may be that it has gone deep into many aspects of the language that are useful."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"The way he used to explain the topics are confusing..I was very excited to buy this book but found it difficult instead of having C and C++ knowledge."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"I used this text as an introductory course in Java. Although the book is well written and presents the material in easy to understand way, I have an objection to the Author's bias against other programming languages. The author does not mention Java's 'weakness'. Of course that is difficult burden for the author since he is a Sun employee I suppose, but books specially technical books should be written as intellectually honest as possible. It shouldn't be an opportunity for marketing Java. I think Eckle's Thinking in Java is a great book covering both the strong and weak sides of Java in a neutral way.Also another comment, you better know other programming language before you buy this book. Other than that it is a great book and I like the Author's sense of humor. Gives great examples also."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"If you want to learn Java in a hurry, go for this book. But if you have some time at your hands, forget it. I say this because of the following 1- It's a small book on a big language which means brief explanations and very few examples.2- Even with this size, the author has wasted quite a lot of book space to show his sense of humor (which I didn't find very humorous, sorry Peter).3- The book is not very well organized.4- The author claims that you don't need to know C++ to learn Java from this book. I find this claim a bit ambitious. Specially when author himself refers to different aspects of C++ to clarify certain concepts.In short, if you want to read some jokes, learn how to make a paper airplane which can carry payload (I'm not kidding), know authors views about how software are and should be named, read some inside information on Sun Systems, enjoy digs at Microsoft and learn Java, buy the book now. But if you just want to learn Java in an organized and professional manner, read Wrox Press' book &quot;Beginning Java 2&quot; by Ivor Horton. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"Explanations are clear and concise....which is what I needed. Includes sample code to illustrate points made."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"This book was easy to read, which meant I read the whole thing. I learned a lot and recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"O.K. The text covers the Java stuff you need to know. It has a clear structure and is definitely a very good textbook. But if you try to learn Java or try to make the transition from a non object-oriented langauge using this book - you'll miss some examples. Peter v.d. Linden would be better off sharing his programming experience by providing examples for the subjects he covers. Instead of giving a simple &quot;hello world&quot; program in the first chapter, he comes with a full blown, four color, text-scrolling, window based &quot;hello world&quot;. Who the hell is supposed to understand the code when he or she never saw object-oriented code? But don't get me wrong - it is definitely a good textbook!"},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"Great book! Kept my attention. Read it cover-to-cover"},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"good high level overview of java for programmer"},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"Not a very good book to learn Java. I found that the book doesn't organized very well, and you will still get confused if you are a beginner even after you read the book throughly."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"I've struggled with a lot of mumbling-jumbling programming books and wondered why programming book can be so boring and difficult. Only after reading this book, I understand a lot of authors either don't know what they are talking about or don't really make an effort to make their books useful. Mr. Linden knows exactly what he talks about and make it as simple as possible to understand. Einstein used to say that everything should be as simple as possible but not simpler. Mr. Linden has achieved that. If there were an award for writing good programming book, he certainly deserves one. Thank you Mr. Linden for writing such an excellent book."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"Just Java 2 is aimed at programmers who already know one language, like Pascal or Fortran. You don't have to know any Object Programming, as it starts right at the beginning.It has great diagrams and great examples. If you can't learn Java from this book, probably no book is simple enough for you!"},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"Excellent book for beginners and intermediate Java programmers. Very well written, explains right to the point. A must for all developers."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"Excellent book, especially for those who have some knowledge of Java.I found the way the author explains topics very thrilling. He makes topics that had previously seemed very hard, such as RMI, appear very simple. The book is also illustrative and leisurely. The examples are simple and easy to follow."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"I believe Peter Van Linden is one of the best authors out there, and his book titled &quot;Deep C Secrets&quot; is one of my favorite. However, this book doesn't quite live up to the standard set by his previous books. There's a lot to cover in Java 2, so I'll cut him some slack. Some topics are given a topical treatment e.g. the difference between package, protected and private scope was poorly explained. On the other hand, his explanations on threads are one of the best - especially the diagrams. In short, I believe this book is not for the beginning Java programmer - more for someone who is between beginner and intermediate level."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"If you've never read a book by Peter van der Linden then you are truely missing out on one of lifes enjoyable experiences. He does an excellent job covering the Java language and best of all he is a good author. He is very interesting and does a good job of keeping your attention. If you have futher questions he is all over the Java newsgroups answering questions. I do have one suggestion for Peter: Write more books!"},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"This book is very good. I understood it pretty well, and learned a lot. It has some fairly funny parts too.I have two complaints. The section on swing sucks. If you really want to do a lot of GUI programming, you need to buy a book dedicated to swing. It is too brief (which is probably the publisher's fault) and has a few errors in it. For example, there is only one page dedicated to checkboxes, and it gives an example where you have four boxes displayed. The event handler code only shows how to read one of the things. The author says &quot;The ItemEvent contains fields and methods that specify which object generated the event...&quot; but doesn't care to let us in on which? Are you expected to write programs with only one checkbox?I would have liked to see 'assignments' at the end of each chapter to check your ablility, but no, the publisher probably thought that answers would take too much space... that's what the CD is for!"},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"Most Java (and other language) books I've read follow through some boring complex application that gets built throughout the book, which makes it impossible to skip chapters and know what's going on. Or they start off with GUI programming (one of the most confusing parts of Java). Just Java starts with the core of the language using very small, descriptive, yet complete code passages that explain his point and nothing more. Thus it is excellent for intermediate and advanced programmers. Further this book is excellent for focusing on the patterns of java--learning the basic ubiquitous patterns goes incredibly far in learning Java."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"This book is great for people (like me) who can already program, and just want to learn Java. I found it went at the right pace to get me the info I needed on Java. Most examples are small enough to understand easily, with much bigger ones inc. complete games &amp; applications on the CD. Highly recommended if you want to learn Java, and already know C or Fortran or VB etc"},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"This book is far too basic for experienced programmers and probably too advanced for people who are just beginning to program."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"If a developer want to survive in the next millenium, he/she will have to know java. This book will certainly start your path. Simply put The Best book to get started on JAVA."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"I learned Java from this book, in 3 weeks. Really enjoyed it too. I bought three other Java books but have returned them: Just Java was what I needed"},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"Peter van der Linden's book is an excellent resource for the beginning programmer, or those who are new to Java. Not only does he know his stuff, he makes the language easy to learn; he's an excellent writer and teacher. (This author also has a great sense of humor that makes the book both informative and entertaining!)Bottom line: This should be your first choice for a book on Java!"},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"Well worth the money. Having had little programming knowledge I wasn't too sure about this but the book explains concepts very well. I had a simple set-up problem, sent an e-mail to Peter and recieved a response the same day!!!! Excellent format, won't bog you down with too much at once. With so many Java books out there I picked this one because it was from Sun, now I would pick any book that Peter has written!!!!"},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"Van der Linden treats his audience like respected colleagues. Unlike many Java insiders, he doesn't try to persuade us that Java is the perfect tool for every situation. Although his enthusiasm comes through, he concedes a few Java shortcomings and openly criticizes some particularly egregious flaws that others present unapologetically (e.g. Java's Calendar/Date abomination; the choice of &quot;static&quot; for class member).The structure and sequence are suitable either as a textbook for an OOP/Java course or for self study by an experienced programmer.I found it easy to find answers to a number of issues that were either omitted or hard to find in two dozen other well-regarded Java texts on my shelf."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"I have read the book cover-to-cover. Peter is an excellent writer. He presented the details very clearly and kept me entertained. I found few errors which I can't say for many of the other technical books I've read. He has helped me get off on the right foot with Java and OOP programming. Readers will need other books to cover specific areas or APIs of Java in more detail."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"This book is the best Java book out there. Finally there is a book (this one) that will teach you what is Java, the language, the standard classes, Swing, JRE, JFC, OOP, JDBC, RMI, Graphics, Animations, Networking and more, and best of all, you learn. What is unbelievable is the ability of the author to teach you some complex topics with a narrative that is simple to understand from the beginning. This book is complete in every way and entertaining. If you are a Java developer this is the BOOK to have."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"The thing I like about this book is it is written in a very concise way and yet it starts from the beginner's level and moves to the advance level with clear and easy explainations that only a master in the language can do. I have learned many things from this book that had been omitted or not well explained in some otherwise very good books. This is the book to get after a Java primer book."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"This book is great whether you are just starting out in Java, or have been at it for awhile. It totally cuts through the technical jargon and tells you what need to know. Vander Linden is a good teacher and makes good decisions on which topics to present and which to mention briefly or not at all.Reading this book helped me correct a few bad habits I'd gotten into in my programming and taught me some very useful new tricks.The explanation of the various forms of Streams and Readers was especially helpful."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"This is a wonderful Java text. My favorite part, as with all PVDL books, is the humor. Each chapter ends with a &quot;Ligh Relief&quot; section, where you can learn the programmer's battlesong &quot;Hatless Atlas&quot;, a list of messy kernel messages, or my favorite, a program that compiles both under C, C++ and Java!Humor aside, the book does a wonderful job explaining Java concepts, and the CD that accompanies the book is loaded with goodies."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"I thought I'd be able to learn Java from this book, but after a few chapters I was totally frustrated by the way the author attempts to teach you Java in terms of C or C++, neither of which I know, neither of which are necessary to learn Java.I found the book condescending to non C and C++ programmers, and the order of subjects he chooses to teach Java is wierd.If you want to learn Java and don't know C or C++, do not look here, go to Dietel and Deitel's &quot;Java: How to Program&quot; instead."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"The title of this book should have been, &quot;Java for C/C++ Programmers&quot;. It is mostly a comparison of C/C++ programming to Java, heavy on the C part. But that is not the only problem. The author's writing style is more aimed at puffing up his own image than simple exposition of the subject. On page 91 he states, &quot;In 1993, I coined the term 'Bubbabyte' to describe 2^64 bytes. Just as 2^10 bytes is a kilobyte, [...] so 2^64 is a Bubbabyte.&quot; He should have coined the term 'BubbaBrain' to describe himself. A much better book is &quot;Core Java, Vol 1&quot;, by Cay S. Horstmann, Gary Cornell."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"I've read several Java books (&quot;Java 2 Unleashed,&quot; &quot;Java 2 Certification Guide,&quot; &quot;Thinking in Java,&quot; and the famous &quot;Java Tutorial&quot; from Sun) -- without a doubt this book is the best overview of the language for programmers trying to learn Java. (Eckel's &quot;Thinking in Java&quot; is better in that it is more balanced, though). Don't buy this book if you are just learning progamming - it isn't &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; basic (which is nice). This book would be better if the author wasn't such a cheerleader all the time. C isn't evil. (C++ is though ;-)Overall, this is the best Java book I have read so far (..from a technical standpoint, i.e., &quot;learning the language&quot; -- but not nec. from a philosophical standpoint.)"},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"I think this a great java book. It has been very usefull to me as a reference as I work more and more in java. It is probably best suited to those with some programming experience, and might not be the best to learn java from scratch from. It does cover basic object theory pretty well. As you get more into java and need to know more about the classes available this book becomes a priceless resource. Also parts of it are a fun read."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"I've found this book totally different from any other tutorial stuff. In spite of my past programmers expirience in database I've started studying OOP from scratch more than one year ago. I had several books of Java-programming (Deitel&amp;Deitel, Mike Morgan, Peter Norton etc.). I've got prefer this one. Author give to readers the pretty excelent refferences. I would say that this book ought to read whether you beginers in OOP or not. This book will compel you work. It is inexhaustible source for Java programming."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"As an experienced C/C++ programmer, I wanted a book that could fairly quickly get me up speed in Java. I'd say that this book met that challenge. Though it's 700+ pages may seem a bit daunting at first, it was an easy read for myself.To finish my first Java project, I had to rely on on-line help and a few other books, so don't expect this to be the only Java book you read. But as a start for an experienced programmer it's quite adequate."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"This book taught me Java and the Java libraries in a short time. I had tried 3 different books that let me down, before people at work directed me to Just Java 2 I wish I had found it to begin with. Excellent. Warmly recommended."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"Excellent book on JAVA. It is a must for programmers want to learn JAVA. It will help if author put some comparisons between JAVA and C++. I assume that most people who learn JAVA know C++. Btw, I list some errors that I saw in the book. I hope that Peter won't mind since I don't know how to contact you directly.1) page 471, the statementmyCodeToHandleWinClose m = new myCodeToHandleWinClose();is redundant, since an anon. class is used.2) similar error appears on page 472 and 474, where a Top-Level Class is utilized."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"Liked this book a whole lot. Many examples. Clear explanations. Saved me a lot of time. Everything in one volume. Hate 2000 pages of multi-volume works. Who has the time? &quot;Just Java 2&quot; Recommended."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"I got so disappointed in other programming books that are hundreds and hundreds of pages of dry, boring text. Hard to write, harder to read, and impossible to follow. What a relief that someone has found an interesting and fun way to write about the Java language.I enjoyed reading &quot;Just Java 2&quot;. It is well organized, and I learned Java so easily from it."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"This book has some excellent reviews. As a student that has studied a few other languages, including OOP languages, I felt that this was the least helpful of all starting books that I've picked up. The code examples do not give you any inkling of how a real Java program may be used. The features of the Java language are introduced without explaining why they are needed and how they are actually used in real programs. I would not recommend this book to anyone who would like a clear example of the Java language."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"The reviews here are deceiving. Trust me. Unless you have already read another book on Java, you will have a hard time understanding it. The examples are fragmented and never complete. The author assumes that you know Java already and did not even bother to provide examples for many of the concepts. This may be a good book for intermediate level JAVA programmers, but it is definitely not for beginners. If I didn't know C++ at all, I would have thrown this book into the trash can the first day I read it. This ranks up there as one of the worst programming books I've ever read, a total waste of my hard-earned money. Thanks to the deceiving reviews, I now need to spend more money to get a real beginner JAVA book."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"I wish to say that Just Java 1.2 it is a very good book on Java.I am not a specilist on this subject and have leraned a lot with it. I have already read a lot of books on Java and I consider this the best one.I am also thanks to the author, who was very attencious with me."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"The author continually tells you how Java is going to take over the world and appears to be good for everything. I half expective a chapter to be titled &quot;How Java cures the common cold&quot;. Also, it is difficult to keep track of what code examples are on the CD from the various chapters.Other than that, the information is very well written and could be used in a college classroom. The author definitely knows what he is talking about."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"It's now 2010 and the book was published more than 10 years.I wanted an intro to Java so I picked this up as it was really cheap.I am a C/C++ and .Net developer so I new the material. I wanted to see the differencebetween Java and the other platforms.The book was excellent. I read it all in about 3 days, with the exception of thesections covering graphics, which I omitted.This book covers the basics well. The book had an easy to read tone to it, and a bit humorous.(Side note: The short historical stories at the end of each chapter were cool)I intend to supplement my reading with further books covering technologies introducedsince (primarily JPA/Hibernate) and J2EE/Java EE technologies."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"not suited for beginner's should have qiute lucid explationsi dont recommend for new commers to java"},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"This book was required for an online Java course I took quite a few years ago. I continue use this book as a reference quite a bit. I also have &quot;Thinking in Java&quot;, and I find this book a slightly better reference because it seems &quot;more dense&quot;; fewer pages can be read to start laying down some code! Occasionally I'll run into some of Van Der Linden's jokes, which I find quite funny, and a nice change of pace in this kind of material. Along with the humor, the author doesn't mind &quot;telling it like it is&quot; with respect to the Microsoft's sometimes illustrious actions."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"I studied no less than four other tutorials, ranging from &quot;okay&quot; (Thinking in Java, Bruce Eckel) to downright bad (Learning Java, O'Reilly). For a while, I was convinced that Java was a sickening, convoluted language with about 850 weird little &quot;rules&quot; that seemed to change for every possible situation. I was never going to get it.Then I gave this book a try, and soon realized that it was not the language that confounded me, but the other authors' explanations of it. Peter van der Linden does an outstanding job of explaining the language with a style that makes his text very easy to read and understand. Things began to click almost immediately, and at more than one point in my discovery of the brilliant design and engineering of the Java platform I caught myself laughing out loud and thinking, &quot;That's *so* cool!&quot; at some particular feature that had just been described in the text.Since reading it, I've written a few useful applications in Java, including a network monitoring tool, and a Java servlet that helps Netcool monitor some of my web servers at work (with the help of &quot;Java Servlet Programming&quot;, from O'Reilly).If you've been struggling with learning Java, I strongly recommend giving this book a try. The language really is incredibly well thought out by Sun, you probably just need the right guide to show you around. Hopefully you'll find, as I did, that Peter van der Linden is that guide."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"Coming from C/C++ and Perl, I understood the book fine. And as long as the author sticks to the technical aspects of Java, he does alright, I guess. But he makes many inaccurate statements about C and Perl, in my opinion, while making Java out to be the greatest thing since sliced bread. I'm keeping the book, at least for now, as a reference, but I'm learning Java from better books, viz, Eckel's Thinking in Java, and publisher Addison Wesley's The Java Tutorial."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"I loved &quot;Just Java 2&quot;, and found it a great tutorial on all the key aspects of Java. Unlike what one other reviewer wrote, there is no assumption of C++ (It amazes me that people who read a book so superficially feel free to share their wrong assumptions about it). Just Java 2 is well written and easy to follow. The examples are interesting, and the source, the Java FAQ, and a wealth of other info and compilers is on the accompanying CD. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"The book is very poorly written. It doesn't have enough solid complete examples to cover a topic. The author tries to rush through and cut corners at every place. The author doesn't realize that theory is best when it is coupled with complete examples. Even the CD is poorly organized and doesn't flow with the book. I'd give this a -1 star if I could.I think the book &quot;core java 2&quot; is much better."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"The great irony about this book is how much the author bashes C++ for being a poorly written language compared to Java. However, in order to keep up with this book you have to have had some exposure to C++. I've been programming in C++ for about a year and I found this book to be well paced. It only touches only simple syntax and instead goes right into the specifics of the language. Also makes a great reference and is currently open on my desk. If you're a beginner stay away, but if you have OO experience this book is well worth it. At only 700 pages you will be up to speed with Java in less than a week."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"This is probably the best computer book I have ever read.

The author doesn't just tell you what to do, but explains why things are the way they are, and is honest about some of the warts on Java!

This book is it. Aside from the JDK help, this is my only reference and for the most part it has served me well.I started from a C++ background and had no trouble learning from this book. It might be tempting to skim through some of the beginning chapters that seem like something any C++ programmer would know (e.g. Object-Oriented Programming), but I recommend reading them. There are a lot of really good Java tips you don't want to miss, such as how constructors are invoked and how static blocks are loaded in the JVM.Probably the biggest benefit of this book is that it tells you both the how and the why in many cases. Another positive is that the examples are small and to the point. In general there was a good amount of information per page.The book's biggest weakness is the chapter on File I/O. This is common functionality that many Java programmers will use, but the presentation is not as easy to follow as the other chapters. Another drawback is the networking chapter, but there seem to be entire books dedicated to this subject.If you are learning Java from an object oriented background, you will be glad you got this book. It's one of the thinner books on the shelf, believe it or not, but the information is top notch."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"This book succeeded in getting me started with Java. I'm not a great programmer, so that's saying something.Other reviewers have complained about the difficulty of picking up OOP concepts from this book. I can understand their point of view, but in van der Linden's defense I think it should be pointed out that OOP is fairly hard to get ahold of the first time you're exposed to it, and I'm not sure other books are much easier.I studied math in college, and I found that I didn't learn things from the teacher as much as I did by wrestling with the problems on my own. If you want to understand why the main method in your class has to instantiate an object of the class that contains the aforementioned main method in order to access an object member that isn't static, you're going to have to work through it on your own. It's the sort of understanding that a teacher can't really hand you on a silver platter. It's not really hard, but you do have to know what all the words mean. The experience of wrestling with these kinds of concepts is what makes them sink in.So I would argue that this book is complete, in the sense that it takes you through the OOP concepts you need to learn. But fundamentally you have to confront those concepts by yourself, alone in front of your own computer with your own copy of the JDK. If you try to run through the book without confronting the issues that fly over your head in the early chapters, the rest of the book will be incomprehensible. It's analogous to what happens to you in French class if you don't learn the early grammar and vocabulary.I enjoyed the style of the book. Linden makes you feel like there's a human being on the other side of word processor, with a personality, a sense of humor, and his own style and sensibility. I wish more computer books were like that, so many of them are impersonal and devoid of human content. Spending time with this book is a little more like spending time with a person, which is a good thing in my opinion.Part of Linden's personality is a fairly ideological approach to the computer industry. He's down on Microsoft and an evangelist for Java. I'm not sure that's a bad thing, but the anti-Microsoft stuff might rub some people the wrong way.I think it's a great book overall."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"I bought this book after reading the reviews. The impression I had was that this would be an excellent introduction to Java. What I discovered is that this book ASSUMES KNOWLEDGE OF C++. If you dont have some background in C++, then skip this and go for something else!"},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"Firstly,Amazon's own review about this book - &quot;If you want to learn Java FROM ZERO...&quot; is entirely misleading. The author has written this book as if he is talking to his collegues(who obviously know Java) over the coffee table. If you want to learn Java from Zero , are new to programming concepts,OOPS etc. just stay as far as possible from this book and PLEASE dont go by the 4 and 5 stars this books has.THIS BOOK IS NOT FOR BEGINNERS and I STRONGLY REQUEST AMAZON to remove their recommentdation about this book for beginners.I have returned this book and am pretty comfortable with the following two books Thinking in Java and Beginning Java2.0 Please trust me and dont waste your time and energy and money on any other books to learn Java."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"If you want to learn Java in a hurry, go for this book. But if you have some time at your hands, forget it. I say this because of the following1- It's a small book on a big language which means brief explanations and very few examples.2- Even with this size, the author has wasted quite a lot of book space to show his sense of humor (which I didn't find very humorous, sorry Peter).3- The book is not very well organized.4- The author claims that you don't need to know C++ to learn Java from this book. I find this claim a bit ambitious. Specially when author himself refers to different aspects of C++ to clarify certain concepts.In short, if you want to read some jokes, learn how to make a paper airplane which can carry payload (I'm not kidding), know authors views about how software are and should be named, read some inside information on Sun Systems, enjoy digs at Microsoft and learn Java, buy the book now. But if you just want to learn Java in an organized and professional manner, read Wrox Press' book &quot;Beginning Java 2&quot; by Ivor Horton. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"This is a great intro to Java. Contrary to what another person said, this book contains no C++, and does not use C++ as a &quot;stepping stone&quot; to Java at all.Likes: well organized, with related material grouped together, and clear summaries after major explanations. Also liked the HUGE amount of code and further material on the CD; also liked very clear explanations of difficult topics like inner classes.Dislikes: would like it better if it had a complete API listing printed as an appendix, even though that is also on CD. Also would like more info on the obsolete features like JDK 1 event handling."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"The book was as good as the other reviews said. The explanation on the topics was detailed and didn't have the patchy treatment I have seen in other books (e.g. &quot;21 Days&quot; or &quot;For Dummies&quot;). It's probably a better book if you already know one other prog language. I recommend it for everyone except complete non-programmers."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"If you're a programmer already, Peter van der Linden's book is an excellent introduction to Java 2. Never mind Jack Woehr (Dr. Dobbs') supercilious, snotty and smug review - I found this book to be not only an informative and well-written view of Java from an altitude of a few hundred feet, but also relaxed and amusing. Guess I'm a lowbrow. I give the book four of five stars only because the author chose not to deal with explaining topics such as JavaBeans and CORBA, which IMHO shouldn't be considered optional knowledge. He does mention that these topics deserve books in their own right, but so do many of the other topics he covers.This book is not meant for people who have never programmed before, nor is it comprehensive enough to be a cert exam text, but it is great for someone who is already a programmer and wants the broad view of Java to use at work. If you're the serious-minded type (and especially if you're self-consciously so, like the Dobbs' reviewer), you'll probably want to pick something from the broad array of other Java books that explain, in oh-so-detached passive voice, technical topics with dry EMP - EMPLOYER sample programs. If you want to learn Java, and aren't too sophisiticated or busy to have a few chuckles along the way, this book's a great place to start."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"This book is written by a programmer for a programmer. It could have been more like &quot;Java programming for C++ programmers&quot;. I find that some of the concepts are more readily understood by Smalltak or C++ programmers. The author illustrates the various access modifiers(.e. pacakage, protected,etc) as well as inheritance really well.The one thing I like about this book is that the authot uses good diagrams/picture to illustrate his point really well.It is a very readable book. I find it better than the &quot;Java in the Nutshell&quot; book. It's a balance between readability and jamming dry material..I strongly recommend it for the busy programmer!"},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"This book is a good introduction for programmers with a C or C++ background (regardless if you know OOP or not). I would not recommend it for people that have backgrounds in other programming languages, unless they like a challenge. I recommended this book to a friend, who programs in VB, and he could not finish the book (although he mentioned to me that he enjoyed the section on OOP). I have a C background and enjoyed the book thoroughly, and still use it as a quick reference. If you are an advanced Java programmer, don't bother with this book, get something more advanced."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"A neat and well organized book, which provides information in single stroke. One should not miss any part of this book. Examples are self sufficient and avoid useless description. Not for beginners.

I particularly like the sections at the end of each chapter which provide for some mild amusement.This will mostly appeal to those people who are newish to Java and/or OO, but there are also many useful nuggets of information for even the most experienced Java professional.Some of the more complicated parts of Java are explained in a very clear and elegant way.This is a genuine Java 1.2 (or 2) book as opposed to those Java books, which have had an extra chapter, added to their 1.1 editions.Go buy!"},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"provides sufficient details, not too much not too little"},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"Very good book. Its fun, and also covers the material very well. Also gives greate examples to get you going right away. I highly recommend it.I read the 1997 version of the book, and am here buy the newer version."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"This book is an absolute waste of money. I have more than three years of programming experience in procedural languages like COBOL. I am familiar with C. I am familiar with basic OO concepts. I thought I was an intelligent and competent programmer. This book did its best to destroy my confidence.To be frank: this is the worst programming book I have ever come across. It gives you half baked ideas, and keeps them that way. Before a concept is fully grasped, the author goes on to say something else in an equally vague manner. If you can find even one single concept clearly explained in this book, you are lucky.Bottomline: This book is great for you if your ambition is to drop a few heavy-sounding technical terms in a gathering of programmers who are not so comfortable with Java. If your ambition is to learn and master a new language from scratch, look elsewhere.P.S. The sale of this book is a classic example of what media hype can do."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"This book is great for those with previous OO experience (or at least a strong knowledge of C programming), but for those who are new to programming, I would recommend trying The Java Tutorial by Campione, et al. Just Java does a good job explaining fundamental concepts accurately, but it might be a bit out there for newbies.I do think that it is a little weak on the topic of Threads - I'd recommend the O'Reilly Threads book instead.Also check out The Elements of Java Style by Vermeulen, et al. Just Java doesn't touch information in that book."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"I am currently teaching a Java class at work and this book has proven to be a great reference book for questions from my class."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"I found this book the best intro to Object Oriented Programming (OOP) on the market, and I have been through quite a few!

Does a great job of teachning Java as well as good OOP habits, too."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"Just Java 2 is very readable, but it does not do a very good job of teaching Java or OOP. I'd read a chapter and feel like I had a fairly complete understanding. But when I tried to apply what I learned, I always struggled.

I spend lots of time reviewing FAQ sites for descent examples.I would not recommend this book.FYI - I am new to OOP, but relatively experienced with C, ADA, Fortran, ..."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"A really good book. I picked up Java easily and naturally. This wonderful book helped me through all the &quot;rough spots&quot; of learning a new programming langauge. Crystal clear. Good examples."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"If you don't know JAVA or even don't know anything about programming, this is the book for you! After reading this 800 pages thick book you're rather an expert in JAVA programming. The book covers all the basic subjects in the first chapters, and the other nice things of JAVA in the later chapters, including Advanced Thread Topics, Networking in JAVA, RMI, the large amount of graphical possibilities and all the others great features. At the end of each chapter, their is a section called 'Some Light Relief', in which the author tells a nice anecdote. Peter van der Linden's humor makes this book easy to read and that's a nice aspect of this book. The HUGE amount of fantastic pictures and clear examples makes this book a real MUST for everyone, who wants to know more about this great language. So this is my advice: BUY it and LIKE it!"},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"You could literally buy 1,000 other Java books and still not approach the magnitude of &quot;Just Java 2&quot;. It deserves 1,000 stars, not 5. I've gone from knowing nothing about Java, to generating QuickTime movies on the pixels and sound byte level, in just 4.5 months. The book starts you off, and the CD sends you flying. Whatever Java angle you're pursuing, Peter van der Linden will get you there. Whenever you fall, there will be something in Peter's book or CD that will pick you up and get you going again."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"The back cover mentions it is a book for people with &quot;programming backgrounds&quot;. I thought that meant any programming language, and I figured expertise in Turbo Pascal would count, but what it should say is &quot;C/C++ expertise&quot;. If you know diddly about OOP, it doesn't help very much. It as easy to read statements like &quot;you invoke the method call implicitly by instantiating the object with a reference.&quot; Mr. Van der Linden is evidently a great programmer, but not a very good teacher. If you know zilch about OOP, C, or C++, pass this one up."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"You don't need to have programming experience in order to learn Java using this book. The author explains OOP concepts in plain English and there are good illustrations. Small code snippets are used to demonstrate where needed. All in all, a very well-organized and easy to read book. This is a good learning and reference book on Java but not to work through as there are no review questions or exercises."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"I like how the author has written this book. It's actually not boring to read. Book doesn't bother with basics, so if you are completely new to Java don't buy it. However if you have any previous programming or java experience this book should do just fine. The only complaint I have is that this book is not thorough enough. More examples as well as more information about some crucial classes like Class would be great. If you need a really thorough Java book, get Core Java 2: Fundamentals. It's not nearly as exciting as this one, but at least after reading a few times, you will get a thorough understanding of most crucial java concepts."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"If you already know C and at least one OO language, and you need to get up to speed fast in Java, then get this book.The explanations are clear, as are the code examples, and have just about the right level of detail to get a fast introduction to Java. And this in only 700 pages. Other introductory books top well beyond that.Plus you get a small bonus once you finish each chapter in form of small stories, demystifications etc... which are very enjoyable.An earlier review complained that some of the OO concepts are not well explained, but I don't think it is the purpose of this book. If you are new to OO, get another book which will teach you the basics."},{"Title":"Just Java 2","review":"Just Java 2 follows a natural progression: first half of the book covers the Java language, with short examples. Second half of the book covers Java libraries with longer examples and many complete programs. Each topic leads smoothly to the next. Good book! Well organized."},{"Title":"Tiger Lil","review":"If you haven't read this book you should. Tiger Lil had me in stitches. Tiger Lil herself is such a self confidant woman, despite her seven(or was it eight?) previous marrages. She has a name for her nipples which she calls her kitties, each with a different name. Archie( don't you just love that name?!) is a first class con man and is determined to find the family jewels. Only he isn't fooling anyone, least of all Tiger Lil. There are some down right hilarious scenes when Archie gets stuck in a hidden room or finds himself hanging from the chandallear just as Tiger Lil walks in. Oh and by the way, Archie has a special name for his man part too. I almost died of suffocation I laughed so hard. This is not a book for the prudish, there are some pretty &quot;HOT&quot; scenes.

The actual advice is a little dated and not particularly unique from what you might find in other guides."},{"Title":"This Little Fish (Mini-Movers Books)","review":"This Little Fishy follows along the same lines as the Tap Tap Who's There? series. On each page, the book asks a question, then you slide a thick, durable cardboard tab to see the answer. This Little Fishy deals with opposites and things you'd find in oceans, so it begins with This fishy is happy, this fishy is...pull down tab...sad. The other characters are boats, seals, ducks and octopi.It's a very cute book that's well made (much better then most sliding tab books). My 10 month old loves the whole series. I highly recommend them."},{"Title":"This Little Fish (Mini-Movers Books)","review":"My 1 year old daughter LOVES this book. She carries it everywhere and tries to take it to bed with her.

Its a Pop-up kind of thing (the moving parts of pop-ups, not the actual 3D stuff) all made of thick card board so its pretty indestructable. That is, except for the cover. I'm not sure what they were thinking. Its a single piece of cardboard, flimsier than cereal box cardboard. I'm not sure why they did that, especially since the reverse of the cover is the first page of the book. The rest of the pages (and back cover) are all thicker than even the sturdiest boardbook. I still give it a solid rating though - sometimes you just have to wonder what people are thinking."},{"Title":"This Little Fish (Mini-Movers Books)","review":"I got This Little Doggy with my firstborn.

It's main purpose is to train the student to write on par with Joseph Addison. It requires The Spectator by Joseph Addison. I found The Spectator in two volumes on Alibris, excellent condition, J. B. Lippincott Company 1890. You're to read a piece by Joseph Addison three times and then you attempt to write what you have just read. Thus it's important to find a copy of the The Spectator that doesn't have any editing by Joe Blow.You're expected to know Latin and it is assumed that you do so. There are interpretations of the Latin at the end of each chapter but it is disruptive.It's excellent. I highly recommend it. I also recommend the simplified Christian dialect that is the present fad and learning material from Memoria Press to start the Latin."},{"Title":"Willie Nelson Sings America","review":"This is a long-overdue major work on Willie's recording career - meticulously researched and beautifully presented. It gives fascinating insights into the background of many of the recordings - obtained from studio session notes and from the recollections of Willie himself, his management team and fellow artistes. Thanks a million Steve Opdyke (et al)."},{"Title":"Journey to Hell","review":"This is actually a retitled and edited version of John Bunyan's, &quot;The Life and Death of Mr. Badman,&quot; which is otherwise rather hard to locate these days. Its lesser popularity is most likely due to the subject matter, which focuses upon sin, and the fact that it doesn't have the &quot;happy ending&quot; most people seem to require. However, it is a terrific work, definitely the equal of Pilgrim's Progress or Grace Abounding. Bunyan, as usual, finds new meaning in many verses of scripture that one might otherwise overlook. If you like John Bunyan's work and don't have this, get it. It's a keeper."},{"Title":"Journey to Hell","review":"Mr. Badman is just plain BAD. Little sins in little children get magnified into bigger and worse sins. Mr. Badman truly has every bad trait anyone could ever have. He started with lying and stealing, graduated into drinking, cheating and adultery, and then becomes a first-class hypocrite to snag himself a wealthy Christian woman for marriage. While he was sick, he cried out in false repentance only to regress as soon as he was getting well. The saddest and most touching part of the book is the death of his Christian wife and her exhortations to him and their unsaved children. From then on, it's all downhill, as Mr. Badman's seared conscience admits no light, and God gives him up to his destruction. This book has everything NOT to do if you don't want to end up like Mr. Badman. It is also very relevant with the issues of today, drunk \\"driving\\", planned \\"parenthood\\", and bankruptcy and fraud. Hot summertime reading."},{"Title":"Journey to Hell","review":"While this book tends to deal with the individual that is completely sold out for sin, there are things that every Christian will be able to identify with. John Bunyan deals with the fact that sin is sin, no matter what lable any given society has given it.While I thank the Almighty Sovereign God for showing me my need for a savior, and for granting me the priviledge of repenting when I did, I must admit that my heart was very sorrowful and heavy as I read this book. By reading of Badman's extreme antics and his propensity for developing new methods of sin, I must admit that I saw things in my regenerated being that relate to Mr. Badman in one way or another. This is NOT a good thing to identify with, however, I feel that it is a tool that God is using in order to show me my continued need for help from above.While this book is ficticious in it's characters, the truths that come blazing forth from the scenarios are deep and penetrating. This is a book that should be read often. This is a book that forces the reader to bare his soul before the Creator. Thank God for men like Bunyan.Do yourself a favor, O comfortable Christian......Read this book and pray that God will allow you to be honest with your assessment of your current condition.Steven D.

John Bunyan (1628 1688) was born England, preached in Lower Samsell and spent time in prison for his faith. His marvelous pen produced:- The Holy City- Pilgrims' Progress- Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners- The Holy War- Visions of Heaven and Hell- And this outstanding volume.Herein Bunyan presents a fascinating allegory as the main character, Mr. Badman, is a wicked miscreant hell-bent of living for sin. He's depraved and immersed in the lusts of the flesh, wickedness, depravity, and carnality. His profligacy is compared with the moral law and the fruit of the Spirit as the right way to live is made clear while trusting in Christ alone for eternal salvation. It's uplifting and edifying to ponder the life of Mr. Wiseman who lives for God and strives to please the Lord.Chapters in this stirring volume include:- A bad boy- Tricks of the wicked businessman- The sin of pride- A Christian's death- A quiet, hardened death- The Final judgment- And Excellent Extras: The sayings of John Bunyan and the Life of John Bunyan.Bunyan says: \\"If you have sinned, do not lie down without repentance; for the want of repentance after one has sinned makes the heart yet harder and harder.\\"This powerful work will help you discover How to:- find true joy in difficult conditions- avoid the dire results of sin and profligacy- instruct your children in the ways of God and how they can avoid evil- be secure in Christ and find pardon from God s judgment- And moreThis was originally published as \\"The Life and Death of Mr. Badman\\" (271 pages).There Are Moral Absolutes: How to Be Absolutely Sure That Christianity Alone Supplies"},{"Title":"Journey to Hell","review":"And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.NO JOKE!

Tozer, an influential pastor in Chicago. The format of the book makes it easy to carry in a purse or pocket. Each page has a title, a quote from Tozer, and a related Bible verse. It would make a great gift for a young person, a person seeking spiritual guidance, a seeker, or someone wanting to know more about Christianity. The layout is decorative and attractive. It would be a good gift for someone in a hospital or nursing home or who needs encouragement. Each page has a digestible devotional theme. I like such books for times when I need a quick word of wisdom during a rushed day, or to keep by my bedside for a last devotional thought each day.Here is one sample page: &quot;Trust and Obey. Salvation apart from obedience is unknown in the sacred Scriptures.(Tozer) Those who obey his commands live in him, and he in them. 1 John 3:24.&quot;In Touch Ministries has a profile on Tozer from which I quote: &quot;Although A. W. Tozer died in 1963, his life and spiritual legacy continue to draw many into a deeper knowledge of God. Tozer walked a path in his spiritual life that few attempt, characterized by a relentless and loving pursuit of God. He longed to know more about the Savior-how to serve and worship Him with every part of his being.Throughout his life and ministry, Tozer called believers to return to an authentic, biblical position that characterized the early church-a position of deep faith and holiness. &quot;He belonged to the whole church,&quot; says James Snyder in the book, In Pursuit of God: The Life Of A. W. Tozer. &quot;He embraced true Christianity wherever he found it.&quot;During his lifetime, Tozer pastored several Christian and Missionary Alliance churches, authored more than forty books, and served as editor of Alliance Life, the monthly denominational publication for the C&amp;MA. At least two of Tozer's books are considered spiritual classics, The Pursuit of God and The Knowledge of the Holy-a tremendous accomplishment for a man who never received a formal theological education. The presence of God was his classroom. His notebooks and tools consisted of prayer and the writings of early Christians and theologians-the Puritans and great men of faith.&quot;As a pastor, I've found that many people will not read a lengthy book of theology, but perhaps with such an introduction to this man, they may pick up another of Tozer's books."},{"Title":"Tozer's Little Instruction Book (Christian Classics Series)","review":"This is not a book so much as a bunch of quotes made by Tozer, put together in a way to look pretty and make the publisher some $$ off people like me who love Tozer's works.

That just wasn't enough Holmes for me, though; so I picked up Doyle's only Sherlock Holmes novel to read. I had somehow missed it, though I've read so many of the original tales. I expected this to be good and it was.In &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles,&quot; Holmes and Watson are confronted with an interesting case. On the moors of Wales, the Baskerville family has long told of a legendary hound who's purpose is to plague the family. It has always been considered only a legend, but then Charles Baskerville is killed, and it could be by that hound. It seems someone wants to be rid of the Baskervilles, and the heir of Charles Baskerville is in danger on the moors. Watson and Holmes, of course set out to solve the mystery.The novel is a success. It is short with easily flowing prose. The case is classic Holmes; it's always intriguing. The atmosphere of the moor Doyle creates is compelling. The novel remains fairly intense until the climactic end. There's not much bad to say about it, except maybe a little more Holmes and a little less Watson would have been nicer. But overall, this is a fun and worthy read."},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"The book is what I would call an intriguing tease.

The plot was somewhat complex but understandable. A visiting doctor tells Sherlock Holmes, along with an assistant and friend, Dr. Watson, the legend of the Baskervilles. The legend is that each time a member of the Baskerville family walks upon the moor alone, a ghostly hound murders the Baskerville. The moor is a swampy, deserted wasteland located right outside of the Baskerville House. There is only one Baskerville left and Holmes and Watson plans to watch over him and solve the legend of the Baskervilles. Watson stays with Sir Henry Baskerville while Holmes is supposed to stay back in London. He actually stays in an old, abandoned hut behind the Baskerville property. The case is later solved. This story will be very interesting if the reader likes mysteries. Anyone who has curiosity in them will really enjoy this story. The story is made really interesting because it's realistic; therefore, the characters are made believable. Although at some times you would think something paranormal is going on. For example, a hound that is a ghost only appears at night when a Baskerville comes upon the moor alone. In order to want to read this story, you have to be a patient or experienced reader. The plot holds you waiting for something to happen for some parts in the story; however, when you get to the good parts of the story, you would rather read this story than watch your teachers in a food fight!"},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"This book is very mysterious and thrilling. You never want to put this book down. I will be sure to recommend it to others."},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"Reviewing a Sherlock Holmes story is like reviewing a Big Mac -- there's little point in recommending it one way or the other because you're already familiar with its ilk and you find it either delightful or a noxious, cholesterol-laden, artery-clogging, quasi-edible hockey puck. A little Sherlock Holmes goes a long way, but \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles,\\" Doyle's only full-length (although short) novel featuring the sleuth, flows at a nice pace that proportions it well with the shorter stories.The case involves the legend of a monstrous hound that haunts the moor around Baskerville Hall, the ancestral manor of the nearly defunct Baskerville line. Sir Henry Baskerville has just returned to England from Canada to inherit the estate left by his uncle Sir Charles who recently died under mysterious circumstances that appear to be related to the hound. In London, Sir Henry has received an anonymous note warning him to stay away from the moor, someone has been shadowing him, and, even more portentously, two boots have been stolen from his hotel room -- not a pair, but one boot from each of two pairs.Immediately hired to solve the puzzle, Holmes dispatches his loyal colleague, Dr. Watson, to Baskerville Hall to collect clues. Watson meets several interesting residents in the vicinity, such as Stapleton, a wispy entomologist living in a house with his sister whose beauty attracts Sir Henry's amorous attentions, and Frankland, an ebulliently litigious old man with a telescope and a troubled daughter. Among the servants of Baskerville Hall, the most prominent is Barrymore the butler who, for the sake of his wife, is harboring an incriminating secret about someone or something lurking on the moor.Doyle is quite effective at evoking the bleakness of the moor, the slipping and drowning hazards of its slopes and bogs, and the chilling reverberations of the ghostly nocturnal canine howl across the open spaces. The dark aura of the setting is magnified by the folkloric evil of Hugo Baskerville, the ancestor whose sins are purported to have brought the curse of the hound upon his descendants. Holmes, of course, is no believer in superstitions; he puts his faith in physical logic and meticulously analyzes every detail observable to nobody but himself until an answer suggests itself. Watson, as the emotional, compassionate half of the duo, complements the stoic Holmes; his main function is not to be a detective but to tell the story, which is fine because Holmes himself would probably be an insufferably mechanical narrator."},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"Written after Conan-Doyle's \`Final Problem' short story about Holmes' \`death' this book takes place before his confrontation with Moriarty at the Reichenbach Falls. Doctor Mortimer from Dartmoor comes to visit Holmes with the story of a beastly hound which has killed Charles Baskerville and will more than likely come after his heir Sir Henry.Holmes promptly sends Watson off to Dartmoor to guard Sir Henry and report back with all developments. This is the point where Holmes disappears for almost half of the book. But he returns near the end to explain the mystery to all involved.While it is better than Conan-Doyle's short stories in terms of a stronger narrative and a larger mystery \`Hound of the Baskervilles' still suffers from long, ludicrous and unrealistic monologues and superficial contrivances. As always the story is told from the point of view of Watson. But it simply isn't a unique enough point of view to make the first person narrative worth it. I can honestly say that if the story was told in the 3rd person perspective it would make hardly any difference.I cannot for the life of me work out how this book is sometimes regarded as a horror. Nothing in it scared me at all. The hound doesn't even show up until the end. And even then Conan-Doyle's description doesn't paint a very vivid picture in your head.There just isn't enough intrigue or reason to keep turning the pages. The human and reality-based side of the story comes thru too strongly to allow any sort of fantastical creativity. As a classic it's a disappointment but compared to the short stories it's definitely better than the norm."},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"I had read this book as a teeneager - It was one of my favorite then and still is today!"},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"I read an bridged copy of this book when I was just a boy.

Doyle writes in fascinating detail, but ultimately his means of plotting \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" will slightly disappoint today's readers.The best thing about this novel is the world that the author creates in and around it, a world replete with mystery and unidentifiable threat and foreboding. Characters are drawn early and drawn well, usually via a pseudo-scientific narrative that presents visible traits or facts and then draws conclusions from there. In so doing, Doyle fits himself snugly into the realist tradition going back at least as far as Balzac's earliest novels, but Holmes' pre-occupation with scientific method pushes this even further until he becomes a sort of storyteller within a story; each clue leads to a supposition that is just as often speculative fiction as it is right on the money. The effect of this is one of the necessary components of great detective fiction: that is, we readers are presented with solutions that are not correct and that necessarily keep us reading until we get the correct one. Doyle does this well.However, it's another necessary component of today's detective fiction that is missing in \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" and that this reader missed dearly: the right solution, carefully and mischievously tucked into the narrative along the way. Part of why we read detective stories is to see whether we are as good at solving them as the detective in the story is, and Doyle refuses to allow us to do that. I don't want to give the ending away, but I will say by way of complaint that it comes from left field, and in such a way that the reader never could have guessed it. The writer of such a tale would today be accused of lazy emplotment. The best counter-example to this is the masterful job done by someone like Scott Turow; the power of \\"Presumed Innocent\\" is largely that, when the mystery is revealed, we realize that we should have seen it all along, just like the protagonist did (although 99% of us DON'T see it all along, because Turow is that subtle). We have been teased and held in the dark not just by Turow, but by the narrator we have come to trust. When the plot is done right, the ending should feel like an ending to the story we've just been told, and not the introduction of something completely new.Despite that fact--the fact that Doyle won't let me play detective--\\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" is an enjoyable read and offers insight into the earliest avatars of today's most popular type of fiction."},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"Missing content is not acceptable for publishing books, either paper version or digital version!

I would recommend it."},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"\\"The Hound of the Baskervilles,\\" originally published in 1902, is an engrossing \\"who-dun-it\\" murder mystery, featuring observant detective Sherlock Holmes and his comparatively humble partner Dr. Watson at their best. Labelled \\"a classic among classics\\" by mystery aficionados, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's masterfully written tale poses the problem--who killed Sir Charles Baskerville?--and offers well-placed clues en route to uncovering the resolution. Set a few hours by train from London on the eerie Devonshire moor, where commoners affirm occasional sightings of a huge black hound-shaped beast, the story offers a suspenseful blend of science and the supernatural, with infallible Holmesian logic predictably winning out by story's end.My only reservation about the book is that it is perhaps a little too formulaic in composition. Among the murder suspects are many: the butler Barrymore and his wife, the neighboring Dr. Mortimer, the argumentative lawyer Frankland with his telescope, the energetic butterfly catcher Stapleton and his sister, the typist Laura Lyons in the adjacent village, the escaped convict Selden, a mysterious black-bearded man seen in London, and, of course, the elusive hound who murmurs and roars on the moor. Watson's thorough narration and detailed letters to Holmes carefully lead us step-by-step through many of the possibilities; however, in my opinion, the overall plotline is more methodical and prematurely revealing than it needs to be. Already by two-thirds of the way through the story, when Holmes, who is supposed to be in London, surprisingly appears on the moor as \\"the man on the tor,\\" we learn who the murderer must be, and the remaining one-third of the book is devoted to detective-style collection of evidence and explanation and recap of the mystery. That's fine as a study for detectives-in-training, but might the book have had a chance of rising higher as a great work of literature if the author had put more effort into concealing Holmes' conclusion until later in the story, thereby creating a more sustained degree of suspense and intrigue?For the benefit of anyone who has not yet read the book, I do not want to give too much away, but as a hint in solving the murder mystery I will say that it helps to \\"follow the money\\" as you read. After childless Sir Charles, who had made his fortune in overseas speculation, mysteriously dies, next-of-kin nephew Sir Henry returns to England to take control of the estate. Assuming there is some financial motivation for the crime, as there usually is, who among the suspects, especially in light of their past circumstances and misfortune, could profit most from seeing both Charles and Henry dead? Clue: no, the butler didn't do it!"},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"Published in the beginning of the XX Century, \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" was a huge hit. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was virtually pressed to write it, because there was so much demand for the character. And even \`under pressure' he managed to write a very interesting novel, that has became timely and has entertained readers for over a hundred years.Narrated by Sherlock Holmes's best friend, Mr Watson, \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" is pretty much what its title says. For years a curse frightened the Baskerville family with a huge and deadly hound. Most believe this is a supernatural event, related to the forces of evil. Holmes, on the other hand, who is a very scientific and logic man, refuses to believe in this explanation. At least, until all the logical possibilities are ruled out.The device of picking Dr Watson -- who is an everyman -- as narrator serves to makes us feel closer to the brilliant Holmes. Not only are the readers connected with Watson by his narration, but, mostly because we tend to have the same common sense analyzes of the situation. Therefore, the detective has the advantage of bringing a different light to a problem. Doyle always provides him with more information than we have. It is a kind of cheat, because sometimes Holmes is not really cleverer -- just more informed. But, the book is so much fun that readers don't really mind being deceived. Moreover, Holmes has a huge ego and it makes him even more fun.One major conflict guides the novel: the battle between \`Natural x Supernatural'. Dr Mortimer, the person who tells Holmes and Watson the hound curse, believe that this is a supernatural affair. However, to the detective the story points to the logical. Holmes personifies the intellectual faith in logic. Given Arthur Conan Doyle beliefs --his faith in spiritualism -- it seems to be contradictory to create such a character that believes so much in logic. Holmes seems to be more related to the writer's scientific training than to what he believes. Much of Conan Doyle's prose depicts the turn of the century society in which he lived.Probably the device that Conan Doyle best exploited was the red herring -- which is very common in mystery and detective stories. In that, sometimes there is a very easy explanation at hand and the writer kind of guides us to believe in it. In \\"The Hound of Baskervilles\\", the writer created a very believable red herring. We are fooled and we like it."},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"_The Hound of the Baskervilles,_ by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is a classic Sherlock Holmes mystery that will keep the reader guessing from cover to cover. Set in Nineteenth Century England, the tale of murder and a family curse will hold the reader's attention until the end. When Sir Charles Baskerville mysteriously dies and the heir to his estate is threatened, the real mystery begins. Doyle's masterful writing style is easy to follow and flows so well the book will be over before the reader realizes it.I enjoyed this Sherlock Holmes mystery because it is easy to read and it flows well. For me, a person that does not usually like classics- or mysteries for that matter, I really enjoyed this book. The story kept my interest and it kept me guessing throughout the entire book. This story is not a thriller, but it is still a good mystery. For someone who prefers John Grisham suspense or a CSI type story line, this book is probably not for them.

You get a period piece with some subtle moves. The Hound of the Baskervilles is a total change-up from that format. Doyle builds the atmosphere of ancient legends, foul play, and a dark moor in an irresistible way. You will find yourself looking out over your shoulder if you read this book on a dark, lonely night. So if you like a novel with a true gothic feel, this will be your main reward.Your unexpected reward will be one of the most famous clues in all of detective fiction. In searching out who is haunting the Baskerville's, Doyle has Holmes solve the puzzle by looking for something that is missing. This is the only mystery that I know of that is solved by vacuous fulfillment (an odd concept of mathematics that Doyle must have known about).The third feature of this story are the many fallacious beliefs about how science works (like phrenology -- the shape of the skull determining your mind and character). You may find this interesting or annoying. In either case, try to remember that we probably have many similar false beliefs today that will look silly a hundred years from now.

All in all I thought this book was excellent. The plot was smoothly paced, never slowing down too much and there were various climaxes that are typical to Doyle's stories. Told from Watson's point of view (as all the Sherlock Holmes stories are) the books story takes place in \\"real time\\" chapters as well as chapters that are letters which Watson has sent to Holmes. This is where the only real disappointment of the book lies, Sherlock Holmes is absent in most of the story. Overlooking this, however, all the other characters in the story are marvelously created and entirely believable. And as always, people are not always as they first appear. As usual, the story leaves you in suspense the whole time and finally reveals the solution to you until right at the end when you are on the edge of your seat. All in all, I found this book to be a fine example of Sherlock Holmes literature. It is a fine mystery novel that is very eloquently written.

Arthur Conan Doyle creates a genuinely creepy atmosphere by his setting on the English moors and the legend of the demonic hound. Of course, being a Holmes story, most things end up with a rational explanation, but there is good, honest, Victorian terror along the way. Reading it, I was struck by how much it must have influenced the movie, An American Werewolf in London.Conan Doyle has a wonderful, economic prose style and his Holmes stories always move at a quick pace. The only maddening thing is how much time Sherlock himself spends off-stage. I guess Conan Doyle treats the character the way most authors treat villains - only allowing the reader glimpses of him. I guess that is because Sherlock's mind is so atypical, he is ultimately unknowable to us. In this story, Holmes has to stay behind in London for a while, so he sends the very competent Dr. Watson to Baskerville hall to investigate the strange goings-on."},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"Where can you find giant hounds that stalk and kill an innocent victim in the night? Well, a good place to look for this dreadful event is in Arthur Conan Doyle's novel, Sherlock Holmes and the Case of the Hound of the Baskervilles. It is a wonderful, but mysterious book that will surely keep you on the edge of your seat. Sherlock Holmes is a very intelligent protagonist who always has a wise explanation for everything that seems unusual. This novel takes place in the gloomy swamplands of England, around the Baskerville estate. The main conflict in the story is Person vs. Nature because during almost the whole story, Holmes is trying to find the ghostlike hound and figure out exactly what is going on.I enjoyed this book a lot because it doesn't give away too much information and allows you to think about all of the possible explanations for the hound which are probably much worse then the actual reasons. I also felt almost like I was right there with Sherlock helping him solve the case. Overall the book was very good but one feature that I didn't like is my edition, illustrated by Pablo Marcos Studio, had many pictures and they definitely weren't how I pictured the hound, it didn't even look like a hound or any kind of animal I have ever seen for that matter.

I liked this book because of the characters, how the story developed, and how it was written.The main characters in the book are Sherlock Holmes and Watson. Together they solve the mystery of who killed Sir Charles Baskerville. I think they make a good team because Sherlock does more of the thinking about evidence and theories and Watson goes out and does the leg work of asking questions and gathering information. Even though Sherlock knows the answer to the mystery, he wouldn't be able to do it without Watson and he doesn't act like the superior of the two.I also liked the book because it was a mystery so the more I read, the more exciting it got as the killer's identity was revealed. I did not know who the killer was or what his motive was until the end.Finally, I liked the way the author wrote. When Sir Henry was being chased by the hound, I almost felt like it was after me. He had the characters say things like \\"By Jove\\" and \\"Good Heavens\\". Also, instead of writing \\"he said\\" all the time, it was sometimes written as \\"said he\\". Lastly, words would be repeated which I thought made it funny such as: \\"The brute, the brute\\", \\"His wife, His wife\\", and \\"A beard, a beard\\".In conclusion, I enjoyed this book and agree with those who say that this is one of the best detective stories ever written."},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"This is a book of stupifying and mind-blowing set of events, in which the incredible Sherlock Holmes is called forth to solve the mystery of the hound that has haunted the Baskerville family for generations.

Elegantly written in formal prose, the story focuses on the moor surrounding the ancestral home of Sir Henry Baskerville, an American who has inherited it upon the mysterious death of his uncle Charles. The moor is so treacherous that no one dares venture upon it at night-one step off the path, and the mire will swallow the unfortunate victim.Family legend says that a sadistic Baskerville from the eighteenth century once loosed a huge and ferocious dog in pursuit of a woman who had escaped his clutches, and that she had died of fright when she heard the dog panting behind her on the moor. The lecherous Baskerville, in pursuit, had had his throat torn out by this \\"dog from hell.\\" The ghostly dog can still be heard howling on the moors, and many believe it was the dog which caused the elderly Sir Charles Baskerville to have his fatal heart attack.In classically Gothic style, the novel features mysterious cries from the moor, foggy nights, an escaped prisoner, signals by candlelight, a butler who knows more than he says, a beautiful woman with a mysterious past, a small boy who carries messages, and someone who spies on the dark and isolated Baskerville Hall. Sherlock Holmes plays a lesser role in this story than he does in most others, remaining in London while Dr. Watson accompanies Sir Henry to his estate as an observer and protector.Holmes, of course, is operating behind the scenes, learning about the activities at Baskerville Hall through the daily accounts which Watson sends him (and which reveal much of the action to the reader). By no means the bumbling character which films have portrayed, Watson offers sensible advice to Sir Henry and shows a keen eye for details of interest to Holmes.Though the prose is often \\"purple\\" with melodrama and overwrought description, this contributes to the fun of the novel, providing a dramatic counterweight to the extreme logic of Sherlock Holmes, whose late appearance in the novel comes as a carefully timed surprise. The story is intriguing, the mysteries are well developed, the atmosphere is suitably spooky, and the resolution, though not really surprising, is appropriate. Even if the story had not been made into a memorable film with Basil Rathbone, The Hound of the Baskervilles would still be justly famous as Conan Doyle's best developed mystery, a genuine classic of the genre.

The mood, the details, the characters--all of it is wonderful. Doyle has created a magnificent story with his successful character, Sherlock Homes.When starting the book, I found the language odd and not of my liking. But as I continued, I came to appreciate it. The novel isn't long, nor is it difficult to understand (though some words were a bit confusing, it is easy to discern their meaning by reading the sentence through again). Though I liked the beginning, I didn't become fully engrossed until page 50 and on.The story itself, told by Dr. Watson, Holmes friend and assistant, follows the mysterious death (or murder) of Sir Charles Baskerville. There is a legend surrounding the Baskervilles, and it tells of a devilish hound which has cursed the family. Suspiciouns of this tale being true are heightened when peasants report of seeing a hound on the moor and unexplained howlings travel on the wind. Dr. Mortimer, a friend of the deceased Charles, comes to Holmes asking him to help make sense of the mysterious death and advise him on what to do with the heir to Baskerville Hall, Henry Baskerville, who is arriving from Canada. Many curious characters and surprising twists befall our protagonists.

You see, an Inverness cloak and deerstalker cap are inappropriate wardrobe for the town, and belong in the country. Sherlock Holmes is predominantly a city dweller and city investigator; it is relatively uncommon that he treks out on adventures, but the case of the mysterious death of Sir Charles Baskerville and the attempted murder of Sir Henry Baskerville led him to the Dartmoor plain. Thus, country garb was in order. This is where we get much of our imagery.Also helping with this is that every major actor to play Holmes has considered 'Hound of the Baskervilles' to be the ultimate Holmes story to act -- rather like the Hamlet of Conan Doyle's work. Holmes was a popular film icon, and in the early decades of the twentieth century several dozen films were made of Holmes, but the first after these many films to be set in Victorian times (and not be updated for the screen) was a version of Hound. Ellie Norwood, Basil Rathbone, Peter Cushing, Jeremy Brett -- many distinguished actors have considered this among their greatest roles.Watson dates the case to 1889, but various reading authorities, knowing the good doctor's occasional attempts to distort details to protect the privacy of the innocent, have dated this to between 1886 and 1900.In fact, the novel appeared in serialised form in the Strand magazine, the great first-publication site of most Holmesian tales, between August 1901 and April 1902, after Conan Doyle had attempted to kill off the great detective in the short story The Final Problem, which showcased Holmes' battle with Moriarity, the Napoleon of Crime. In fact, Conan Doyle came to dislike the character of Holmes because it was a distraction to his other pursuits.So, bowing to public pressure, Conan Doyle penned Hound of the Baskervilles to placate the public demand for more stories, but took care to place it before the death of Holmes, in the hopes that he could leave the detective safely dead (if not buried). Such was not to be, and we find a few years later that in fact Conan Doyle 'resurrects' Holmes in a rather ingenious fashion.But, on to the story at hand. Holmes and Watson, at home at 221b Baker Street, are approached by a Dr. James Mortimer regarding the death of Sir Charles Baskerville and a family curse which involved evil forces in the form of a satanic hound. Mortimer is concerned for the safety of the new proprietor of the family lands, freshly arriving from Canada, who had a new boot stolen, then an old boot stolen, in his hotel in London. Later Holmes would put together the significance of this seeming strange minor act (no, I won't tell you).Holmes sends Baskerville and Watson together to the country estate while he tends things in London on another case. In reality, Holmes is setting Watson up as a diversion, while he investigates the moor and the surroundings of the Baskerville estate under cover. Life at the estate is a bit strained, given the murder, an attempted murder, a curse, and all. The neighbours seem nice enough, though. Or are they? Watson picks up on curious little details of their relationship, which he reports back in written notes to Holmes (which have been redirected to his moor outpost).Eventually Holmes reveals himself to Watson, and then to Baskerville, and the chase is on in earnest, to discover the reality of the mysterious creature each have seen or heard. In good mystery fashion, we come across long lost relatives and an inheritance to be had; we find plots and subplots muddied by superstitious belief and fear, on a mysterious plain in southwestern England.All the elements combined that are now considered standard bits for a well-done country English mystery. But the mystery does not stop merely with the story. In true mystery fashion, appearing in the Daily Express edition of March 16, 1959, there were doubts cast upon the authorship of Hound of the Baskervilles. The one who carried the dispute was named none other than Baskerville, Harry Baskerville. He credited the story to one Fletcher Robinson, who died (perhaps of the Egyptian mummy's curse) at age 35 shortly after the publication of Hound. With his death, only Baskerville remembered the issue of co-authorship. Baskerville claims it was Robinson who 'borrowed' the Baskerville name.One of Conan Doyle's heirs, Adrian Conan Doyle, heatedly denied involvement of Robinson past possible 'conversations' that might have taken place between Arthur Conan Doyle and Robinson. But, he did not deny Conan Doyle's possible 'inspiration' from Robinson.One Baker Street Irregular (an exclusive club of Holmesian experts) was doing a monograph on this issue as well, claiming that the reason why Holmes appears so infrequently is due to the fact that he had to be written in to an otherwise essentially completed story. This Irregular travelled to meet with Baskerville, and hinted at discoveries he had found. But alas, the Irregular died three weeks later in America, his monograph never published and his notes were never found. Perhaps a dog ate the homework? A mysterious hound, perhaps?"},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"Sherlock Holmes is approached by a concerned doctor from Devonshire, in this longest and most famous of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's mysteries. A novel in its own right, this tale of the macabre murder on the moor (which houses a desolate prison) takes Holmes from London to the dreaded Grimpen Mire-treacherous with pockets of quicksand. But nothing will deter the famous Victorian sleuth from helping an innocent man discover the truth about the family legend. Is it really a hound from Hell or something more worldly which threatens to wipe out the Baskerville family?Even Holmes expresses reserve about taking on the devil himself, for he admits that this foe is as vicious and clever as any he has encountered. Forced to go undercover, Holmes delegates faithful Dr. Watson to guard the new baronet at Baskerville Hall, with serious instructions to send regular reports of all he uncovers to him in London. Doyle's style includes lenghty dialogue, unrealistically long and detailed letters, with alternating slow and fast pacing; the interesting denouement, where all lose ends are explained, occurs curiously two months later.THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES proves vintage Victoriana, where Holmes' mind proves as fertile and agile as the master criminal's elaborate schemes to defraud the true heir. Holmes uses both his \\"irregulars\\" and Scotland Yard to help him achieve justice on the moor. If this is your introduction to the sleuth who resides at 221-B Baker Street, be sure to enjoy an anthology of his fascinating and deadly short stories."},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"The Hound of the Baskervilles is about one of theadventures of the famous Sherlock Holmes.

Sherlock Holmes has to risk it all and lieeven to his best friend and assistant, the narrator,Watson.The setting of the moor is the perfect place for thelegend to exist because of all the ancient structuresand the Grimpen Mire.

I thought it was very exciting and suspensful. Conan Doyle uses a very elevated vocabulary which may not be appropriate for young people. Also Conan Doyle does a great job of illustrating to us what Baskerville Hall might look like and what the moor may seem like at midnight on a cloudy evening. He also depicts the characters very well and he did a great job with the death scenes. I was a little dissappointed that the book was not more scarey. It was not the best I have ever read but The Hound of the Baskervilles was certainly a great book."},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"First I must make a note of the fact that this is the first and only Sherlock Holmes story I've read thus far. Therefore I cannot offer any kind of comparison between &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot; and Doyle's other works. I will simply give you my thoughts about it as a story in and of itself.The book is simply written and easy to understand, but the plot remains engaging throughout. It is not overly complicated, but neither is it too simplistic or predictable. The Baskerville family has passed down the legend of a giant black hound that plagues the residents of Baskerville Hall, bringing a swift end to any that dare venture alone onto the nearby moor at night. When Sir Charles Baskerville is found dead upon the moor with the pawprints of a large dog in the earth nearby, the case is presented to Sherlock Holmes in hopes of unraveling the mystery and ensuring the safety of Sir Charles's nephew and Baskerville Hall's new occupant, Sir Henry Baskerville.Too busy to investigate the matter himself, Holmes sends his friend and assistant, Dr. Watson, out to Baskerville Hall in his stead. Watson is the narrator of the story, and we see threads of the mystery slowly unravel as he makes his reports back to Holmes. Other reviewers have complained about the fact that Holmes is not the central figure in this particular novel, but I actually liked the way the story was done. And as we find out toward the end of the book, Holmes actually plays a larger part than he initially appears to. I must admit, though, that it was a bit depressing to see Watson toil away at investigating and drawing conclusions only to have Holmes repeatedly inform him that his conclusions are wrong. Watson does most of the drudge-work but gets very little in return.The style of the writing was very appealing to me. The story has a very dark, gothic feel, and is full of suspense. Doyle's descriptions make the eerie moor feel very real. For a book written a century ago, it is still very reader-friendly. The only part where I thought the book dropped off a little was in the last few chapters. For all the build-up and suspense, the climax of the story is much too short and quickly resolved, leaving a feeling of unreality. Also, Doyle concludes by having Holmes simply recite to Watson all the details of his sleuthing that were left out of the action of the book. I think the rule &quot;Show, don't tell,&quot; is a good one when it comes to literature, and I would rather have actually seen Holmes come to his conclusions as the story progressed.Overall, though, I did enjoy the book, and look forward to reading more of Doyle's work. My one last word of advice regards this particular edition of the book (the 1993 Signet Classics printing with Afterword by Frederick Busch). There are numerous typos that really should have been caught and corrected before publishing (most, curiously, are instances where the letter &quot;t&quot; is inexplicably replaced with the letter &quot;b&quot;). I would recommend looking for a different version that is more competently edited."},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"This is hands down one of the best mysteries ever written by Doyle. While Amazon categorizes it as a book for 9-12 year olds, I believe it may be too difficult for the low end of this age range.

The only problem I found was that the beginning doesn't do a good job of reeling you in. However, the farther into the book you get, the more exciting the plot becomes. Sometimes, the only reason I kept on reading the book was because I knew what was coming next. The story does make up for what it lacks in the beginning in the end.The case starts out when Dr. James Mortimer brings a case to Sherlock Holmes. The detective dubs it; \\"Very suspicious indeed.\\" It concerns the mysterious death of a very rich and respected man, Sir Charles Baskerville. He apparently went out for his nightly walk the day before he left for London, afraid of the family curse. Later that night, Sir Charles was found dead with no harm at all to his body. Now the new heir, Sir Henry Baskerville, has been warned to leave Baskerville Hall - or else.With Sherlock in London, and Watson left alone to deal with the case, there doesn't appear to be much hope to stop the villan. However, the great detective may be up against more than just human forces. The curse of the Baskervilles, started by the evil Sir Hugo in the early 17th century, has been haunting the Baskervilles ever since. Sir Hugo fell in love with a yeoman's daughter and swore he would marry her. He kidnapped her and held her prisoner in Baskerville hall. Shortly after, she escaped. Hugo chased her down the moor on horseback until she died of exhaustion. When Sir Hugo's companions finally caught up with him, he was dead. Standing over his body was an enormous black hound plucking at his throat.

There's already a mystery to be solved right when you open the book, with a mysterious cane left in Watson and Sherlock's office.Doyle keeps each page filled with suspense and thrills. Even as I read, I could hear the low, mournful sound of the hound that Stapleton keeps locked up baying across the moor.The characters are amazing and funny. Sherlock Holmes keeps me giggling with all of his oddities and eccentrities. Watson is amusing with his normal assumptions next to Sherlock.The mystery is intriguing and darker and deeper than it first appears. The book can actually be rather creepy and suspenseful, unlike the other mystery novels where they're solving the typical robbery, or something like that.The only thing that I didn't like as much compared to other authors I've read was that his sense of description wasn't as good. I had to rely more on my imagination to see the moors as he described it rather than what it really looked like.Yet in spite of that, the novel was comedy, mystery, and a pinch of horror all rolled into one delicious enchilada."},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"The setting is the star of Arthur Conan Doyle's atmospheric \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles,\\" his most popular Sherlock Holmes story.

Does a cursed hellhound stalk the last heir to the Baskerville fortune? Only Sherlock Holmes can answer that, but for a good portion of the novel Watson is left to investigate on his own.

The setting of the \\"Grimpen Mire\\" is perfect for a murder mystery: ancient hut relics, deadly bogs, and even an escaped murderer.My only complaint is that there is not much suspense when it comes to the ending, since Holmes of course is always a step ahead and he clues the reader in perhaps earlier than necessary.

What is there not to love here? Setting this tale amid the legends of the lonely moors of rural Devonshire, Conan-Doyle revived his protagonist from a watery Swiss grave and let Watson take us back a decade to the day a nervous client comes to call on 221-B Baker Street. The man believes full well in the legend of a murderous hellhound which preys upon the male heirs of the all-but extinct Baskerville line, and he fears for the safety of the new heir, who is soon to arrive to take possession of his ancestral home. Whereas the tale of a predatory dog that arose after a 17th century curse might be laughed off in the enlightened Victorian Era, the stark truth is, the previous owner of Baskerville Hall was found dead on his grounds after a nocturnal stroll, his face a mask of terror, and about his body lay the paw prints of an enormous hound! Holmes is asked to determine whether this creature of myth, recently blamed for the suspicious death of the elderly Sir Henry Baskerville, is an apparition or a being of flesh and bone. Holmes sends Watson off to lead the quest for truth, and stays behind in London. Over the distance of this story, a hyperactive anthropologist, a law and order fanatic local busybody, a slinking, creepy butler and his wife, a beautiful Brazilian lady and the lady's giddy brother are all introduced to us, as is the last living representative of the Baskerville line, an American who disregards all notions of any danger existing from something as silly as a demonic hound.

I can honestly say I was quite spooked as I was reading some of it at night!Since this is the first novel I have ever read by Doyle, I didn't know what to expect. But the twists in the plot and the constant itching to know what was going to happen next had me hooked!I watched the 1959 movie after reading this, and I have to say it was a disgrace.

In this novel, good is pitted against evil, and realism against the supernatural, as Sherlock Holmes tries to defeat a very worthy and powerful foe. Throughout the novel, Holmes characteristically dismisses the following theory: Could the sudden and tragic death of Sir Charles Baskerville have been caused by a gigantic ghostly hound which is said to have haunted his family for generations? Claiming to be caught up in another case, he sends his partner Watson to Devon to protect the Baskerville heir and to observe the suspects closely.

It suffers a little from a lack of Holmes, but is otherwise a tightly-written, solid little mystery.Sir Charles Baskerville was found dead of a heart attack -- apparently killed by a family curse in the shape of a giant dog. So his pal Dr. Mortimer asks Sherlock Holmes to protect Charles' heir, Henry Baskerville, who has just arrived in England to claim his estate and inheritance.But even without Holmes, Watson can tell that something is up -- secretive servants, peculiar neighbors, an escaped criminal, a giant quicksand marsh, and the sounds of a dog howling in the night. But Holmes knows that the curse is no supernatural hound -- and that Sir Henry is in danger from a more real kind of ancient enemy.\\"Hound of the Baskervilles\\" stumbles in one area -- the relative lack of Holmes. He's out of the picture for most of the book, and Watson does plenty of solid detecting on his own. Everybody loves the faithful narrator, but Watson isn't the Great Detective, and the book feels vaguely incomplete without Holmes inspecting clues and giving little hints to Watson.The mystery unfolds at a languid pace, dropping a few red herrings along the way. Doyle pays loving attention to the dangerous, almost surreal Grimpen Mire and the surrounding countryside. But when Holmes comes back onto the scene, the book tightens itself up. All the plot threads rapidly slip into place as the real \\"hound\\" is uncovered.Holmes' steel-trap mind is untarnished here, especially when he reveals what he figured out at the end. He's especially likable in an endearing scene at the beginning, where he educates Watson on deduction. But this is Watson's turn to shine, since he spends a long time gathering clues and even solving a sub-mystery without any assistance.\\"Hound of the Baskervilles\\" is a short, satisfying Holmesian mystery, which is only hampered by Holmes' absence for about half the book.

Dr. James Mortimer found the footprints of a gigantic hound twenty yards from the body! There have been sightings of a huge hound on the moors at night. A new heir, Sir Henry Baskerville, arrives from Canada to take over the Baskerville property; he is the last of the line. Will he meet the same evil fate? Holmes makes an appointment to meet Sir Henry the next day. Holmes peers over the Ordnance map of that area. Has any crime been committed (Chapter 3)? Sir Henry tells of a warning letter sent to his hotel; who knew he was there? Why would anyone steal just one of his new boots? Would anyone follow Sir Henry? Dr. Watson will accompany Sir Henry back to Baskerville Hall; there is less danger in a small village than in London. Dr. Watson must keep his revolver near and never relax his precautions (Chapter 6).The moor country is described as wild and sparsely settled. Dr. Watson reports his observations of the people who meet with Sir Henry. Watson sees the dangers of the great Grimpen Mire when a pony is caught in a bog and killed. There are stone huts from prehistoric man. Watson meets Stapleton the naturalist and then his beautiful sister (who tells him to go back to London). Stapleton had once been a schoolmaster (Chapter 7). Watson sends letters to Holmes in London (Chapter 8). Mr. Frankland has a passion for litigation. He also observes the country with a telescope on his roof. Why was Stapleton so angry (Chapter 9)? What was the secret of the Barrymores? Watson meets Laura Lyons and hears her secret story (Chapter 11). What did she hold back? Mr. Frankland observed the stone huts. Then Watson hears a terrible scream from the moor (Chapter 12). Holmes has the solution to a cold-blooded murder, but lacked definitive proof. Holmes studied the portrait of the wicked Sir Hugo. Then plans are made for the night's activities. Will an unexpected fog create a complication? Holmes, Watson, and Lestrade rescue Sir Henry from a murderous fate. The villain escaped to a hiding place on the moor, but justice wasn't cheated. Chapter 15 ties up the loose ends.This may be the most popular of Doyle's four Holmes novels. It does not involve a religion, a company town, or imperial looting. Did Doyle implicitly criticize a hereditary aristocracy that passed down evils to each generation? The character traits of the villain seem like those in true crime stories. Inheritance through murder has inspired other stories (\\"The List of Adrian Messenger\\"). There is one flaw in this story. How could the purchase of food for a giant hound be kept secret? Sherlock Holmes could question the grocers and butchers in the area to find the owner of that giant hound."},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"The main conflict in this book is that Sir Charles Baskerville is killed.

This book isn't the best book I have read but it is not the worst.A theme from this book that could help to everyday life is that sometimes weird things occur and you can't trust everyone. In the book there is a killing hound and the owner is one of the friends. This helps in everyday life because sometimes things that don't happen sometimes do happen. Also this shows that not everybody can be trusted. Sometimes you can trust people but sometimes you can't."},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"I love mysteries and this is my favorite Sherlock Holmes story. The Baskerville family has been haunted for generations by a legendary hound of the moors. The evil deeds of one of their ancestors (and their guilty feelings about his actions) brought this hound into their family history in the form of a curse.Sir Charles Baskerville, master of the estate has recently died, apparently of a heart attack. There's no reason to suspect foul play but the doctor investigating the death scene found the tracks of a gigantic hound near his body and speculates that with Sir Charles' bad heart, he may have been frightened to death.The estate now passes to next of kin, Sir Henry Baskerville and the question arises whether he will be safe from the ghost hound from Hell who haunts his family. And who would inherit the estate, if he should die? To add to the superstitious feelings, residents of Dartmoor have recently reported hearing the howling of a hound across the moors at night.Undoubtedly, Sherlock Holmes will be able to find a logical explanation for this mystery. But in maddening fashion, he refuses to travel to Baskerville hall, sending Dr. John Watson in his place. Holmes will be investigating in his own ways but he keeps his plans secret. Watson soon finds himself walking the shadowy, dark and haunted moorlands of the Baskervilles where he will eventually come face to face with the beast of Dartmoor.Interestingly, this story may be loosely based upon a legend which does exist about a dark beast which prowls the land of Dartmoor. However, the Baskerville family and their family curse are entirely fictitious."},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"This was my first time to have read Sherlock Holmes.

Alongwith his loyal assistant, Dr. Watson, Holmes tries to solve one of the most complex mysteries in his life. At his home on Baker Street, Holmes is visited by the mysterious anthropologist, Dr. Mortimer,who is disturbingly interested in people's skulls. Mortimer comes to homes on the occasion of amurder of Sir Charles Baskervilles, of the Baskerville family, one in which all males are to suffer apainful death of the Hound of the Baskervilles, one that been around for over two hundred years.Mortimer also comes to Holmes asking what to do Sir Henry Baskerville, an American heir to thehome. Soon in the novel, Holmes meets Sir Henry. On a walk down a street in London, Holmesnotices that a horse-drawn taxi is stalking Sir Henry Baskerville and Dr. Mortimer, and rushes to it,only before speeding away, giving a glimpse of man with a beard. While looking at their first clues,Holmes and Dr. Watson notice that Sir Henry is boiling mad in his hotel, because someone stoleone of his brand new boots. Not only that, he gets a threat letter, telling the young man to notventure out onto the moor, where Baskerville Hall is. His boot is soon switched with one of his oldones. After this baffling clue, Holmes sends Dr. Watson to Baskerville Hall along with Sir Henry.But on the trip, they're not alone, because there is an escaped convict named Selden on the loose.At the hall, Watson and Sir Henry are introduced to Mr. and Mrs. Barrymore, former servants of SirCharles. After this, Watson is introduced to the neighbors of Baskerville Hall : Mr. and Mrs.Stapleton, brother and sister. One night though, Watson thinks he hears something in the hallwaywhere his guest room is located. He and Sir henry follow, to find Mr. Barrymore signaling someonewith a candle on the moor. Captured, the Barrymores reveal that the man is the escaped convict,Selden. Chasing the convict, Watson sees a mysterious figure on a nearby tor. Losing Selden,Watson and Sir henry make a discovery : Selden is Mrs. Barrymore's brother. And anotherdiscovery is made : the person who was standing on the tor was none other than Sherlock Holmes.From Holmes, all of the clues seem to be pointing to Mr. Stapleton, and that his sister is really hiswife. But as soon as everything is revealed, Holmes and Watson hear the Hound of theBaskervilles, and an alarming scream, who turns out to be Selden's. After a couple of moreseconds, there is silence. Death is on the moor. Even worse, Stapleton sees Holmes, blowing hiscover. However, Holmes says to Sir Henry that he and Watson are leaving to go to London forjust a short time. This is used so that when Stapleton sees Holmes leave, he will carry out his planto murder Sir Henry with the hound. At the train station, Holmes interviews Laura Lyons, whowas used by Stapleton to lure Sir Charles to his death. Once Holmes goes back to the moor,accompanied by Watson's former partner, Lestrade, they solve the mystery, shoot the Houndof the Baskervilles before it attacks Sir Henry, and they cause Stapleton to die in the bogs ofthe moor. The Hound of the Baskervilles is an excellent classic to read by Sir Arthur Conan Doylefor its great deal of suspense, mystery, and for its great and complex characters.In The Hound of the Baskervilles, there is a great mass of suspense that will constantly put thereader on the edge of his or her seat. In the novel, there is the point in which Watson and SirHenry are chasing the escaped convict, Selden. Losing him, they turn back to Baskerville Hall,just in time for Watson to see a man standing on the tor in front of him, looking down on thevast expanse of the moor. Although it later happens to be Holmes, this will keep the reader onthe edge of his or her seat, asking, \\"Who is that man?\\" Also, there is a section where Holmes,Watson, and Lestrade are spying on Stapleton, watching if he would soon spring his trap onSir Henry. As Sir Henry is walking home, Holmes is watching him. But an approaching fogbank from the moor blocks his view, and he hears a sharp cry. This will make the readerwant to read the rest of the book, asking, \\"What will happen to Sir Henry?\\" This novel is theone for people who crave suspense.The Hound of the Baskervilles, by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is an excellent mystery, truly one ofthe best of its time. The mystery of Sir Charles's death comes up early, when Dr. Mortimer visitsHolmes at his house of Baker Street. In his pocket was an old manuscript telling the detailsof his death. Early in the 1700's, a man by the name of Sir Hugo Baskerville was killed by theHound of the Baskervilles after attempting to murder an escaped maiden. From then on, everymale member of the Baskervilles would die a horrifying death if they ever walked out on themoor at night. That was what happened to Sir Charles, except he was found dead runningaway towards the moor, instead of away from it. He was never touched, but Mortimer reportedseeing the footprints of a giant hound some twenty yards away. There is also the instance ofthe missing boots and the threat letter, along with Mr. Barrymore signaling with a candle late atnight. The Hound of the Baskervilles is definately a great mystery that will thrill anyone.Sherlock Holmes is a complex character in The Hound of the Baskervilles. Known as thegreatest fictional detective of all time, Holmes is a brilliant thinker, athletic for that period oftime, and has a massive attention span. Not only that, he notices fine details in what normalpeople would not notice. That's most likely what makes Sherlock Holmes such a greatdetective. Meanwhile, Dr. Watson is a wealthy man who constantly attends parties, and isnot nearly as silent as Holmes is. In the Hound of the Baskervilles, Watson's two main purposesare to narrate the novel, and to explain what Holmes is saying. Besides these two partners incrime-fighting, Stapleton is the perfect villain. Almost as cunning as Holmes, Stapleton is alwaystrying to outwit his foilers and is trying to take claim of Baskerville Hall, because is secretlyanother heir to Baskerville Hall.The Hound of the Baskervilles, by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is an excellant classic novel to read.It has great sections of thrill and suspense, it is an excellent mystery, and it has the perfect mixof characters.

I was SO wrong! I finished the book in a period of less than 24 hours!!! This is an absolutely fabulous book! Doyle's use of language is masterful, and you are swept away to the moor with its swamps, jagged cliffs, and massive hills. I can honestly say I was quite spooked as I was reading some of it at night!Since this is the first novel I have ever read by Doyle, I didn't know what to expect. But the twists in the plot and the constant itching to know what was going to happen next had me hooked!I watched the 1959 movie after reading this, and I have to say it was a disgrace. I don't know if I would be happy seeing any of the versions, only because I don't know if any of them could even compare to the rich world and language used by Doyle to transport you to Devonshire!! But of course, the book is always better than the movie. :)"},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"With echoes of Edgar Allan Poe, this 1902 novel continues to delight mystery-lovers. Elegantly written in formal prose, the story focuses on the moor surrounding the ancestral home of the Baskervilles, which an American, Sir Henry Baskerville, has just inherited upon the mysterious death of his uncle Charles. The moor is so treacherous that no one dares venture upon it at night--one step off the path, and the mire will swallow the unfortunate victim.Family legend says that a sadistic Baskerville from the eighteenth century once loosed a huge and ferocious dog in pursuit of a young woman who had escaped his clutches, and that she had died of fright when she heard the dog panting behind her on the moor. The lecherous Baskerville, following the dog closely, had had his throat torn out by this \\"dog from hell.\\" The ghostly dog can still be heard howling on the moors, and many believe it was the dog which caused the elderly Sir Charles Baskerville to have his fatal heart attack.In classically Gothic style, the novel features mysterious cries from the moor, foggy nights, an escaped prisoner, signals by candlelight, a butler who knows more than he says, a beautiful woman with a mysterious past, a small boy who carries messages, and someone who spies on the dark and isolated Baskerville Hall. Sherlock Holmes plays a lesser role in this story than he does in most others, remaining in London while Dr. Watson accompanies Sir Henry to his estate as an observer and protector.Holmes, of course, is operating behind the scenes, learning about the activities at Baskerville Hall through the daily accounts which Watson sends him (and which reveal much of the action to the reader). By no means the bumbling character which films have portrayed, Watson offers sensible advice to Sir Henry and shows a keen eye for details of interest to Holmes.Though the prose is often \\"purple\\" with melodrama and overwrought description, this contributes to the fun of the novel, providing a dramatic counterweight to the extreme logic of Sherlock Holmes, whose late appearance in the novel comes as a carefully timed surprise. The story is intriguing, the mysteries are well developed, the atmosphere is suitably spooky, and the resolution, though not really surprising, is appropriate. Even if the story had not been made into a memorable film with Basil Rathbone, The Hound of the Baskervilles would still be justly famous as Conan Doyle's best developed mystery, a genuine classic of the genre. Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"Familiar with his stories for years, I finally decided to buckle down and read one of Arthur Conan Doyle's stories of Sherlock Holmes, and \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles,\\" the most famous of the novels, was the one I decided to pick up. To my surprise, I tore through it. It was a simple read, yet a complicated and satisfying mystery.As with all the Holmes stories, his assistant Dr. Watson is charged with telling the tale of the bloody Baskerville curse. Sir Charles Baskerville, who was the charge of the family estate, has recently been gored to death by some sort of animal, and Sir Henry, the new heir to the household and the family fortune, fears that the mythic curse of a hellhound stalking the family grounds is true.A strange twist occurs in this investigation, though, for it's not Holmes who goes to investigate the house. It's Watson, who studies the suspicious neighbors and staff, keeps close watch over Sir Henry and begins to notice that some very odd things are lurking about the moor.Is the curse behind this killing, or is it a villain of flesh and blood?The lead characters are defined well, and, though this is my first Holmes story, I understood the basics and the rhythm almost immediately. The narrative structure that Doyle is famous for is, as expected, charming, and the characters are well-defined. The mystery is properly twisted, and I didn't really guess the middle or the ending.The best twist, to me, wasn't the reveal of any villain or method. It was the twist involving the shadowy figure on the moor. I didn't see it coming at all, and, when I read it, I realized that this old novel still had the narrative tools to surprise me.It's a classic for a reason."},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"There are very few iconic characters in fiction, but Sherlock Holmes may very well be the most iconic of all. The mere mention of his name, even to those who've never seen a Holmes movie or read a Holmes book, is enough to evoke an image of the detective (most likely looking like Basil Rathbone, or more recently Robert Downey, Jr.). Part of being an iconic character is he will transcend the work itself. Like James Bond, another iconic character, the author or actor almost don't matter; if a particular story fails, it is the writer's fault, not the character's.The Hound of the Baskervilles is probably the most famous Holmes story, and though I'd seen a couple movie versions (one with Rathbone, one with Peter Cushing as Holmes), I'd never read the novel previously. The tale focuses on the supposedly cursed family of the Baskervilles. The family is wealthy enough, but tragedy and a mysterious monstrous dog fit into the Baskerville legend, a curse brought upon them for the actions of the vile Hugo Baskerville.After one more Baskerville is killed by the dog (or at least scared to death by it), Holmes and Watson are called in to protect the last Baskerville heir. The completely practical Holmes refuses to believe in a supernatural explanation and will eventually find the much more mundane solution.As with most Holmes stories, the pleasure is in seeing Holmes in action. But a little Holmes goes a long way, so Arthur Conan Doyle limits his presence in the story to maybe a third of the book. If you read enough Holmes stories, the formulas Doyle uses become apparent, and they're in this tale too. Nonetheless, this makes for either a nice introduction to Holmes, or for seasoned readers of earlier novels and short stories, one of Doyle's better efforts."},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"I would give this Sherlock Holmes story 5 stars, the low rating is due to the poor Kindle formatting. I know it is free but there are substantial passages missing... parts that are very important to the story... such as the actual legend of the Hound of the Baskerville. If you are truly interested in reading this story, there is a version that is only $1 to download and is complete."},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"Warning! Once this book opens, its reader may be unable to set it down. The Hound of the Baskervilles is an irresistible adventure. This thrilling Sherlock Holmes mystery pulls the reader into tracing the steps of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson as they question suspects and discovers clues. As a teenager, I have enjoyed the short story adventures of Sherlock Holmes, but this full length novel was so much better. The PACES PAideia Study Guide proved extremely helpful in thoroughly comprehending each aspect of the book. The Character Chart, located in the Study Guide, enabled me to track the suspects and compile information I gathered on each. The thought provoking Journal Questions helped me organize my thoughts about the story on paper and keep up with the plot. The Study Guide's Parent Questions also assisted me in digging deeper into the novel and discussing key points with my parents. My favorite part about this mysterious tale is that, for the most part, it is unpredictable. Numerous red herrings arise throughout the story, forcing the reader to decipher the truth. Even when the verdict is revealed, the reader is left with many questions to ponder. Thus, the reader ultimately becomes the detective right along with Holmes and Watson. Again, warning! Once this book is opened, its reader will be unable to close it until the end."},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"Seeing as how Series 2 of \\"Sherlock\\" has yet to make it to the United States, I was hoping that this would be the script, or at least an adaptation of the script to a novel format.

But like I said before 14 or more pages in a chapter. Trying to find out the mystery is the best part.I'll pick characters because the characters are weird. The cool ones are Sherlcok Holmes and Dr. Watson. But then you get weird ones that Sherlock Holmes thinks are the suspects.

The first 50 pages are rather boring and unimportant to the rest of the story. The book only starts to get some what interesting after that.

I do not recommend."},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"Perhaps the best known, most adapted, and (bowlerized) of the Conan Doyle Sherlock Holmes stories, this one has it all, and this edition does it justice. You just cannot put it down and it has everything: mystery, horror, even (possibly) a werewolf and a real link to human relationships. Doyle even explores the idea of nature versus nurture and \\"bad blood\\" coming down the aristocratic line along with a cursed house.The movies, and TV shows have gone all over the map with this story, but it is best enjoyed if you can read the original, since no scriptwriter can do justice to Conan Doyle.The final treat to this goodie of a book is an analysis of the book, and the characters and story by famed mystery writer Anne Perry. She writes a lovely, in depth Afterword which gives wonderful insights not only into THE HOUND, but also gives the Anne Perry fan a peek at the mystery writer's viewpoint."},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"This is Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's best-known Sherlock Holmes mystery and, for many, his very best. what I like best about this new edition is that it is set in modern form: much easier to read than older editions that are set in tiny type with inadequate line spacing!

It suffers a little from a lack of Holmes, but is otherwise a tightly-written, solid little mystery.Sir Charles Baskerville was found dead of a heart attack -- apparently killed by a family curse in the shape of a giant dog. So his pal Dr. Mortimer asks Sherlock Holmes to protect Charles' heir, Henry Baskerville, who has just arrived in England to claim his estate and inheritance.But even without Holmes, Watson can tell that something is up -- secretive servants, peculiar neighbors, an escaped criminal, a giant quicksand marsh, and the sounds of a dog howling in the night. But Holmes knows that the curse is no supernatural hound -- and that Sir Henry is in danger from a more real kind of ancient enemy.\\"Hound of the Baskervilles\\" stumbles in one area -- the relative lack of Holmes. He's out of the picture for most of the book, and Watson does plenty of solid detecting on his own. Everybody loves the faithful narrator, but Watson isn't the Great Detective, and the book feels vaguely incomplete without Holmes inspecting clues and giving little hints to Watson.The mystery unfolds at a languid pace, dropping a few red herrings along the way. Doyle pays loving attention to the dangerous, almost surreal Grimpen Mire and the surrounding countryside. But when Holmes comes back onto the scene, the book tightens itself up. All the plot threads rapidly slip into place as the real \\"hound\\" is uncovered.Holmes' steel-trap mind is untarnished here, especially when he reveals what he figured out at the end. He's especially likable in an endearing scene at the beginning, where he educates Watson on deduction. But this is Watson's turn to shine, since he spends a long time gathering clues and even solving a sub-mystery without any assistance.\\"Hound of the Baskervilles\\" is a short, satisfying Holmesian mystery, which is only hampered by Holmes' absence for about half the book. Solid work, and a good introduction to the Holmes series."},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"I'm not a big fan of Sherlock Holmes, but I really enjoyed this one! It was a different style, easier to read and follow."},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"Sherlock Holmes made his debut in \\"A Study in Scarlet\\", a novella first published in 1887. He and his sidekick, Doctor John H Watson, appeared in over fifty mysteries together. \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" is probably the pair's most famous case, and was inspired by a legend about a ghostly hound that haunted Dartmoor. The story was first serialised in the Strand Magazine, with the final instalment appearing in 1902 - and the complete book first appearing that same year.Although Holmes will be seen as the book's hero, it's Watson who tells the story. The pair's involvement with case begins with a visit from Dr James Mortimer - although, initially, he has stopped by only for a little advice. Mortimer has travelled up to London from his home on the edge of Dartmoor. Sir Charles Baskerville, an elderly neighbour of Mortimer's, has recently died and the doctor is in town to meet his successor. However, thanks to a family legend, the details of the death have the whole community panicking. Back in the 1700s, the man who ruled Baskerville Hall - Sir Hugo - was anything but a virtuous man. Having kidnapped the daughter of a neighbouring yeoman - she wouldn't come willingly - he wasn't at all pleased when she later escaped and fled across the moors. In true Monty Burns style, he pledges himself to all that was unholy, unleashes the hounds and sets out after her. Unfortunately, things don't quite go according to plan. While a huge ghostly hound joins the hunt and the girl dies of fear and exhaustion, Sir Hugo also dies and the hound feasts on his throat. Holmes, of course, views this as little more than a fairy tale. However, those who live close to Baskerville Hall are worried that the curse of the Baskervilles has returned. Several have seen a huge black hound on the moors, \\"luminous, ghastly and spectral\\", while Mortimer himself discovered massive paw-prints close to where Sir Charles' body was found. Unlike Hugo, Sir Charles was very highly thought of by all those who knew him. Dr Mortimer is naturally very concerned for Sir Charles' nephew and heir. Sir Henry, the last surviving Baskerville, will very shortly be arriving in London from Canada.Naturally, the bad news keeps coming for Sir Henry. He has barely arrived in London when he receives a mysterious letter warning him to keep away from Baskerville Hall, there's a mysterious bearded man is following his every move, an escaped killer is living rough on the moors and (strangely) someone keeps stealing his boots. Not to be put off, Sir Henry decides to return to the ancestral home - though not without Watson. Holmes, initially, is unable to join them - there are a few cases in London needing his immediate attention. However, he does issue Watson with some very clear instructions on how to proceed.A short and easy read...though not quite as scary or as dramatic as I'd imagined. I'd put this partly down to the \`old fashioned' writing - while it was probably pacey stuff at the time it was written, it's a little stiff and formal by today's standards. I was also a little disappointed with Holmes : while Watson was a likeable character, I couldn't really warm to the great Sherlock. He struck me as an egotistical showman, a little too keen to hog the spotlight. (He practically threw a huff when Mortimer compared him unfavourably to Bertillion). He appeared desperate to deduce everything - whether he needed to or not - so that people could marvel at his incredible intellect. ( I also wondered if he was - at least partly - trying to keep Watson in his place). Still, there isn't too much damage done : Holmes goes missing for a stretch, and that gives Watson - who is much more likeable - the limelight."},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"When I glanced at this book, I thought it would be a typical story, but as soon as I read into it, I was pleasantly surprised how adventurous and quite grusome it was.

As I have no means of comparison, I am not sure whether the style of the novel is consistent or singular in terms of Sherlock Holmes novels and stories, but I was delighted by the narration provided by Dr. Watson. As a narrator, he was faithful and consistent, and Doyle skillfully manipulates the character to both gain the reader's confidence and sense of security, while keeping many important facts close to his chest. Holmes, on the other hand, was detestable. From his very first introduction I felt repulsed by the character. For that reason, I am glad that the narrator was Watson and not the infamous detective himself. In the end, he played a relatively minor role, and the novel itself is very enjoyable."},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"I had not read anything by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle since my high school days, some 35 yrs ago.

He describes Baskerville Hall and the surrounding moor with great detail, creating an eerie and suspenseful setting. The story also moves along at a decent pace, with many tidbits of information at every turn. The wide range of characters, each with their own secrets, or at least suspicious behavior, make for an interesting roster of suspects and possible motives.

Conan DoyleSherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson discuss what can be deduced from a walking stick left behind by a visitor. When the visitor returns he tells of the old legend about the hound of the Baskerville family, and how Sir Charles Baskerville died recently. Dr. James Mortimer found the footprints of a gigantic hound twenty yards from the body! There have been sightings of a huge hound on the moors at night. A new heir, Sir Henry Baskerville, arrives from Canada to take over the Baskerville property; he is the last of the line. Will he meet the same evil fate? Holmes makes an appointment to meet Sir Henry the next day. Holmes peers over the Ordnance map of that area. Has any crime been committed (Chapter 3)? Sir Henry tells of a warning letter sent to his hotel; who knew he was there? Why would anyone steal just one of his new boots? Would anyone follow Sir Henry? Dr. Watson will accompany Sir Henry back to Baskerville Hall; there is less danger in a small village than in London. Dr. Watson must keep his revolver near and never relax his precautions (Chapter 6).The moor country is described as wild and sparsely settled. Dr. Watson reports his observations of the people who meet with Sir Henry. Watson sees the dangers of the great Grimpen Mire when a pony is caught in a bog and killed. There are stone huts from prehistoric man. Watson meets Stapleton the naturalist and then his beautiful sister (who tells him to go back to London). Stapleton had once been a schoolmaster (Chapter 7). Watson sends letters to Holmes in London (Chapter 8). Mr. Frankland has a passion for litigation. He also observes the country with a telescope on his roof. Why was Stapleton so angry (Chapter 9)? What was the secret of the Barrymores? Watson meets Laura Lyons and hears her secret story (Chapter 11). What did she hold back? Mr. Frankland observed the stone huts. Then Watson hears a terrible scream from the moor (Chapter 12). Holmes has the solution to a cold-blooded murder, but lacked definitive proof. Holmes studied the portrait of the wicked Sir Hugo. Then plans are made for the night's activities. Will an unexpected fog create a complication? Holmes, Watson, and Lestrade rescue Sir Henry from a murderous fate. The villain escaped to a hiding place on the moor, but justice wasn't cheated. Chapter 15 ties up the loose ends.This may be the most popular of Doyle's four Holmes novels. It does not involve a religion, a company town, or imperial looting. Did Doyle implicitly criticize a hereditary aristocracy that passed down evils to each generation? The character traits of the villain seem like those in true crime stories. Inheritance through murder has inspired other stories (\\"The List of Adrian Messenger\\"). There is one flaw in this story. How could the purchase of food for a giant hound be kept secret? Sherlock Holmes could question the grocers and butchers in the area to find the owner of that giant hound."},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"I've seen this in several of Kindle's Free Editions, all excerpts are missing!

But here the mood is so well established, and so central to the success of the work, that we barely notice the fact that the murderer's identity is somewhat obvious. The horror of the lonely hills and swamps, and the unknown menace of the hound permeate every chapter of the book, and the general sense of confusion and dread is heightened by the fact that Holmes himself is absent for much of the first half. We can feel Watson's anxiety as he tries to protect Sir Henry Baskerville, and share his relief when the great detective finally re-emerges.Supporting characters like Dr. Mortimer, the Barrymore's, and Stapleton are well drawn, but as usual, the true delight is in the characters of Holmes and Watson, and their interaction with one another."},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"The classic tale of Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson investigating the strange goings-on at Baskerville Hall...and, what's that howling in the distance?

It was very imaginative and certainly a lot better than the stuff being written today. I would highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"Checking out audio versions of Sherlock Holmes stories from the library is as close as you can get to a sure thing, since Arthur Conan Doyle's writing is generally superb even in the lesser tales, and the interplay between Watson and Holmes tends to be more entertaining in audio format. I therefore pounced on this unabridged recording of Hound of the Baskervilles read by David Case when I saw it at the local library.Readers familiar with the Holmes canon are probably familiar with the story, as Holmes is hired to investigate the recent death of his client's uncle at Baskerville Hall, a gloomy old manor on the edge of the moor allegedly haunted by a vicious beast. The very first chapter sets a wonderful tone for the rest of the lengthy story, as Holmes and Watson use logic and a handful of clues to guess the age and employment of a visitor solely by examining the visitor's walking cane, left by accident at Holmes' flat on Baker Street while our hero was away.The mystery at Baskerville Hall is an effective one, putting Holmes and Watson in the path of sneaky butlers, dangerous fugitives and con artists, while being watched and pursued themselves.Although the story is very well-written, I was somewhat taken aback by the strange reading by David Case. His British accents for the characters seemed almost intentionally overblown, as if this whole reading was a Monty Python sketch about haughty British windbags. To his credit he does make each character's voice sound different. For some of the characters, Case resorts to a voice so bizarre it sounded as if he was speaking while inhaling. There is certainly some comic relief to this presentation, and after awhile you forget about the narrative foibles and get wrapped up in the story. I give the recording a lukewarm three stars."},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"The is the first book i read by Doyle and it is truely amazing.

You listen to stories of the notorious hound. Finally, before its too late, decide who is behind the murder of Charles Baskerville.

His absence further underlined the charm of Holmes as the readers would inevitably be constantly and eagerly hoping for his reappearance. Indeed I was overjoyed when Holmes later re-entered the scene.

Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's works are among the best of the genre, and THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES is Doyle's best novel. Those readers expecting to find in this book the famous Holmes line about the dog that didn't bark will be disappointed. That nonbarking dog isn't here. It's in one of the Holmes short stories. What we have here is a moody work set among the moors with a strong and obvious Gothic influence upon Doyle by the mystery genre's founder, Edgar Allan Poe. Holmes and his supporting cast are all in fine form. The plot works, as does the setting and the tone. THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES has endured. It will continue to endure in the future. It is a classic that people actually read."},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"this one is a thriller not that much of suspense but still it forces you not to give it up before finishing it."},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"Probably the best and definately the most famous of the S. Holmes books, aided perhaps through its Gothic overtones, the book is a quick read and has minimal padding unless one compares it to its Noir antecedents. These factors alone make it worthy of a read. But like other works by Doyle, what may be particularly pleasing and illuminating is the light it sheds on late Victorian sensibilities, particularly in areas which are now deemed to be, to put it delicately, highly charged. Craniometry is evidenced throughout (this being the study of the shape of the skull to determine the contents within, which will 'of course' determine the character of the possessor).E.g., upon meeting S. Holmes Dr. Mortimer says, &quot;I had hardly expected so dolichocephalic a skull or such well-marked supra-orbital development. Would you have any objection to my running my finger along your pariental fissure?...I confess that I covet your skull.&quot; (I never expected such an exemplary example of early anthropological practice in Doyle [at the time, anthropologists didn't study the culture of native peoples, they wanted their skulls. Holmes, being interesting, must needs be have an interesting skull].) Likewise the ladder of evolution is applied to races and classes (blacks, the poor, and criminals are presumed to be closer to animals, etc., and 'empirical' evidence proves this). Now I am not faulting C. Doyle for being an avid follower of such theories, despite costs incurred to so-called racial inferiors (e.g., paternalism, racism, and the later Holocaust), but his books give a wonderful slice of late 19th century sensibilities. Those who are historically minded should find Doyle, and this book in particular, to be of extreme interest. In it one can see racial science applied 'rationally' and to effect by its practitioners in good faith and innocence.In sum, the book is entertaining, well written, and most famous. It will be of interest to any interested in crime fiction, mysteries, literary history, &quot;racial-science&quot;, racism, the history of science, and the history of culture and sensibility. &quot;The Hound&quot; is a microcosm of actions and thoughts current at the time of its inception, or better yet if one be as cold-blooded and rational as its protagonist, it is an excellent and entertaining piece of evidence, a Holmesian footprint, that may help explain human history as it travelled to its nadir."},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"I am a committed Sherlockian.

These two novels where enough to get me hooked on the world of Doyle's Holmes. Then to make things even better, I read the \\"adventures of Sherlock Holmes,\\" a collection of short stories, which were excellent, followed by \\"the memoir of Sherlock Holmes\\" which was on the same lines as the adventures, but Sherlock Holmes was finally killed by Moriarty in the last short story of the collection. I was not afraid, because the remaining pages of the collection of stories I had was still thick, so I knew something was going to happen. Sure enough, Sherlock Holmes was resurrected in the next collection (not before \\"the hound of Baskervilles\\", although it is traditionally given before it in the complete works) which was called \\"the return of Sherlock Holmes.\\" Up to this point I was a big fan of Holmes, but this story: \\"the hound of Baskervilles,\\" came to destroy everything.The first aspect I hated about it, was that it wasn't a mystery. It was a quest behind the villain, who was knowen by the middle of the story ... and no wonder, for Doyle wrote this after the acclaimed death of Holmes. He was not ready yet to bring back his detective, and he was actually going to write this story with different characters, until he was struck by Holmes as an already existing character of his, and that he needn't waste his time creating some new character line.The story is not totally bad, but the idea of having Holmes in a non mystery novel did not strike me as plausible.I recommend you to read it.

Sir Charles Baskervilles' nephew, Sir Henry Baskerville, comes to take over his Uncle's estate and business. He tells Holmes and Watson that Sir Charles' death is probably due to the family curse. They learn that the family has been cursed by a mysterious and supernatural black dog, \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\".Holmes and Watson travel to Devonshire to get to the bottom of the case. They collect clues and facts about the mysterious things that have happened on the moor which surrounds Baskerville Hall. In the end, the detectives put all the clues and facts together to solve the case.Sherlock Holmes and Dr.Watson are the main characters in the story. Holmes is the famous detective that lives at 221b Baker Street in London. Watson is Holmes' admiring helper and the story's narrator. Holmes sends Watson to Devonshire to be his eyes and ears and to collect all the clues and facts of the case. In the end, Holmes tells Watson that he had been in Devonshire the whole time. Watson gets upset that Holmes was just using him and didn't trust him to do a good job. Holmes told Watson that he had received all of the notes that Watson had sent him.The mystery of this story is the suspicious death of Sir Charles Baskerville. Holmes and Watson discover lots of smaller mysteries in Devonshire in addition to the main mystery. The missing boot, the escaped convict, a person walking on the moors at night, a howling dog, and the curse of the Baskervilles are all solved in the end.To solve the mystery, Holmes and Watson talk to people around Devonshire and gathered clues and facts. They get some background information about the Baskerville family from Dr. Mortimer and Sir Henry Baskerville. In the end, the world famous Sherlock Holmes, pieces all the information together and solves the case.In my opinion, the book is really good yet confusing.

I really like how they put the clues together at the end."},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"Sir Arthur Conan Doyle has created perhaps the best detective in Sherlock Holmes. \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" is narrated by the faithful Watson, a man of genius not quite on par with that of Holmes, the master mystery solver. Holmes is forever quizzing Watson to see things the way he does, to figure out the mysteries of small things, like a walking stick left behind by a visitor.\\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" tells the story of Henry Baskerville, a man who has inherited his family's home and fortune (as the supposed final heir), but also their apparent curse. His uncle was recently found dead on the grounds of Baskerville Hall, with little explanation for his death. The locals are sure as to the cause; it is the mysterious hell-hound that haunts the moors that was the cause of his death. The local doctor brings the matter to Holmes and Watson and they are charged to protect the young Henry Baskerville from a similar fate, as well as to solve the mystery of the hound.While trying to gather facts for his intrepid employer, the faithful Watson narrates the strange happenings among Sir Henry's neighbors, wanting to add his own theories, but leaving the mystery solving to his much-admired mentor. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle writes a well-paced narrative that builds to a climax that is still exciting even when we know the real mystery behind the hound. At the end, it is Holmes and not his faithful sidekick Watson, who reveals the tricks of his trade and how he solved the mystery that no one ever suspected. Doyle has created a wonderful pair of complementary characters in Holmes and Watson and it is a joy to read their adventures."},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"When I was a kid I used to read about a detective named Encyclopedia Brown.

The story offers suspense and mystery, and challenges you to beat Sherlock to the solution. It challenged me enough that I went out and bought the complete set of Holmes' Stories...and I am gonna figure at least one of them out.I deducted a star simply because I read it in between books like 'Grapes of Wrath', 'Catcher in the Rye', and '1984' which must, necessarily, be rated higher.

Sir Charles Baskerville had recently died of exhaustion after running from the demonic Hound of the Baskervilles, the family curse. While going to claim his inheritance, Sir Henry, the last of the Baskervilles, is warned away from Baskerville Hall by an anonymous note. At any moment, Sir Henry's life might be put into peril by the beast or the culprit behind it, so Dr. Watson accompanies him to Baskerville Hall. Holmes must deduct who is behind these seemingly supernatural occurrences before the hound strikes again."},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"Sherlock Holmes had already been officially killed off by 1902 - but the public was so loud in wanting to hear more stories about him that Sir Doyle relented and wrote a new story. He set it in a real house this time, based on a real legend. This Holmes tale has been voted by many groups as the best of all Holmes stories. Indeed, there are at least 30 different versions of dramatizations of the story.What is interesting is that the story isn't a typical puzzle where Holmes works through the clues one by one while you watch. Instead, we get some brief time with Holmes and Watson at the beginning, as they interact with a Doctor. Then Watson goes off with the Doctor and Sir Henry Baskerville, recently come over from Canada. It turns out Henry is now owner of a manor in the Baskervilles. The family has been under a curse involving a large hound. In fact the reason the home is now his is that his relation was apparently slain by such a hound.So Watson goes along Sir Henry to keep an eye on things, while Holmes sits home. The entire story is told from Watson's point of view, only of Watson's observations. Instead of watching Holmes work, we get more of a \\"storytelling\\" sense here. We hear about the melancholy gloom of the home. We hear often of the quiet loneliness of the moors, with the fog rolling in. It is very much a story of atmosphere, of haunting cries in the night and mysterious faces in the dark.Without giving away the ending, the key to the puzzle is withheld from the audience meaning we aren't allowed to \\"solve\\" the case with Watson or Holmes. This is disappointing - I enjoy mystery stories where I feel I have a chance of reading the clues properly. Also, the key instigator is quite intelligent - but the end aim of these machinations seems rather suspect. In fact, in the story Watson asks Holmes just what the apparent plan was, and Holmes himself says he doesn't quite know. Which is also a bit frustrating.It is rather refreshing to have a top selling book that doesn't involve sex or drugs, although there is of course violence here. There are at least two murders in the course of the story. But the focus is on the fact of the murder and the seeking of justice - not on gory details of the actual scenes.At only 100 or so pages, this is well recommended to anyone who enjoys a good story!"},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"This book was used as an example of English literature of the period in an English Literature class for 8th graders which I teach.

Conan DoyleSherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson discuss what can be deduced from a walking stick left behind by a visitor. When the visitor returns he tells of the old legend about the hound of the Baskerville family, and how Sir Charles Baskerville died recently. Dr. James Mortimer found the footprints of a gigantic hound twenty yards from the body! There have been sightings of a huge hound on the moors at night. A new heir, Sir Henry Baskerville, arrives from Canada to take over the Baskerville property; he is the last of the line. Will he meet the same evil fate? Holmes makes an appointment to meet Sir Henry the next day. Holmes peers over the Ordnance map of that area. Has any crime been committed (Chapter 3)? Sir Henry tells of a warning letter sent to his hotel; who knew he was there? Why would anyone steal just one of his new boots? Would anyone follow Sir Henry? Dr. Watson will accompany Sir Henry back to Baskerville Hall; there is less danger in a small village than in London. Dr. Watson must keep his revolver near and never relax his precautions (Chapter 6).The moor country is described as wild and sparsely settled. Dr. Watson reports his observations of the people who meet with Sir Henry. Watson sees the dangers of the great Grimpen Mire when a pony is caught in a bog and killed. There are stone huts from prehistoric man. Watson meets Stapleton the naturalist and then his beautiful sister (who tells him to go back to London). Stapleton had once been a schoolmaster (Chapter 7). Watson sends letters to Holmes in London (Chapter 8). Mr. Frankland has a passion for litigation. He also observes the country with a telescope on his roof. Why was Stapleton so angry (Chapter 9)? What was the secret of the Barrymores? Watson meets Laura Lyons and hears her secret story (Chapter 11). What did she hold back? Mr. Frankland observed the stone huts. Then Watson hears a terrible scream from the moor (Chapter 12). Holmes has the solution to a cold-blooded murder, but lacked definitive proof. Holmes studied the portrait of the wicked Sir Hugo. Then plans are made for the night's activities. Will an unexpected fog create a complication? Holmes, Watson, and Lestrade rescue Sir Henry from a murderous fate. The villain escaped to a hiding place on the moor, but justice wasn't cheated. Chapter 15 ties up the loose ends.This may be the most popular of Doyle's four Holmes novels. It does not involve a religion, a company town, or imperial looting. Did Doyle implicitly criticize a hereditary aristocracy that passed down evils to each generation? The character traits of the villain seem like those in true crime stories. Inheritance through murder has inspired other stories (\\"The List of Adrian Messenger\\"). There is one flaw in this story. How could the purchase of food for a giant hound be kept secret? Sherlock Holmes could question the grocers and butchers in the area to find the owner of that giant hound."},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"Sherlock Holmes, just the mere mention of his name strikes fear into the hearts of criminals, but what is especially great about this book, is that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle doesn't let the reader know that Holmes is in the book until the end portion. What that does for the reader which I enjoyed a lot, was that it let the reader try to figure the mystery instead of with the help of a detective extraordinaire.The mystery begins in London in 1989 with Holmes and Watson examining a cane. From the very beginning, it is easy to understand that Watson is no skilled detective but is a dramatic foil for Holmes, meaning he outlines Holmes' character by being his opposite. While inspecting the cane, a man named Mortimer walks in and makes it known to Holmes' and Watson about the Baskerville curse. The curse came about when Hugo Baskerville, an ancestor to Sir Henry made a deal with the Devil to let him find a girl he fell in love with. The girl had run away, and when he went to look for her in the moor, both he and the girl were found dead. The next heir to his estate, Charles, was also killed from the monstrous hound, leaving only one heir left, Henry. Holmes gives the case to Watson and tells Watson to update him frequently. As Watson watches over Sir Henry, he gains information slowly about the people living in Baskerville Hall, one couple the Barrymores, provided some suspicion, with their late night endeavors with someone out over the moor. Another couple, the Stapeltons, who were brother and sister, was also considered to have ties to the death of Charles and to the demon hound. An escaped convict also plays an important role in the mystery as to giving Watson and Holmes some clues about the murders. At what appears to be the climax, Holmes reveals to Watson that he has been on the case and at Baskerville Hall, in Devonshire, the entire time. He also shatters all of Watson's theories about the case and tells Watson who the real culprit is. But the story is not over yet, as Holmes, Watson, and Sir Henry devise a plan to capture the culprit in the act, but a thick fog throws a monkey wrench into the plan and results in Sir Henry's encounter with the glowing, fire-breathing cursed hound of the Baskervilles.Overall, I enjoyed the book very much, and this is saying much since I hate to read. What I especially liked about the book is the fact that Doyle threw so many possible suspects into the plot, but only one of them had anything to do with the mystery. That coupled with the fact that Watson, a mediocre detective, was on the case lets the readers logically run through the possibilities instead having Sherlock Holmes just give the answer away. The plot was developed very well with many cliffhangers which kept me wanting to read more. All in all, the only thing I didn't like about the book was the fact that the murderer was given away well before the end of the book. This was done at the time Sherlock Holmes was reintroduced. But Doyle well more than made up for it, by adding an intense finish to the book that kept me guessing as to the outcome. This book was definitely written to appease to the desires of those who enjoy murder mysteries and for those who like to be able to solve the case based on gathering information and putting it back together to form a logical explanation of the events."},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"Hound of the Baskervilles by Arthur Conan Doyle is a great and easy read for anyone who likes mystery books. This book is another case of death or murder investigated and solved by Sherlock Holmes and his partner Dr. Watson. The book begins and ends in London in Sherlock Holmes&#65533; office, but the rest of the book mostly takes place in Devonshire at Baskerville Hall. It is a race to solve the mystery of the death of Sir Charles Baskerville before it&#65533;s too late and before the same thing happens to Sir Henry Baskerville, Sir Charles&#65533; nephew who is the next to take over Baskerville Hall.In the first few chapters, the author catches your attention by explaining &#65533;The Curse of the Baskervilles&#65533; and why it is believed that every member of the Baskerville family has died the same way and by the same curse. The curse is well explained and it makes you wonder if it could be true or false. As the book goes on and Holmes and Watson are getting closer and closer to solving the mystery, there are a few unexpected encounters and events that are also unexplained. These events make it a bit more difficult to figure out the mystery, but they keep your attention and make you want to read on and find out what might happen next.Not all the characters are what they seem to be, which allows for a few surprises along the way of solving the mystery. New events and people come up in every chapter making you want to learn more and solve the mystery. Holmes and Watson are a great team and although people try to get in their way, they always stay right on track until the end.Hound of the Baskervilles is an awesome mystery book in my opinion. I liked everything about it, especially that it always kept my attention with the new and unexpected twists. It&#65533;s easy to understand and not too long of a book either. The characters are well explained in their roles throughout the book so you&#65533;re never confused about who&#65533;s who. The author puts some twists in the novel to try to shy you away from the real murderer, but they don&#65533;t stop Holmes and Watson from figuring it out. As the book goes on, it gets better and better as you get closer to solving the mystery. You&#65533;ll have to read the book to find out what &#65533;The Curse of the Baskervilles&#65533; is and what really happened to Sir Charles Baskerville.

It is the first Holmes novel I read as a child, and the combination of ancient curse, foreboding moor, and modern danger kept me turning the pages.&quot;The Hound&quot; is unique among the Holmes novels because for a large part of the mystery, Holmes' character is offstage, appearing only at the last moment to bring events to a hair-raising denouement.Holmes is a brilliant but eccentric detective. Sometimes his personality quirks lead him into danger. Holmes is both tenacious and audacious, and the interplay of those two qualities almost bring him to grief. He loves to hold his cards close to his vest, and sometimes excludes others from information vital to their safety. He also loves to engineer dramatic climaxes to highlight his deductive powers. Holmes' joint penchants for secrecy and sensation almost gets his client killed, but all's well that ends well.The Dover Thrift Edition offers quality entertainment at a rock bottom price. Inexpensive, but definitely not cheap."},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"I'd be happy to argue the point, but it seems to me that the four greatest fictional characters of all time (excluding Don Quijote, who's in a league of his own) are : Frankenstein's monster, Dracula, Sherlock Holmes, and Tarzan. There are certainly no other characters who are so familiar, so often revived in plays, movies, song, television, and books, nor so often parodied and imitated as they. Take a look at your TV Guide and there'll be a movie featuring at least one of the four on the air at some point this week. They are all still just as popular as the day their authors introduced them. The reason for this is, first of all that they are simply brilliant creations, but secondly that they each in their own way tap into very powerful human fears and aspirations. Frankenstein's monster and Dracula represent victory over mortality. Tarzan represents victory over Nature. Sherlock Holmes represents the ultimate and inevitable triumph of reason over the mysteries of human behavior.Of this quartet, it is Holmes, because he is the most realistic character and because his victory seems closest to our grasp, who resonates most deeply with us. Realistically, none of us expect to gain eternal life nor to be plopped down in the jungle unexpectedly, but there's a sense in Holmes that, for all his genius, he is really just using the brain power that all of us share better than the rest of us do. As he tells Watson here, after one of his those classic moments where the good Doctor is stunned by one of Holmes's analyses :The world is full of obvious things, which nobody by any chance ever observes.Nobody that is except the world's greatest detective. But the idea that things are just waiting to be observed, and the simplicity of Holmes observations, serves to foster the illusion that the mysterious will yield to our intellect should we merely apply rigorous reason. For all his foibles and quirks, it is this that makes Sherlock Holmes an aspirational figure.Holmes and Watson are so familiar to us as to need no further exposition. Suffice it to say that this quintessential novel features many of the elements that made the series immortal : inexplicable doings at stately manor houses, chases across the moors, pea soup fogs, beautiful damsels in distress, and the like. And if the villain is not the equal of Dr. Moriarity (then again, who is ?), surely this tantalizing intoduction to the mystery is as enticing as any ever committed to paper :&quot;On the night of Sir Charles's death Barrymore the butler who made the discovery, sent Perkins the groom on horseback to me, and as I was sitting up late I was able to reach Baskerville Hall within an hour of the event. I checked and corroborated all the facts which were mentioned at the inquest. I followed the footsteps down the yew alley, I saw the spot at the moor-gate where he seemed to have waited, I remarked the change in the shape of the prints after that point, I noted that there were no other footsteps save those of Barrymore on the soft gravel, and finally I carefully examined the body, which had not been touched until my arrival. Sir Charles lay on his face, his arms out, his fingers dug into the ground, and his features convulsed with some strong emotion to such an extent that I could hardly have sworn to his identity. TheFe was certainly no physical injury of any kind. But one false statement was made by Barrymore at the inquest. He said that there were no traces upon the ground round the body. He did not observe any. But I did -- some little distance off, but fresh and clear.&quot;&quot;Footprints?&quot;&quot;Footprints. &quot;&quot;A man's or a woman's?&quot;Dr. Mortimer looked strangely at us for an instant, and his voice sank almost to a whisper as he answered:&quot;Mr. Holmes, they were the footprints of a gigantic hound!&quot;The reader, if he exists, who doesn't yearn to discover the secret of this gigantic hound may as well give up reading.GRADE : A+"},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"this was one of shelocks best books. this book was suspenceful,exicting, mysterious and shocking. in this book all kind of things happen,i mean think about it ok, your in 1814 and your dad has been atacked by a \\"hell hound\\" so you think his son has just enherited his mancion and his money. she he calls sherlock holmes to find out what happend to his father, and as he gets to start looking around the place he finds that the father had another son but did not knew about it. this son was even living on the property, and this son was the killer becuse he whanted to have the manchion. the conflict is great, we have person vs.person, person vs.nature, person vs.animal. this was a great book just to read, allways had surprises and suspence, it was a great mystery."},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"This is really good book I reccomend it: Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson wait inside.

It suffers a little from a lack of Holmes, but is otherwise a tightly-written, solid little mystery.Sir Charles Baskerville was found dead of a heart attack -- apparently killed by a family curse in the shape of a giant dog. So his pal Dr. Mortimer asks Sherlock Holmes to protect Charles' heir, Henry Baskerville, who has just arrived in England to claim his estate and inheritance.But even without Holmes, Watson can tell that something is up -- secretive servants, peculiar neighbors, an escaped criminal, a giant quicksand marsh, and the sounds of a dog howling in the night. But Holmes knows that the curse is no supernatural hound -- and that Sir Henry is in danger from a more real kind of ancient enemy.\\"Hound of the Baskervilles\\" stumbles in one area -- the relative lack of Holmes. He's out of the picture for most of the book, and Watson does plenty of solid detecting on his own. Everybody loves the faithful narrator, but Watson isn't the Great Detective, and the book feels vaguely incomplete without Holmes inspecting clues and giving little hints to Watson.The mystery unfolds at a languid pace, dropping a few red herrings along the way. Doyle pays loving attention to the dangerous, almost surreal Grimpen Mire and the surrounding countryside. But when Holmes comes back onto the scene, the book tightens itself up.

I was pleasantly surprised, I ended up finishing it in one sitting because it was so exciting. The story centers around a curse haunting an ancient family on the moor, which involves a spooky black hound and plenty of strange people.While others might complain about the time Doyle spends on the setting, I thought it added greatly to the spookiness. It takes place on the moor, which is a dreary enough place already, but Doyle adds in other details that give the moor as sinister quality. Now that I have read other Sherlock stories I can see that none of them devote as much time to the setting, but the setting here is also an important part of the story.The thing that many readers will find strange is the actual absence of Sherlock Holmes himself from much of the story, with Watson narrating and doing much of the investigating. However, I thought this added even more mysteriousness to the story, as there is an entire piece missing until you catch up with Sherlock. There are plenty of other good characters in this story as well, something missing from short stories that tend to focus solely on Holmes and Watson.This is a great introduction to Sherlock Holmes, as well as an exciting story. Of course the language can be archaic and the story is complex, but it's not anything anyone older than 12 can't handle. If you like Hound of the Baskervilles, you'll also enjoy any of the Holmes short stories too"},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"All indented quotes are missing.

For anyone who's never read Sherlock Holmes and is afraid they won't understand the language (the thought I had before I actually read one), it's actually very easy to understand (I didn't realize it's actually written in pretty understandable English). There's plenty of dialogue that moves you through the story rather quickly and it's not boring in any way. There are some funny parts, and you'll have fun trying to figure out the mystery."},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"Although I haven't read many Sherlock Holmes stories, I have enjoyed every single one. This book was no exception, although I did find it to be riddled with many unanswered questions at the end of the story that I don't find to be normally present in other Sherlock Holmes stories. Despite these, though, I thoroughly enjoyed the suspense that this book offered, and I was honestly on the edge of my seat almost the entire way through.Story/Plot - Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson are visited by a doctor, who brings them a curious case. His patient and friend Sir Charles Baskervilles has been found dead outside his manor, supposedly the victim of a heart attack. The spooky part arrives when it is said that near his dead body are the footprints of a hound, which is the animal rumored to hunt down and kill all Baskervilles. As Sir Charles's nephew comes to take possession of the manor, it is up to Holmes and Watson to keep him from the same fate.Writing Style - It couldn't be a Sir Arthur Conan Doyle story and not be written fantastically. The story flows almost perfectly, and the details are developed well. The characters are portrayed very nicely, and they're are just the right amount of them: not so many that it's confusing, not so few that it's boring. The perspective changes slightly a few times; you start with Watson's first person narrative, then move to his letter to Holmes, then move to his diary entry, then back to his narrative; it never gets confusing, though.The major complaint that I have with the book is just that by the end there are a lot of questions unanswered. To make it worse, the questions are usually pointed out in the story sometime and not just randomly minute details. However, none of the detract from the novel enough to ruin the story, just enough to leave the reader wanting a few more answers.Warnings - Mild Horror, ViolenceOverall - Despite the unanswered questions at the end of the book, I have absolutely no other complaints about this spectacular story. It's a little darker than Holmes stories usually are, I dare say, but it shouldn't scare older kids. It truly is a classic novel that I would recommend all readers read at some point."},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"Despite being written in 1902, this is immensely fresh and readable mystery. Sherlock Holmes and his offsider Dr Watson are investigating the mysterious death of Sir Charles Baskerville. It appears that he may have fallen victim to a family curse: a ghostly hound that lurks in the nearby moor at night. Holmes and Dr Watson need to solve the mystery and in doing so protect Sir Charles's heir, Sir Henry Baskerville.The book has a terrific gothic atmosphere. There is the dark and near empty Baskerville Hall, eerie lights and sounds coming from the moor, anonymous letters of warning to Sir Henry, an escaped murderer on the loose, secretive locals and a general feeling of menace. The mystery has a number of strands with plenty of twists and red herrings along the way. Great fun.I recommend the Aladdin classics version of this book. It includes an introduction and a reading group guide, and the font is a very nice size."},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"My problem isn't with the story, it's with this copy. If the character is reading something, you aren't. Every single time the author says that someone is reading something, it immediately cuts ahead to when they put the document away.

In this novel Holmes is called from London to consider the death of Charles Baskerville, apparantly by a crazed and superhuman dog. Reports have come from the manor of a ghostly, dog-like creature that haunts the hills. When Charles's heir arrives to take up residence at Baskerville Hall, Holmes is convinced that the young Baskerville's life is in danger. Watson takes up residence at Baskerville Hall to watch out for Henry Baskerville's safety. When Watson notices strange things happening in the moors, the reader starts to wonder if, in fact, there is something supernatural haunting the moors.The Hound of the Baskervilles is certainly an engaging read. I stayed up late to finish it, and I can imagine that reading it in serials would create great anticipation for the next installment.The one shortfall I found was in my ability to visualize the scenery. I'm not entirely familiar with Dartmoor, and it was difficult sometimes to understand the placement of Baskerville Hall and the surrounding terrain.

Perhaps this is because of its ingenious plot premise. In this story, the famous deductive detective and his friend Dr. Watson are called upon to investigate at Baskerville Hall, a remote country mansion where the new heir to the property fears for his life. Apparently an old family legend has come true, and a horrible hound who haunts the moors is thought responsible for the deaths of the previous landowners. I know of no more chillingly atmospheric and mysterious setups for a mystery than this one. Unfortunately, large portions of the book feature yawning gaps in which Holmes himself does not appear, and we are forced to subsist on less interesting characters. Still, it *is* a Holmes story (fans of Holmes were delighted when this novel first appeared, since it was the first new Holmes story in some years, the author having previously killed off his famous hero in \\"The Final Problem\\") and the mystery is a good one, featuring red herrings, suspicious goings-on, and clever sleuthing by the great detective.

Afraid to have this radient doing of murder happened with the next generation of Baskervilles going up to \\"the throne\\" a man calles Sherlock Holmes,who has been a character misplaced in cinema very badly through the years, comes into the dark scene. In the original books he is of logic being, running around the dreary streets of London, searching for the killer or criminal who had so changed so many lives. What he really is searching for is a piece of himself. For he is made up of cunning villians ready to be discovered. Logically, with him comes along the affectionote character of Dr. Watson.Succesfuly tricking Dr. Watson and making him come to the conclusion that he is investigating the deadly moor alone, they go of to investigate. The investigation seems to be much more sinister than expected as it opens new secrets. Though very exciting and methodical, I must complain ( as I always do) that however exciting it may be , Doyle is a genuis only in his genre. The artistic flow of workes of genuis is not quite apparent in the books. So, we must dig in hopes of finding new discoveries in the verges of this novel. the comfort comes from knocking on Sherlock Holmes door and hearing the vivid knock... the knock of being alive and well.The knock.. of mystery calling us."},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"In phycological flotsam and jetsam, the murderer usually screams in awe. He has been found , he yells in despair. What marks quite an innocent human being marks a deadly mistake to be born in a true mystery. And so it is on Baker Street everyday as Dr. Watson, his loyal \\" follower\\" portrays and writes about him like noone can. For he sees him as a pure genuis of state of mind. He sees him as purely logical, a person that nothing can be tricked. And just to know that there is a fictional character like this makes us keep reading this startling adventure. There is a so called curse upon the Baskervilles and as a new Baskerville has come into the picture, his friends wants to be insured that he is not harmed. For one time, for once and for all they expect to solve this deadly mystery.. Here comes the mind of Sherlock Holmes. Kind but simultanously crude. Lovable but impossible. He thinks in puffs of his pipe. As he pretends to be engaged in another matter ( which is very typical of Holmes) he sends Dr. Watson to investigate. The sparkiling chilling descriptions of Baskervilles mansion and the mysterious moor add some artistic matter to the old victorian style of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Just like his character he had created, Doyle writes punctiouly and strongly into one direction. This makes us think: Is this real lituruture. We decide yes ofcourse in the end. Here, there is no need to think or decide this. For, it is already clear. Watson meete very suspiciouse characters such as Stapleton and an old retired proffesor. These dialouges also add magic to this already quite worthy mystery. But what many people don't see in Doyle's work is the phycologicaly circumstances. The fright of Stapleton, for example or how neatly Holmes traces his thoughts. We must look at these not just a s a mystery but as a true book.After reading, it seems as if there is no point.

Henry could hear the hound in the distance, so he started to run. Holmes and Watson started to run after the hound and Henry. The hound gained on Sir Henry and knocked him over, and started to maul Sir Henry. Holmes, pistol handy, shot the hound many times. Sir Henry went into shock, and slowly overcame it, with some brandy that helped. When Watson found Holmes on the tor, in the darkness, amid their conversation, they heard the hound that had gotten loose and was chasing someone. Holmes and Watson tried to run in the direction of the howls, and heard someone fall over. They went over to the body, face down, and saw that it was Sir Henry. They started crying, until Holmes realized that the body had a beard, and Sir Henry doesn't have one. They roll the body over, and find out that the body is Selden, the fugitive.This book was very educating. In the beginning, when Watson and Holmes were looking at Dr. Mortimer's walking stick, I wouldn't have thought that the bite marks on the stick were a dog\`s, let alone a specific dog. When Holmes and Watson were following Dr. Mortimer and Sir Henry, and the taxi that was also following them, raced away and Holmes got the cab number that fast, I would have never thought that someone was following Sir Henry because they knew where he was staying. Lastly, when Watson asked Holmes who took care of the hound while the Stapletons were watching Sir Henry in London, Holmes anwsered, with ease, that since Roger Baskerville lived in South America and had a child there, the \\"Stapletons\\" lived in South America, and they came to London, they also brought their servant, Anthony, who was long gone to South America with his payings the Stapletons paid him to helpthem, and Anthony comes from Antonio, which is of South American decent. I would have never thought that the butler was involved.This book was good because it had a good plot. When Sir Henry's boot was stolen you wondered why would someone would want to steal only one boot, only to be replaced and have one of the old boots stolen. You didn't know that it would be used for scent, until all was revealed in the end. I wondered why the barrymores were introduced. That was because they were to introduce Selden to be used as a decoy, because Holmes, Watson, and Stapleton thought that Selden was Sir Henry laying there dead. when Sir Henry and Ms. Stapleton were strolling and Stapleton ran up fussedat Ms. Stapleton and yelled at Sir Henry, you wondered why he was overacting over his sister. later you find out that Ms. Stapleton is Stapleton's wife, but that act of stupidity tipped off Holmes and Watson off.This book is a timeless classic that generations will share together.B. Rimando"},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"I chose this book because it was recommended to me as a good mystery.This book is about a murder case that is publicly disguised as a supernatural curse. The curse is based on the history of the Baskerville family. Hugo Baskerville, who was very wealthy, was mysteriously murdered by a supposed hound that killed him because he was taking advantage of a neighbors daughter. After that incident, the hound haunted the family. After the death of Sir Charles Baskerville in the same way, Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson investigate to keep Sir Henry Baskerville safe, who will be moving into the family estate. Originally, all signs lead to the Barrymores, who would have gained some inheritance after CHarles' death.This was one of the few books that I enjoyed. It was the first real mystery book that I've ever read, and it was interesting to read. It never really got boring, and it also was a believable story. I don't like many stories where the plot has too much supernatural stuff and I just don't fall for it. I don't regret reading it."},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"There are few better detectives in fiction than Sherlock Holmes. And there is no Holmes novel better than \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles.\\" Granted, Doyle may have been at his best when penning his short stories, but of his four novels starring Holmes, \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" is easily his best, and arguably among the best-ever novel-length murder mysteries. Published in 1902, Holmes wrote \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" after he had published his first two collections of short stories, and when his pen was producing Sherlock Holmes at his best.The adventure starts when Sir Charles Baskerville, owner of the Baskerville mansion, meets an untimely death from a heart attack, apparently the result of his terror while faced with a huge hound. An old Baskerville family legend testified to a supernatural and ghostly hound that tormented the family, and Charles' death appears to confirm local gossip that the hound is alive and roaming the moors. When Sir Charles' only living relative and heir of his fortune, Sir Henry Baskerville, arrives at Baskerville Hall, his life too appears to be threatened. Who is following him, who is stealing his boots, and who is the author of a warning note? To protect Sir Henry and unravel the mystery, Dr. James Mortimer, friend of the late Sir Charles, obtains the involvement of Holmes and his loyal sidekick Dr. Watson. While he does not expressly discount supernatural involvement, Holmes uses the ruthless application of logic and reason to find the real solution to the mystery.The plot thickens as an escaped convict hiding on the moor joins the action. Homes must uncover the masks behind a cast of mysterious characters, including the caretakers Mr. & Mrs Barrymore, the amateur astronomer Mr. Frankland and his daughter Laura Lyons, and the botanist Jack Stapleton and his sister Beryl. With the appropriately chilling and melodromatic setting of the gloomy moor, the action increases with a thrilling finale, as Holmes uses Sir Henry himself as bait to bring the criminal out of hiding, and reveal the mystery behind the supernatural hound from hell. And after the excitement of the climax dies down, we are given the pleasure of sitting down with the great detective, as he explains everything in his usual way with cold calculated logic.What makes \\"The Hound of the Baskerviles\\" work so well is the combination of all these elements. The eerie setting, superb characterization, and a well-paced narrative plot, are gift-wrapped with the logical deductions that are the hallmark of a typical Sherlock story. But unlike some of the Holmes short stories, the novel length of \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" allows room for traditional murder mystery thrills and spine-tingling suspense before the illuminating deductions of Holmes that his fans expect and love. For once, the logic and persona of the great detective is overshadowed by a suspenseful plot. This is a murder-mystery classic, and if there is one Doyle novel that Sherlock Holmes fans should read, it's undoubtedly this one. -GODLY GADFLY"},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"The image of Sherlock Holmes in 'The Hound of the Baskervilles' is perhaps the most enduring image we have of him. You see, an Inverness cloak and deerstalker cap are inappropriate wardrobe for the town, and belong in the country. Sherlock Holmes is predominantly a city dweller and city investigator; it is relatively uncommon that he treks out on adventures, but the case of the mysterious death of Sir Charles Baskerville and the attempted murder of Sir Henry Baskerville led him to the Dartmoor plain. Thus, country garb was in order. This is where we get much of our imagery.Also helping with this is that every major actor to play Holmes has considered 'Hound of the Baskervilles' to be the ultimate Holmes story to act -- rather like the Hamlet of Conan Doyle's work. Holmes was a popular film icon, and in the early decades of the twentieth century several dozen films were made of Holmes, but the first after these many films to be set in Victorian times (and not be updated for the screen) was a version of Hound. Ellie Norwood, Basil Rathbone, Peter Cushing, Jeremy Brett -- many distinguished actors have considered this among their greatest roles.Watson dates the case to 1889, but various reading authorities, knowing the good doctor's occasional attempts to distort details to protect the privacy of the innocent, have dated this to between 1886 and 1900.In fact, the novel appeared in serialised form in the Strand magazine, the great first-publication site of most Holmesian tales, between August 1901 and April 1902, after Conan Doyle had attempted to kill off the great detective in the short story The Final Problem, which showcased Holmes' battle with Moriarity, the Napoleon of Crime. In fact, Conan Doyle came to dislike the character of Holmes because it was a distraction to his other pursuits.So, bowing to public pressure, Conan Doyle penned Hound of the Baskervilles to placate the public demand for more stories, but took care to place it before the death of Holmes, in the hopes that he could leave the detective safely dead (if not buried). Such was not to be, and we find a few years later that in fact Conan Doyle 'resurrects' Holmes in a rather ingenious fashion.But, on to the story at hand. Holmes and Watson, at home at 221b Baker Street, are approached by a Dr. James Mortimer regarding the death of Sir Charles Baskerville and a family curse which involved evil forces in the form of a satanic hound. Mortimer is concerned for the safety of the new proprietor of the family lands, freshly arriving from Canada, who had a new boot stolen, then an old boot stolen, in his hotel in London. Later Holmes would put together the significance of this seeming strange minor act (no, I won't tell you).Holmes sends Baskerville and Watson together to the country estate while he tends things in London on another case. In reality, Holmes is setting Watson up as a diversion, while he investigates the moor and the surroundings of the Baskerville estate under cover. Life at the estate is a bit strained, given the murder, an attempted murder, a curse, and all. The neighbours seem nice enough, though. Or are they? Watson picks up on curious little details of their relationship, which he reports back in written notes to Holmes (which have been redirected to his moor outpost).Eventually Holmes reveals himself to Watson, and then to Baskerville, and the chase is on in earnest, to discover the reality of the mysterious creature each have seen or heard. In good mystery fashion, we come across long lost relatives and an inheritance to be had; we find plots and subplots muddied by superstitious belief and fear, on a mysterious plain in southwestern England.All the elements combined that are now considered standard bits for a well-done country English mystery. But the mystery does not stop merely with the story. In true mystery fashion, appearing in the Daily Express edition of March 16, 1959, there were doubts cast upon the authorship of Hound of the Baskervilles. The one who carried the dispute was named none other than Baskerville, Harry Baskerville. He credited the story to one Fletcher Robinson, who died (perhaps of the Egyptian mummy's curse) at age 35 shortly after the publication of Hound. With his death, only Baskerville remembered the issue of co-authorship. Baskerville claims it was Robinson who 'borrowed' the Baskerville name.One of Conan Doyle's heirs, Adrian Conan Doyle, heatedly denied involvement of Robinson past possible 'conversations' that might have taken place between Arthur Conan Doyle and Robinson. But, he did not deny Conan Doyle's possible 'inspiration' from Robinson.One Baker Street Irregular (an exclusive club of Holmesian experts) was doing a monograph on this issue as well, claiming that the reason why Holmes appears so infrequently is due to the fact that he had to be written in to an otherwise essentially completed story. This Irregular travelled to meet with Baskerville, and hinted at discoveries he had found. But alas, the Irregular died three weeks later in America, his monograph never published and his notes were never found. Perhaps a dog ate the homework? A mysterious hound, perhaps?"},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"OK, the hype on this famous and classic book is huge.

Throughout the book, the neighbors, the townspeople, an escaped convict and are all suspects.While not a large book, the Hound of the Baskervilles does trudge along at some points. The someone antiquated language aside, it does delve into more detail and much more build up than a typical Holmes' short story does. So while in a short story, the mystery would be solved in minutes, in this book, the mystery takes a while to come forth. For example, in the beginning there is a mysterious person in a stagecoach following the heir. The mystery is only solved at the end, but with all the other events that took place, the reader has already lost interest in that particular person. I personally forgot about it, thus it did not intrigue me at all.Also, in much of this book, Holmes is not even present. The wit and mystery are substituted with settings and descriptions instead, not Doyle's strongest points.While a classic mystery which is still good, it can come out as somewhat unsatisfying."},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"I received myKindle 3G Wireless Reading Device, Free 3G + Wi-Fi, 3G Works Globally, Graphite, 6\\" Display with New E Ink Pearl Technologyaround December 22nd.

The formatting was HORRENDOUS. I downloaded a few samples, and exchanged for a better interactive table of Contents. Even for only .99 cents (I'm willing to pay a little for well formatted public domain books), I want to be able to enjoy the transcripts.I have since learned the value of downloading samples where available. It saves you money, and/or reading free non-classics that you might not like.

History, however, awards its literary plaudits to the good doctor for his immortal literary detective Sherlock Holmes and his bumbling sidekick Dr. John H. Watson. Doyle wrote 54 Holmes short stories and four novellas on the most famous consulting detective in all of world literature.The Hound of the Baskervilles was published in serial parts in the Strand Magazine from August 1901 through April 1902. It is his most famous work worthy of its acclaimThe story involves Herny Baskerville who has inherited a large fortune and vast estate in Dorset. His friend Dr. Mortimer visits Holmes and Watson at 221B Baker Street to tell them that Baskerville is frightened of a huge fiendish hound said to roam over Grimpen moor. Ever since one of Henry's ancestors was killed by a large dog following a maiden's seduction it is believed that the Baskerville's are cursed by the fiendish monster mongrel.Holmes and Watson arrive in Dartmoor to investigate. while Holmes returns to London it is left to Dr. Watson to record the happenings at Baskerville Hall. Doyle has Watson speak through a journal he keeps while a guest of Sir. The plot is gothic horror, suspense fiction and love story all entwined in a delicious plot. There is even quicksand to trap hapless victims of Grimpen. The scenes remind one of the Wasteland imagery of a TS Eliot who was enamored of this great story. Freudian and psychological interpreters have had a field day with this one!There are many interesting characters in the case. Selden an escaped convict from the nearby prison; Stapleton the lover of butterflys and his supposed sister Beryl. Murder occurs as the savage beast is on the prowl. The mysterey is intricately plotted and there are many surprises. One of life's joys is to read this novella for the first time! Doyle is a master of evoking a chilly, creepy atmosphere filled with fog, rain and fear on the prowl. The novella is superior to any film version ever made of this classic workDoyle was an Edwardian gentleman who loved nature, spiritualism and hiking. He also was an excellent stylist who will keep your interest as Holmes unweaves the complex tale. The Hound of the Baskervilles is masterful, suspensful and worthy of your time.

I thought this because you had to use your imagination-the thought of an actual living beast that kills people. It had some surprising turns which I thought made the book even better. What I liked alot was how detailed the author was in writing the story. He would be so descriptive in the writing of this book, that you could even imagine it in your own head! When I was reading this book, I thought to myself, a doctor-trying to find out who killed a person close to me, and then finding out that it was a beast ! This book was an amaxing book, and I think that people who like suspense should read it. Many stories don't always include explicit descriptions, as well as the moods of mystery and horror. I definitely would read this book again, and recommend it to others.

This story is primarily set on the moors of Devon in England, the perfect backdrop for a creepy legend.I have to admit that I was a little disappointed with this story from Arthur Conan Doyle. As a lover of mysteries, I had been looking forward to reading a Sherlock Holmes story. But Holmes was absent from most of this book as Watson is on his own for a good portion of it.The Kindle version that I had was also missing some pertinent parts of the story, which I had to look up online to not be completely lost. And while the mystery they were solving was hardly over exciting, it was still a very enjoyable read with plenty of twists and turns to the plot."},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"He has many followers. From Marple to Millhone, from Rebus to Rockford, from Scarpetta to the Scooby Gang. When it comes to the sciences of investigation, detection and deduction, Sherlock Holmes is the original, and still the best.In 'The Hound of the Baskervilles,' we see the reason for this - both in his unforgettable presence, and his unfortunate absence.We see in the first few pages how the presence of Holmes drives the story forward, unrelentingly and entertainingly, as Holmes poses his cohort Dr. Watson with a question about an old cane left mysteriously in their Baker Street home office. Watson deduces an answer that delights Holmes - because it is \\"almost wholly wrong\\" - but pushed Holmes' own thoughts in the right direction. This is the epitome of Holmes as a character, like a Dr. House for the 19th Century: intelligent, cunning, excitable, egotistical, funny, determined, stubborn, with just enough mean spirit to keep it interesting.Arthur Conan Doyle brings all these traits to bear in the mystery that unfolds from the old cane in the office - the fearful hound that seems to be hunting the Baskerville clan to extinction. Starting with the old family legend of Hugo Baskerville but straight into Holmes' present-day with the recent death of Sir Charles Baskerville under mysterious circumstances. The ancient hound is still said to be prowling the moor, and Sir Charles has seemingly died of pure terror, leaving Henry Baskerville the last surviving heir. Holmes' task is to solve the mystery of the hound and keep Henry alive, the tale of which is, as always told to us through the eyes and ears of Dr. Watson, Holmes' constant companion.Which brings us to the only problem with 'Hound of the Baskervilles.' For a time, about the middle third of the book, Holmes is absent from the story, and we are left to the narrative of Watson's own investigations into the matter. Watson is a fine and intelligent man, but he lacks the personality and ingenuity of Holmes. Simply put, without Sherlock Holmes front and center, the driving force and much of the fun of the story are gone with him. These chapters seem to drag slowly compared to to Holmes' breakneck pace. This uneven pacing is an unfortunate flaw in an otherwise flawless story.But when Holmes makes his surprising return to the tale, he takes off at a gallop and never slows down until the end, leaving the reader gasping to catch up. The satisfying conclusion makes up considerably for the slower middle.Truly, Doyle's tales of mystery are as much about the character of Sherlock Holmes as they are about his cases. He exerts his presence and his influence throughout the book, and steals the stage with every quip. As we see in 'Hound of the Baskervilles,' without him, it's just a mystery. But with Holmes at the helm, it's more.With Sherlock Holmes, it's an adventure."},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"This version is missing text.

Do you love a good mystery once in a while, which will leave you guessing right until the end? If so, The Hound of the Baskervilles by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was made for you. Written in 1910, for a century this book has been the rave for thrill and mystery seekers all over the world.The Hound of the Baskervilles is a novel dealing with a centuries old legend of a \\"Hell-Hound\\" lurking in the town of Devonshire located in southern England. When Dr. Watson and his accomplice Sherlock Holmes get wind of a murder taken place they are instantaneously intrigued and immediately devote their time into the inves-tigation. Sir Charles Baskerville died from unexplained causes with no trace but a sin-gle foot prints from \\"a hound as big as a large lioness\\". From the outset, Dr. Watson is hot on the trail of the hound and planning to send the legend home with its tail be-tween its legs. But then as in all good stories there is a plot twist where all of yours and their assumptions are proven wrong.I would recommend this book to anyone with a strong reading capability and a love for a mystery because I thoroughly enjoyed it and I would bet my bottom dollar that you will too. So if I can give any advice it would be for you to read this and you will like it.If anyone asked me I would above all else recommend this book with a slight warning. You need to be a strong reader to tackle this book for it is not written in a modern context for after all it is a flat century old. This book however is a must read. There are parts about this book that you are so enthralled and mortified while your heart is beating a triathlon and your instincts say to put the book down but you just can't muster the strength. At one point in the book where a stranger meets an un-fortunate demise it is especially exuberating."},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"Interesting from the first page. There's already a mystery to be solved right when you open the book, with a mysterious cane left in Watson and Sherlock's office.Doyle keeps each page filled with suspense and thrills. Even as I read, I could hear the low, mournful sound of the hound that Stapleton keeps locked up baying across the moor.The characters are amazing and funny. Sherlock Holmes keeps me giggling with all of his oddities and eccentrities. Watson is amusing with his normal assumptions next to Sherlock.The mystery is intriguing and darker and deeper than it first appears. The book can actually be rather creepy and suspenseful, unlike the other mystery novels where they're solving the typical robbery, or something like that.The only thing that I didn't like as much compared to other authors I've read was that his sense of description wasn't as good. I had to rely more on my imagination to see the moors as he described it rather than what it really looked like.Yet in spite of that, the novel was comedy, mystery, and a pinch of horror all rolled into one delicious enchilada"},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"It wouldn't be right to say much about the plot of a detective murder mystery. So I won't. The short, non-spoiler synopsis is: Holmes and Watson solve the crime behind the mysterious death of a man with the surname Baskervilles, circumstances being complicated by a curse. The characters were well-developed, descriptions good, plot non-figure-out-able. I'd only take issue with statements that seem true, but turn out to false or vice-versa. Then again, I guess that the way it goes the genre.This being my first Sherlock Holmes story, I was surprised to learn that this particular book is (p vii) \\"the most popular Holmes story and perhaps Doyle's most acclaimed work.\\" Also interesting is the fact that (p vi, vii) Doyle killed off Holmes (in a book published in 1894), but brought him back for this book, published in 1901. Although a helpful explanatory Notes section was provided to clarify some of the terminology, the book was, in general, a short, easy, enjoyable read.

Not deluxe, but worth the low price."},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"The Hound of the Baskervilles deserves its recognition for a number of reasons. Not only was it the first Sherlock Holmes story to be released in the 20th Century but it was the first story that seemingly endeavoured into the world of the supernatural which would challenge Holmes' idea of rational existence. This story has also spawned many film adaptations but none of which match up to the spectacular story telling ability of Conan Doyle and the gripping nature of the plot told in its literary form. This has become my favourite of the Holmes novels simply for the way in which the case being explored is introduced and the twists which allow it to reach its conclusion.The plot focuses around the death of Sir Charles Baskerville in the county of Devon. His heir, Sir Henry Baskerville is forced to travel from Canada to claim his fortune but first he is introduced to Holmes & Watson by Sir Charles' friend Dr. Mortimer. Dr. Mortimer is convinced the death of Sir Charles was caused by the legendary Baskervilles curse which has been killing the Baskerville heirs for centuries. The myth focuses around Sir Hugo Baskerville who lived during the time of Oliver Cromwell. The curse arose through revenge of Sir Hugo's misdeeds and has haunted the family ever since. The body of Sir Charles is found with no visible wounds so it is determined that Sir Charles died of pure fright and an obscure footprint of some form of hound a distance from the body only seeks to enforce the myth of the demonic beast.Told in the third person once again from the perspective of Dr. Watson the story gives a whole new importance to Holmes' accomplice as Watson is sent off to Devon as the protector for the heir to Sir Charles' fortune and fellow investigator whilst Holmes stays in London to commit to another crime. This time spent away from the Holmes character gave me a broader appreciation for the importance of Watson and it certainly does appear, from reading previous stories, the Watsons skills of observation have improved thanks to the time spent with his companion in solving crime. Two chapters specifically are written in the context of letters to Holmes and again gave diversity to the writing of Conan Doyle which makes the situations all the more realistic.The setting of Dartmoor and the descriptions of the Baskerville Manor are detailed and easy to imagine in their own right. The imagery of the Grimpen Mire is especially intriguing and the inspiration for the Grimpen Mire is certainly a place I would like to see. The characters aside from the main protagonists are interesting in their own quirks and presence and their importance or lack thereof still add equally to that of the overall story. The legend of the hound itself is an excellent way of challenging Holmes' overall mentality as he first dismisses the myth as nonsense but as more and more evidence piles up in support of the myth it becomes interesting to see the character come to terms that some form of demonic hound may actually exist. It is a stunning story and a worthy addition to the Holmes universe."},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"I concur with previous reviews.

It is superb."},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"The Baskerville family had a myth that haunted them for ages. When it finally comes true, Mr. Sherlock Holmes must come to the rescue. The Baskerville myth of a dog that kills all descendants of the Baskervilles at night on the moor has haunted the family for ages. So, when Sir Charles Baskerville is found dead on the moor, everyone assumes it was the hound. Sir Henry, who is Sir Charles' nephew, comes and inherits the estate with Holmes closely watching. Sir Henry meets the Stapletons, a young couple that are his closest neighbors, and begins to fall in love with Ms. Stapleton. Holmes puts Sir Henry's life at stake at the end of the book, and they catch the culprit in the act. This book is an excellent read that would be the perfect story to read when you can't decide between a mystery and an adventure.This book is an example of how much Sherlock Holmes cares about other people's feelings. When Holmes sent Watson with Sir Henry to inherit the estate , he didn't tell Watson that he would follow to make sure everything was OK, which made Watson feel betrayed and not trusted. Holmes also told Watson that Cartwright had supplied all of his needs for him, which made Watson even more upset. At the end of this story, Holmes puts Sir Henry's life on the line when he lets the hound jump on Sir Henry before he kills it, petrifying Sir Henry with fear.The antagonist is really good at disguising himself in this book. He outsmarts Sherlock Holmes in London with a full black beard, and calling himself Sherlock Homes. The Antagonist also befriends the Baskervilles so that they would never suspect him as the culprit. His plans are very smart, from bribing Sir Charles out of his house to attempting to kill Sir Henry the way back from a friendly dinner.This book has many adventures. Sir Henry and Dr. Mortiemier get dogged in London, Watson and Sir Henry chase an escaped convict, and Sir Henry almost gets eaten by a huge hound.This is the perfect book for any day. It is suspensful, exiting, and it puts you on the edge of your seat. This book deserves a five star rating!"},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"With echoes of Edgar Allan Poe, this 1902 novel continues to delight mystery-lovers. Elegantly written in formal prose, the story focuses on the moor surrounding the ancestral home of Sir Henry Baskerville, an American who has inherited it upon the mysterious death of his uncle Charles. The moor is so treacherous that no one dares venture upon it at night-one step off the path, and the mire will swallow the unfortunate victim.Family legend says that a sadistic Baskerville from the eighteenth century once loosed a huge and ferocious dog in pursuit of a woman who had escaped his clutches, and that she had died of fright when she heard the dog panting behind her on the moor. The lecherous Baskerville, in pursuit, had had his throat torn out by this \\"dog from hell.\\" The ghostly dog can still be heard howling on the moors, and many believe it was the dog which caused the elderly Sir Charles Baskerville to have his fatal heart attack.In classically Gothic style, the novel features mysterious cries from the moor, foggy nights, an escaped prisoner, signals by candlelight, a butler who knows more than he says, a beautiful woman with a mysterious past, a small boy who carries messages, and someone who spies on the dark and isolated Baskerville Hall. Sherlock Holmes plays a lesser role in this story than he does in most others, remaining in London while Dr. Watson accompanies Sir Henry to his estate as an observer and protector.Holmes, of course, is operating behind the scenes, learning about the activities at Baskerville Hall through the daily accounts which Watson sends him (and which reveal much of the action to the reader). By no means the bumbling character which films have portrayed, Watson offers sensible advice to Sir Henry and shows a keen eye for details of interest to Holmes.Though the prose is often \\"purple\\" with melodrama and overwrought description, this contributes to the fun of the novel, providing a dramatic counterweight to the extreme logic of Sherlock Holmes, whose late appearance in the novel comes as a carefully timed surprise. The story is intriguing, the mysteries are well developed, the atmosphere is suitably spooky, and the resolution, though not really surprising, is appropriate. Even if the story had not been made into a memorable film with Basil Rathbone, The Hound of the Baskervilles would still be justly famous as Conan Doyle's best developed mystery, a genuine classic of the genre.

I was SO wrong! I finished the book in a period of less than 24 hours!!! This is an absolutely fabulous book! Doyle's use of language is masterful, and you are swept away to the moor with its swamps, jagged cliffs, and massive hills. I can honestly say I was quite spooked as I was reading some of it at night!Since this is the first novel I have ever read by Doyle, I didn't know what to expect. But the twists in the plot and the constant itching to know what was going to happen next had me hooked!I watched the 1959 movie after reading this, and I have to say it was a disgrace. I don't know if I would be happy seeing any of the versions, only because I don't know if any of them could even compare to the rich world and language used by Doyle to transport you to Devonshire!!

But the story is unreadable without the missing text."},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"When Henry Baskerville, the last remaining scion of the family, travels from Canada to England to take up residence in Baskerville Hall after the puzzling violent death of his uncle, Sir Charles, he is immediately greeted with a string of baffling mysteries not the least of which is the legend of an enormous hound residing on the moors in Devon. Dr James Mortimer, family friend to the Baskervilles, engages Holmes and Watson to advise and protect Henry and to resolve the issue of the hound's existence once and for all. Not one to believe in supernatural phantoms such as this spectral hound from hell endowed with \\"blazing eyes and dripping jaws\\", Holmes dispatches Watson to scout out the terrain and place the neighbouring residents under the proverbial magnifying glass - Stapleton, the accomplished entomologist and his beautiful sister, Beryl, who attempts to warn off Henry from taking up residence in the hall; Frankland, a crotchety busybody with a telescope and his troubled daughter, Laura Lyons, recovering from an ill-advised marriage; and the Barrymores, long time butler and housekeeper to the Baskerville family, who are clearly carrying a disturbing secret of their own.True to the well-established paradigm of the Holmes canon, Doyle allows Watson to tell the tale with a deliciously full serving of speculation, theorizing based on \\"incomplete data\\", emotion, gentlemanly bravado, flowery Victorian atmosphere, elegant dialogue, and extensive detail on the routine of daily living at the turn of the century such as communicating by telegram and traveling by coach. His development of the bleak, dark, gloomy atmosphere of the moor is masterful:\\"Over the green squares of the fields and the low curve of a wood there rose in the distance a grey, melancholy hill, with a strange jagged summit, dim and vague in the distance, like some fantastic landscape in a dream.\\"An easy one evening read over the comfortable space of a couple of hours, The Hound of the Baskervilles moves swiftly from the traditional cozy opening of Holmes' Baker Street digs to a resounding climax that is packed with more excitement and action than almost any other story in the entire Holmes litany. Two thumbs up and a five star recommendation to readers of all ages!Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"\\"Hound of the Baskervilles\\" is a unique story in the Sherlock Holmes canon -- author Arthur Conan Doyle wrote it in the years between Holmes' death and his resurrection several years later.But due to public pressure, Doyle brought Holmes and Watson back temporarily for a sort of \\"memoir\\" tale, a tale of supernatural curses, escaped convicts and ghastly glowing hounds. It suffers a little from a lack of Holmes, but is otherwise a tightly-written, solid little mystery.Sir Charles Baskerville was found dead of a heart attack -- apparently killed by a family curse in the shape of a giant dog. So his pal Dr. Mortimer asks Sherlock Holmes to protect Charles' heir, Henry Baskerville, who has just arrived in England to claim his estate and inheritance.But even without Holmes, Watson can tell that something is up -- secretive servants, peculiar neighbors, an escaped criminal, a giant quicksand marsh, and the sounds of a dog howling in the night. But Holmes knows that the curse is no supernatural hound -- and that Sir Henry is in danger from a more real kind of ancient enemy.\\"Hound of the Baskervilles\\" stumbles in one area -- the relative lack of Holmes. He's out of the picture for most of the book, and Watson does plenty of solid detecting on his own. Everybody loves the faithful narrator, but Watson isn't the Great Detective, and the book feels vaguely incomplete without Holmes inspecting clues and giving little hints to Watson.The mystery unfolds at a languid pace, dropping a few red herrings along the way. Doyle pays loving attention to the dangerous, almost surreal Grimpen Mire and the surrounding countryside. But when Holmes comes back onto the scene, the book tightens itself up. All the plot threads rapidly slip into place as the real \\"hound\\" is uncovered.Holmes' steel-trap mind is untarnished here, especially when he reveals what he figured out at the end. He's especially likable in an endearing scene at the beginning, where he educates Watson on deduction. But this is Watson's turn to shine, since he spends a long time gathering clues and even solving a sub-mystery without any assistance.\\"Hound of the Baskervilles\\" is a short, satisfying Holmesian mystery, which is only hampered by Holmes' absence for about half the book. Solid work, and a good introduction to the Holmes series."},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"Some proclaim Doyle's greatest work to be \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles.\\" And, it may be just that.Set on a British estate, mixing science fictional accounts with old wive's tales and mythology, it is not a standard tale of urban sleuthing. This involves Holmes outside of London, and working with the \\"plebians\\" or \\"ordinary people\\" in his mission to save \\"Sir Henry\\" from encountering the same fate as his uncle Sir Charles Baskerville.There are tales of adultery, slanting lies and rendevous at late hours of the night in the moor which flanks the estate of Sir Henry. The evenings overlooking the moor are often disturbed by the noisy backdrop of a hound howling, but not the sound of a hound ever heard by anyone before.The moor is dangerously dotted with mires in which a step could mean one's end. Muddy and deep, the step into such places becomes a trap for the unwary. Hence, the moor includes dangers beyond its sounds, it is a place where young and old should avoid unless they know which places are safe and which are not.An entomologist named Stapleton knows the moor inside and out. He befriends Sir Henry and Watson. He cannot meet Sherlock Holmes who must stay in London for other cases. This story follows the day-to-day discoveries of Watson, more than others.In the end, the intertwining of evil that haunts the people in the tiny hamlet becomes staggering and one must wonder - could a village of such small size really have so many people within it keeping such deadly secrets without one of the others (if not all of the others) knowing? Probably not. But, who cares.And, I lastly note that Doyle certainly was more than a mystery writer. His prose rivals Forster or Waugh. For instance, he wrote:\\"We looked back on it now; the slanting rays of a low sun turning the streams into threads of gold and glowing on the red earth new turned by the plough and the broad tangle of the woodlands.. . Now and then we passed a moorland cottage, walled and roofed with stone, with no creeper to break its harsh outline. Suddenly we looked down into a cuplike depression, patched with stunted oaks and firs which had been twisted and bent by the fury of years of storm.\\"With prose like that, you only conclude: This is more than a mystery novel."},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"This edition is missing THE main plot of the story.

This isn't even a good deal for free!"},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"Dr. Mortimer appears at 221B Baker Street to elicit the help of the famous Sherlock Holmes. Sir Charles Baskerville is dead, and it is supposed that he died because of a curse on the family. Now, Sir Henry Baskerville is ready to take over for his grandfather, only will he soon suffer the same curse?I've only had the chance to read one other Sherlock Holmes story--a short story, whose name I've long forgotten, where the clever use of a carriage came into play (by the way, that was one of the only stories I read in high school that I really liked). My book club chose this small read for the holiday season and I was pumped, but also nervous. Writings from this era tend to be heavy, very reliant on wordy prose. Could I penetrate the words, figure out the meaning AND finish this deceptively slim book in time for book club?Surprisingly, yes. I was pleased to see that the prose wasn't a cripple to the novel. The pace is brisk, yet still somehow descriptive. Sure, there are words that are used oddly to modern readers, a bit of the sentence structure that is odd, but of all the older novels, this is one of the most understandable to the modern reader. Plus, the atmosphere is truly creepy, causing more than a few shivers when I tried to sleep at night.Mysteries tend to focus on the, duh, mystery. Who did it and how, and can our clever detective figure it out? There isn't much of an emphasis on character (although for serial mysteries, a detective figure that is interesting and hopefully changing is a big plus--look at Cornwell's, Grafton's, Patterson's, or any other mystery authors' main character). So I was somewhat expecting the characters--minus perhaps Holmes and Watson--to be boring. Again, I was proven wrong. Watson, who I thought would be stupid and boring, was actually really clever (though not as clever as Holmes, of course) and very interesting. Dr. Mortimer was a nice guy; Sir Henry young and spry; even the ladies weren't stereotypical wimps. The baddie wasn't stupidly cliched.As for the mystery itself...it is good. Not great, but good. There is no pulling the bad guy out of thin air, the mystery follows a logical course. The problem? I was expecting more (bad thing, I know). I kinda wanted Holmes to be more clever, to reveal the bad guy with some sort of ultimate clever plan that would make me gasp and be in shock that I totally missed whodunnit. But I, sometimes the most dense of readers, was able to clearly see who it was by the final pages. And having Holmes recap was unnecessary. Sure, it tied up some details (such as who was stalking them, who cut out the message, etc.), but overall, it pretty much told me everything I had learned earlier.So I know I probably came in with unrealistic expectations, but I won't let that drag down my overall opinion. This was an interesting, engaging novel, and I truly was interested in solving the mystery. I definitely recommend.Brought to you by:*C.S.

Doyle Sherlock Holmes stories (that I have read so far). This is a great read around Halloween-time as it combines some of the most creative mystery fiction with elements of a horror novel. Usually I can get a pretty good idea about what is going on in a Sherlock Holmes story/novel...but this one had me guessing the truth until the very end. The story essentially surrounds the mysterious death of one of the last remaining Baskervilles and the spectral hound that is supposedly a curse on the entire family. If I have a complaint about this story it is that the ending was somewhat anti-climactic. But the journey to get there more than makes up for the somewhat vanilla ending."},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"If Sherlock Holmes is one of those books I would read over and over again, I would be darned, that's what I would say to myself some 10 years ago.

The guy was an expert at crime science, he smoke crack, had an actual doctor as a sidekick, and he never miss the beat of criminal intent.

He also had a very large egos, and a very inciting house. He incite criminals, must have raise their IQs by a couple thousands of degrees celsius and made himself a target. He was inconceivably strong willed too, for the author to write him such. I am guessing that is why Sir Conan Doyle never made Watson the main character and scrap him to be the criminal solver. He chose to be a guy who knowingly and willfully his own life to extend those of his client. Is that what it means to be every body's favorite person.

I really enjoyed this book. I started out with several short stories featuring Sherlock Holmes, found them fascinating, and read this. I wasn't disappointed. The book is rather short so it kind of still keeps that short story feel. It also has the horrid skill of making the reader almost sick with the unknown. When I read this, I wanted it to end more than most other books I've read just to find out what was going on. Also, as a horror fan, I can definitely say that this book has horror elements in it. Some scenes are damn creepy and all scenes are completely necessary with no slow or dull moments to let you lose that building tention. Brilliantly told and a book that is a classic to me. And, in the end, there is always an explanation to satisfy the reader and this is a good one indeed."},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"This book was a real mystery.

The novel opens with Dr. Mortimer, friend of the family, relating a strange legend to Sherlock Holmes which supposedly explains the curse placed on the Baskerville family. When the authorities find both Hugo Baskerville and the maiden dead, there is said to have been an enormous, supernatural hound at both of their sides. Thus begins the curse. Now, recently, Sir Charles Baskerville has been found dead under suspicious circumstances, and it is up to Sherlock Holmes to solve this puzzle. Ignoring a mysterious plea to stay away from the estate, the new heir Henry Baskerville, along with Watson and others head to Baskerville Hall.One enjoyable part about reading The Hound of the Baskervilles is not only trying to solve the central mystery--the cause of Charles' death--but the many other smaller mysteries that surface once Watson and Sir Henry reach the Baskerville residence. There are several suspicious individuals that are encountered, and Watson is always looking over his shoulder with the feeling that something is watching over him. Doyle\`s use of the moors as a backdrop create the mysterious, almost unearthly feel goes right along with strange happenings and the curse of the hound. We have the odd sounds, a dangerous criminal on the loose, people creeping out at all hours, and a general gloom that pervades the landscape. Holmes has quite a job on his hands in this case, and needs his trusty sidekick Watson to help.One problem some readers have with The Hound of the Baskervilles is the curve balls thrown at them in the form of red herrings to get them off the scent of the crime. I can forgive Doyle for this; his writing makes up for it. He has an impeccable way of getting into character's heads, examining motives, and putting the pieces together.Sir Arthur Conan Doyle treats us to a compelling and clever Victorian mystery, with well-timed suspense and build up to the resolution, engaging action, and fantastic pacing of events. I also really enjoyed the portions of the narrative from Watson's point of view; he really holds his own in this mystery, having a prominent role in the case and keeps the story engaging. Doyle's mystery finishes with a clincher that unravels nicely.The Hound of the Baskervilles is definitely a treat of a mystery, one Sherlock Holmes' fans should enjoy."},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"Before there was CSI and the magic of solving a crime in less than 60 minutes we had Sherlock Holmes.

I picked up this book because I like to inject classic pieces into my reading and this had been recommended to me.This did not disappoint! Although very short - just over 200 pages - this novel has a huge impact. I would say this novel is closer to a thriller/mystery, and it includes a cast of potential villains or heroes, a creepy moor, a spooky house, a mysterious curse, and an overall gothic feel. Even though the language is formal, it is easy to feel engaged and the action sweeps the reader into it.There is an absence of Holmes, which I was not expecting, but it makes his appearances in the book all the more intriguing. I had always thought the character of Dr. Watson was more of a foil or a prop, but he plays a very central figure here and that was interesting.What I truly appreciated in this work is that it is a thinking person's mystery. I usually avoid mysteries, especially modern mysteries, because they aren't challenging and I usually solve them partway through the book. This novel allowed for clues to be given, almost like a puzzle, to be thought over and contemplated. I very much enjoyed that.I can now say that I look forward to enjoying more Sherlock Holmes mysteries! I'm eager to find out how the short stories compare to the novel."},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"Published in the beginning of the XX Century, \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" was a huge hit. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was virtually pressed to write it, because there was so much demand for the character. And even \`under pressure' he managed to write a very interesting novel, that has became timely and has entertained readers for over a hundred years.Narrated by Sherlock Holmes's best friend, Mr Watson, \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" is pretty much what its title says. For years a curse frightened the Baskerville family with a huge and deadly hound. Most believe this is a supernatural event, related to the forces of evil. Holmes, on the other hand, who is a very scientific and logic man, refuses to believe in this explanation. At least, until all the logical possibilities are ruled out.The device of picking Dr Watson -- who is an everyman -- as narrator serves to makes us feel closer to the brilliant Holmes. Not only are the readers connected with Watson by his narration, but, mostly because we tend to have the same common sense analyzes of the situation. Therefore, the detective has the advantage of bringing a different light to a problem. Doyle always provides him with more information than we have. It is a kind of cheat, because sometimes Holmes is not really cleverer -- just more informed. But, the book is so much fun that readers don't really mind being deceived. Moreover, Holmes has a huge ego and it makes him even more fun.One major conflict guides the novel: the battle between \`Natural x Supernatural'. Dr Mortimer, the person who tells Holmes and Watson the hound curse, believe that this is a supernatural affair. However, to the detective the story points to the logical. Holmes personifies the intellectual faith in logic. Given Arthur Conan Doyle beliefs --his faith in spiritualism -- it seems to be contradictory to create such a character that believes so much in logic. Holmes seems to be more related to the writer's scientific training than to what he believes. Much of Conan Doyle's prose depicts the turn of the century society in which he lived.Probably the device that Conan Doyle best exploited was the red herring -- which is very common in mystery and detective stories. In that, sometimes there is a very easy explanation at hand and the writer kind of guides us to believe in it. In \\"The Hound of Baskervilles\\", the writer created a very believable red herring. We are fooled and we like it."},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"This classic work creates amazement to those lucky enough to hear it...One man handles a full stage of characters with style and panache..This is a true Holmes and Watson that makes the great work live like never before-- A must to all lovers of Doyles favorite.."},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"[This is a review of the Dover thrift Edition of 'The Hound of the Baskervilles'] Dover Thrift Editions have done a lot to get me to read great literature: classic lit at an *incredibly* affordable price (at the time I'm writing this review the book retails for a *buck fifty*...even if it goes up, that's still one of the best book values you'll ever find!).Dover's no-frills approach (generic jackets, inexpensive paper) belies the classic range of their thrift editions, and this is one of my favorites: Conan Doyle's best-known Sherlock Holmes adventure, genuinely chilling and moody. If you haven't read it in a long while, you might have forgotten how well-drawn and detailed this is. Conan Doyle's characters, dialogue, cliffhangers (Chapter Two's end is, in my opinion, one of English lit's best example of suspenseful cliffhangers that will have you flipping the page), setting and the suspenseful climax have made this a mystery classic for over a hundred years. If you're familiar only with Nigel Bruce's humorous but bumbling portrayal of Doctor Watson, you'll enjoy the *true* Watson of the novel...intelligent man of action, trusted by Holmes to investigate the scene ahead of him.The price makes this an excellent gift (aw, at this price, go ahead and pick them up a few more Dover Thrift editions, including 'Six Great Sherlock Holmes Stories') or a great book to take on a trip (at this price, you can afford to give it away to a fellow traveler when you've finished)."},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"This is a great story, but as others have already noted, this Kindle version is missing numerous passages.

This may be attributed to the fact that it was written as a serial and makes effective use of cliffhangers and foreshadowing to keep the reader engaged.Sherlock Holmes himself is an interesting character. His ego is enormous and his humor, combined with his condescending attitude, was somewhat of a shock to the stuffy analytical character I expected. He was of course methodical and calculating, but would also be inclined to hop \\"himself up on coffee and consume an incredible amount of tobacco\\". Watson, who does the heavy lifting of the pair, has to put up with Holmes' attitude which creates an interesting dynamic. The reader would not have been surprised if Watson suddenly decided to throttle Holmes if he didn't admire him so much. Holmes \\"...loved to dominate and surprise...I had often suffered under it...\\" says Watson at one point.In the age of CSI and Patricia Cornwell, the mystery itself (that revolves around a curse upon the Baskerville family who are haunted by a supernatural beast living in the bogs by their estate) is not as entertaining as it once must have been, but the narrative unfolded nicely, the characters were fun (and still fresh) and the ending was resolved nicely. I found the mystery to be smart and fun to read, with great use of settings to create an effective mood. I expect I will need to spend more time with Holmes and Watson in the future."},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"'The Hound of the Baskervilles' is truly a Holmes classic. It is testament to Arthur Conan Doyle's immense talent as a writer, that the desolation and solitude of the moors are every bit as entrancing a century after they were written about as they were in his day.It is in the full length novel format that the characters of Holmes and Watson come into their own. The briefer stories can be exciting but their length and pace doesn't allow the characters to get into their full stride. Here the writing style is as methodical and effective as the musings of the great detective himself.A great swathe of this book is the reports of Watson who has been left to his own devices by Holmes. However the main player's absence does nothing to diminish the novel's impacte. The bleak aspect of the Devon countryside allied to the intricate and bizarre relationships of its residents fuse to make this outing of Holmes a memorable one. Both the surroundings and the vivid descriptions of the hound itself, combine to draw the reader in, in a way that few novels can.'The Hound of the Baskervilles' is widely beleived to be one of the greatest of the Sherlock Holmes oeuvre, and indeed the intricacy of the plot development, along with an excellent climax put this novel up there with the best of them."},{"Title":"Hound of the Baskervilles (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"A classic of the mystery genre.

It suffers a little from a lack of Holmes, but is otherwise a tightly-written, solid little mystery.Sir Charles Baskerville was found dead of a heart attack -- apparently killed by a family curse in the shape of a giant dog. So his pal Dr. Mortimer asks Sherlock Holmes to protect Charles' heir, Henry Baskerville, who has just arrived in England to claim his estate and inheritance.But even without Holmes, Watson can tell that something is up -- secretive servants, peculiar neighbors, an escaped criminal, a giant quicksand marsh, and the sounds of a dog howling in the night. But Holmes knows that the curse is no supernatural hound -- and that Sir Henry is in danger from a more real kind of ancient enemy.\\"Hound of the Baskervilles\\" stumbles in one area -- the relative lack of Holmes. He's out of the picture for most of the book, and Watson does plenty of solid detecting on his own. Everybody loves the faithful narrator, but Watson isn't the Great Detective, and the book feels vaguely incomplete without Holmes inspecting clues and giving little hints to Watson.The mystery unfolds at a languid pace, dropping a few red herrings along the way. Doyle pays loving attention to the dangerous, almost surreal Grimpen Mire and the surrounding countryside. But when Holmes comes back onto the scene, the book tightens itself up. All the plot threads rapidly slip into place as the real \\"hound\\" is uncovered.Holmes' steel-trap mind is untarnished here, especially when he reveals what he figured out at the end. He's especially likable in an endearing scene at the beginning, where he educates Watson on deduction. But this is Watson's turn to shine, since he spends a long time gathering clues and even solving a sub-mystery without any assistance.\\"Hound of the Baskervilles\\" is a short, satisfying Holmesian mystery, which is only hampered by Holmes' absence for about half the book.

I read it completely, despite the painfully boring flatness of the prose itself. It might be useful for a psychologist trying to understand a patient in an unpleasant love affair: ah yes, now you're at Stage 2, subdivision 3, section 1a. Imagine a mechanical drawing, say, an exploded diagram of a pencil sharpener.. why not call it a work of art? Glorious detail, exact descriptions, complete and entire... But it's not a work of art creatively. To say that Svevo is a bridge between George Eliot and James Joyce misses totally the art of the language itself created by those two."},{"Title":"As A Man Grows Older (Sun and Moon Classics)","review":"I understand the concern with finding a correct translation of Senilit&agrave;, but I do not share the opinion that it is a huge problem that the Beryl de Zoete version is translated a bit more \\"freely.\\" I am writing this after having studied Svevo in the United States and in Italy and having read it in Italian at least three times and in the de Zoete translation twice. This may not make me more of an authority but hopefully will temper the following comments:Essentially, the problem with translating Italo Svevo's work (if it is a problem) is that it was already been translated once from Austrian German thoughts (Svevo was born Hector Schmitz in Trieste, an Austro-Hungarian port city) into Italian. When you read Senilit&agrave; (or its forerunner, Una vita - which is painful to read) you get an idea of how hypercorrect Svevo's writing was. This was not by accident, but rather through his desire to write perfectly in Italian. While this makes it an exceptionally easy read in Italian, if you translated it too closely, it would read more like Hemingway than anything else. In translations, I like the de Zoete translation (Bantam Modern Classics) because it is a little more fluid.On to the merits of the book, whatever the translation or title, it is a masterpiece of Italian decadentism. The protagonist, Emilio Brentani is the last member of a dying family who must find a way to keep it going. He is getting on in years (which I guess early in the 20th century was mid-30s) and this is his last opportunity to do it. The book traces his battle with Angiolina, who is more element of nature than human, and the story takes him through a vortice vitale (the vortex of his life) into old age.He carries out this battle against the background of caring for his sick sister Amalia and taking lessons from his libertine friend and sculptor Stefano Balli as they walk along behind the dog catcher. The time frame is Carnevale, the period before la Quaresima (Lent). The basic story is of his farewell to meat (so to speak) before the long fast that concludes his life.I think this book makes a great introduction to Svevo and the svevian concept of \\"inept\\" man, and it is more focused than La coscienza di Zeno. I give it the thumbs-up."},{"Title":"As A Man Grows Older (Sun and Moon Classics)","review":"I don't think Svevo is an artist that can be ruined or even significantly damaged by a translation, any more than Tolstoy can be messed up by Constance Garnett - it may not be as true to the quality of their prose, but for the most part I think their rare value is communicated as long as the translation is accurate: and this one is. The comparison to Tolstoy is apt, because I think Svevo is sort of a bridge between that tradition and Proust, where the writing starts drawing a great deal more attention to itself - and the internal workings of consciousness come to the forefront.Svevo strikes the perfect balance between the 19th century's skill at construction complete characters (well, at least the Russians and George Eliot) and the 20th century's desire to focus intensely on processes of thinking, to lay bare the way they function. What Joyce did by actually splitting up and writing Bloom's individual thoughts, Svevo accomplishes with sentences that have the precision and wit of a French aphorist, while retaining a level of compassion that can coexist with his irony.I remember a passage in The Confessions of Zeno (I read the Zoete translation on that one too) where, after a hilarious sequence when Zeno ends up marrying a woman that he has no interest in marrying, he comes to realize - many years later - just how much he's come to love her. Svevo is, I think, the most warm-hearted of great 20th century writers, even though all of his books are supposed to be merciless unmaskings of ineffectual men.As much as I loved The Confessions (or Conscience) of Zeno, this is the more complete work of art. The five linked stories in Zeno didn't really cohere (especially the last chapter), but this book is beautifully paced and constructed, the work of a young man who is already a master - funny and sad and wonderful. A book to treasure.(Incidentally: I like Joyce's title, As a Man Grows Older, but it would have been nice to have Svevo's original title back - which was only abandoned because they didn't think anyone would buy a book called Senility - certainly very few people bought Senilita when it was in Italian. And people were, understandably, confused, since there's no one in this book who is old, or any discussion in it of aging or senility.But the whole book is filled with an atmosphere of last things: it is also about virility, and the lack of it, and the desire to both have and get away from the mental clarity that comes with intelligence. Senility: a great writer knows how to come up with a great title. But this is still a lovely book in a beautiful edition: another wonderful reissue from NYRB.)"},{"Title":"As A Man Grows Older (Sun and Moon Classics)","review":"But by about a quarter of the way through this novel, I realized that I was mesmerized by it. Emilio's obsession with Angiolina is less long-winded than Proust's obsession with Albertine, but the two stories have much in common. They both are about men involved with women from a slightly lower rung of the social caste system. Both women are inveterate liars and both men are adept at fooling themselves. Both stories employ a mixture of emotion and irony. I thought Beryl deZoerte's translation was serviceable and unobtrusive, which is what a good translation should be. I'm sure that it's missing a lot of the subtleties of Italian, but that's something one has to deal with in any translation. The flow of the words seemed natural and I didn't detect any Britishisms.Svevo is quite adept had economically drawing fully realized characters who have the power to engage the emotions. Emilio (the man in younger middle-age who naively thinks he'll have a painless romantic fling), his spinster sister Amalia (whose silent suffering is almost unbearable), his artist friend Balli who does not see his own foolishness and Angiolina, the object of his obsession are all riveting characters. I quote my favorite passage in the book:\\"She [Angiolina] lied obstinately, though she had not really mastered the art of lying. It was easy to make her contradict herself. But when the contradiction had been proved she would return with unruffled brow to her previous assertion, for in her heart of heats she did not really believe in logic. And it was perhaps this simplicity of hers which redeemed her in Emilio's sight.\\"AS A MAN GROWS OLDER is ultimately unexpectedly powerful. This is another outstanding novel I'd especially recommend to older readers. I think younger people can enjoy the book but it will mean more to the over-40 reader."},{"Title":"As A Man Grows Older (Sun and Moon Classics)","review":"Readers should be aware that this translation, by Beryl de Zoete, is much older, freer, and less accurate than the newer one, published by Yale Nota Bene, translated by Beth Archer Brombert as &quot;Emilio's Carnival.&quot; Don't be fooled by the classy NYRB edition; the usually impeccable editors of that series have passed this &quot;vintage&quot; translation into print with nary a warning. Of course, older translations may be your thing (they're certainly mine much of the time) but you should know that this edition isn't all it seems.

It's a wonderful story, the one of the future luminary resuscitating the old, broken spirit and it gave me the impetus to even pick up a Svevo book (that one being The Confessions of Zeno). But what is here? It is a very engaging, very biting, very vivid story, and one that is told with wit, grace and style. But (and there is usually a but) it clearly pales against his later masterpiece. If given a choice, I would definitely recommend Zeno over this one, but this is still a truly excellent read. The story of liasons gone awry, psychological musings and other problems of that then new creature, the Modern Neurotic, are the spine of this story, and they provide sturdy support... even if they get a better treatment in his next book."},{"Title":"As A Man Grows Older (Sun and Moon Classics)","review":"\\"It coursed powerful as ever through his veins and annulled whatever resolution his senile mind had made.\\"I don't profess to fully understand the title \\"Senility,\\" except to say that Svevo reserves a specific meaning for the word beyond normal, everyday usage. The NYRB Zoete translation only uses the word once, and for Emilio Brentani, it refers to a state of mind in which he has just attempted to fool both his best friend and himself into thinking he is no longer infatuated with Angiolina. This \\"senility\\" is then opposed to \\"youth\\" or Brentani's reckless abandonment to his passions. I can only surmise that the title refers to Brentani's fluctuations between love, indifference, and disgust. For those who enjoy this about Svevo's characters, there is enough to go around in \\"As a Man Grows Older.\\"While I have noticed other reviewers claiming this to be Svevo's master achievement, and somehow a more perfect work of art than \\"Zeno's Conscience,\\" I disagree. The first-person narration of Zeno (simultaneously one of the saddest and funniest characters in literature) provides an immediacy and consequence that the other novel lacks; AaMGO mostly depicts character interaction through description, narrated by a rather unremarkable narrator. The prose is not \\"flat,\\" as another reviewer claims, but often quite workmanlike. There are moments when the prose attempts to reach a higher register, such as Amalia's scene in the opera house, and Emilio's closing thoughts of Angiolina, and these are quite lovely, even in translation. However, I felt this novel was missing the unforgiving verisimilitude of ZC, which I sorely missed.Similarly, while the novel does develop its characters, it takes quite a bit of time. I would much rather have spent this time engrossed in their lives, not waiting for them take shape--especially since the novel is so short. ZC doesn't need this buffer, and for the simple reason that Zeno is such an engaging and sympathetic narrator. I believe in both his loving and venomous descriptions of characters (Ada, Guido) in a way that I cannot fully believe the descriptions in AaMGO; while at times one feels they are truly living in Zeno's memories, I can at best only watch Emilio from a short distance, and often then quite disinterestedly.In my opinion, Svevo's greatest strength is his ability to seamlessly interweave humor and tragedy, which is one of the defining characteristics of ZC; while there is plenty of tragedy in AaMGO, I found little of it to be actually funny. There was one excellent comic scene near the end of the novel, which I will not spoil, that made me laugh out loud. I reread it a couple of times just to prolong the effect. Unfortunately, these moments were very few. While this novel is indeed more \\"focused\\" than ZC, my question is, \\"Who cares?\\" It has no excuse not to be. ZC is written in the form of a memoir by a very eccentric individual who makes no attempt to write a focused narrative; AaMGO lacks this fictive lens, and therefore cannot really claim tight structure as one of its recommendations--insofar as this quality supposedly elevates it above Svevo's later work. One could easily argue that Gaskell's \\"North and South\\" is more focused than \\"Moby Dick\\" or \\"The Brothers Karamazov,\\" but who would actually argue that it's a better book?Criticisms aside, this is an engaging novel, and worth the read. I think it misses its chance to drive its tragedy home through less-than-optimal characterization, but that there are enough good qualities here to recommend to fans of Svevo. He's a brilliant artist, and one whom more American readers should experience. Four stars."},{"Title":"As A Man Grows Older (Sun and Moon Classics)","review":"As A Man Grows Older (English title given by James Joyce; the Italian is Senilita) was the second of only four novels written by the Hector Schmitz, the Italian businessman known to the world now as the Italian writer Italo Svevo. He wrote this and his first book, A Life, in his thirties to little acclaim. But when Schmitz began taking English lessons from Joyce in 1907, he dared give the 25 year-old budding author the novels to read. Joyce loved them and became a life-long admirer. And in 1923, Joyce was instrumental in getting Svevo best known work, Zeno's Conscience, published. It is because of this that we can now read Svevo's great work.As A Man Grows Older is the story of Emilio Brentani, a thirtyish business man who is obsessed with a young woman named Angiolina. We follow Emilio's unstable thoughts and feelings as he tries to understand and control his love for her. Anyone's who's been in love, especially of the unrequited variety, will recognize most of what goes on in his mind. Emilio is happy when he is with Angiolina, but when he is not, he is often pre-occupied with seeing her again, or jealous from rumors he's heard about her with other men. And over time, we begin to understand that Angiolina is in fact a liar and unworthy of Emilio's trust. But, even when it should also be clear to Emilio, he still finds new ways of rationalizing her behavior. He fluctuates between wanting to free himself of this painful love, but then tries to manipulate her into bed or devise some stratagem to see her again. He even pulls the old trick of leaving her in hopes of making her see how much she loves him, only to find himself going back with her. She sleeps with him now, so perhaps his tactics have worked. But the reader will know from very early on in this book that their relationship is an accident waiting to happen.We also hear and see from Stefano Balli, Emilio's sculptor friend who is successful with women. As such, he counsels Emilio about how to handle Angiolina. But when they go on a double date, Angiolina flirts with Balli, adding to Emilio's anxiety in a way that never truly heals, and almost comes between the friends. The other main character is Amalia, Emilio's sister and roomate. She is unbearably lonely and in love with Balli. Emilio's neglect of Amalia for his obsession of Angiolina leads to the critical event of the book, and will leave most readers heartbroken.Svevo interest in psychoanalysis pervades all his work. Here he is almost clinical in his rendering of Emilio's thoughts. Yet we care about him, despite his foolishness. There is no plot, yet we are pulled forward with desire to see where events and Emilio will turn next. As such, Svevo's work fits in a nice spot between the realists and the modernists in its ability to teach and entertain.As A Man Grows Older is considered by some to be a better and more complete work of art than his episodic masterpiece. I agree with that assessment. I felt more satisfied when I put this book down than when I finished Zeno. This novel is wonderful work of art, filled with every emotion imaginable. When we read this, we will remember what it's like to love, to be anxious about love, and to lose love."},{"Title":"As A Man Grows Older (Sun and Moon Classics)","review":"Emilio, a retiring, cautious insurance clerk with some literary pretensions, decides he needs to broaden the scope of his life. He figures he knows all about love and affairs because he's read a lot. He decides his \\"amour\\" shall be the blonde, luscious Angiolina, full of life. He launches on his affair, ignoring the disapproval of his friend, Stefano. Emilio lives alone with his mousy sister, Amalia. A man may grow older, but he doesn't often grow wiser. Svevo's novel, written in 1898, definitely bears out this observation. Emilio's love connection goes from bad to worse, fouled up not only by the unfaithful, sluttish behavior of his paramour, but by his own immaturity, lack of worldly experience, and psychological hangups. His casual love affair balloons into an obsession. Meanwhile, sister Amalia falls hopelessly in love with Stefano, who hardly even notices her. Things do not end well.AS A MAN GROWS OLDER, a novel I first read in Southeast Asia 26 years ago and recently read again, may not have a thrilling plot line. It is overwhelmingly a psychological study of lovers and as that, a brilliant piece of writing which has held its power for over a hundred years. The evocations of Trieste, of the society that surrounded the love story is equally excellent. Emilio's plan to be more or less a casual playboy comes to grief as he is consumed by love and jealousy. It takes him a long time to get Angiolina into bed, which in turn opens up a new page for doubts, regrets, unfulfilled vows, and momentary steadfastness, always undermined by both desire and hatred. The double nature of love affairs---bringing out both passion and anger, love combined with hesitation, desire for approval, wild swings of emotion and inability to leave---has never been better described. At the same time, the purely imaginary love of Amalia for Stefano adds a further dimension to this veritable catalogue of realistic romance. Italo Svevo, who died in a car crash back in 1928, certainly left behind a classic with this novel. It does not seem to be widely read, which is a shame. A gem for anyone interested in a novel of the kind I've described."},{"Title":"As A Man Grows Older (Sun and Moon Classics)","review":"This review complements a review I posted on the other available translation of this work, published by Yale University Press:Italo Svevo's novel Senilita is one of the great achievements in the bourgeoning era of early Modernism. It has rightly been credited as a forerunner and influence on James Joyce, and any fan of Flaubert, Chekhov, Proust, or Fontane (as well as less celebrated figures such as the Yiddish writer Dovid Bergelson or the Brazilian novelist Machado de Assis) will find much that is familiar, edifying, and entertaining in this intimate and masterfully observed novel. It is a book full of irony and empathy, artful paradox and plain-spoken truth; it stands half-way between romantic decadence and modernist realism, poised on the cusp of the 19th and the 20th centuries.It is also representative of the most interesting trends in High Modernism precisely because of the self-consciousness of its atttiude toward narrative and language. Svevo, as is well-known from any synopsis of his career, was an Italian Jew brought up primarily in a German-speaking milieu. He is therefore demonstrably and purposefully uncomfortable in his use of Italian (just as Kafka in Czech-speaking Prague is deliberately not quite at home with German, or many post-colonial authors from Africa or India are fluent writers of English but nonetheless not native speakers of the language--this disparity is by definition and design a feature of their writing). And although there is no explicit reference to Jews or Judaism anywhere in this novel, it is not difficult to extrapolate his anamolous presence as a Jew in Catholic Italy as a motivation for his estranged, alienated, detatched mode of storytelling and social observation.All of these factors account both for what's interesting about this novel, and what's difficult about trying to translate it--starting with the title, which nobody seems to understand or care for. There are two available translations in English: this one, and the one published by Yale University Press as Emilio's Carnival. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE buy and read this version!!!!!This is a reprint of the original English translation first published in 1932. It is well produced and idiomatic; it captures the strange and indelible spirit of the original, without compromising its fidelity to the letter of the text. It also benefits from an unusually helpful and insightful introduction (in conspicuous contrast again to the Yale UP version) that is so well-observed and persuasive that I would recommend readers to do as I did and save it until after completing the novel itself.Best of all, this is the less expensive of the two versions! Case closed--who could ask for anything more?! Only that more people read, think, and talk about Italo Svevo, and that more people purchase and read this version of his first great novel."},{"Title":"As A Man Grows Older (Sun and Moon Classics)","review":"Very good about passion in a Proustian way.

The only reason I'm not giving it more stars is that the concepts regarding the evolution of the spiritual man, though still retaining some validity, seem somehow outmoded. In addition, the writing style is a bit anachronistic. However the author was remarkable for his time (which was not all that long ago) and he is still very much worth reading. He was an underrated, somewhat eclectic philosopher who was courageous enough to question the scientism of his day."},{"Title":"Pain, sex and time;: A new outlook on evolution and the future of man,","review":"This is a book by Gerald Heard. Catchy title, no?The book starts off rather well. It proposes that man must make the next step in evolution - mental/expanded consciousness - or degenerate or destroy himself. Note that Heard wrote this around the start of WWII.The pain and sex in the title has to do with excess energy present for doing this next step that we are failing at doing, hence problems with these. The time part is that it is an illusion - not much done with this that I noticed. He seems to say that when we are intellectually occupied, we are less worried about sex, have less sensitivity to pain and are not as aware of time - he may be on to something here.Heard then reviews history (including evolutionary history of life) to shown that his points have merit. There are some interesting items here.Things get a little sketchy and hard to follow near the end - even his sentence structure gets hard to follow - when he starts talking about how to achieve the next step. His method is hard to explain, but it based on explicit effort in special communities. Apparently, he even attempted to found one in California in the 1940's which did not catch on - this is not to say that his ideas were wrong.Heard was a rather interesting character - see the biographical information in the book. He was friends with Huxley and involved in the Vedanta Society. Meditation was very important to him in later life.Worth a read, but be prepared to trudge through some rough spots, especially towards the end. The summary at the very end is fairly informative about the book as a whole.I had very high hopes when I started it, but kind of lost them in many respects as I finished it."},{"Title":"Pain, sex and time;: A new outlook on evolution and the future of man,","review":"Humankind is doomed or will destroy itself unless some radical countermeasure is found. Unlike other biological creatures whose evolution has stopped we have still reserves of unspent biological energy. The proof for this can be seen in how we experience pain, and in the peculiarities of our sexual behavior. So, we are capable of evolution. The pace of evolution has quickened enormously, further human evolution will be not biological but psychological. To characterize this the term \\"enlargement of consciousness\\" is used; in a great part this means attaining mystical experiences and supernormal psychic powers. Attaining this state of consciousness should be the new goal of mankind.These are very shortly the basic ideas of Mr Heard's book. He continues to design, in broad terms, the practical way of achieving such a goal. Shortly, he proposes the creation of voluntary communes totally dedicated to it. There is also a short review of the history of human mystical experience (maybe the most interesting part of the book). One remark here: Mr Heard seems to be overenthusiastic with what concerns the spiritual development of the Jewish Essene community and early Christian gnostics. Was their religion really non-anthropomorphic as he seems to think?Mr Heard tried to realize his ideals. He failed, like so many idealists before. Which does not mean that these were not worthy ideas. Perhaps the practical steps should have been different.Long, winding sentences make the book somewhat difficult to read, until you get used to them. (Was this kind of style fashionable before WWII?) Not all the ideas presented are convincing, particularly those concerning evolution. Nevertheless, Mr Heard's mission is that of a pioneer. One of his troubles is that his goal is very difficult to describe. \\"The enlargement of consciousness\\" is good but very general. The same vagueness applies to the possible methods of moving towards it. He is feeling his way towards an unclear goal in an unknown land, therefore his language is, out of necessity, also quite general, perhaps not always very clear.All in all, it was not a very interesting reading, except for some parts on history. But it certainly raises the right questions like the following: why do we have such an enormous discrepancy between the ever more powerful means in our possession (science, technology) and the negligibility of our ends (material well-being - yes, but... is this all, gentlemen?)."},{"Title":"Pain, sex and time;: A new outlook on evolution and the future of man,","review":"A brilliant review of the social, psychological and spiritual state of Western culture just before it dived into the cataclysm of WWII."},{"Title":"The Wonder War","review":"This story is basically a satire of war, the military mind and all sorts of government bureaucracy.A team of intelligence operatives from a galatic federation arrives at a planet to prevent the outbreak of war, but they run into obstacles not forseen.Janifer writes very much like Robert Sheckley.

This is basically poetry of a rather abstract sort, broken up into five sections: The Garden, The Brothers, The Flood, The Tower, and The Land. The author introduces each section with a scriptural passage from Genesis, then rewrites the tale thus told in an entirely modern, disconcerting way. He apparently does have a good bit of Biblical knowledge, but he treats the material more as myth than as divine revelation. Even if the events never happened, they necessarily \\"are\\" now and forever, and Napier runs with this idea, making his lyrical re-telling a present-tense yet timeless story. His speakers refer to places and events throughout history and sometimes play off of modern phrases and references. The author describes this book as an \\"existentialist interpretation\\" of the major events of Genesis' opening chapter, but I don't think I would classify it as such. It is rather striking, however, as Adam and Cain basically claim the world as their own domain, criticize God for punishing them for things he supposedly led them into, and do all but tell God to go jump in the lake. I was expecting a poignant, somewhat inspiring retelling of the Genesis stories, but I in fact got just the opposite. Each \\"speaker\\" basically concludes his personal quintet with the plea \\"come sweet death,\\" essentially refuting God entirely. The opening section is particularly disconcerting, as Adam criticizes and lambasts God from the time of his creation to the moment of his expulsion from the Garden (which came about because of \\"a silly tree\\"). All I can do is describe the unusual nature of this book; I think the interpretation of it is a purely subjective, personal one that may vary widely from one reader to the next."},{"Title":"You Can't Print That The Truth Behind The News 1918--1928","review":"For a few years now, I have been thinking that the sole global superpower situation was very much like the German situation at the end of World War I, or Vienna in July 1919, when Victor Tausk committed suicide after being dropped from the highest level of psychoanalysis by Freud and his followers after Tausk had served the Austrian army as a psychiatrist, and a monetary mulch of America could follow the pattern described by Keynes in 1923 in his tract on monetary reform. The 1929 publication date of You Can't Print That! by George Seldes marks a big change from boom to bust in the economic thinking of many modern seekers of a viable future. I myself fell as dumb as Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty when I try to think of ways that political activity could contribute to some form of economy that will be able to function on very little fossil fuel.You Can't Print That! is very informative about conditions in Germany at the time of the Armistice because George Seldes was in a group of press officers who violated orders and crossed the Armistice line while fights between soldiers and civilians were still breaking out in Germany. Seldes wrote that a German officer who had been shot in the stomach dropped on the feet of Seldes shortly after Seldes had flattened himself on the ground and observed a panorama of flying feet early on the morning he decided to take a train for Luxembourg instead of going to Berlin with the other press officers. Part I -- The War, was exciting for me up to chapter 3, The Truth About The War at Sea. Once I read \\"The enemy did not attempt to save the crews of its sunken destroyers,\\" it was too much like the confusion in Athens in the time of Socrates, when sea battles made people want to execute their generals, and I quit reading.Part II -- Italy ends with a chapter on Fascism in 1928. Part III -- Russia includes The Terror in Russia continues. A few pages on Catholic Trials in Moscow might be worth reading by those who sympathize with one side or the other. I think reports of trials in Russia now are usually about tax evades. When a journalist gets killed now, someone might write that there are still no trials of the killers of many Russian journalists. Part IV -- Arabia has something about \\"British Imperialism,\\" and a Note On Massacre. Part V -- The Truth about Mexico starts with a Heritage of Hate. The first chapter in Part VI -- The Rest of Europe is called American Ambassadors as Censors.A hundred years can be a long time that nobody remembers, but George Seldes lived a long time and began a book in 1929 with: Introduction -- Billions and Bunkum. The usual history of great things made possible by electricity could become the bunkum that fails to produce expectations of prosperity expanding our prospects as advanced systems become too complex to function in changed circumstances.

Now that my daughters are getting older, I hope they'll gravitate toward books like \\"Hands,\\" which teaches character and trust in God, but shows clearly that life is never easy and decisions can sometimes overwhelm us.

I am not so sure everything that happens is COMPLETELY realistic, but it is realistic enough.The only thing I would say that I didn't like was not enough information was given about the characters' families. There isn't much detail--but that makes the letters real. At the end of the book, I found myself wondering what happened next.I think it's worth the read."},{"Title":"Hands across the Moon","review":"Hello to start with i can say this was a present from my best friend when my dad got transferred from our home country. I started reading this on the way to our dads transferred place. i could say i was literally in tears as it is about two friends who are separated with the same situation as ours. It was really touching. I totally loved the book and i even have it in kindle reading it all the time when i miss my friends. It reminds us of our high school. I'm not ready to comment on the writing style of the author or anything because this book was just way too over whelming with sentiments that it really dint matter much. This book is something that i would like to be kept treasured. i Hope everyone else who misses their best buddies would feel the same."},{"Title":"Hands across the Moon","review":"A well-done book showing the trials and joy, and most of all the energy of teenage girls. The use of the letter-witing medium adds to the appeal, making the communications between the two main characters real and immediate."},{"Title":"Bighorse the Warrior","review":"Tiana Bighorse is my grandmother's aunt and the Bighorse of the title is my great-great grandfather. I love this book. It was such a find for me to finally read it. I do not speak Navajo being half Navajo and half Nakota Sioux, so this story was never told to me. And anyway, during short visits to my grandparents no one ever had time to talk this away about our family history. I love it that Noel strove to retain Tiana's voice. My grandmother, her niece, cannot actually speak English as does her aunt, so it was neat to see what she might sound like if she actually did speak the language I do! All in all a real treasure. True, it does not go into great detail about the horrors of the Long Walk, but I loved some of the nuggets of wisdom she passes down from my long-gone grandfather. One is how he urged, like a modern psychologist that survivors of the Long Walk (he did not walk it himself, but fought as a guerilla fighter against the Americans) talk about their pain and losses. So many kept it inside them and it killed them. I also love her message to the young Navajo people about how this Navajo homeland was not &quot;given&quot; to us but it was fought for and people died and suffered for. My family now lives in Cameron on the Western side of the reservation, but when I drove across the vast Dinetah, which is the size of Ireland or W. Virginia, it gave me a great feeling of pride to know my family had lived all over that land. From Mt. Taylor, where Bighorse is originally raised, to Navajo Mountain where he lived as a guerilla warrior and finally in the Tuba City area, where my mom's family live now. The best quote from the book and I am paraphrasing is what Big Horse told her about being a warrior, a warrior is the one who is still walking around, tending to the sick when everyone else is down. This is such a Navajo sentiment. My aunts and uncles are always urging me to stand up, keep moving, wake up early. And implicit in that urging is the belief that we all have the ability to access our inner strengths for the benefit of those we hold dearest to us."},{"Title":"Bighorse the Warrior","review":"If you have an hour to two hours, and have any interest in Native American History from an Indian perspective, Tiana's story of Bighorse is a gem to find!

This book definitely keeps their spirit alive!"},{"Title":"Bighorse the Warrior","review":"This is a pretty good book. The main focus is on the struggle of the Navajo people against the United States government. Tiana Bighorse's stories about her father that he told her make up this book's chapters.

The stories include fighting, running away, terrible atrocities commited by our government, and the struggle of her father and other warriors. On the whole the book is interesting and informative."},{"Title":"Bighorse the Warrior","review":"I've met the author - Tiana Bighorse Butler.

Great book!"},{"Title":"Bighorse the Warrior","review":"The topic which this book covers, the oppression of the Apache Indians by the American Government, particularly the Long Walk, is an amazing story of struggle and brutal oppression. However, this story, an account of the events from a family memeber of Big Horse the Warrior, leaves the reader feeling a little slighted. Very little detail of the horrific events is given and worse yet, the events end up sounding watered down, as if they really weren't that bad.Overall, I feel the historical event of tragic proportion deserves a much better account which brings the readers into the emotional aura surrounding the events."},{"Title":"The Marshall Cavendish illustrated encyclopedia of World War II: Based on the original text by Lieutenant Colonel Eddy Bauer","review":"My copy was destroyed by flood damage, so I had to have a new set.

A somewhat slim book, I finished reading it in one day. You know if a book is going to be worthwhile usually after the first couple of chapters, and the time spent reading 'Red' was thoroughly worthwhile. It still remains one of the best pieces of fiction I have encountered, which brings me to ...... 'Only Child'.Like 'Red', this novel is fairly slim. But that is as it should be. There is no room for wasted words in Jack's writing. He gets to the point quickly and effectively, inviting his readers into a nightmare journey - a mixture of fiction and reality. It is exactly this juxtaposition of taboo realism and carefully crafted fictional characters that lends Jack's writing its uniqueness. He deals with the cruelty and evil inherent in society, bringing such issues to the surface, almost as if he is attempting to release his anger by way of writing.Violence in 'Only Child' is extreme and, at times, graphically depicted. In this way, the novel can be likened to Richard Laymon's work. But there is nothing supernatural about this book. Jack's horror is about the experiences some people suffer everyday of their lives - people who want to escape from their tormentors but are too terrified to take a stand, because of the consequences should they fail. Lydia McCloud, however, does make a stand.Married to the fraudulently good-natured Arthur Danse, Lydia soon discovers his dark side. For Danse does not adhere to the rules of society. Undoubtedly disturbed, Danse believes he is here for a reason ... to ensure that he teaches humankind that both fear and pain are necessary, and that he has been chosen to inflict such pain on anyone who refuses his demands. His disturbing behaviour is not limited to the unfortunate people he encounters outside his family - rather it is Lydia and his young son, Robert, who are most at risk.Jack Ketchum has created two strikingly different characters here. Lydia is imbued with inner strength, a giving nature, and an understanding of what really counts in life. Arthur Danse is cruel, calculating, and possesses a relentless determination to both control and hurt people.The message behind this book is that good can triumph over evil if the victim is able summon enough courage to face their tormentor. 'Only Child' takes a realistic and accurate view of domestic violence and child abuse. It explores the psychological aspects of such abuse from the viewpoint of both antagonist (Danse) and protagonists (Lydia, Robert, and anyone else who, along the way, dares to question Arthur Danse).I once knew a mother and daughter who were subjected to physical and psychological violence and abuse within a domestic environment, and can therefore relate to this story.'Only Child' should be remebered alongside Thomas Harris's 'Silence of the Lambs' as one of the best psychological thrillers of violence ever written. Jack's writing is both dark and powerful; his subject matter disturbing yet insightful. Certainly unforgettable.Along with 'Only Child', I reccomend you try other works by Jack Ketchum, especially 'Red', 'Road Kill' (a.k.a 'Joyride'), 'Offspring', 'Off Season', 'The Girl Next Door', and the phenomenal 'A Right to Life'."},{"Title":"Only Child","review":"I'd like to deduct a star from this rating...but it wouldn't be fair. Based upon the novel Ketchum meant to write -- based upon a true story, it turns out -- it's hard to criticize a word here. Ketchum is a good writer, and, I believe, wrote exactly the book he intended to. It's a solid, effective thriller.My only hesitation lies in the expectations I brought to the book. I haven't read a lot of Ketchum's work, and was excited to leap into this one. I expected a horrific ride, based upon Ketchum's hard core reputation. And it WAS horrific, but also somewhat restrained, probably owing to Ketchum's desire to be faithful to his source incidents. Fully half of the novel takes place in a court room -- intense matters are being considered, but the incidents themselves are, for the most part, off-camera. I admire Ketchum's restraint, but it didn't completely jibe with the \\"pull no punches\\" reputation I'd heard about.Also -- with a couple chapters to go, I saw a twist ending coming, and it was a doozy. I was already getting impressed by Ketchum's clever manipulations. The only trouble is -- it never happened. The real ending was pretty straightforward, again probably owing to the \\"real world\\" incidents he was documenting. Again, not fair to deduct points for that, but moderately disappointing as a reader.Anyway, the book Ketchum actually did write -- it's a first rate thriller, and I would recommend it to any fan of the genre."},{"Title":"Only Child","review":"I'll keep this short. I've read all of Ketchum's novels. This is, hands down, his best. I'm confused as to why, as movies have been pitched and produced, this one hasn't been considered.

The previous reviews have said it all, so I don't want to be redundant."},{"Title":"Only Child","review":"Gave this to my husband for Christmas and he loves the book as he is a big Jack Ketchum fan."},{"Title":"Only Child","review":"This is, without a doubt, Jack Ketchum's best book so far.

How to Ignite Your Partner's Passion","review":"&quot;Seduce Me&quot; is primarily a book about sexuality between couples. Many couples recall when they were first dating and it seemed that they were constantly touching each other. At time wears on that touching becomes less and less and sexual activity also declines. Author Darcy Cole discusses physiological and psychological factors in this change and how to get back the sexual fire. She notes that it takes very little to get men in the mood for sexual relations but men don't generally understand what is required to get a woman in the mood. This book details the various factors involved and how they work together to get a woman interested in sex. &quot;Seduce Me&quot; is very detailed in its descriptions and provides a wealth of information for those who want to understand the process of female seduction. While many parents would have a big problem with this book being included in a high school library, it is a very appropriate book for those wanting to increase their partner's sexual desire."},{"Title":"Seduce Me! How to Ignite Your Partner's Passion","review":"I was disappointed after reading this book. It was written for men who want to get their partners more interested in sex. It does nothing for the woman who wishes to get her man more interested. Believe it or not, some women have higher sex drives than their man.

For instance, I had no idea how birth control pills or other medications can affect desire for sex, or how types of stress cause hormonal changes that ruin sex drives. I also learned alot about the female psyche and how what is going on in her mind interferes with getting her in the mood. Once you understand the problems, the solutions make alot of sense. I really enjoyed this book and recommend it for any couple wanting to keep the fires burning, whether they need a little spark, or a major overhaul.

Clear those up and you will be free to proceed down the highway of intimacy again.With a background in health care management and business consulting, it is clear that Darcy Cole is a problem solver who cares about the problem! Applying scientific research, anecdotal evidence and yes, personal experience to the development of \\"Seduce Me!\\", Darcy has completed a guide that offers advice and clear speaking factual information that answers the many questions we all have. Like \\"Why am I not in the mood?\\" and \\"How can I get my partner interested in sex again?\\"With understanding of a roadblock we can plan to take a detour.

The price was very competitive and it made a great gift to a dear friend."},{"Title":"Pilgrim's Progress","review":"Pilgrim's Progress is without a doubt one of the true classics of time--an allegory that has remained a best seller years after its introduction.My first introduction to Pilgrim's Progress was as a child in parochial school. I had to do a book report on it in 5th grade and ended up reading numerous times for various projects throughout grade school.The reader follows the main character--aptly named &quot;Christian&quot;--on his journey to the Celestial City.Along the way, Christian passes through the many trials of life, symbolized by intruiging characters and places along the way. An early temptation is the &quot;City of Destruction&quot;, which Christian narrowly escapes with his life. The various characters are perhaps the most fascinating portion of the book--Pliable, Giant Despair, Talkative, Faithful, Evangelist, and numerous others provide the reader with a continual picture of the various forces at work to distract (or perhaps, encourage)Christian on his ultimate mission.Of course, the theology (for those of the Christian faith) of Pilgrim's Progress is a constant source of debate, the book is nonetheless a classic of great English writing.It's not a quick read--that's for sure--however, I certainly would recommend that one read it in its original form. Don't distort the beauty of the old English language with a modern translation."},{"Title":"Pilgrim's Progress","review":"In this classic work, John Bunyan paints a detailed picture of the Christian life/walk, giving true-to-life insights and experiences. The despair, sorrows, trials and temptations that a believer may face are depicted in an allegorical manner, as well as the hope, joy, and salvation found in Jesus Christ. The main character Christian (once named Graceless) sets out on a lifelong journey from the City of Destruction, where his family disowned him, and encounters many persons and difficulties along the way to the Celestial City (heaven). The characters he meets are given names that reflect their mindset or what temptation they bring. At times he stumbles and at times he perseveres, but all by the grace of God. The second portion of the book tells of the conversion and subsequent sojourn of the wife (Christiana) and children of Christian. The discussions of Christian in the first part and Christiana and her companions in the second part are very interesting, as they defend their faith and explain their purpose to those they meet along the way. The book is quite different from your ordinary novel, and has many interesting words of wisdom for the Christian life. Readers should be aware that some of the language is antiquated and has unfamiliar usages, so its a little bit of an adjustment to read."},{"Title":"Pilgrim's Progress","review":"A letter to Marvin Minsky about this book:I urge you tolook at a remarkable book by the English Puritain John Bunyan(1628-1688), \\"The Pilgrim's Progress\\", which is one of the great evangelical Christian classics, though clearly that is not why it interests me and should interest you (although I AM interested in the puzzle that is the religious sense, which even the irreligious feel, and this book can give remarkable insight into that as well).Rather its fascination lies in the pilgrimage it depicts, or in the fact that human traits, vices, virtues, &amp;c are PERSONIFIED as particular individuals who are their living and speaking epitome, and who are encountered along the way in revealing situations.Bunyan's hero is appropriately named Christian. Someone once wrote that \\"Christian's journey is timeless as he travels from the City of Destruction to the Celestial City, meeting such characters as Pliable, Talkative, Giant Despair, Evangelist, Worldly-Wiseman, Faithful, Ignorance and Hopeful.\\"At first this personification is merely amusing, even a bit annoying (as caricatures or truly stereotypical people can be); but after a while I found myself enthralled because I realized that the effect of this odd literary device was to give unmatched insight into the nature of such traits. The force of the whole thing comes from the fact that one journeys about in - literally INSIDE of - what is both a comprehensive and finite moral and psychological landscape (a \\"psycho-topography\\"), very much as though one were INSIDE the human mind and your \\"Society of the Mind\\" was embodied in the set of actors. This is more or less the opposite or an inversion of the \`real world' of real people, who merely SHARE those attributes or of whom the attributes are merely PIECES; in \\"Pilgrim's Progress\\", by contrast, the attributes are confined in their occurrence to the actors who are their entire, unique, pure, and active embodiment, and humanness, to be recognized at all, has to be rederived or mentally reconstructed from the essential types.The effect, for me, was something like experiencing a multidimensional scaling map that depicts the space of the set of human personality types, by being injected directly - mentally and bodily - into it by means of virtual reality technology.So Bunyan's book has something of the interest to a psychologist, neuroscientist, or philosopher that Edwin Abbot's \\"Flatland\\" has to a mathematician.I don't mean to overpraise \\"Pilgrim's Progress\\", of course; it was written for theological rather than scientific purposes, and has conspicuous limitations for that reason. But its interest to a student of the mind who looks at it at from the right point of view can be profound.- Patrick Gunkel"},{"Title":"Pilgrim's Progress","review":"I have to admit that I've never been a fan of Pilgrim's Progress. Despite the fact that I usually like all sorts of folk art and corny stuff in general, this ham-fisted allegory just seemed too weird---too kooky.Yet Edward de Souza's *reading* of the text turns the thing into a work of art. I'm a voracious consumer of audiobooks, and I have to say that De Souza's performance for Naxos here is the best I've ever heard. The dramatic pause---almost as if perhaps he's thinking up the name---just before he tells you the goofy name of each new character, turns what I used to consider the most annoying aspect of the book, into the most charming instead. Bravo.And it's not just this book. From the opening strains of the fine, authentic 17th century music, you're at once made to know that Naxos has thankfully brought the art of the audiobook out of the dark ages. I have bought a few Naxos titles and found each more impressive than the last. Great job."},{"Title":"Pilgrim's Progress","review":"I just purchased this item. What a delight it is.

This book is relevant to everyone who is a christian and should be read by those who seek a better knowledge of what it is to live a christian life. It is just as true and applicable as it was in the 1600s. Everyone should read this book and learn."},{"Title":"Pilgrim's Progress","review":"Is this book a classic or what? No other book has ever sold as many copies as this one, save one Holy Bible. And there's no wonder why. It's timeless. If you don't mind reading seventeenth century literature, please pick this book up and read it. The first part of the book is an allegory of one Christian on his journey from the City of Destruction to the Celestial City. Forsaking all he knows, all he owns to take a blind leap of faith into the unknown, Christian meets with many trials and tribulations. The second part of the book for me was just as good, as a matter of fact, a bit more touching as I had standing water in my eyes in a few places. I won't go into detail what happens in the second part, but it was quite pleasant for me. Who would I recommend it to? Heck, anyone who likes to read will not waste there time on this one.

I highly recommend David Suchet's reading of this endless tale."},{"Title":"Pilgrim's Progress","review":"As I walked through the wilderness of this world, I lighted on a certain place where was a Den, and I laid me down in that place to sleep: and, as I slept, I dreamed a dream. I dreamed, and behold, I saw a man clothed with rags, standing in a certain place, with his face from his own house, a book in his hand, and a great burden upon his back. I looked, and saw him open the book, and read therein; and, as he read, he wept, and trembled; and, not being able longer to contain, he brake out with a lamentable cry, saying, &quot;What shall I do?&quot;In this plight, therefore, he went home and refrained himself as long as he could, that his wife and children should not perceive his distress; but he could not be silent long, because that his trouble increased. Wherefore at length he brake his mind to his wife and children; and thus he began to talk to them: &quot;O my dear wife, said he, and you the children of my bowels, I, your dear friend, am in myself undone by reason of a burden that lieth hard upon me; moreover, I am for certain informed that this our city will be burned with fire from heaven; in which fearful overthrow, both myself, with thee my wife, and you my sweet babes, shall miserably come to ruin, except (the which yet I see not) some way of escape can be found, whereby we may be delivered.&quot; -John Bunyan, The Pilgrim's ProgressPilgrim's Progress, though hardly anyone reads it anymore, is one of the best-selling books of all time and was enormously influential for several centuries; in fact, we are still living under its influence. However, like Dante's Inferno, it has passed out of favor in recent years, not because of its pedantry and antiquated style, but because much of its message is simply too harsh for the tenor of our times.The narrator relates an allegorical dream in which Christian, having received knowledge that his city is to be destroyed by heavenly fire, leaves his wife and children and sets out on a quest for salvation which takes him to the Celestial City. In the Second Book, his wife, Christiana, and the kids follow. In their travels, they must pass through such places as The Valley of Humiliation and Death, the Slough of Despond, and Vanity Fair, and must resist the blandishments of folks like Ignorance and Hypocrisy. Ultimately, all of the pilgrims do make it and enter through the gates of the City, saved by their unbroken faith.It's easy to see why the story was so popular. First, it's an exciting tale of adventure; one reviewer aptly refers to Christian as a Protestant Indiana Jones. Second, it is triumphant, with Christian overcoming all the odds to arrive in the Celestial City, nor is there ever any real doubt that he is going to succeed. Bunyan, who had become a Baptist preacher after a lifetime of tormenting dreams and struggles with doubt, wrote the story (and an autobiography) during two periods of imprisonment, one lasting twelve years, for holding services that were not in accordance with the teachings of the Church of England. Especially in light of the author's circumstances, he expresses a bold certainty that Christian's path is in fact the path to Heaven.But it's here that we see why the book is no longer popular. Start with the idea that God's judgment is coming and that most of us face the fire this time. Then add in the concept that Christian's are embattled by temptation and the sinners around them, and that many will succumb. Top it all off with the notion that it is only by following in the Pilgrim's footsteps that you can attain salvation, that everyone else is doomed to Hell. These aren't exactly the humanistic, inclusive, permissive doctrines which inform modernity are they ?But there's one crucial tenet of Nonconformist Protestantism which Pilgrim's Progress captures and which is both the religion's greatest gift and worst legacy to modern times : the primacy of the individual. John Bunyan experienced the struggle for faith as an intensely personal battle and his protagonist, Christian, likewise makes his pilgrimage alone. It shocks our sensibilities for him to abandon his family and friends to their fiery fate, but such is his desire for &quot;eternal life&quot; that abandon them he does. Here lies the two-edged sword of the radical Protestantism of the 16th and 17th centuries, for if it is true (and I think it is) that this emphasis on the individual in religious matters also spread to economic and political matters and brought about the concurrent rise of protestantism, democracy and capitalism, it is also true that this emphasis on the individual, if unchecked by morality, ethics and institutions, leads to the complete atomization of society and a cult of selfishness which undermines the very free society that it creates. Personal freedom has been the greatest engine of progress that mankind has ever known, and it has been generated in large part by the Protestantism of which Bunyan was a part; but that same freedom, if torn loose from the laws, responsibilities and moral precepts out of which it grew, becomes mere license. The individual, though paramount, is not sufficient. Freedom, though vital, is not everything. In particular, extreme individualism and liberty are inadequate ideals around which to build a civil society.Christian's pilgrimage conveys the message that faith is the most important quality we bring to our approach towards God. As theology, this doctrine of &quot;salvation through faith alone&quot; is harmless enough, and for all we know it is absolutely correct. But in organizing Man's affairs here on Earth, we have to emphasize works as well as faith--works which manifest themselves in following the law, accepting one's responsibilities to one's fellow men, and behaving morally. Otherwise, come Judgment Day, God won't have to smite us with heavenly fire, we'll have destroyed ourselves already.Bunyan's book, besides being a rousing adventure tale, should be read both because of the influence it has exerted in shaping the modern world and because the issues it raises, of individualism and the like, are still just as important today, when they have gone to far, as they were when he was writing, and they had not come far enough. It is a brilliant, though flawed, work, one who's impact on English Literature and Western Culture can not be overstated.GRADE : A-"},{"Title":"Pilgrim's Progress","review":"Pilgrim's Progress is an important religious work, and should be read for that reason alone. It can be heavy going at times because of the moralizing and preaching that goes on throughout, but in spite of that there is a pretty good story here. Bunyan does preach and moralize, but he tells a darn good story too. This book is a product of the Protestant Reformation (published in 1684) just after the release of the King James Version of The Bible. The book is a religious and political allegory that symbolizes particular qualities and actions that should form the cornerstone of a Christian's life. It is a book about the hero Christian's flight from the City of Destruction to the Celestial City. He meets all kinds of strange and wonderful sights and people along the way and Bunyan does a masterful job of characterization throughout the book."},{"Title":"Pilgrim's Progress","review":"We've read this book to our son and he has really enjoyed it. He doesn't yet fully understand everything and we had to stop and explain a lot to him, but it is something that we plan on reading over and over again as our kids continue to grow.I read a review that stated that a main flaw in this book was the lack of one on one relationship with Christ. I can understand what they are saying, but I think what you have to keep in mind is that while we are here on earth and in our day and age we do not physically see Christ. He was once here walking and living on this earth, but He is now in heaven. He uses other means now to maintain a personal relationship with us. For example, we can know Christ through His word and through prayer. Just as in the book, He often also sends other Christians along in our life to help us and encourage us. This book is a good example of a walk of faith. We can't see and physically touch Christ right now, but when we are in heaven we WILL see Him just as Bunyan talks about in the book. Christian persevered in his walk without physically seeing Christ and he was rewarded in the end for his faith. For now, how much greater our reward is for those who have not seen Him and yet believed!"},{"Title":"Pilgrim's Progress","review":"This is a great classic and a must have for any Christian striving to follow Jesus Christ and His Word.

[July note: Penguin is again listing it as current!] Most of my comments are specific to this edition, and a few other closely related text editions.Back in, I think, the early 1970s, I was taking a course in seventeenth century English literature, and encountered a library copy of Roger Sharrock's 1960 Oxford English Texts edition of \\"The Pilgrim's Progress from This World to That Which is to Come,\\" an immensely impressive editorial treatment of the famous allegory of the Christian life, but fairly expensive, and, I think, out of print. (There was a revised printing in 1975; it seems to be out of print for now.) Sharrock's edition was intended as a revision of a 1928 edition by J.B. Wharey, but it broke new ground in Bunyan studies. It returned for its base text for Part One to the first edition of 1678, drawing on the second (also 1678) and third (1679) editions only for Bunyan's additions to the text. (For Part Two, published in 1684, only its first printing has any claim to authority.)This decision was based on the recognition that printing house practices had rather quickly denatured Bunyan's highly personal, colloquial, and even regional (Bedfordshire) English, turning it into what typesetters thought of as acceptably genteel, beginning as early as the second printing. The progress of textual corruption had continued through the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, despite several attempts to provide scholarly editions. Close study of Bunyan's other, rather extensive, and generally less frequently printed, writings, helped to establish a clearer idea of his use of English, as against that of the printers. For the first time in centuries, Bunyan's most famous book was available in (almost) exactly his own words, as nearly as possible as he had set it on paper. Since Bunyan's vocabulary and style of punctuation reflected the speaking voice of an accomplished preacher (the \\"crime\\" for which he was imprisoned for twelve years), this almost amounted to restoring the correct meter to a poem long printed with incorrect versification.Fortunately, or so it seemed, Roger Sharrock had also edited a very slightly modernized text, without the full critical apparatus and notes, for the Penguin English Library (1965). It was not readily available at the campus bookstore, and the student-oriented stores in the area were already being replaced by chains, but there was a religious --- excuse me, a *Christian* -- bookstore in the neighborhood, which had a good selection, and generally well-informed and helpful clerks. I was bemused to find an unfamiliar member of the staff, who was quite enthusiastic about the King James Bible, in what is in fact Elizabethan English, but dubious about an unmodernized version of \\"Pilgrim's Progress.\\" The book's language is almost a century closer to us in time, and it claims only to be the work of a \\"Tinker and a Poor Man\\" (as the title of American editions of Christopher Hill's biography reminds us), not divine revelation. Still, she assured me, an original-spelling edition of it would be just \\"too hard to understand.\\" Surely I would be better off with one of the many nice adaptations or retellings? See the children's' section. (I had a sudden image of a special angel assigned to each and every copy of the King James Version, to supply linguistic information to its readers, lest they go astray over the unfamiliar words and grammar, but decided not to confide this to the clerk, who was trying to be helpful.)In the end, it turned out the Penguin English Library edition was unavailable; I eventually found a used copy, years too late for the course, but worth having. I don't find Bunyan an edifying guide to the religious life (see below), but he is in many ways an appealing human being, and a remarkable writer, the author of the last great medieval allegories in English, which are at the same time among the first modern novels.In 1986, however, Penguin reissued Sharrock's popular edition in the Penguin Classics series, and even gave it a revised edition in 1987, as well as a splendid new cover (from William Blake's illustration of a scene in the book). In the meantime, the Oxford text as such formed the basis of a World's Classics edition, edited by H.N. Keeble, with a new introduction, helpful notes, and a chronology of Bunyan's life based on the latest research (1984). That edition went through a number of printings, and was reissued in slightly larger format when the World's Classics line was revamped as the Oxford World's Classics. Keeble's edition has just been replaced by a new version by W.R. Owens, likewise following Sharrock's critical edition, but restoring a few more (specified) first edition readings which, in Owens' view, make sense as they stand; I have reviewed this last separately.It should be made clear that I have written this review as a reader with an interest in seventeenth century English literature and history, and a concern with the combination of realism of style and incident with a narrative of marvels and adventures. As far as what John Bunyan considered most important about his work, I am probably a less than ideal reader. Although coming from a secularized Jewish background instead of an Orthodox one, I tend to agree with David Daiches that the Pilgrim, Christian, seems to spend far too much time worrying \\"What must I do to be saved?\\" in the World to Come, and too little asking \\"What ought I to do?\\" in this world. Still, I find Bunyan's sincerity, and willingness to work out the implications of his theology, impressive in their own right."},{"Title":"Pilgrim's Progress","review":"This book is truly a literary classic! Although written over 400 years ago, this allegory of the Christian life is still relevant today. It still speaks to incredible depths of the Christian experience, the struggles as well as the joys. You'll feel the emotion of &quot;Christian&quot; as he encouters a number of characters, all named for their particular life experience.I have read this book 4 times in the last 10 years, and plan to again this year. Everytime I pick it up my relationship with God is strengthened. I have also refered to it many times in conversation.

I guarantee it!"},{"Title":"Pilgrim's Progress","review":"This is super thick to me. It is pretty simple on surface, and fun to read. But diving into each of the characters and their virtues/vices has kept me up late since I received the book. Lots of personal questioning, lots of views that I hadn't considered. I strongly recommend."},{"Title":"Pilgrim's Progress","review":"I can't pretend to understand the historical milieu from which this book arose, or the theological underpinnings that led to its writing. Instead, I come to the book as a modern and secular reader, trying to learn more about Western thought and literary tradition. Despite its archaic language and sometimes tedious preaching, I found my time well rewarded. The familiar aspects showed me as much as the unfamiliar ones did.Among the unfamiliar ones, I was struck by the pervasiveness of the religious sense in Bunyan's world. Seemingly ever action was seen in terms defined by religion. It almost appeared as the sole source of light in that world, without which nothing could really be seen, and tinting everything with its own color. Likewise, the literary tool of \\"morality play\\" naming sounded odd to my modern ear. Writers still use names in many ways, but characters names like Hope, Atheist, or Mr. Money-Love come across as heavy handed. Perhaps that mechanism helped in a semi-literate society, where subtlety of reading could not be counted on; perhaps it acted as a short-hand, invoking values shared consensually across a fairly homogeneous society.More familiar aspects of the storytelling also struck me, possibly because of their contrast to the ones no longer used in modern writing. Christian's journey, for example, has been copied repeatedly and in many variations by writers ever since. Not just allegory for seeking, it provides a natural way to expose the protagonist to a series of other characters and challenges, and foreshadows some destination for the story. The \\"journey\\" has been refined over the years since Bunyan and rarely takes such a central spot in more recent texts, but I enjoyed seeing it in this relatively pure and primitive form.In itself, 'The Pilgrim's Progress' holds only slight interest for me. As an historical document, reflecting the religious sense of its time, and as an ancestor of modern writing, I found it fascinating.-- wiredweird"},{"Title":"Pilgrim's Progress","review":"This book was packaged in a plastic rap which was very nice as I am giving it as a gift to my Pastor and his wife.

Rich in Biblical theology, it is the best-known allegory of the Christian's life. It tells the story of a pilgrim named Christian as he walked a journey from the City of Destruction (where he lived before his conversion) to the Celestial City (an allegory of heaven), sharing with us the many challenges, obstacles, comfort, and encouragement Christian encountered in his long journey. This book reminds me that I, too, am walking in a similar spiritual journey as Christian did.When I read of Christian passing through the Valley of Humility and falling into the Swamp of Despondence, I'm reminded of those times when I, too, was in such a swamp and valley, and how God graciously used those trials to humble, comfort, and rescue me.The Pilgrim's Progress reminds me and encourages me with the Biblical promise that regardless of what deep valleys I may be in, whatever swamps I fall into, whatever rough roads I tread, whatever rivers to ford, or whichever steep hills I may be climbing in my own life journey ... my Guide is ever watchful, my Deliverer unfailing, and He is indeed faithful in keeping and persevering all of His elect in the faith till they arrive to their final destination at the Celestial City--that glorious, everlasting City that is so different than the one I've traveled from and \\"built not by the hands of man.\\" Every Christian can learn and be encouraged from the Biblical doctrines taught in this story."},{"Title":"Pilgrim's Progress","review":"I give this book away every chance i get $$$ enough to do so.The first time i read it i was amazed at how i was on this adventure and it was changing the way i thought of things.and how it influenced my dreams was amazing as well; being that the story is a telling of a dream, made me even more in wonder.than i read it a second time and could not believe the amount of detail that comes out of this little book. if you know your Scriptures you will see them jump off the pages and here they are with visual application.If you don't know Scripture and find it hard to understand what The Bible is saying, here is a story that puts it in perspective.I love this book and can now understand why it has been so poplular for so many many years.i will read this book again and again as medicine for my soulHigh five for John Bunjan"},{"Title":"Pilgrim's Progress","review":"This past year in school my class studied &quot;Pilgrim's Progress&quot;.

Perhaps a bit too widely. While the book itself is stunning, having seen, heard, or read so many attempts to imitate it, I found that the original effect of the story was lessened for me.By all means, this book should be read -- it is in itself a great work of literature, and it is a prime example of Puritan thought. Be aware, however, that much of it will seem trite and worn -- not because of anything inherently wrong with Bunyan's writing -- primarily because we have all heard so many poor imitations that it will be difficult to put them aside.However, this book still warrants a reading for the simple fact that it is a great story!

(Due to Amazon's tendency to post reviews of one edition of a book on another edition's product page, make sure you're viewing the product page for ISBN 156563134X.)This review focuses on the edition only, as the Pilgrim's Progress itself needs no review. The hardcover binding is handsome and tasteful, and looks well on the shelf. The typeface is very readable. It would in fact be a perfect inexpensive edition of a great allegory, if not for two relatively minor flaws.The first is no \\"Note on the Text,\\" or even the name of an editor (of this volume; I believe the series may have a general editor). From what edition was this text edited? What other editions were consulted? What is the history of the text of the Pilgrim's Progress? A Note on the Text wouldn't have been much trouble, and would have raised this edition up a notch or two.The second is the glossing of words such as \\"I trow\\" which the unknown editor considers difficult for modern English readers. Glossing should properly be done either with footnotes or in the margins, but in this edition, the glosses are in brackets immediately following the word glossed. E.g. \\". . . I trow [believe] . . .\\" I find the procedure annoying; other readers might find it helpful.

The Interpreter answered, 'This is Christ, who continually with the oil of grace maintains the work already begun in the heart, by the means of which, notwithstanding what the Devil can do, the souls of his people prove gracious still. AND IN THAT THOU sawest that the man stood behind the wall to maintain the fire, this is to teach thee that it is hard for the tempted to see how this work of grace is maintained in the soul.And this: Now a little before it was day, good Christian, as one half amazed, brake out in this passionate speech. 'What a fool', quoth he, 'am I , thus to lie in a stinking dungeon, when I may as well walk at liberty. I have a key in my bosom, called promise, that will (I am persuaded) open any lock in Doubting-Castle.'A key called promise.. great thoughts.There are many editions to Pilgrim's Progress, and I haven't found one I am happy with yet. Try to get one with the original wording, and the references to passages in the bible. Many versions delete the references to passages in the bible, which are, of course, the most useful to Christians and of least use to the world.ISBN 0140430040 appears to be true to the original wording of the classic. On the other hand, it lacks the biblical passage references, chapter divisions, and is a paperback with (quite frankly) an ugly cover.ISBN 0785242228 is a modern spelling version. However comparing it to the original shows that a lot more than just the spelling has been changed, and it doesn't read nearly as well. This is a nicely bound hardback with quality paper and chapter divisions, and some (but not all) the references to the bible. Character names are annoyingly abbrievated throughout book.ISBN 1557480990 is a children's version of Pilgrim's Progress. While a children's book, it remains true to the original and is worth getting. The illustrations are great.There are also many etext versions of Pilgrim's Progress that include the original text and all the references the text makes to passages in the bible.I recommend you take your time reading the book, and reflect on what is being said. Also, if you have a full version of this book, with the references to passages in the bible, you could use it as part of a bible study.BTW: the phrase 'vanity fair' comes from this book."},{"Title":"Pilgrim's Progress","review":"In contrast to Dante, Bunyan fills his allegory with real people, not just stereotypes - or even archetypes. Though his characters have names like &quot;Honest,&quot; &quot;Feeble-mind,&quot; and &quot;Ignorance,&quot; they come across as real people given a nickname. The names apply to some extent, of course, but not to the point of making caricatures out of the characters.This volume contains parts I and II of Pilgrim's progress. The first part concerns the journey of a pilgrim named &quot;Christian,&quot; while the second describes the journey of his wife, Christiana. Both start from the City of Destruction and both encounter many of the same obstacles - the Slough of Despond, the Vanity Fair, the Castle Doubt - before reaching the gates of the Celestial City. Other than that, their journeys are rather different, for Christian travels on his own, with a bit of help here and there, and with one or another traveling companion, but his progress is almost entirely his own. Christiana, by contrast, travels as part of an ever growing company, who support one another and who are defended by one or two powerful champions.You never lose sight of the allegory, but this work is not a mere tract. The story itself and the characters entertain - even today."},{"Title":"Pilgrim's Progress","review":"This book is essential reading for any Christian who wants to &quot;fight the good fight&quot; and to finish the race well. The excellent thing about this book is that it helps to give the big picture of life and what small events that happen in life can mean in the scheme of things. The first book is about about a man named Christian (you can see that the allegory isn't too hard to understand) and the things that happen to him after he starts on the journey on the road that leads to Heaven. We see how with each step and misstep along the way Christian has the option of continuing on the road to Heaven or giving up, and that helps us readers to realize that the same thing is true in our own lives. Another thing I really like about this book is how even when Christian totally goes off the path and in the wrong direction, God extends grace to him and he is able to return once again to the road to Heaven. The second book is about Christian's wife and family, and is also worth a read. One thing to note though, unless you are extremely comfortable reading old English (which I am not), it would be a good idea to get the modern language version instead of the original; because I read the original and there were several times when I thought about how I probably would prefer a more readable, modern translation. But whichever version you choose, make sure you read this book. It will help you to thoughtfully consider the here and now and also your final destination."},{"Title":"Pilgrim's Progress","review":"Everyone should read Pilgrim's Progress. I read it for the first time last week. It is a book about a journey by the main character, Christian. It will also set you on your own journey through the Bible. John Bunyan writes that his allegory contains \\"nothing but sound and honest Gospel strains\\" and he includes references to Bible verses on nearly every page. I found it easy to understand Christian's journey by looking up these verses in my Bible as I came to them. By doing this, Bunyan was giving me fresh guidance because I had not read many of these verses recently. The references also allow me to keep Bunyan accountable for his words by comparing them to Scripture.Reading a book is a journey in itself, especially when it is read along with the Bible. It was also a literal journey for me because I was reading Pilgrim's Progress while on an airplane. In one sense I was meeting John Bunyan for the first time through his book while at the same time my flight from Los Angeles to London was taking me closer to Bunyan literally. On City Street in London is a cemetery called Bunhill Fields which is full of non-conformist preachers (Puritans and others who severed their ties from the Anglican church establish by Charles II). This is where John Bunyan is buried. Last night when I finished the book I came across a related quote by Charles Spurgeon:Go into Bunhill-fields, and stand by the memorial of John Bunyan, and you will say, \\"Ah! there lies the head that contained the brain which thought out that wondrous dream of the Pilgrim's Progress from the City of Destruction to the Better land. There lies the finger that wrote those wondrous lines which depict the story of him who came at last to the land Beulah, and waded through the flood, and entered into the celestial city.\\"So the day after finishing Pilgrim's Progress I took Spurgeon's advice and went into Bunhill Fields to see Bunyan's tomb (as well as John Owens). It is ironic that a man whose life and thoughts so greatly followed and conformed to the Word of God would receive the reputation of non-conformist. It's clear from the story where Bunyan's loyalties lie:Ignorance: What be good thoughts respecting ourselves?Christian: Such as agree with the Word of God.Ignorance: When do our thoughts of ourselves agree with the Word of God?Christian: When we pass the same judgment upon ourselves which the Word passes...Ignorance: What are good thoughts concerning God?Christian: Even, as I have said concerning ourselves, when our thoughts of God do agree with what the Word saith of him.I appreciate Bunyan's regard for the truth. He clearly shows that we all are born into the City of Destruction wearing nothing but rags. He insists that the only road to the Celestrial City is through the Narrow Gate. He portrays the progression of our sanctification as a grueling journey, but one that is nevertheless fueled by God's grace. The true nature of worldliness is portrayed in Vanity Fayre, Satan's schemes are encountered and explained, and numerous actions, attitudes, and feelings are examined.Pilgrim's Progress is about the ultimate journey of life of pursuing a pure heart through faith in Jesus. By modeling faithfulness and perseverance, its characters illustrate the trials and tribulations by which God works His good in us. This book is a classic and I hope it remains in print for a long time so many more generations can learn and be encouraged by it."},{"Title":"Pilgrim's Progress","review":"\\"The Pilgrim's Progress\\" is a classic Christian text written by John Bunyan. Written in an allegorical format, the two-part story focuses first on \\"Christian\\", then on his wife \\"Christiana\\" and sons. Convicted of their own sinfulness, the characters set out on the journey to salvation at the Heavenly Gate. Characters such as \\"Honesty\\", \\"Great-Heart\\", and \\"Faithful\\" aid the pilgrims on their journey, whereas they face trials from the Slough of Despond, Vanity Fair, and the Valley of the Shadow of Death.Getting through the book takes some work, less because of the story and more because of the depth of the allegory. Also, the dialogues between characters regarding salvation and righteousness often require a careful read. However, the story is exceptionally creative and thought-provoking, and the lessons that can be gleaned from it are timeless and worth the effort that needs to be expended. I recommend reading this one at least twice."},{"Title":"Pilgrim's Progress","review":"John Bunyan confronts the world head on in his allegory The Pilgrim's Progress. Using the journey, conversations, actions, and interactions of his main character, Christian, Bunyan draws contrasts between true Christianity and the vast array of opposing philosophies and opinions offered by the rest of the world. Each contrast demonstrates the superiority of Christianity to the perspectives and beliefs of the fallen world.The story is told through the use of a narrative device. That devise is that of the narrator himself recounting his dream in which Christian makes his way to the Celestial City. The device serves to put the action of the story in context as well as a way break up the story into manageable segments. A key phrase often used in service of this device is: &quot;then I saw in my dream&quot;. The narrator's dream begins in the City of Destruction; which is Christian's homeland. As Christian Journeys to the celestial city, he encounters many people and trials. Each one is representative of various worldly, or otherworldly philosophies or beliefs.Bunyan has in all these encounters faced the problem of the truth of Christianity. If Christianity is true, how come there are all these alternative ideas in the world. Bunyan successfully exposes the weaknesses of the alternative ideas by refuting them one by one in the context of his pilgrimage allegory. Through his characters, Bunyan agrees with the apostle Paul. His argument is that our best weapon as Christians (once we have accepted Christ as our Savior and realized that only his grace is sufficient to save us) is to keep our eyes on God and the things of heaven (Colossians 3:2). All the arguments presented by the characters contrary to Christianity in this book add up to meaningless noise compared to the word of God and the truth expressed therein.Bunyan takes great care to steer clear of the idea that Christians are somehow intrinsically better than other people. He is careful to express that only God's grace working within them makes them capable of withstanding the trials of life. He demonstrates time and again that Christian suffers from the same weaknesses as normal people and is therefore prone to failure. It is only the love and assistance of God that allow Christian to reach his destination.God's grace and God's grace alone are sufficient to save Christian from the perils he encounters in his journey. Any time Christian attempts to do something of his own accord, his plans go horribly wrong and God must rescue him.The second part is about the travels and trials of Christian's wife: Christiana. It too is very instructive and entertaining.Pilgrim's Progress is insightful as an allegory. It is instructive and would be useful reading for anyone currently alive and making there way through our current sojourn or &quot;pilgrimage&quot; here on earth. Anyone going to the real Celestial City would profit from taking a glance at this book as they walk along the narrow path. I recommend it."},{"Title":"Pilgrim's Progress","review":"The first time that I encountered Christian and his pilgrimage was as a preface and a family favorite in the book Little Women by Louisa May Alcott. Unfortunately, it was not until twenty-something years later that I actually got around to reading the book itself. If I were you, I would not wait that long.The first part of the current combined book appeared in 1678. Bunyan, a nonconformist Protestant minister who was imprisoned for preaching without a license, wrote at least the first part of the book in jail. The second part was first published in 1684. It is likely the most popular allegory ever written, and is still one of the best selling books of all time.What makes it so popular? The obvious key to its popularity is its simple, crisp style. Even accounting for the language changes between the seventeenth century and now, it is not a struggle to read Progress and it flows well for the modern reader. Although the book is allegory, the characters are full of little realistic details that make them feel quite human. Incidentally, I was reading this book as I was walking some of the old pilgrimage trails of Europe and it was interesting to me how vivid and applicable his version of the pilgrimage experience is. The Slow of Despair rang remarkably true, as did characters such as Talkative and Mr. Worldly Wisdom.The Oxford University Press edition is bound with a scholarly introduction which is, for a change, worth reading. It also came with explanatory notes and a glossary which were helpful for the modern reader who is not familiar with the everyday language of the period."},{"Title":"Pilgrim's Progress","review":"Pilgrim's Progress has been accepted by the world as a classic piece of literature. However, just as Handel's Messiah is recognised as a magnificent work without people really appreciating the message it brings so Pilgrim's Progress can suffer from its own fame. Here we have the stories of believers moving towards heaven. They have ups and downs. They suffer pain and experience pleasure. All the time the christian reader is being led forward into experimental practical christian avenues. Despair, doubt, backsliding, the temptations of the world, helps from above and support from others on the Way all make this work so vital and relevant. Both parts, Christian's journey and Christiana's are wonderful in their own ways. For the past four years I have preferred the second part. Read it every year at least once. If you must read only one other book next to your Bible let it be this one, (Or Thomas Watson on All things for Good) but do read it all. A classic that is beyond review."},{"Title":"Pilgrim's Progress","review":"worth the value of the print and binding alone, this edition not only has the Pilgrim's Progress (with illustrations) in large print (yeah, no glasses!) but the OTHER works of this brilliant man, including his last sermon preached!Masterbooks has done us all a wonderful favor.

John Bunyan writes about the form it took in his generation. This classic in Christian and English literature describes the journey Christian takes to the celestial city--that permanent home of believers in Jesus.In the New Testament we're told of the war between the flesh and the spirit.

The applications John Bunyan makes with the Christian life are so practical and real. As a young person its principles have encouraged me as I go about life's journey. I'm reminded of all those who went on pilgrimage, and the reason they continued or left the way.

I struggled and persevered with it, using a dictionary to decipher most words longer than 6 letters! Eventually I came to the end with with a strong determination to face up to my life with the same courage as Christian! Unfortunately, like Christian, I lost my way,more than once in my later years, lingering in unseemly places,falling into pools of Despondancy,and loosing Hope at one stage. I cant really remember the entire ending to Christian's journey,but as a man of some years now, and finding life a lot less turbulent and more meaningful,then I graciously look forward to the final part of my journey. Praise be to God. Like the book of JOB,John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress is impossible to rate with a few stars! I would suggest that such books should be purchased 'mainly' unabridged but nevertheless, intelligible to the reader."},{"Title":"Pilgrim's Progress","review":"I first read this book in High School and it is one of only two or three books that I have ever re-read. I am making plans right now to read it to my kids (right after we get through with the Chronicles of Narnia series). Though this book is old (published 1682) it is still one of the best descriptions of the Christian life available in either fiction or non-fiction form. The mental image that has stuck with me since the day I first read this book is of Christian coming up on the cross. &quot;He ran thus till he came at a place somewhat ascending; and upon that place stood a Cross, and a little below, in the bottom, a sepulchre. So I saw in my dream, that just as Christian came up with the Cross, his burden loosed from off his shoulders, and fell from off his back, and began to tumble, and so continued to do so, till it came to the mouth of the sepulchre, where it fell in, and I saw it no more. Then was Christian glad with a merry heart. He hath given me rest by his sorrow and life by his death. Then he stood still a while, to look and wonder, for it was very surprising to him that the sight of the cross should thus ease him of his burden.&quot; Unfortunately I have met some who won't read this book due to it's length and archaic language, and this is a great loss for them. Truly this is a book that warms the heart, rekindles our affection for Christ, and provides encouragement for us in our own journey to the Celestial City."},{"Title":"Pilgrim's Progress","review":"I read this book about 8 years ago and still have it in memory. I cannnot recollect everything the book said vividly as at now. However, I still recollect what the story entails: a guy named christian who decided to leave his home to the celestial city. Basing all his actions on his strong faith in God, he went through a lot of up's and down's. I remember at one time he gave up and decided to return but he had a change of mind on the way and decided to pursue his journey. This is a great book and I'll encourage anyone who gets the opportunity to spend a little time reading it. It is highly inspirational."},{"Title":"Pilgrim's Progress","review":"The Pilgrim's Progress is perhaps one of the most enduring allegories ever written; it has set the form for several more recent works (Hannah Hurnard's \\"Hind's Feet on High Places,\\" most notably). Bunyan's work was, for 18th century Christians, a companion to the Bible. The theology is a perfect example of Reformation thought, and were it not for a major flaw in the allegory, this work would be just about perfect.Setting out from the City of Destruction, Christian makes his journey throughout many perils and temptations, eventually finding his way (through death) to the Celestial City, to live with Christ and the saints. Along the way he learns much about evading temptation, and much practical advise on escaping sin is given to the reader through his discussions with travelling companions Faithful and Hopeful.However, by no means is Christian's journey representative of the Christian life as it is meant to be lived. Two stunning flaws stand out - first, that Christian in no way has any direct contact with Christ, until after his death; secondly, that Christian's life is devoid of relationships, outside of his two travelling companions.These two realities of the novel are startling, especially given that the Christian life is, first and foremost, relational-primarily, the Christian lives in relation to God, and then in relation to his neighbor. The Christian is not an island; he is to evade the world, but love those in it. Bunyan entirely misses this key point.Not only is the life Bunyan paints theologically incorrect, but it is entirely undesireable. It would be unimaginable for the Christian to live an entire life without, along the way, enjoying intimacy with Christ. Indeed, it is these moments of intimacy in spite of imperfection, which drive the Christian's soul onward. And it hardly needs mentioning that a Christian who, rather than reaching out and loving those around him, dismisses them as sinners and leaves them behind, is more reminiscent of Pharasitical hypocrisy, than Christian love.If one is looking for a challenging allegory, they need look no further than Hannah Hurnard's \\"Hinds Feet on High Places;\\" its protagonist, Much Afraid, is throughout her journey often in direct contact with Christ, and her redemption comes not through death, but through Christ making her able to go out into the world and love. Though \\"Hind's Feet\\" is not as theologically rich as Bunyan's allegory, its practical application is far more uplifting, hopeful, and correct."},{"Title":"Pilgrim's Progress","review":"Other than the Bible this book has sold more copies than any other book in history.

Praised by Ezra Pound, whose disciple he was, and feted by the likes of luminaries William Butler Yeats and TS Eliot, his work remained virtually unknown to the outside world until 1966, when the (North of England based) Fulcrum Press brought out Briggflatts, an epic poem drawing on elements of inner autobiography and Northumbrian folklore. Then his career kicked off in earnest, with the result that we are now able to see Bunting for what he is; a great Modernist poet whose work will undoubtedly last.This edition brings together the majority of Bunting's work he and his executors saw fit to preserve and is definitive. In it you can treat yourself to the First Book of Odes with its brief verses originally published in various magazines and pamphlets that published the work of poets prepared to make poetry count after the foggy Neo-Romanticism of the Georgians had all but rendered it irrelevant. Alongside is the Second Book of Odes, mainly assembled in 1965 after Bunting, neglected and working on a newspaper in Newcastle England had been rediscovered by counterculture poet Tom Pickard. These poems are brief and lyrical, reinforcing Bunting's belief that &quot;poetry is to be heard&quot;, and are sometimes hard to get into. However, they repay a certain amount of rereading and rapidly become memorable. The same can be said for the &quot;Overdrafts&quot; - free verse versions of poets as diverse as Horace, Virgil, Firdosi and Rudaki. Bunting spoke Persian fluently (he worked in Iran for part of his life) and his translations are highly accessible.The highpoint of the book, however, must be &quot;Briggflatts&quot;. &quot;Brag, sweet tenor bull/Descant on Rawthey's madrigal&quot;. It is described by the poet as &quot;an autobiography&quot;, but it communicates on a far deeper level than simply that. Items of myth, music and art are fused ably together, and the effect is of an English Modernist masterpiece rivalling Eliot's &quot;The Waste Land&quot; and Hart Crane's &quot;The Bridge&quot;. The poem experiments with sonata form, as do &quot;Villon&quot; and &quot;The Spoils&quot; among others.Bunting was Pound's follower, but he avoided his political excesses and linguistic boasting. He also perhaps managed a higher level of originality, for whilst like Pound and Eliot he was happy to draw on sources, Bunting seems to have weaved his heritage into his work in a way in which the joins are less obvious. His concern was primarily with music, and he had, whilst making it new, to make connections with sound in the manner of the Troubadours or wandering minstrels. His work deserves every new reader it gets.Enjoy"},{"Title":"Complete Poems","review":"Anyone who loves Louis Zukofsky and George Oppen must make the acquaintance of their great British contemporary and counterpart, Basil Bunting. I'll let this great poet describe himself: &#34;STRENGTH / inked with a light brush.&#34; By &#34;light,&#34; he does not mean feathery or easy off the tongue or on the eye; he means letting words have a say in what is being said and, in Bunting's case, more often sung. That takes an ear for speech as great as any. As Bunting urges, &#34;listen as crags / listen to light.&#34; Otherwise (which is to say dumb) &#34;the soil refuses the lightning&#34; as the vellum on which ink flows rips beneath pen's ponderous weight. In short, 200+ pages of unerring music from a man worthy of being called a poet."},{"Title":"Prompt and Utter Destruction: Truman and the Use of Atomic Bombs Against Japan","review":"This book is an important contribution to the ongoing (and seemingly never-ending) debate on the reasons why the U.S. chose to drop two atomic bombs on Japan. The author took it upon himself to clearly determine whether the bomb was militarily necessary - as has been suggested by many U.S. historians writing before J. Samuel Walker - or whether it might have been used for purely political reasons such as intimidating the Soviet Union.The results he comes up with are in many ways quite remarkable. For instance it becomes evident that then president Harry S. Truman was never confronted with the categorical choice between using the bomb and invading the Japanese main islands (which might have involved heavy U.S. losses). Indeed, by the beginning of summer 1945 Japan was believed to be so weak that the war was expected to come to an end before an invasion began, and even if it had been necessary to proceed with an invasion, the resulting casualties were supposed to be much fewer than Truman and his top-level advisers claimed after the war. However, Walker demonstrates rather convincingly that whichever alternatives might have existed, the bomb nevertheless proved to be the best means to win a decisive victory at the lowest cost in American casualties. Taking into account the element of time, one begins to understand how great the temptation must have been for Truman and his cabinet to drop the bombs and thereby finish the war with a clean stroke. Although other reasons, too, played an important part in the ultimate decision, the finding that using the bomb simply provided the president and his advisers with the most convenient measure to end the war is a compelling one and without doubt the book's most valuable message.J. Samuel Walker has to be applauded for presenting the reader with this highly readable account of the line of reasoning behind the U.S. decision to use atomic bombs against Japan. The book is both concise and completely free of any emotion otherwise detrimental to a scholarly approach to this debate: a truly outstanding work - and probably the final say on the subject!"},{"Title":"Prompt and Utter Destruction: Truman and the Use of Atomic Bombs Against Japan","review":"One of the most complex, divisive, and nuanced debates in the history of the twentieth century is the decision by U.S. President Harry S. Truman in August 1945 to drop two atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, thereby ending World War II. A traditional conception of the decision, indeed the one most often voiced by actors in the decision, was that it was done to speed the end of the war and thereby preserve American lives that might be lost in future combat. The revisionist interpretation, often identified with Gar Alperowitz, argues that the war was almost over and that the Japanese were on the verge of surrender anyway. The reason to drop the bomb, therefore, had little to do with the ending of World War II and was aimed more at impressing and influencing future relations with the Soviet Union. Another interpretation suggests that the use of the atomic bomb had more to do with American racism, and that the U.S. would have refrained from using such a horrific weapon on other Caucasians in Europe. Other scholars condemn the use of such a weapon targeting large populations, including non-combatants, as immoral and obscene. Subsequent historians have argued various permutations of these interpretations and the debate remains far from settled.J. Samuel Walker's \\"\`prompt & utter destruction': Truman and the Use of the Atomic Bomb against Japan\\" is a superb short discussion of the merits of each of these interpretations and an assessment of the current state of understanding on the subject. He takes an exceptionally even-handed approach, pointing up the strengths and weaknesses of each major argument and assessing how they have evolved over time. In the end, as Walker documents, five fundamental considerations played into the decision to use atomic bombs in August 1945.First, the decision makers, especially Truman, sought to end the war at the earliest possible moment. They believed this new and terrifying weapon would do so and should therefore be employed for what they considered the greater good of ending the bloodshed. Wrapped up in this argument, although Walker thinks it a bit of side issue, was a widely held belief that bringing the Japanese to the surrender table would require an invasion of its islands. This would be, as those considering it believed, a costly and lengthy campaign that might mean the loss of thousands of lives on both sides. Casualty estimates of all types exist, and they have been used in the debate since then to justify or condemn the use of the bomb. Walker finds that those estimates, which are at best educated guesses that range broadly depending on the assumptions and the perspectives of those making them, are less useful in assessing what took place than the understanding that Truman was unwilling to accept any more casualties than absolutely necessary.Second, Walker notes how Truman and his advisors were intensely concerned that they had to justify the enormous cost of developing the atomic weapon, and a decision not to use it once it existed would open them to significant criticism. As Walker states, \\"The success of the Manhattan Project in building the bombs and ending the war was a source of satisfaction and relief\\" (p. 94). In this context, Truman expressed great concern that should he decide not to use the weapon once he had it that every American life lost thereafter would have been wasted. As he explained to Secretary of State James F. Byrnes in 1947, \\"I believe that no man, in our position and subject to our responsibilities, holding in his hands a weapon of such possibilities for accomplishing this purpose and saving those lives, could have failed to use it and afterwards looked his countrymen in the face\\" (p. 94).Third, at least one of Truman's advisors, Secretary of State Byrnes, realized immediately and argued to his colleagues that this weapon would be useful in helping to bend the Soviet Union to American wishes in the post-war era. Truman recognized this as well, but according to Walker this was definitely an added bonus and not the primary consideration in using the bomb. Walker concluded, \\"Growing differences with the Soviet Union were a factor in the thinking of American officials about the bomb but were not the main reason that they rushed to drop it on Japan\\" (p. 95). Gar Alperowitz's \\"atomic diplomacy\\" thesis, therefore, has merit however overstated it might have been.Fourth, Walker asserts that there was a lack of incentives among those making these decisions not to use the bomb. \\"Truman,\\" Walker notes, \\"used the bomb because he had no compelling reason to avoid it\\" (p. 95). While many people since 1945 have questioned the morality of its use, Truman and his advisors did not let those scruples--and they did exist among them--outweigh their goal of ending the war as quickly as possible. Indeed, by the last year of the war conventional weaponry had laid waste to so many cities containing thousands of non-combatants--witness the firebombing of or Dresden and Tokyo--that virtually no one in a senior decision making role in the U.S. questioned the use of nuclear weapons despite their destructiveness since they believed dropping these bombs would shorten the war and save American lives.Fifth, Walker comments that \\"Hatred of the Japanese, a desire for revenge for Pearl Harbor, and racist attitudes were a part of the mix of motives that led to the atomic attacks\\" (p. 96). Again, this was not the primary consideration in dropping the bomb on Japan, \\"But the prevalent loathing of Japan, both among policymakers and the American people, helped override any hesitation or ambivalence that Truman and his advisors might have felt about use of atomic bombs\\" (p. 96).Walker ends \\"prompt & utter destruction\\" with a series of questions still being debated about the decision to use the bomb. These include: \\"(1) how long the war would have continued if the bomb had not been used; (2) how many casualties American forces would have suffered if the bomb had not been dropped; (3) whether an invasion would have been necessary without the use of the bomb; (4) the number of American lives and casualties an invasion would have exacted had it proven necessary; (5) whether Japan would have responded favorably to a American offer to allow the emperor to remain on the throne before Hiroshima, or whether such an offer would have prolonged the war; and (6) whether any of the alternatives to the use of the bomb would have ended the war as quickly on a basis satisfactory to the United States (pp. 108-109).These historiographical questions ensure that future study of this subject will remain contested; overlaying all of it, of course, is the question of the morality of Truman's decision. Walker offers no conclusion to the debate, instead inviting further inquiry and exposition as each scholar makes a contribution to the marketplace of ideas where positions will be evaluated and accepted, rejected, or modified. This book is a must read for anyone who wants to understand the nature of the end of World War II and the beginning of the cold war."},{"Title":"Prompt and Utter Destruction: Truman and the Use of Atomic Bombs Against Japan","review":"This book gives a good overview but just that - an overview. The events and circumstances surrounding the use of the A-bomb simply must be addressed in greater depth for one who wishes to become truly knowledgable on the subject. However, its brevity is also a strength in that for one just getting into the subject it serves as a fabulous introduction and for those already familiar with the subject, it sums things up into a nice recap. Contrary to some reviews of the book, the author doesn't ever say or even imply that the bomb should not have been dropped. Quite the opposite, he provides compelling reasons why the decision to use the bomb was sound and wise militarily, politically, diplomatically, and morally. Granted, the idea of morally justifying such terrible force in any context seems paradoxical and borders on philosophical absurdity, but the author does an admirable job at least providing relatively sound coherent reasons. So while not the final say, this book would be a good addition due to its brevity, credible research, and arguments which, as a whole, are very sound."},{"Title":"Prompt and Utter Destruction: Truman and the Use of Atomic Bombs Against Japan","review":"This is a jewel of a book on the end of World War II.

Walker has written a half-way decent introduction to the subject at hand, but it is not as good as many of the other reviewers think.Walker presents strong evidence that the use of the atomic bomb was necessary if the war was to be ended \\"as quickly as possible.\\" So far, so good. When it comes to the question of whether the bomb was necessary to end the war 'reasonably quickly,' that is, within three or four more months, he uncritically accepts the claims of Paul Nitze that the Japanese would probably have surrendered by Nov. 1st, 1945, and certainly by Dec. 1st. This is rather odd, because, Walker cites Robert P. Newman'sTruman and the Hiroshima Cult. Newman read through the interrogations of Japan's surviving wartime leadership conducted by the Strategic Bombing Survey, and found that they only one Japanese leader agreed with Nitze's estimated surrender date, and that one only when prompted (earlier in the same interview, he expected Japan to hold out rather longer).Newman further reviewed the intelligence data available to the U.S. through July of 1945, and showed that the Japanese were making strenuous efforts to resist the expected amphibious invasion, while specifically rejecting the terms they finally accepted in August. (The U.S., British, and Chinese governments were convinced that a surrender on terms, a la the Versailles treaty, would likely lead to World War III in the 1960s or 1970s). Thus, even if Nitze's conclusion was correct, there was no reason for Truman or anyone else in Washington to believe it.Finally, Nitze's conclusion of a surrender by December 1st at the latest, Newman showed, was formed around June of 1945, and was based on his assessment of the damage conventional bombing would inflict on Japan, and how he thought the Japanese leaders would react to that damage. Nitze had persuaded the Air Force to schedule an air campaign targeting Japanese transportation facilities, which would have disrupted both war production and food distribution, leading to a threat of widespread starvation. While this might have caused the Japanese government to fold, it might also have resulted in widespread relocation of civilians to rural areas, where they would have had ready access to food. Thus, the estimated surrender date was little more than a guess, unsupported by evidence.Robert C. Butow interviewed those same Japanese leaders at much greater length for his book Japan's Decision to Surrender, which I highly recommend. His conclusion, as related by Freeman Dyson inFrom Eros to Gaia, was that there was no way to know when the Japan would have given up, because the Japanese leaders themselves didn't know when they would have surrendered.When it comes the question of how many casualties the U.S. would have suffered if the U.S. had invaded Japan, Walker accurately summarizes the estimates presented to Truman in mid-1945, when there were only 350,000 Japanese troops present on Kyushu. Based on experience on Luzon, casualties might have been \\"only\\" about 17,000 killed, 53,000 wounded. As Walker says, preventing such casualties was itself enough reason for Truman to order the bomb dropped. But by August 1st, the number of Japanese defenders on Kyushu had grown to 900,000, as Richard B. Frank notes inDownfall: The End of the Imperial Japanese Empire, another of the works Walker cites. Thus, 'Luzon percentage' casualties would have grown to around 43,000 killed, 137,000 wounded. And, as Frank further notes, Luzon's casualties levels were among the lowest of the Pacific War, when measured by casualties inflicted per Japanese defender. The experience of Okinawa or Saipan would have suggested at least double those figures, and casualties per Japanese defender on the scale of Iwo Jima would have led one to expect around 300,000 dead, 800,000 wounded among the Kyushu invasion force. The medical corps was expecting around 400,000 to 500,000 total casualties, about one-fourth of them dead. In fact, it was the position of the Japanese military that they would inflict such heavy casualties on any invasion force that the Allies would agree to precisely the surrender on terms the Allied governments wished to avoid, and there was substantial evidence of war weariness among the U.S. and British populations.Further, D. M. Giangreco has since shown that higher estimates were circulating in Washington at the time, and that former President Hoover had written Truman that as many as half a million U.S. troops might die in an invasion of Japan. (See e.g.Harry S. Truman And the Cold War Revisionistsby Robert H. Ferrell). Thus Walker's confident predictions of relatively low casualties in an invasion have little value, and his statement that Truman's postwar estimates of hundreds of thousands of deaths among the invasion force were not believed in 1945 is questionable, to say the least.In addition, Walker completely neglects to mention deaths among Allied POWs and civilian internees held by the Japanese (tens of thousands had already died, and hundreds of thousands probably would have died if the war had continued much longer), Asian civilians who died in areas under Japanese control (perhaps 200,000 per month on the average, for the entire 97 months starting with Japan's invasion of China in 1937), Japanese civilians killed in air conventional air attacks (around 20,000 per month, excluding the Tokyo raid of March 9-10), expected Japanese civilian casualties in an invasion of Japan (over one million), expected British Commonwealth and Japanese casualties in the invasion of Malaya (scheduled to begin September 1st, 1945), and Japanese military and civilian deaths as a result of the Soviet invasion of Manchuria (scheduled to begin August 15th, 1945, but moved up a week after the Hiroshima bombing). When contemplating a war extending another two-and-a-half to three-and-a-half months, these figures lead to a conclusion that many more people would certainly have died than the atom bombs killed, probably have led to more Japanese casualties than occurred, and possibly have led to more Japanese civilian casualties than occurred in the atomic bombings.And when it comes to the perception of the Japanese as \\"beasts,\\" Walker completely neglects to mention the deliberate Japanese murders of POWs and civilians, or the documented Japanese biological warfare experimentation and use in China. If the description of Japanese conduct as \\"beastial\\" is to be objected to, it can only be on the grounds that the adjective is unfair to wild beasts.As a short introduction to a vast and complicated subject, this book isn't too bad. But it is highly limited, definitely biased against Truman and the U.S., and can not be taken as a last word on the subject by any means. It should definitely be supplemented by some of the works mentioned above for an accurate view.20120418: added product link, corrected typo."},{"Title":"Prompt and Utter Destruction: Truman and the Use of Atomic Bombs Against Japan","review":"Prompt and Utter Destruction carefully builds arguments in favor of the decision to use the bomb based upon correspondence, interviews, etc., then tries to demolish them with speculative opinion. Perhaps this was done in the interest of objectivity; however, the result is a difficult to read, conflicted narrative. It is certainly not the definitive word on Truman's decision to use nuclear weapons against Japan.If you have a passionate interest in atomic age politics, WWII, and/or the Manhattan Project (as I do), this short book is worth reading, if just to have imaginary arguments with its author. However, if your interest is less intense, I can save you some time. The main conclusion of Prompt and Utter Destruction is that Truman had very strong reasons to authorize the use of atomic weapons, and no good reason not to do so:(1)Atomic bombs might shorten the war and save American lives.(2)Demonstrating that the US will use nuclear weapons would scare the heck out of Stalin, making him easier to negotiate with after the war.(3)If they were not used, Congress and the American people would want to know why the government spent $2 billion developing them.(4)Japan had it coming (payback for Pearl Harbor, the Battan death march, etc).Against these reasons stood only the vague concern that maybe atomic weapons were immoral.

Then ask yourself, what would I have done in 1945? Very challenging book. It certainly provides a very good understanding of the choices Truman had to deal with and the feelings in the US at that time.One final point for the anti-bombing crowd: Check the stats on the casualties in the conventional bombings of German and Japanese cities.And educate yourself about Japanese atrocities in China: 350,000 slaughtered in Sungchiang, and between 260,000-350,000 civilians murdered in Nanking.

In such a situation, someone like the author of this book (and there are many others like him) can go back and question the decision to use the atomic bomb against Japan from the safe distance of more than 50 years.

The character of David Hammond is far from boring as other reviewers say; indeed, he's one of the most realistically drawn characters in any horror novel and is a perfect main protagonist. The depression and bad situation he begins the book in shows that horror can be found in everyday life, not just with mysterious ravenous beasts. His relationship with Anna is well-depicted, growing believably through the course of the novel. As always in a Schoell book, the supporting and even minor characters are well fleshed out, especially Harry London. Frederick Anton, the main human villain, is perhaps a bit two-dimensional, but it works.But oh, what monsters! Maybe they don't appear on-page enough for some readers, but I found that keeping them hidden and lurking for much of the action increased their terror, to make them all the more frightening for the times they did jump out. The \\"full reveal\\" when we finally learn just what they're made of and what they look like is chillingly done, as is their main rampage, and a close-combat scene between one and David inside a car, while he struggles to keep it from killing Anna or making her lose control of the vehicle, is as intense as it gets.My only complaint is that the ending is a bit abrupt; the plot is resolved, and then the book ends.

Easily 50 - 100 pages could have been dropped to make this a tighter more compact and enjoyable read, but instead it tends to drag and shift its focus on the disinteresting thoughts of the main characters far too much.

Bartlett and Patricia P. Bartlett is a 291 page paperback published by the University Press of Florida. Having read several of the Bartletts' guides to herp captive care, I was a bit disappointed by this effort. It appears that the Bartletts' main talent lies in husbandry and less in the realm of writing about field herping. The species overviews are weak and several are misinformed. The Bartletts refer to some species that do not even occur in the Amazon region while leaving several very important and common species out of the guide. This was surprising for a book that aims to furnish information on some of the more common herps throughout Amazonia. As a matter of fact, the majority of the reptiles and amphibians that are illustrated in this book are unlikely to even be seen by an ecotourist. I found the photo quality to be poor and numerous species were misidentified. Furthermore, the title is a bit misleading as most of the species represented in this book are from the Upper Amazon region of Peru, making this guide not as user friendly in other areas of the Amazon. I have traveled extensively, and the Amazon is one of my favorite spots to visit. I was really hoping to finally have a herp guide that would prove useful throughout the mighty Amazon. Looks like my wait continues!"},{"Title":"Reptiles and Amphibians of the Amazon: An Ecotourist's Guide","review":"I got this book shortly after returning from South America and at first glance I was impressed. The cover is decent, the publishing quality higher than expected, and the intro a good start. Unfortunately, the content is a disappointment. I have three main complaints about this volume, and some background will add perspective to these criticisms. I have been keeping and breeding poison frogs of the family Dendrobatidae for nearly a decade and am familiar with R.D. Bartlett as author of numerous articles for the pet trade. Rather than articles from the hobby, I prefer the scientific literature, journals or texts on various herpetological subjects. I have made nearly a dozen trips to the Neotropics with friends or family in the last 5 years and have seen both the dendrobatids I study as well as over a hundred species of frogs and dozens of species of lizards and snakes.My experiences in Central and South America have led me to conclude that ecotourist guides are ineffective. Whether they are for plants or animals, these guides are geared for people who are somewhat interested in a particular taxon, but relatively ignorant of the species. I have found that ecotourist guides illustrate a limited number of representative animals. This is justified in regions where there are hundreds of species including some new to science. However, the illustrations or descriptive text are so vague and generalized that they can't be used to identify species. The problem with ecotourist guides is that if you necessarily limit the number of species then you need more detail and information to make sure you are identifying the correct subject. However, most ecotourists want, at quick glance, to know what they saw and rarely require great detail. My first attempts to identify birds from an ecotourist guide were frustrating because of the lack of detail. I now travel with detailed excellent bird guides from various regions. I have been awaiting the herp equivalent of these books but the Bartletts' ecotourist's guide falls well short of the mark.The information offered is vague, downright silly, or wrong. For each animal there is a species account that includes size, identifying features, voice, reproduction, similar species, habitat/range, and comments. Size is a generalized descriptor but it frequently does not help in distinguishing between similar species. Identifying features usually state the obvious but after reading a number of these one gets the impression that an animal could not be identified based on what the Bartletts have written. Voice descriptions are useless. Frogs usually call in mixed species choruses so one would have to have a calling animal in front of them to ascertain what it sounded like. Many frogs quiet themselves upon human approach so it would take patience to catch a frog species calling. I don't believe the average \`ecotourist' would make that effort. The calling description is also difficult to use. What is a \\"series of peeps\\", \\"two syllables often repeated\\", or \\"repeated buzzes\\"? The habitat/range info is equally useless. Take this quote from Platemys platycephala: \\"Although essentially aquatic, twist-necked turtles wander far overland during the rains and when water levels are high. They may be left high and dry as the waters recede.\\" Does this mean one can find this turtle anywhere in the entire Amazon basin? Numerous ranges are listed as primary, secondary, or edge habitats or entire countries. Well of course! I guess it wouldn't be in the book if it didn't occur in the Amazon!Ah, but then that would be an incorrect assumption. Dendrobates azureus and D. tinctorius are poison frogs inhabiting the Guiana shield of South America. This geographically distinct region from the Amazon consists of a massive up welled landmass on the northern edge of South America. Take the following account of D. azureus. Voice: \\"Males produce easily overlooked peeps.\\" The call of a male D. azureus is actually a soft buzz much like the electronic ballast of a fluorescent light fixture. Similar species: \\"Some dyeing poison frogs (D. tinctorius) are quite similar in color, but they usually sit in a more erect posture and often (but not always) have at least a little yellow on the back.\\" Are the Bartletts suggesting that posture is an identifying characteristic of these species? They seem to think so, as they repeat that stance shortly thereafter under the account of D. tinctorius. Habitat/range: \\"This poison frog has become quite uncommon over much of its original range and is now found in isolated pockets of pinelands and surrounding rainforest near the Brazilian border in Southwestern Suriname. Of difficult access, this region is technically somewhat north of the actual delineation of the Amazon Basin but is drained by several rivers that do terminate in the Amazon.\\" What exactly was the original range of this species? Difficult access to be sure. An expedition to collect this extremely rare species a few years ago was restricted as the local indigenous community controls the area. This region is not in the Amazon proper, but even more glaring is the Bartlett's stated reason for inclusion that the region has rivers that drain in the Amazon. Aside from the absurdity of that argument most of this region's rivers, the Sipaliwini included, flow north and drain into the Atlantic Ocean. So why are D. azureus and D. tinctorius included in this book? I can only conclude that they make pretty pictures, and like much of his dendrobatid section, are based on their popularity in the pet hobby.The entire dendrobatid section of this guide is filled with errors. The indigenous people of the Amazon did not use these frogs to \\"concoct a potent toxin from these compounds with which they coat darts and arrows.\\" Only the Noanam&aacute; and Ember&aacute; Choc&oacute; Indians west of the Andes used frogs for poisoning darts. Most Amazonian hunting poisons are made from plants. The Bartletts frequently start to use locale as a defining characteristic for species but then lists the range as so wide, such as southeast Peru, that species overlap makes this technique useless. In fact they give no range for Dendrobates imitator and to beat that they include an incorrect photo of it. The Bartletts list the range of D. castaneoticus as Northeast Brazil (!), which is a massive area. Caldwell's description of the species specifies a much more restricted region. Under D. quinquevittatus they again say to use range to distinguish it from D. ventrimaculatus, yet the two species do have range overlap. They include an incorrect photo of D. quinquevittatus. They state that D. reticulatus are arboreal and while they are capable of climbing most hobbyists and field biologists know that they prefer a terrestrial lifestyle. Most of his accounts on Dendrobatids seem based on their, or others', hobby/pet trade experience. Many of the poison frog photos are of captive specimens. I wonder why they relied on these instead of in-situ shots of these animals if they were as widely traveled as they claim.The Bartletts' vague mentality carries on in nearly every aspect of this book. Take the species account of Hyla leali. Bartlett calls it a non-descript frog that can most reliably be identified by what it is not (?!). There are hundreds of species of hylid frogs in the region. His photo of it is a Hyla brevifrons. Writing of vipers, they state that captive Bothriopsis bilineata can kill a lab mouse quickly. They remark repeatedly that nocturnal vipers are more prone to bite after dark. Obviously these comments are fluff and seem to be just words to fill the spaces; perfectly meaningless for identification or natural history.The errors go on. I thought of listing them but there are simply too many to include here. Not to mention that I'm not being paid to correct the Bartletts' mistakes.My last critique is of the photos. They are generally good and usually catch the identifying characteristics of the frogs, but the print quality is poor. It seems as if someone went bonkers with the hue/saturation settings in Photoshop, as many of the bright colors come off as garish and inaccurate. Some appear as if printed with a color laser printer. Nonetheless, the photos are the only useful part of this book. In fact this book would be more useful if it were just a collection of photos with species captions. That could certainly limit the number of inaccuracies.The authors present themselves as Amazonian experts but after reading through this work it seems they just made a number of trips to the Iquitos region, taken a bunch of photos of the region's herps (as indicated by the location captions), and decided to publish a book. I would guess that many of the animals were identified for them; otherwise some research would have produced a deeper knowledge. The topic seems broader than their experience and their facts and natural history information come off as made up or based on limited dealings with the animals. They certainly could have benefited from delving into the literature on ranges, natural history, and other details that scientists have been documenting for years.If you have herp experience or are serious about these animals then I can't recommend this book. It is inferior to Rodriguez and Duellman's, Guide to the Frogs of the Iquitos Region, Amazonian Peru, and Dixon and Soini's guide to the Reptiles of the Iquitos region. This book does have more photos, some of which prove useful in identifying animals. But if you were to take the Bartletts' advice and travel to the region with any of the South America tour companies, many with herp experts, then those experts will likely identify the animals for you free of charge."},{"Title":"Reptiles and Amphibians of the Amazon: An Ecotourist's Guide","review":"A lengthy inset section of full-color photographs beautifully illustrates Reptiles And Amphibians Of The Amazon: An Ecotourist's Guide, which is a straightforward listing of species of frog, salamander, turtle, lizard, snake, and more.

Here's the book blurb:Understandably, we pick up any book about the Holocaust with hesitancy and trepidation, but we put down Destined to Survive with gratitude that such a man was willing to share his experiences with us.Israel Cohen is an alumnus of ghettos and concentration camps, but he is also an architect of faith and rebuilding. His spirit could not be broken in Auschwitz, and after the war he became a teacher, supervisor, and role model for young people who were left with nothing but their lives - and the need for someone as devoted and inspiring as this young Gerer chassid from Lodz whose Jewish spark remained alive.Herman Wouk came to know and admire him. As the famous novelist says in his Introduction to this book:\\"Israel Cohen's ... unpretentious account is outstanding for vividness - and most strangely - optimism... The author paints a telling picture of the way a religious structure gives form and strength to life, and could do so even in Auschwitz... Israel Cohen is a maggid, a storyteller. \\"Destined to Survive\\" held my interest throughout. I recommend the book as a declaration of faith that has been tested in hellfire, and as an adventurous personal history wholly Jewish and wholly G-dly.\\"More than once, Israel Cohen thought he was a footstep away from the end, but he was destined to survive - to start a new life, raise a proud family, and share his experiences with us. And his experiences are truly a gift, because Cohen is a man with a heart and an unshakeable faith. His moving, hope-filled articles (some of which are included in this book) have appeared in religious and secular publications in the United States and Canada, and he has often been called upon to share his experiences with audiences in both these countries."},{"Title":"Girl Culture","review":"American photographer Lauren Greenfield's recent exhibition is entitled \\"Girl Culture\\". The artist's stunning documentary photographs are prompting comparisons to other female photographers such as Tina Barney and Nan Goldin.Like Barney, also a documentarist of the social realms of contemporary America, Greenfield painstakingly monitors subtle variations of self-representation, made congruent with commonly accepted ideals at the earliest possible stage in a person's development. The rites Greenfield are watching are those of the common girl. In this way, \\"Girl Culture\\" presents the opposite of the body-hiding conventions of Barney's East Coast WASPs. Greenfield focuses on the procedures of preparing and presenting the body in a body-fixated mass culture.\\"Girl Just Want to Have Fun\\" springs to mind as a disturbing euphemism for living the life of a little girl, an adolescent, or a grown woman in the United States today. Oscillating between overeating, starving, and self-mutilation, these girls become conditioned at an early age (even as young as four) by dressing up (and looking frighteningly grown-up) in a brutally competitive environment filled with drastic misconceptions of beauty.The radical affirmation of the standardized ideal sometimes results in travesty, such as when we look through the photographer's eyes at both Las Vegas showgirls and minors wearing too much makeup. Greenfield knows her craft. Her eye is never hurtful or brutally revealing, but instead allows her subjects to present themselves the way they like, the way they live - knowing that the production of the self in front of the camera can be more revealing than any pose the photographer suggests.Beauty, for most of these girls and women, is used as a weapon. It seems to grant self-esteem and acceptance. The outer appearance supports and covers the self simultaneously until the individual is no longer indistinguishable from the masses, until it seems to blend in smoothly. The American body is a body for the masses that results in mass display of the manipulated, operated, augmented body on such ritual occasions as pageants and spring breaks. Greenfield shows the way that these rituals conceal a rigid subtext of pain, suppression, and denial.Remarkable is the sheer absence of men in all of these scenes. With the exception of a spring ritual, in which a group of men hold up a woman like a broken Barbie doll, they are almost invisible. They occupy the women's fantasies, their longings, their projections. Thus, they are included in every picture that Greenfield takes, with a girl culture unfolding in front of the backdrop of dominant male culture. In this respect, Greenfield's seemingly objective photography contains a tangiable, important critique. (Written by Magdalena Kroner)"},{"Title":"Girl Culture","review":"In very brief terms, this is indicated as an examination of the way today's North American cultural superficiality often results in appearance being the sole, all-encompassing purpose of girls' lives. Indeed, even when one accounts for clear editorial bias, it is successful (and quite disturbing) in expressing to what extent this can be true.It's funny, therefore, how Greenfield as a photographer almost exclusively chooses attractive girls to photograph. Aside from weight issues, there is almost no examination of how these cultural values impact, say, ugly girls. There's this sense throughout the book that attractive girls, strippers and models, as well as their sex lives, are more interesting to the photographer and her audience than less glamourous types.It seems as if, in choosing her subjects, Greenfield is affected by the very values she is attempting to expose. After all, who wants to see photographs of ugly girls? Note the fact that the cover of this book, featuring a moderately attractive young blonde exposing her cleavage, almost reads like a clothing ad. Many clothing ads even have similar underlying dark, self-critical elements (see Terry Richardson's advertising work for example). It seems as if this cover is meant to attract readers in the same way that these advertisements do, and appeal to the very desire to see attractive sexualised young females that the book attempts to criticise.There is a fine line between sensationalism and criticism here, and certainly this book DOES make one look at attractive women differently after reading it. However, though this book does successfully expose some very interesting elements of North American culture, its focus on attractive subjects, sexualised professions and teenage sexuality gives it a very sensationalist overall feel, and tips the scale away from it being truly relevant criticism."},{"Title":"Girl Culture","review":"Words can add little to the beauty of these photographs. The introduction and conclusion are utterly unnecessary and frankly are a little preachy, but the essays in the subjects' own words are fascinating. This is a book one absorbs more than reads."},{"Title":"Girl Culture","review":"A modern classic that should be required fare for anyone seeking insight into contemporary American girlhood. Guaranteed discussion starter."},{"Title":"Girl Culture","review":"I first saw this exhibit at the CCP at the University of Arizona, when I was 18 years old. Since then, I have not been able to erase Greenfield's images from my mind. Not only are her photographs beautiful and powerful, but the testimonials that go with each photo are heartbreaking. After I saw the exhibit, I had to have the book... but I didn't end up buying it until years later. I was happy to find that the book has expanded content--more pictures, longer testimonials, an introduction by JJ Brumburg (excellent!) and an essay written by Lauren Greenfield herself. I highly, highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the psychology and sexuality of America's female population."},{"Title":"Girl Culture","review":"Girl Cultureby Lauren Greenfield is the print version of her touring photography exhibit which traveled all over the United States, including Arizona where I first saw it in 2002. It gives us a detailed look at women and girls of all ages and how media shapes female perception of sexuality and body proportions. From fat camps to eating disorder clinics, from beach parties to auditions, Lauren Greenfield captures what it means to be a girl in this contemporary moment. In her final words, she writes, \\"The body has become the primary canvas on which girls express their identities, insecurities, ambitions, and struggles.\\"A series of images look at the female relationship to breasts, beginning with 15-year old Amber attempting to force her breasts into the full version demanded by popular culture as her friend watches. This photograph is followed by young girls stuffing their shirts to outrageous dimensions in fun. Next, a young woman examines her post operative body after breast implants. This is juxtaposed to a surgeon performing breast augmentation.Before the almighty mirror women are encouraged to position their body, adjust their image, and accentuate with products what time takes away or genetics does not give.13-year-old Hannah describes the importance of preparing daily for school and a big seventh-grade party. She says, \\"In our group, people get criticized if you don't look a certain way. If you have a flaw, then you will be criticized whether you like it or not.\\"Self identified as overweight, 13-year-old Lisa explains the importance of consumer culture at her school. She says, \\"It's like everyone has to have a brand name . . . People shouldn't be stereotyped by the way they look. But, unfortunately, that's the way it is, and you can't exactly change that. So you have to live with it. All the time.\\"Women and girls feel powerless to change the existing pressure to conform to contemporary ideals of female beauty. However, it's not just suburban adolescents anxiously attempting to follow the winnowing media generated body, but also those within the industry.Captured on a stroll down New York City while several men assess her, 19-year-old Sarah, a model, rationalizes her career. She says, \\"I don't think my modeling is good for society. I mean, ultimately, what am I doing? I'm making a bunch of little girls feel bad about their bodies and go anorexic. I don't think I'm doing the world any good, but if the client is offering you ten thousand dollars to do a shoot for the day, are you going to say no?\\"Countless times, Girl Culture reveals the cost of beauty, a price in which women will pay just about anything. Ruby's Quinceanera (celebration of her 15th birthday) is sixteen thousand dollars. For graduation, girls at Cornelia Conley School of the Holy Child wear expensive wedding dresses and carry roses. In Tennessee, May Day ushers in May gowns in bright colors with contrasting bouquets for tradition. Gucci, Versace, and Prada seem normal accessories to prove both status and quality of womanhood.Girl Culture is a collection of one arresting picture after another. With assistance and a cheering crowd, a woman backbends to pantomime oral sex on the anticipating male. Moms primp with their youthful daughters before overflowing counters of cosmetics in nearly identical outfits. Fashion show contestants await judgment. Fat camp attendants await measurements. Children of 3, 4, and 5 undulate, re-creating MTV dance steps as they decorate themselves in makeup and heels.Every female reader will be able to find some image that hauntingly echoes their own pursuit of fitting into girl culture. Lauren Greenfield's Girl Culture is a visual critique of the same magnitude of Naomi Wolf's The Beauty Myth, Joan Brumberg's The Body Project, and Jean Kilborn's Killing Us Softly. However, don't expect careful analysis or directions on how to interpret these images. Lauren Greenfield skillfully presents images and interviews from those photographed and nothing more. It's up to the reader to decide what these images say about girls and culture. If your eyes haven't been opened yet, they will be after seeing these images.originally published in Empowerment For Women - Laura Madeline Wiseman, January, 2005"},{"Title":"Girl Culture","review":"The stunning photographs of young women, interspersed with a few celebrities, are juxtaposed with essays told in first person by some of the girls themselves. Commenting on topics ranging from exotic dancing to weight-loss camp, competitive swimming to a high-school dance, these ladies are alternately self-assured and searching, confident and struggling to figure out what it means to be a woman in today's society. The images are important for the glimpse they give into the real thoughts of these girls, and reading them one is reminded of her own childhood and the desperation and exhilaration that is felt from one moment to the next. My one very small complaint is that not all of the girls who have contributed essays are pictured. The ones who are in the photos next to their essays are the most compelling because you are seeing the outward face of the person who just shared her innermost thoughts with you.Anyone interested in women's studies, photography, or sociology will find this a must-read."},{"Title":"Girl Culture","review":"Thought Provoking and moving.

Come on...fat camp? anorexics? models? a few spring break photos for good measure? Greenfield's book would've been groundbreaking in the early 90's, but her subjects have been done-over and over again.It appears that Greenfield herself was looking for something profound in her subjects. The results feel labored, and almost eager, as though the photos have an invisable caption attached. There is neither spontaniety, nor profundity in the way she frames her subject.There are a few photos which I did like. For example, the photographs of a young girl's quinceanera (a \\"sweet \\" fifteen) are lovely and refreshing.

Anyone raising girls, anyone who was a girl, and anyone interested in trying to understand women, should have this book! What a magnificent find!"},{"Title":"Girl Culture","review":"Lauren Greenfield's photographs from her most recent project, Girl Culture,represents an important return to traditional photography and a break withthe popular, staged work of the past decade. Using a 35mm camera andworking intuitively and spontaneously, Greenfield returns to the basics -picturing that which is important and reorganizing the chaos of the realworld into compelling and complex images that speak to our experiences asemotional beings. This may sound simple, but over the past ten years,photographers have moved far from the traditional approach and into theimaginative fictions of Hollywood films, utilizing elaborate productionscrews and massive digital prints. Greenfield, in a powerful and compellingexhibition and book, brings photography back down to earth, and in doing so,signals a shift in contemporary picture making.Greenfield has spent more than five years photographing young women andgirls, plumbing the zeitgeist for clues about body image, self-esteem,consumerism and sexuality. As you can imagine, the results are not pretty.They are skewed toward the complicated psychological arena whereself-awareness is mixed with victimization. The exhibition and book arequite different experiences due to the fact that the publication includedinterviews with the subjects. For a full appreciation of how vital thiswork is to photography and to womens studies, it is important to see themboth. I found a pervasive sadness to the interviews, wherein women spoke ofthe pressures to be thin, stylish and sexual and then expressed admirationfor these ideals, like an alcoholic who continues drinking, encouragingothers to join in.The exhibition at Stephen Cohen Gallery is immediately remarkable due to theintimate scale of the photographs. The prints range from 11 by 14 inches to16 by 20 inches with only a few being larger. This changes the experienceof the work by drawing the viewers in close to read and interpret theimages. Besides the modest print size, when we get close to thephotographs, we can see the tiny specks of grain and notice that some ofthem are a bit out of focus. This may seem sound like a criticism, butthese imperfections are a refreshing departure from the majority ofcontemporary photography, suggesting the haphazard complexity of real lifeand the mediums dependence on the artists unique vision.Greenfields photographs are well known from major magazines and oftendisplay a biting criticism and acerbic wit. These characteristics are usedmercilessly in some of the images. Lillian, then 18, shops at Kirna Zabete,New York shows the pretty blonde sitting in an upscale boutique, holding ared shoe. Her mouth hangs open in mid-sentence and its red-lined, ovalshape is echoed in the red, open-toed, ankle-strapped slingback she isholding. Lillian reeks of having too much money and too little taste, andthe photograph is an indictment of her shallowness and vanity. In theinterview, Lillian says she hates being a blonde but claims to be so onlybecause shes an actress. Her awareness of the burden of beauty isoutweighed by her greedy consumerism. Another highly critical image showspornographic film star Taylor Wayne, who, dripping in jewelry, strikes aclich&eacute;d pose, her massive breasts practically bursting from her dress. Shelooks like a parody of herself, more of a mannequin than a real woman.Greenfields tone is more forgiving when she examines subjects who have lesscontrol over their lives. The photographs of kids and teenagers, some atweight-loss camp, exude a compassion that is balanced with the artistscritical eye. Paula, 11, at weight-loss camp, Catskill, New York isheartbreaking but empowering. Apprehensive of the camera, the pudgy girlwith crimson cheeks turns her body away, clasping her hands in front of herchest defensively. Greenfield photographs her in the shade without a flash,and the soft, cool-cyan light bespeaks the girls vulnerability. Usingwide-angle lens and slightly tilting the camera, she keeps our attention onthe girls face and accents her expression and wide body. The image isgentle but also has the effect of suggesting her inner power and creates anoptimism not seen in the more critical pictures. So too with the image ofJoyce, Elysia and Alison at their friends sixteenth birthday party.Instead of primping or showing off, the three girls embrace and comfort eachother. The picture is so intimate that it reveals an emotional supportsystem so vital to many of the younger women pictured here.The power and importance of Greenfields work arises from its combination ofpoignant subject matter, powerful compositions and framing, and the profoundconnection between the subject and tradition the artist creates through hermasterful technique. The only weakness in the work is the dense contrastbetween shadows and lights in many of the prints which takes away from theiremotional strengths. Greenfield is often referred to as a photojournalist,which understates her importance in the art world. She is certainly notdriven to make pictures just because she is on assignment, but more likelyout of the desire to express her personal vision through relevant subjects.Like Nan Goldin who, in 1987, showed that there was more to photography thanpostmodern intellectualism, Greenfield takes us away from the monotonous,digitized unreality of so much contemporary fine art photography. In sodoing, she reestablishes the primacy of the individual artists vision inconnecting passion and subject matter."},{"Title":"Girl Culture","review":"They are always blond, it seems, and always thin: the Popular Girls of every woman's haunted teenage memories. They are named Monique or Sandy or, of course, Heather, and their lithe legs stretch a mile from their fashionably rolled-up shorts to their totally cool sneakers - a degree of stylistic perfection unattainable by mere mortals. They seem so preternaturally gifted that you wonder whether such grace can persist into adulthood. (Maybe you hope it doesn't.) You also wonder whether these girls are happy.Lauren Greenfield wondered just that when she traveled to Edina, Minnesota, in 1998 to photograph a story for The New York Times Magazine on the expansive topic of \\"being 13.\\" Her pictures of the glorious blond Alpha Girls ruling over the seventh grade there began to provide an answer. The photos also began to convince Greenfield that there was much to be revealed about the real lives of American girls. It all led to a new book, Girl Culture (Chronicle Books, $40), an ambitious effort that blurs the distinction between photojournalism, art, and social science. (An accompanying exhibition of the images opened in October at the Pace/MacGill Gallery in New York and will be traveling to the Stephen Cohen Gallery in Los Angeles in December and the Robert Koch Gallery in San Francisco in January.) \\"What I learned shooting the 'popular girls' in Edina was how hard it was to stay on top,\\" says Greenfield, \\"and how insecure they felt about their social position. One said she was afraid she would come to school one day and suddenly find that she wasn't in the popular group anymore. Another girl said that if she could do it over again, she'd rather have real friends who liked her for who she was.\\" Instead, she was rewarded for who she appeared to be.That raw truth - the tyranny of appearance in the lives of young girls and women-lies at the center of Greenfield's book. The girls in Girl Culture range from four-year-olds playing dress-up in spangly princess outfits to awkward teenagers arriving at a weight-loss summer camp to Las Vegas showgirls and strippers plying their trade. In one way or another, all of them are defined by how they look. Like the photographs in Greenfield's first book, 1997's acclaimed Fast Forward: Growing Up in the Shadow of Hollywood, the images in Girl Culture are often weighty with unflinching detail. In one shot, a showgirl named Anne-Margaret is seen reflected in her dressing-room mirror at the Stardust Hotel in Las Vegas. Taped to the side of the mirror is a handwritten note that reads I APPROVE OF MYSELF alongside pictures of models the dancer admires. That picture, shot on assignment for Stern magazine, got Greenfield thinking \\"about how girls construct their identities, how they use pieces of the outside world to express themselves.\\"Soon, Greenfield, who recently became a member of the VII photo agency, began seeing aspects of girl culture all around her: on an assignment in Florida shooting a story on spring break, with its \\"girls gone wild\\" partying; while photographing Chattanooga, Tennessee, debutantes who complained about being fat as a size four; and while shooting the Edina teenagers, whose unforgiving social structure was described by one of their mothers as consisting of \\"tier-one, tier-two, and tier-three girls.\\" Putting the book together, Greenfield says, was an intuitive process. \\"I made a lot of different pictures that seemed like pieces of the puzzle,\\" she says, \\"but I didn't know until I was editing it whether they would all fit together.\\" The puzzle included some surprising juxtapositions, tying together the worlds of girls and adult women. \\"When I looked at the exhibitionism of strippers, it reminded me of little girls and how they perform, how they look for approval,\\" the photographer says. \\"In pictures, you can't help seeing the similarities in dress and body language.\\"The work was also cathartic. Greenfield was once, after all, a little girl who grew into a woman in the American body culture, and she recounts her own teenage years of chronic dieting, anxiety about her own popularity, and a conviction that her outer appearance reflected the imperfections that lurked on the inside. In this Greenfield has plenty of company. One eating-disorder clinic estimates that 85 percent of adult females wake up each morning dissatisfied with their weight and appearance, determined to somehow replicate the ever-shrinking dimensions of \\"lollipop\\" actresses and models (so called because their heads look oversized atop their sticklike frames). Joan Jacobs Brumberg, a historian at Cornell University, who wrote the introduction to Greenfield's book, feels that the current cultural environment, fueled by commercial forces outside the family and community, is actually toxic for adolescent girls \\"because of the anxieties it generates about the developing female body and sexuality.\\"One bright spot in this dispiriting landscape of insecurity and self-blame is the rise of girls' athletics, which is credited with giving at least some girls a body identity that arises from their abilities rather than their decorativeness. Greenfield says that the athletes she photographed-including tennis star Venus Williams, members of the Stanford University women's swim team, and players on the Little Indians softball team in Naples, Florida, where girls' softball is a local tradition-had a sense of a goal broader than themselves. \\"They have a larger and more important context in which to see themselves,\\" she says, \\"that has to do with making a faster time, or coming through for their team, rather than simply looking good when they walk out the door.\\"The book also features Greenfield's bracingly honest interviews with some of the girls she photographed, such as Stephanie, 14, whom the photographer met at the weight-loss camp, and Sheena, a 15-year-old struggling with her body image (see page 56). \\"I think it's a challenging culture for girls to grow up in,\\" Greenfield admits. \\"My role isn't to condemn it, but to try to show the pieces, to put them together. This book is a subjective view of one aspect of the girl culture. It's not the whole story, but it's the part of the story that leaves no one untouched.\\""},{"Title":"Girl Culture","review":"I was walking through a local bookstore when the cover of this book caught my eye, and I was impacted immediately.

This is an astonishingly powerful book, and I've never seen anything like it. The incredibly evocative photographs are often coupled with a monologue by girls/young women. Both the photos and the monologues are exceptional looks deep into the psyches of girls and young women. There are average girls, popular girls, Latina girls, African American girls, girls at weight loss camp, girls at an eating disorder clinic, nude girls lap dancing....every kind of young woman imaginable. The photos hit me right in the gut....and I am shocked that I've never before heard of this author. Sometimes, the photos were disturbing, but only because they probably hit \\"too close to home.\\" Sometimes, the photos were lovely and peaceful. Sometimes, the photos were shocking and beautiful at the same time.I don't like to \\"tell the whole story\\" in my reviews; I think that completely spoils the surprise element for someone reading a book such as this for the first time.

I was 16 when Lauren photographed me. There is only one photograph of me and there is no story to go along with it. Why? Because I was a teen with a buzz cut who worked for a youth organization as a peer counselor. This does not fit the theme of her book, only the idea that I was controlled by our consumer culture worked to serve her concept so the rest of me was omitted. But hey, I like clothes so I must be a mindless drone of the beast that is consumer culture. I own the book now and I think what she is doing is admirable. Unfortunately I think she only shows one side and I am curious about the rest of the girls who were portrayed so negatively. This book makes a point that needs to be heard. It warns us of the dangers of our own materialism and the portrayal of women in the media.

Among the photos - which together could easily comprise a leaden (and rather predictable) commentary on the excesses of American girlhood - are some startling juxtapositions: in one, a group of smiling, glossy-haired students at a private girl's school hoist their candy-colored bridemaids' dresses to reveal lacy garter belts.

On the other hand the book also contains pictures and stories of women and girls who are happy to be who they are.Read this book along with \\"The beauty Myth\\" and you'll never look at another 'beauty'-commercial for clothes or cosmetics the same way you did before. Both books are true 'eye-openers'."},{"Title":"Girl Culture","review":"I just got back from Florence, Italy where my fiance and I came across this amazing exhibition called \\"Girl Culture\\" at the Forte Belvedere. Along with Gary Winogrand, Nan Goldin and Robert Frank, Lauren Greenfield certainly holds her own both as an artist and as a social commentator. I bought the book and have to say that I was floored by the interviews and additional images not included in the traveling exhibition.Lauren Greenfield is doing some ground-breaking work here, adding a visual layer to an already burgeoning discourse on modern femininity, the influence of the media and the increasingly deteriorating state of body-image in America.The cross-section of characters, ages, races, urban/suburban, school-age, college-age serves to hammer home the ubiquity of this \\"girl culture\\" experience. The interviews are heart-breaking, the images stark reminders of the dillusion of modern, female self-improvement. It is an inspriational body of work, an important look at our society at this time and place, but most importantly, it is perhaps the most powerful depiction of the 20th Century American female experience that I have ever seen.

There were some that I had read many times before, but others that I had barely read. The Tragedies are what Shakespeare is most noted for, and with good reason. Each of these plays is a masterpiece in its own right, and each of them provides such a wide variety of quotes that we all have heard over and over. That is the most enduring thing about Shakespeare - his mastery of the English language was so great that his words are still remembered today (almost four centuries since his death). Shakespeare has written thirteen tragedies, and I will do individual reviews of three of my particular favourites. The ones that I will further review are \\"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark\\", \\"The Tragedy of Macbeth\\" and \\"The Tragedy of King Lear\\". As much as I enjoy each of these the other ten should not be ignored either. Shakespeare could not keep some comedy out of his famous tragedies, and sometimes it is these comedic scenes that we remember the most. Who can forget the drunken porter in \\"Macbeth\\"? It is very difficult for me to pick a favourite out of these thirteen masterpieces, but I think if asked I'd have to admit to Macbeth. But read them all, they are well worth the time."},{"Title":"The Tragedies","review":"I love the 'Everyman's Library' series of Shakespeare. They are handsome and as another reviewer pointed out easy to handle and read, but the odd thing is the two sets of the Tragedies. What is conspiciously missing is 'Romeo and Juliet'.

The contents of the two volumes (thanks to other readers) are:Tragedies, Volume 1 contains: Hamlet; Othello; King Lear; MacbethTragedies, Volume 2 contains: Titus Andronicus; Troilus and Cressida; Julius Ceaser; Anthony and Cleopatra; Timon of Athens; CoriolanusAnd this is what the two volumes I purchased contained.I contacted one very helpful bookseller and she agreed that her copy did not contain R&J;, but she suggested I look at a copy of the \\"Romances\\" volume, alas, it contains:Pericles; Cymbeline; The Winter's Tale; The TempestSo my nearly complete edition of the tragedies remains incomplete.

I strongly recommend this edition for anyone who is not already familiar with Shakespeare's plays.I recently bought a Kindle edition of three tragedies. The type face is very good but there are no notes or essays whatsoever. I would not recommend any of the Kindle editions that I have seen for anyone who is not already fully conversant with Shakespeare's language.

If you are relatively new to TOC, books from authors like Eli Goldratt, Bill Dettmer, Eli Schragenheim, Debra Smith, Lisa Scheinkopf, and many others are \\"must reads.\\"These books, however, generally focus on explaining the details of TOC. This is necessary. In order to succeed with TOC you have to know what it is and how and why it works.But subject matter knowledge alone is not enough, if you want to actually use TOC in business. You must also have a valid roadmap for implementing it.In my experience, this is where many people fail with TOC. They believe they can \\"just wing it\\" and so try to implement TOC without having a valid roadmap. The results are all too predictable: they wind up lost in the weeds, the implementation fails, and the company becomes blocked from further improvement for a very long time.Mark's book is valuable because it provides a real roadmap for implementing TOC in a manufacturing organization.Throughout the book, you have the voice of a successful TOC consultant leading you to understand how to implement TOC in a manufacturing organization. The writing is clear and direct. The advice is concrete and actionable.The book also provides examples of various charts, forms and procedures that you can use as patterns for the materials you will need in your implementations.In closing, I am highly satisfied with this book and don't hesitate to recommend it to anyone who is considering implementing TOC in a manufacturing organization."},{"Title":"Manufacturer's Guide to Implementing the Theory of Constraints (The CRC Press Series on Constraints Management)","review":"This book is not just for manufacturers, but holds enormous value to any operation.

Non stop adventure, this was better than the first book. I read this in a few days, could not put it down."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"You must read Into the Wilderness first. Fast paced historical adventure with romance, mystery, and great character development. Follows the Bonners in both Early America and Scotland."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"I wasn't as taken with this book as I was the first one. While it promised to have a lot of action; kidnappings, rescues, etc., it was actually kind of boring. As a recap (and possible spoiler) the first book covered Elizabeth, a teacher who came to America and fell in love with outdoors man Nathaniel Bonner. Together they secretly elope so they can restore a piece of land to its rightful owners.We are first taken to Canada where Nathaniel has gone to rescue his father and a Native American friend of his, Otter. Unfortunately he is unsuccessful and ends up locked up with them. They manage to escape, with Elizabeth on the way to help them, but then her newborn twins are kidnapped from them by a devious servant of a relative in Scotland. This uncle wants them to come there so they can claim inheritance and he can keep the land out of the hands of his enemies. They have to enlist the aid of a pirate ship to get their babies back and then deal with all the deviousness of the Carryck relative and try to get back home.The majority of this book was spent on the boat. And honestly, while there are some things that happen on the boat, it certainly didn't warrant as much space in the book as it did. Overly lengthy descriptions actually seemed to take away from the book.Usually Donati is pleasant to read but it this book since they are headed to Scotland, there was a lot of Scottish dialogue. Normally this would intrigue me but I don't speak Scots and it made the story very hard to follow. I feel like I lost a good bit of the plot that was told through stories from Scottish speakers and I felt a bit lost as a result. I admire her attempt to be linguistically correct but it would have been extremely helpful to include a dictionary if she was going to be that authentic. The rest of the writing, however, was in an enjoyable style and easy to understand. The book was told in the third person.Overall the book wasn't bad, but it wasn't near as good as the first. I'll keep reading to find out what happens but I hope the next book is more interesting.Dawn on a Distant ShoreCopyright 200463 pages"},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"This book is the sequel to Into the Wilderness, which I read late last year and really enjoyed. The story picks up right where it left off with a gripping series of scenes in which Elizabeth gives birth to twins at home on Hidden Wolf with only the help of her ten-year-old step-daughter. Meanwhile Nathaniel is trapped in the village by a blizzard, desperate to get home to his wife, whom he thinks is only having one baby. A good way to draw the reader into the story and what follows does not disappoint: an adventure with a long, twisting, turning plot with many characters and viewpoints, romance, danger and surprises.The Bonners travel to Canada and Scotland, through wilderness and by sea. Ms. Donati writes very descriptively, and there's no doubt she brings settings and details into vivid life, but sometimes I felt like there was too much attention paid to detail and conversely there were several instances where I felt like not enough attention had been paid to the meat of the story. All of the storylines come to a head in the last few pages and thus the climactic scenes felt rushed and conclusions to a couple of storylines were not thoroughly fleshed out; I didn't feel completely satisfied. One example: near the end Nathaniel has to make a startling revelation to Elizabeth, but the reader is not privy to that conversation or to her reaction to the news.Some of the plot twists were a little over-the-top, but I once read that if you can write great characters, your reader will go along with anything you throw at them, and Ms. Donati has a real talent for writing characters that are complex and realistic and that readers become attached to. A large chunk of this book is devoted to Hannah, Nathaniel's tender-hearted half-Indian daughter, who struggles to come to terms with the cruelty and bigotry of others, and to find her place in the world as a child of two races. I was glad to get to know her so well and my heart ached for her. She is much changed by the end of their journey and there is a very fitting and meaningful rite of passage at the end for her.Overall I enjoyed this sequel. I've grown attached to the characters and I'm moving right along to the next book in the series, Lake in the Clouds."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"If you enjoyed the first book, I think that you'll like this one too. While the setting changes, and I understand that has been off-putting to some people, I felt like the story was still as engaging as before and remained true to the characters. If you're a Gabaldon fan, there's a decent chance that you'll like this series by Donati as a means of filling the time before Gabaldon's newest! These are good reads. Smart, well written, historically accurate and comelling characters. Love it!"},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"I tend to get drawn into epics and this was no exception.

Then it seemed to drag and I found myself skimming through pages. Also, I found a few too many similarities with the Outlander series...the &quot;civilized&quot; lady falling in love with the &quot;savage&quot; ,long haired man...the Scottish dialogue...the endless amount of adventure...All in all, I liked this book, however, I think I'll read a few other books before I move on to &quot;Lake in the Clouds&quot;."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"I came upon this book by chance, and was overwhelmingly surprised. It's been years since I read a historical novel that was so well written. But do yourself a favor, read Into the Wilderness first. I found myself wondering so much about references to things that happened in the first book that I just had to search for it to read. And I wasn't disappointed. But I do actually think Dawn on a Distant Shore is better written. There's so much action, every time you think a matter is resolved, another one pops up right on its heels. It's like Elizabeth can never catch a break. I am now eagerly awaiting the paperback printing of Lake in The Clouds. I plan to pass these books on as a set, to anyone I know who is into historical novels."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"This sequel to Into the Wilderness was fast paced and adventurous, but somewhow found time for us readers to see a bit more of the characters.

It's a delight!"},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"I picked up Into the Wilderness by accident and thought it was one of the best books I'd read. I counted the days til Dawn on a Distant Shore was released but found it to be, at best, disappointing. Truth be told, I found the story farfetched, the characters(who seemed so alive in Into the Wilderness) flat and, in some instances, just plain unlikeable, and the sea voyage boring. Absolutely nothing in this book caught my interest . . . strange, because I found the first book captivating both in terms of the developing storyline between Elizabeth and Nathanial and the book's historical context. I still look forward to the next installment, primarily because it's set back in Hidden Wolf where this story belongs, but I won't be counting the days until its release and I won't invest in a hardback edition."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"I have never reviewed a book before but feel compelled to review this one. I waited with baited breath for the sequel to Into the Wilderness and could not be happier with the result of that wait. Dawn on a Distant Shore was a wonderful book that brings back all the characters you know and love from Into the Wilderness and puts them into new and exiting situations. The best part, to me, was to see Hannah growing up. She is so mature and wise for her age. I really loved this book and I am already anticipating the next installment. Keep up the good work Sara Donati!"},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"This is a striking story on so many levels, that I'm afraid I'd exceed my 1000 word limit if I went into all the reasons why. Let me sum up by saying that Sara does not disappoint in telling a fantastic sequel and reacquainting us with Nat and Elizabeth. DDS is full of adventure and shocking plot twists, the dialogue is sincere and superbly done. How one author can manage so many dialects, so many distinct voices is beyond me. There are some wonderful and touching scenes between our favorite characters (you'll revisit passages again and again), and we're introduced to several spicy schemers described with such flavor I found myself laughing out loud (in public places, no less). I loved this story and can't wait for #3!"},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"I liked this. Better than the first one, I think, although I have to go re-read that one. I especially liked the way the characters are developing into more complex people. The scenes at sea are wonderful, but I have to say that I'm glad she didn't leave them in Scotland. Too much Scotland these days in love stories. Don't people realize it's wet and cold there most of the time? I'm looking forward to the next installment back on the ny frontier. Give me mosquitos over scotsmen anyday.I also have a theory about the reviews here that call this book boring (there are about five of them, I think). There are three reasons that come to mind to call this boring: somebody glued the pages together on you, you're brain dead, you've got something against the author. I suspect those reviews were all written by the same boring person. A vendetta? Sour grapes? Oxygen deprivation? Who knows."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"I very much enjoyed this book--I thought it was much better then the first one she wrote (Into the Wilderness), as it had much better character development and story line.

I am looking forward to the next one!"},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"this book is a demanding read - but it is well worth it. It is very detailed and brings the 18th century alive.

Although different from the 1st, DDS is a fabulous read.I love the strength that Elizabeth shows, that she is willing and capable to do whatever she needs to do for those she loves. She is NOT a wimp! She loves and protects unconditionally. I also love how her relationship with Nathaniel continues to grow and deepen, and stays so real.So many romance books out there are trashy and jump from one unbelieveable sex scene to another... if that's what YOU like, great, but that's not me. This book has a wonderful story, believeable characters, good dialogue, and Sara's fabulous writing style. I have already recommended this series to several people."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"What a wonderful, long awaited sequel!

The characters of Nathaniel and Elizabeth and their relationship with each other is so real and believable. What a love they have! While I was sorry to see them leave their wilderness for this story, it was a great adventure to follow them across the ocean to Scotland. And I enjoyed the ride immensely. Sara Donati does a wonderful job of describing the world of over a hundred years ago. I love the way actual historical people are sprinkled through her books. It adds even more realism to the story. She had me seeing and feeling it as if I were really there.

The story just gets better and better."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"Dawn on a Distant Shore by Sara Donati is the sequel to Into the Wilderness and continues Elizabeth and Nathaniel's story. It beings in media res with Elizabeth giving birth to her twins. Soon after, she straps them to her back and sets out through the winter to save her husband from being hung as a spy. The tension at the beginning of the novel sets the tone for the entire book. If strapping infants to your back isn't complicated enough, they and their older sister, Hannah, get kidnapped, forcing Elizabeth and Nathaniel to sail across the Atlantic to retrieve them.I liked this book quite a bit better than the first. I found the characters to be much more believable and lovable. There's still great chemistry between Nathaniel and Elizabeth, but you could really tell how much they love each other. Losing their children solidified that for me. I also loved that there was a sea voyage. I know a lot of people think that part of the book dragged on and on but I ultimately thought it was a great way to flesh out the characters and give them and their personalities time to shine and grow. We learn so much about Hannah and see what kind of woman she's growing up to be. By the time they reach Scotland, the story really starts to pick up. There's a bit of politics, family intrigue, and some interesting family history that gives the Bonners a more complete family tree.I have to recommend this series to fans of Diana Gabaldon. Though Donati's storytelling isn't quite as up-to-par as Gabaldon, she still knows how to tell a great story. It's solid historical romance."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"The 2nd book, was very good. I preferred the story line in the wilderness of NY, but it was a swashbucklingly good story in itself. I like the characters that where brought in. Just wish kindle made it clearer that these books are part of a series, and which one comes after the other."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"Dawn on a Distant Shore is the second novel in Sara Donati's Wilderness Series and I recommend to read the first, Into the Wilderness prior to this one as these novels don't really stand alone.As parents to newborn twins, Nathaniel and Elizabeth Bonner are hoping for some peace and time away from adventures such as they experienced in Into the Wilderness, but there is still the matter of Moncrieff, the Scot, hoping to track down Hawkeye, Nathaniel's father, as the heir to a piece of land and an earldom in Scotland.When Nathaniel receives the distressing news that his father is imprisoned in a Montreal garrison, he makes the difficult decision to leave and help him. Elizabeth then receives the subsequent news that the attempt didn't go well and Nathaniel is also imprisoned, so she bundles up her children and heads for Montreal where things quickly spiral out of control and everyone underestimates the desperation and stubbornness of Moncrieff with shocking results.I found this book to be quite slow, especially in comparison to Into the Wilderness which I eagerly devoured, and it seems to take a long time to build up to the point where the reader understands the entire plot and the Scottish characters motivations. In this case, I think the book suffered from the change of scenery from New York state and Lake in the Clouds which were so excellently portrayed in the first novel. This book doesn't transport you to the frontier but is still an interesting read. I'm looking forward to continuing the series."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"Always a great shopping experience, correct description, reasonable pricing, very fast mailing,great packaging, just a 5 star review.

Sara Donati lets you live the life of Natanial and Elizabeth. I cannot wait until the next book comes out!!!"},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"I admit, I am a sucker for a happy couple, and the added bonus to this book was a quick look at where Jaime and Claire are. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to be taken to another time and place and make new friends. I read both books in this series, and have fallen in love with the characters."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"Sara Donati has become one of my favorite authors. This second novel is every bit as well written as the first one was. Ms. Donati takes you back in time and you enjoy the scenery and adventures. I think that Ms. Donati should be on the best seller list. If you have not read &quot;Into The Wilderness&quot; please do yourself a favor and read it! Then enjoy &quot;Dawn on a Distant Shore&quot;. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It was like visiting with old friends. The story was exciting- not a sleeper at all. I could relate to the strong emotions shown by the charactors towards their children. I love a good historical novel with an intelligent love story and this series is one of the best. Bring on the next book, Sara!"},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"I loved the book! However, it was quite different from Into The Wilderness. Into The Wilderness was an introduction to the people and life in the Endless Forest. This book examined the primal instincts human beings have when protecting their children and loved ones. In this book we get an inside look at Nathanial and Elizabeth's relationship. Their complete and unconditional acceptance of each other, shines through. As a reader, I could actually feel their need to keep their family and each other safe. Characters such as Aunt Merriweather and Will Spencer are no longer in the background. They become important, lovable and filled with humor. Nathaniel's daughter Hannah, becomes a very complex and unusual girl. I look forward to watching her grow up into a very interesting woman in the upcoming books. The ending of the book was my favorite part, and left me with a warm feeling and wanting much more. I guess there is no hope for me now that I am addicted to yet another series of historical fiction."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"Wonderful Adventure!What fun, while DDS has a different feel than the previous book, ITW. I found that the story was lot of fun. I carried this book everywhere with me for the 3 days it took me to devour the text. It reminded me of reading DG's Voyager (not to be confused with the same as)... it was full of adventure, non-stop action, great linguistic touches that made me feel like I was on location. Elizabeth and Nathaniel have their hands full keeping their family together in this chapter of the ITW saga, there are some interesting surprises, new freinds to meet and some heartbreaking moments. I loved it and look forward to the next book with eager anticipation."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"This book is different from Into The Wilderness, but that doesn't detract from it's worth! From the beginning to the end, the pace is breathless, wild and hectic. This is a chase novel, through and through. Ms. Donati keeps the emotions running high as we travel from New York to Canada to Scotland and the tension doesn't let up for a minute. She is able to convey the emotions and nuances of family ties and keep us interested in her characters. She comes up with a spectacular new villain and some protagonists that end up very sympathetically. While I admit I missed Hidden Wolf and the characters there, Ms. Donati has left many dangling threads that are sure to be dealt with in her third novel in the series and we'll see all these wonderful and not so wonderful people again. I really liked this book. I read it one sitting...long into the night!"},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"It's true that this sequel is different in tone than the first book, but I like the fact that the author doesn't repeat herself. Great sailing detail, exciting to the last page."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"DAWN ON A DISTANT SHORE is an interesting read - I strongly suggest that INTO THE WILDERNESS be read FIRST. It will clarify the many, many characters Ms. Donati as used to tell the story. A big plus is the time and place the novel is set in. I look forward to her next book!"},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"This sequel to INTO THE WILDERNESS is certainly a book any historical novel reader will want to read. I strongly suggest reading iNTO THE WILDERNESS first. It will make the reader better acquainted with the Bonner family, and other characters!"},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"Into the Wilderness was one of the best books I have ever read and I have been reading since a very young person. Naturally I couldn't wait to get into Dawn on a Distant Shore and continue the saga of Elizabeth and Nathaniel. It starts with Elizabeth giving birth to twins while only Hannah is with her and a raging snowstorm outside has kept Nathaniel and Curiosity down in Paradise unable to get to her. Hawkeye is in Montreal in prison and Nathaniel finally is persuaded to go up and see if he can get him out. This is due to the business of the Earl of Carryck in Scotland, who is trying to get Hawkeye (or Nathaniel) back there to carry on the line so the property won't be turned over to the English upon his death.Elizabeth gets word that Nathaniel is now in prison up in Montreal and is determined to go up and do what she can to get them out. She takes Hannah and the twins with her and sets off. Many twists and turns later, unbeknownst to Elizabeth, the men are broken out of prison and put on a ship to get out of Canada. They all do meet up but find themselves in a mess and on their way to Scotland. Curiosity and Robbie are there also along with Moncrief who has been sent by the Earl to get Hawkeye or Nathaniel back to Scotland. An old lover of Nathaniel's from his teenage years in Montreal plays an interesting part also. Much intrigue when finally the whole situation straightens out with Nathaniel finding out about a son he didn't know he had by this old lover. The boy agrees to take the family name and live in Scotland to carry on the family line.Not as riveting as Into the Wilderness but anyone who liked the first book would like this one as well. All the main characters stay true to themselves from the first book so it isn't dull. Just not as good as the first one but that would be a very hard act to follow. Just glad they are coming home!"},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"I don't quite know what to think about this book. It is very melodramatic and rather silly, as are most romances. Is it a romance? Perhaps an adventure story? As a family historical epic, it strains credulity considerably. As a novel it strains credulity considerably. Elizabeth is not a woman typical of the times. As one reviewer has already said, everything is black and white. This time the Scottish Catholics are the bad guys, I think. There is not much room for another opinion. The dialect is considerable and mind-bending. Surely some authenticity could have been added for flavor, but so much causes me to lose interest.I had a little trouble keeping up with names and locations of characters. The shell game of who is on which boat and when and how makes for difficult reading. But, please, how many rescue trips does Elizabeth have to make to Canada? One per book? The series is getting a bit strained but still is better written than many that have received a two star from me. I give it three stars for that reason but think it really deserves two--or one--or none. I will let the Bonners live their happy and drama-filled life without my help. I have no interest in pursuing this series further."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"I found &quot;Dawn on a Distant Shore&quot; to be colorful and also a look into how life was in the late 1700's in America and Ireland. It continued with the lifes of the Bonner family and close friends and brought back some characters from the past that added more intrigue. I read through it quickly because I couldn't put it down. Start reading yours and you'll see what I mean."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"Sara has done it again. She's brought back the same chemistry of Elizabeth and Nathaniel from &quot;Into the Wilderness.&quot; Against the backdrop of new places and new adventures, the story is wonderful. Sara has a wonderful way with words, making it feel as if we were right there along for the ride.The love and passion of Elizabeth and Nathaniel is once again alive and full. As they are separated, you can feel your heart pulling for their safety and reunion right along with them. I am anxiously waiting for the next release in this wonderful series, and wish to see Sara recieve a place on the bestseller's list for her masterpieces."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"This is a satisfying adventure/romance novel and a worthy successor to Into the Wilderness. However, I agree with another reviewer who says that Nathaniel and Elizabeth deserve a little peace and stability at some point. This novel runs along at breakneck speed, and some of the beautiful intensity of &quot;place&quot; that made Into the Wilderness so lovely is lost here. I hope that Sarah Donati returns to the roots of her series in her next book. She has a lot ot offer."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"When I had read Into the Wilderness I went out to the library immediatly and got Dawn on a Distant Shore. Sara Donati makes the characters in the book seem so real. I felt like I was part of the book. I felt their pain, joy, and worry with them along the way. I can't wait till the next book comes out so I can meet up with my friends again, and go along the new journey! This is the best book anyone could ever read!"},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"This sequel to Into the Wilderness is an excellent read; a high caliber novel comparable only to author's like Diana Gabaldon. The story of Nathanial and Elizabeth continues, taking you from the remote wilderness of upstate New York, to the harsh and volatile lanscape of the Scottish highlands. Well written, and well researched, I highly reccommend this book."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"The story was a bit on the long side, but was entertaining enough that I was able to finish in only three days. I loved following the budding romance."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"I recently read Dawn on a Distant Shore by Sara Donati and i absolutly loved it!! It has everything i enjoy in a book- the adventure, the history, and the romance. The storyline was really mooving; i could hardly put the book down- a real page turner. I'm gonna read the prequel- Into the Wilderness next. I encourage everyone to read this book and its for every age group (I happen to be 15)"},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"I don't give out five stars easily, but this book deserves it. I really cared about the characters and I am very upset about having to wait until the next book comes out to read more about them. This book is hard to put down because Donati keeps you in suspense the whole time; once one problem is solved another has arisen. It also made me cry when I read what happened to Treenie, and then Robbie. My God, that was sad!! Some have said that it is not as good as INTO THE WILDERNESS, but I disagree. DAWN ON A DISTANT SHORE strengthens your feelings about these characters."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"After reading &quot;Into the Wilderness&quot;, I couldn't wait to get my hands on &quot;Dawn on a Distant Shore&quot;. It was definitely worth the wait! I've read many good romance novels, but very few authors can blend romance, adventure and history with the depth you'll find in this book. The description is so detailed and thorough that the reader can actually &quot;see&quot; Elizabeth, Nathaniel and the rest of the characters. I was sorry that the story had to end (for now), and I'm certainly looking forward to &quot;Hidden Wolf&quot;."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"I was hoping to find another series that would be similar to Diana Gabaldon's books, but I was very disappointed. I still have not found anyone who writes like Gabaldon. I'll make this short and sweet in that I do not think that Donati has developed her characters as well as she could. I wanted the story to be wrapped more around Elizabeth and Nathaniel, but instead, much of the story came from Hannah's point of view. I realize this is probably due to the fact that Hannah's character is being built for an upcoming book, but I was not interested. Elizabeth's character was developed well, but I felt in both Into the Wilderness and Dawn on a Distant Shore, that Nathaniel did not have as strong of a character and hero image as I would have liked. I just did not feel the passion between these two as I had hoped. Even the ending was very weak to me."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"This is a great sequel to Into The Wilderness. Completely lives up to expectations. If you liked the first one, you'll love this one too! I couldn't put it down and finished in two days - perfectly set up for a third one - can't wait!"},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"When I read Into The Wilderness last year, it ended up being one of the top ten books I had read in 2002. Naturally, I was really looking forward to this second book in the series to continue where I left off with Nathaniel and Elizabeth.In addition to loving the relationship between these two characters, I was also drawn to the setting of Hidden Wolf Mountain at the edge of the New York wilderness. Sometimes I wonder why an author chooses to change the setting of a book when that locale was obviously so successful in the first place. In Dawn on a Distant Shore, Sare Donati forces the reader to accompany the main characters first to Montreal and then on a ship across the ocean to Scotland. This took away from my enjoyment of the book. If I wanted to be in Scotland, I'd be reading Gabaldon's Outlander series and not this one.With all that said, the main crux of this story is for Donati to get across to the reader how persecuted Catholics were in Scotland in the late eighteenth century and how important it was for them to keep their lands away from the Protestants. To this end, she has Nathaniel finding out that his father, Hawkeye, is a descendant of the Scott's of Carryckcastle in Scotland and the Earl of Carryck is very eager to have Hawkeye come to Scotland to claim his line in the family tree. In doing so, the lands of Carryck would pass on to Hawkeye's son Nathaniel upon the death of the Earl and would consequently remain in the hands of the family....Catholic hands. Needless to say, Hawkeye and Nathaniel have no desire to reside in Scotland so the Earl has no choice but to kidnap Nathaniel's children forcing him to come to Scotland to be reunited with his family. Have I bored you enough yet???A major part of this story takes place on various ships getting to and from Scotland. Ever since I read Moby Dick, there's nothing I like less than reading about ocean voyages. The other major section of this book takes place in Scotland and I like that even less because you have to try to decipher the Scottish accent when reading. Instead of having a cast of characters and some maps at the beginning of the book, I'd much rather have a dictionary explaining what some of the Scottish words mean. It took me forever to figure out that \\"ken\\" means know, \\"na\\" means not and \\"tae\\" means to.The good news is that the next book in this series, Lake In The Clouds, actually has Nathaniel and Elizabeth back on the land they know and love. It also brings back many of the characters Donati's readers enjoyed in her first book, Into The Wilderness. Based on this, I look forward to this next adventure and only hope that Donati has no plans to return her characters to Scotland...they don't want to go there and neither do I with this series."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"Wonderful Adventure!What fun, while DDS has a different feel than the previous book, ITW. I found that the story was lot of fun. I carried this book everywhere with me for the 3 days it took me to devour the text. It reminded me of reading DG's Voyager (not to be confused with the same as)... it was full of adventure, non-stop action, great linguistic touches that made me feel like I was on location. Elizabeth and Nathaniel have their hands full keeping their family together in this chapter of the ITW saga, there are some interesting surprises, new freinds to meet and some heartbreaking moments. I loved it and look forward to the next book with eager anticipation."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"After waiting for so long for this sequel, I certainly was not disappointed! The beloved characters from Into the Wilderness were brought back in a big way. The descriptions and dialogue written by Ms. Donati take the reader right into the story so much you feel as if you were there. The story itself is fastpaced and the action is non-stop -- but all is believable! And the best part is the ending, which leaves everything open for a continuation. I, for one, highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"This is the second in a series of three published books by this author. Following on the heels of the author's enormously popular debut novel, &quot;Into the Wilderness&quot;, this novel attempts to pick up where the other one left off. While eminently entertaining, it does not reach the heights of the author's beautifully written, debut novel.In this sequel, Elizabeth and Nathaniel Bonner have their idyllic married life in late eighteenth century Upstate New York shattered shortly after Elizabeth gives birth to a set of fraternal twins. Nathaniel, upon learning that his father, Hawkeye, an intrepid backwoodsman with strong ties to the Mohawk nation, has been arrested in Canada, departs to the rescue. When he sets foot over the border, he, too, find himself arrested as a spy and imprisoned in Montreal with his father, victim of a sinister plot.Elizabeth, never one to sit by idly, packs up the twins, and she, too, goes to the rescue. The Bonner men, however, are released through the intervention of others before Elizabeth and her entourage arrive. The hand of fate deals them yet another blow, however, when they all are spirited away by ship to Scotland, where the Catholic Earl of Carryck awaits their arrival. It seems that the Earl has determined that Hawkeye is his long lost first cousin and, consequently, his heir. The Earl means for Hawkeye or Nathaniel to inherit the Earldom, in order to thwart his Protestant adversaries. Unfortunately for the Earl, the entire Bonner family proves to be uncooperative, leading to many adventures, both on land and on the high seas.Part of the charm of the author's debut novel lay in its telling of life in Upstate New York in the late eighteenth century, with all of its historical underpinnings. That is entirely is lost here, as this novel takes a decidedly international turn. Some of the adventures are a little too far-fetched, making the novel seem a bit incongruous at times, though still eminently readable on its own terms. Those who enjoyed the author's debut novel will, undoubtedly, enjoy this sequel, though with an underlying layer of disappointment that the debut novel proved to be just too hard an act to follow. Still, notwithstanding this, I am looking forward to reading the third novel in this series, &quot;Lake in the Clouds&quot;, as will all fans of this author."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"Anyone who says this books isn't as good as the first is absolutely crazy! Donati has managed to keep the passion and intimacy in Nathaniel and Elizabeth's relationship, despite the many new characters she introduces, and the ever changing conflicts in the book. My only complaint is the loss of a well-loved character(but I won't spoil). The sweetness of E &amp; N marriage was so realistic I could visualize it! I loved the way Donati developed Hannah's character, and I hope that the other books don't forget about Jennet and Luke. This book leaves you drooling for the next... Sara PLEASE hurry with Hidden Wolf!"},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"Although this is a great sequel - the book comfortably stands on its own merits. I much appreciate the growth and change in the characters and focus. Hannah, in particular. I find her intelligence and pluck refreshing, entertaining and entirely believable. I'm hoping to see more of her in the future (and I know I won't be disappointed!) Keep up the good work.I must particularly note the quality of writing. Time and again I had to stop and reread an especially lush passage. I am also exceedingly impressed with the author's command of historical detail. She does not let it bog us down, quite the opposite - her comfortable, easy command allows the story to flow beautifully. To soar, in fact.One of my most favorite passages (writerly and for historical detail) is the bit where Hanna wanders off into the market and encounters the man with the moccasins (no more details I'm not a spoiler) - it was an extraordinary flight. Thank you!"},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"A great follow up from Into the Wilderness, again the story of the Bonner's kept me captivated the whole time I was reading it, again the characters are so real that you are living the story with them. I recommend this book very highly, I can't wait for the next one, Sara Donati has done it again, a book not to be missed!"},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"After reading Into The Wilderness, I was anxiously awaiting this sequel, Dawn on a Distant Shore. It is a wonderful journey, one that you hope will never end. Both books are outstanding, and I am looking forward to the third book. Sara Donati --please keep writing about Nathaniel and Elizabeth!"},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"Into the Wilderness was one of my favorite reads last year, so I was really looking forward to the sequel. Ms. Donati does not disappoint as Nathaniel, Elizabeth and their family are plunged headlong into a rousing new adventure overseas. All the familiar characters from the previous book are here, including my favorite Curiosity Freeman. The story begins where the last left off, with Elizabeth giving birth to twins with only her step daughter Hannah to help her. Nathaniel, his father Hawkeye and family friend Robbie MacLachlan are imprisioned in Montreal, and Elizabeth soon packs up her children and sets out to help her men folk. A series of adventures, betrayals, and double crosses soon has the Bonner clan off to Scotland to meet the mysterious Earl of Carryck, who claims kinship to Hawkeye, and has plans for the entire Bonner family.Although I found the book a bit slow going at first, I was soon completely enthralled with all the characters again and look forward to the third book in the series."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"This is a great sequel to Into The Wilderness, just slightly weaker. Being with these characters is delightful. Sara Donati writes smooth and forms great visuals with her choice of words. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"I was hoping that this would be a great sequel, but was very disappointed. The characters, except for Hanna did not develop at all. Nathaniel and Elizabeth had the beginning of a relationship in the first book and their characters were well developed, but they were very two dimensional in this book. That said I await the next book because I trust Ms. Donati will continue the story without destroying the characters."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"I got it at the library and boy am I glad I didn't waste my money by buying it, which I might have done based on Donati's first novel. I am sooo disappointed! This was a snoozorama to say the least. I guess I can only hope for improvement in the 3rd novel. This novel was just sooooooo slow and boring, Daniel and &quot;Boots&quot; had no chemistry which was very disappointing"},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"Though I knew this book was used, I felt the condition was not worth the money I paid for it. The cover was dirty and the spine is very cracked."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"It's a good thing that I read Into the Wilderness first or I never would have bothered to read another one of her books. I read it all, but I will admit I &quot;skimmed&quot; over the last of it. It was a definite sleeper."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"I found this sequel to be a big disappointment and pales in comparison to Donati's first book. This time around, the characters bordered on boring, the plot lines forgetable and Donati's sweeping prose sadly absent. I thought this was an overall tough read. Hopefully the next one will be more of a page turner like the first one was."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"The story falls over before it ever gets started. It doesn't convince me that the only course of action possible is for Nathaniel to try to rescue his father, or that any mother with the sense God gave a goose would take newborn babies on such a dangerous trip. I know Sacajawea went on a much harder trip while pregnant, but this book needed to convince me, and it didn't.The adventures and dangers are thrown at us too fasst and furiously. We are not given much chance to enjoy the peaceful spots or anticipate or fear the next obstacle. It's boring the way any laundry list of problems is boring if a reader don't care whether or not the characters get through it. Or if they don't really believe the plot in the first place."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"I loved Into the Wilderness! This cannot be the same author. It was boring. The characters were dull and the whole book dragged. I will definitly borrow her next book from the library!"},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"This book was a disappointment from the very beginning. One stand out irritation is that the author does not allow these poor characters a moments peace. From the very begininng we are launched into the latest drama - improbable tales, pirates, hangings, illegitamate heirs, castles - this has it all - the author should write for a daytime soap not novels. There is so little time spent on establishing a sense of beginning, middle or even an end before we are launched headlong into yet another overdramatisized journey. The Mills and boons romance is pure syrup . Later in the book one feels that we are meant to be impressed by the authors grasp of the scottish way of speech - it is only interminable. Not only can every character speak 4-5 different languages they are all so is so indestructable . I enjoyed parts of into the wilderness...though critisised the heroines near indestructable qualities...the pace she kept up was inhuman. I just shook my head in disbelief at some of the ghastly passages in this book and debated with myself whether I should finish the drivel. I notice that Diana Galaldon endorsed the first book but has remained silent about this one. I am not in the least suprised. This book has been published on the strength of the last - and did not deserve to be published on it's own merits. The only reason I bought the last was because of Diana's reccomendation. I will not recommend the book to my friends, and will throw it away rather than own up to reading a novel with so little merit. Leave the Scottish tales to Diana Gabaldon or Barbara Erskine. Total rubbish. I love a good trashy read at the best of times - escapism that allows one to learn a little about history as it's bought to life in a skillfully woven tale. This book just does not deliver. Shame on the publishers and author for allowing this book to reach the shelves of the public. I will not be buying any further follow up books and personally abhor this endless stringing along of epic tales. The later books always lack the same passion and interest of the first book and resort to outlandish escapades in order to keep our attention. (This applies to Diana Gabaldon too I'm afraid) Please put these poor characters out of their misery..and us too."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"THIS IS A VERY EXCITING ADVENTURE, LOVE STORY AND ABOUT LIFE IN A DIFFICULT SITUATION. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO THOSE THAT LIKE FICTION."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"I couldn't read this fast enough. This second novel in the \\"Wilderness\\" series is like eating a favorite meal that you've eaten and enjoyed many times before. All your favorite old friends are in here and new developments in their lives are interesting and exciting. Unfortunately, I ran out of book before I satisfied my appetite and now I am looking for book three in the series, but I don't know the name of it. After searching online here at Amazon it seems like it has been skipped over and gone right to book four.This book however is one in which many family secrets are revealed, the twins are seperated from their mother and a lot of time is spent developing Hannah's character. Possibly in preperation for an upcoming book devoted to her.Great read and I recommend it whole heartedly."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"Still loved this book and will continue to read the series but into the wilderness was a little better. This book has a lot more action and Elizabeth and Nathaniel (spoiler) are separated quite a bit. But as good read none the less!"},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"Although I thoroughly enjoyed Donati's first book in this series, Into the Wilderness, for some reason I dragged my feet about reading this one. Maybe it was because the synopsis made it sound like the majority of the book would find Elizabeth and Nathaniel separated, and that just didn't sound like any fun! I have just finished it and wished I hadn't waited so long to read it. Yes, there are parts where they are apart, but there were plenty of other elements to keep it moving along. I will not wait so long before reading the next book in the series. If you are a fan of Diana Gabaldon, you will most likely enjoy this series. You won't find the time travel element, but you will get a well-developed group of characters, good historical detail, and a variety of story lines all twining together. This book begins the focus on Hannah, so that the next book(s) in the series will move along with the generations of this interesting family."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"Second book in authors \\"Wilderness\\"series.

So glad I have a Kindle."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"I am thinking that I already did a review for this book...regardless...It being the book to follow &quot;Into The Wilderness&quot;...makes it worth a double 5 point review! After falling upon &quot;Into The Wilderness&quot; , by chance and loving it, I was very excited to see this book come out. I read both of them when they were first out and have shared them with everyone I know that enjoys historical fiction. Sara did her homework. The story follows the descendants of the character &quot;Hawkeye&quot; from James Fenimore Cooper's great novel &quot;The Last of the Mohican's&quot;. A surprise in the first book, &quot;Into the Wilderness&quot; was the cameo appearance of a character from Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series,Ian Murray. That was a treat. This book has so much detail that some point I found myself saying...&quot;well, can we move on now?&quot; but I soon regretted my impatience because what I hurried through was as it turned out a vital part to something that came up at a later date. So..as my final comment re the book and the author...Sara Donati, I think you are a fantastic writer and I anxiously await your next book!!"},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"This is a wonderful book that held my attention from the beginning to the end and consider this: English is my second language. The strong charaters, well researched facts and simplistic &quot;words&quot; made this book an excellent read. Sure, E's and N's characters dwindled a little bit in quantity terms, but their emotional connections had not strayed. Other characters such as Hannah and Curiosity had given this book well balanced perspectives. I can't wait for the third book of this series. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"Patrick O'Brien meets Sherlock Holmes meets James Alexander Thom, with some romance to add spice.Better than the first one, for my money."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"In To The Wilderness and Dawn on a Distant Shore were fantastic books. I would love to see another one. They held my heart and my attention. A great adventure."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"These characters are wonderful. _All_ the characters are wonderful, even the ones that only show up for a paragraph or two. Miss Donati is a little like Dickens in the way she makes every single person stand out. I think the way she weaves historical detail into her fictional plot is wonderful. Most of the time people won't even notice -- I only caught on to some of it because I'm distantly related to the Schuyler family -- but it really adds something.Some reviewers have criticized the dialogue, which amazes me. There is nothing archaic or formulaic about this dialogue and _comical_ is the absolute last word I would use. Some of these reviewers should cut back on the caffine.My favorite character is Elizabeth, but Hannah comes a close second.I'm supposed to say something critical too, so here it is: I didn't follow the stuff about the Tory with notched ears and his mocassins until I read it three times. Then it gave me nightmares."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"I couldn't put this book down! I love the way Sara writes and the way she writes makes me feel that I am there personally. A wonderful family are the Bonner's and I hope she continues the series. A must read for anyone who enjoys an adventurous tale. Aloha, Jennifer"},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"** SPOILERS **Sara Donati's second book in her \`Wilderness' series starts with Elizabeth Bonner's dramatic labour to twins Lily and Daniel. It's a wonderful opening chapter in which Elizabeth's step-daughter, Hannah, has to deliver her half-siblings because a storm has kept Nathaniel away.From there the pace only gains momentum as Nathaniel is forced to travel to Montreal and rescue his brother-in-law and father from gaol and the clutches of a conniving society darling.But the rescue doesn't go according to plan, and Elizabeth is forced to cart her twins, step-daughter and friend, Curiosity Freeman, across the Canadian wilderness to Montreal to retrieve her husband and assorted family members.Things are made even more complicated as an English lord is likewise on the hunt for the Bonner men, Nathaniel and his father Daniel, to ensure they claim their rightful Scottish inheritance.This book felt a lot like Diana Gabaldon's third book \`Voyager'. A lot of \`Dawn' takes place on the high seas, to eventually make port in Scotland. It was very reminiscent of \`Voyager'; just in the fact that pirates and privateers pepper the cast, there's a lot of ship-swapping to keep up with and hidden agendas to keep track of.I was ultimately disappointed with this second instalment. Donati came close, but never quite met my expectations in \`Dawn'. For one thing, in this book it felt as though Donati was skirting around certain issues and topics. The perfect example of this is in Giselle Somerville. Ms. Somerville is a woman from Nathaniel's past, a Montreal society darling who seduced Nathaniel when they were both 17. Giselle was taken by Nathaniel's Mohawk savageness, and since his departure from her bedchamber, Giselle has bedded a cachet of Indians and navy-men alike to satisfy her lustful curiosities. In \`Dawn' Giselle has turned her attention's to Nathaniel's brother-in-law, Otter, and Nathaniel is forced to travel to Montreal to recover the lad.There's a lot of unspoken baggage between Giselle and Nathaniel - both Nathaniel and his father, Daniel think on the affair... but they never *talk* about it. Elizabeth is especially intrigued by Giselle as a woman of her husband's past... but she and Nathaniel never *talk* about her. It is very, very frustrating. And the lack of conversation serves to put distance between Elizabeth and Nathaniel. I started wondering why they weren't being open and honest with one another - it may be an uncomfortable topic to discuss, but asking your significant other about their first loves and past relationships is a big and necessary conversational obstacle.I do still love Nathaniel and Elizabeth - despite feeling a chasm of difference between them for everything they *didn't* say, I still like them. In this book we glimpse what Elizabeth's life could have been had she not left England for New-York, and it works to illustrate how much she has gained from Nathaniel.As much as I still loved the romance in \`Dawn', Donati literally \`lost the plot' in this second book. My biggest complaint was that a lot of the action seemed to take place off the page. There's a big revelation half-way through the book that Giselle gave birth to Nathaniel's son all those years ago. Nathaniel learns of his estranged child, and resolves to tell Elizabeth about the boy, Luke, and to decide with her whether or not he leaves the boy be or tracks him down. But we never read the scene in which Nathaniel breaks the news to Elizabeth that he has an illegitimate son. It is in the final pages that we read a letter claiming that the Bonner clan tracked Luke down, and bought him back to Hidden Wolf in New York for a time. It is an absolute travesty that we don't get to read these scenes, that they are recounted to us in summary instead of scene. It is such a waste of intense dramatic scenes and a deplorable case of \`telling, not showing' and as a reader I feel terribly ripped-off by Donati.I will continue with this series, but I have a touch of resentment toward Donati for dropping the ball with this second novel."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"Into the Wilderness was absolutely top-notch so maybe my expectations were too high for Dawn on a Distant Shore. This story contained little action and far too much gossip. These wonderful outdoorsmen (and women) were confined to rocking in ships for 300 pages! I was as homesick for the mountains as Hannah was. I love Ms. Donati's characters but I was as uncomfortable as they were in their oversea adventure. I do hope she brings them home for the next installment. If I hadn't read the first book I would never have finished this one - the plot was too much of a stretch - but the Bonners are terrific and I had to know what happened to them."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"I didn't enjoy this one as much as the first one, but I usually think the first book in a series is the best anyway. All in all this is an excellent series, recommend!"},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"I read this book without ceasing on my Kindle, could not put it down....and now have finished book 3, Lake in the Clouds. Donati develops rich, endearing characters, so knowable, I found myself in tears, as I felt as if I could imagine myself as one of the residents of Paradise. The history I know is now enhanced and makes me love the people who began this great land of the free we call the USA. She has moved up high in my list of recommendations, Donati has, right next to Diana Gabaldon. Please start with book 1."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"If you are new to this series, read this review - then go buy INTO THE WILDERNESS and read it first. Some series stories can be read out of sequence, but this is not one of them. DAWN ON A DISTANT SHORE assumes the reader already has some background knowledge about the main characters, and wastes little time bringing newcomers up to speed on their history. Instead, the tale plunges headfirst into the action and intrigue, and you'll miss out on some enjoyment if you have to play guess and catch-up with the events that precede it.The Bonners of New York State, in early post-revolutionary America, trade the wildness of the New World for the jaded Old, as they are forced into a trans-Atlantic chase to Scotland orchestrated by Nathaniel's distant older cousin, the Earl of Carryck. The Earl, a shadow figure about whom we learn only from others' perceptions for almost two-thirds of the book, is desperate to induce one of the male Bonners to stand as his heir, and thus help him avoid forfeiture of his ancestral lands. Although it is Hawkeye, the eldest in the Bonner line, whom he originally covets (yes, new readers, this is the same LAST OF THE MOHICANS Hawkeye), any male Bonner will do - which, of course, means that Nathaniel and his baby son, Daniel, are also at risk. In WILDERNESS, fresh characters populated a virgin land, with all its beauty, sharp edges, and savage nature. In DAWN, almost a third of the story is spent at sea, and the dangers are more human than natural.Sara Donati's sequel to INTO THE WILDERNESS is a different sort of book, and it is hard to avoid comparisons. However, DAWN stands on its own as a complex story about family and political relationships. I admire the inventive mind of the author, whom I forgive (just kidding) for making me wait six months longer than I'd hoped, to read this book. What a devious plot! The various characters are unfolding their personalities layer by layer; this time, Nathaniel's and Elizabeth's relationship is somewhat taken for granted and less in the forefront, while Hannah, Curiosity, and Hawkeye receive more attention. Several new characters, including one nice surprise, make their appearances (to be fleshed out later, I hope). Too many times to count, I found myself rereading certain passages in order to make sure I had all the relationships straight. In that respect, the story parallels WILDERNESS, where the reader has to thread a path through the intricacies of kinships that blend English, Mohawk, and American blood.To me, this book felt like a transitional work - a necessary middle story to elaborate on background, context, and personalities, and to introduce new faces while pruning away others whose time had come. Readers of WILDERNESS will notice that Dr. Todd, a very central character in the foundation story, is absent from this one, as is most of the Mohawk portion of the Bonner family. I missed these characters, and I also missed the excitement, newness, and panorama of the New World and the fledgling nation setting that WILDERNESS gave us. DAWN is still a five-star book, for me, but like many of the other readers, and the Bonners themselves, I now want to go back to Paradise and Lake in the Clouds. Ms. Donati, I hope you'll take us back there next time!"},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"Sara Donati sure isn't afraid to take risks! Within pages of the beginning of the book she separates Elizabeth and Nathaniel, the heroine and hero she brought to life in INTO THE WILDERNESS. In the middle of winter Elizabeth delivers twins, but when the couple learns that Nathaniel's father, Hawkeye, and their friend Robbie MacLachlan are in prison in Canada, Nathaniel sets off to free them. He ends up being arrested, and this triggers a thrilling chain of events that leads the Bonner family and their friend, Curiosity Freeman, all the way to Scotland where they become the unwilling participants in age old political and religious conflict. Donati continues to explore the evolving relationship between Elizabeth and Nathaniel while bringing Nathaniel's daughter from his first marriage, Hannah, front and center. The end leaves open the possibility of further additions to Donati's saga. This is very good news, indeed, for her many readers who have come to care about this marvelous cast of characters. (And any book which cleverly manages to give Scottish poet Robert Burns a cameo is a winner in this reviewer's estimation!)"},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"I read Into the Wilderness and had to immediately pick up Dawn on a Distant Shore to continue reading the detailed way in which Sara Donati writes to take me back into a different time. I have to say that now that I have finished both books and compared the two,they are written a little differently. I enjoyed both books immensly. Dawn on a Different Shore is packed full of adventure and detail however there isn't the slow pace detail in the story to savor like Into the Wilderness had. I too look forward to another book from Sara Donati that will let us enjoy Hidden Wolf and the wonderful characters and setting she has created for us there."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"In 1794 at the edge of the wilderness in Upstate New York, Elizabeth and Nathaniel Bonner live in marital bliss. Their idyllic life turns even more blissful when Elizabeth gives birth to twins. However, Nathaniel soon learns that the British government in Canada has arrested his father, Hawkeye.Nathaniel travels to Canada to help his father, but instead finds himself incarcerated as an American spy. When Elizabeth discovers that her spouse could be hung for espionage, she takes her two children and Nathaniel's pre-teenage daughter from another marriage in order to intercede on his behalf. Her efforts go astray when someone kidnaps the twins. Elizabeth and Nathaniel follow the trail to his ancestral home in Scotland where they hope to once again become the loving family they were before Hawkeye was imprisoned.The sequel to the exciting INTO THE WILDERNESS, DAWN ON A DISTANT SHORE continues the post Revolutionary War adventures of the Bonner family. The lead couple is an invigorating duo who will charm readers even though at times their discussions seem so emoted that they feel comical. The support cast provides humor and depth as they help bring the late eighteenth century to life. The story line is impressive as the plot fully entertains the audience. Sara Donati creates an Americana epic that will receive much acclaim from fans and critics.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"Sara Donati is a master of her genre. Her work is exceptionally well researched and her characters are sincere and very endearing. In Dawn of a Distant Shore, the relationships and characters that were introduced in Into the Wilderness grow and surprise us. (Just take the touching relationship between Nathaniel and his exceptionally perceptive daughter Hannah.) If you loved Curiousity in the first book, get ready for a wonderful dose of her and her wisdom in the second. Get the book, settle down in your most comfortable chair, and buckle up! You're in for a wonderful ride!"},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"Sara has done it again. I waited over a year for her second book and she did not let me down. The book had a lot of different turns and surprises and I truly enjoyed it. Elizabeth and Nathaniel prove, once again that their love can survive anything. Sara writes so beautifully, her words are so realistic that if you stop and close your eyes you are living the life of Elizabeth and her adventures. This book was well worth waiting for but now leaves me anxiously awaiting her third book &quot;Hidden Wolf&quot;. For all of you who have read Into the Wilderness and Dawn on a Distant Shore know hours and hours of pure entertainment. I look forward to seeing if anyone out there in Hollywood has the brains to make a movie out of these wonderful books. PLUS I do not understand why she is not on the best seller list for both books. If you haven't read Into the Wilderness first I would highly advise you to before you read Dawn on a Distant Shore. Believe me you will thank me for introducing you to a very gifted and wonderful writer. Oh to have this kind of talent! Sara is truly blessed!"},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"Dawn on a Distant Shore is a well researched, well written adventure/romance/historical. It takes us to a part of our history that isn't well known and gives us a panoramic look at this fledgling country as well as a bit of our northern neighbor's story. Elizabeth and Nathanial are terrific, their love is profound and palpable. And Ms Donati's secondary characters shine also. Hannah is a wonderful little girl who is going to be fun to watch grow. Curiosity Freeman, the backbone of the little troop, is just plain terrific. I enjoyed the Canadian scenes and felt that the family's mad dash across the Atlantic was especially exciting. This is a worthy sequel to Into the Wilderness and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"Sara Donati's long awaited sequel to Into The Wilderness is a real cliff hanger from start to finish. I could hardly bring myself to put this book down once I started it.Ms. Donati has done a masterful job of weaving together a story that has a lot of something for almost everyone. Romance, adventure on the high seas, political intrique, and just plain old delicious villany. The maturing relationship between Elizabeth and Nathaniel is utterly beleivable and some of the scenes between Hannah and her Father were so tender they almost broght tears to my eyes.This is the best book I have read since I finished Into The Wilderness."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"I loved this book! I really enjoyed &quot;Into the Wilderness&quot;, so I was eager to start &quot;Dawn on a Distant Shore&quot;, and I was not disappointed. Once again, I found the characters engaging, and the story interesting. There were some wonderful plot twists, and I am anxiously awaiting the next book in the series. I especially appreciated the realistic portrayal of Elizabeth's feelings and anxieties concerning her children, as well as the interspersing of actual historical figures into the story. It was a wonderful read, and I was sorry to finish it!"},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"I loved this follow up to Into The Wilderness! It lived up to my expectations and was well worth the wait. For those of you who have not read Sara Donati yet. I strongly suggest reading Into The Wilderness first as there are several references to people and events from that novel. It will enhance your enjoyment of this book and keep you &quot;in the know&quot;. I know I always hate it when people chit-chat about a previous party that I was not invited to! Don't let this happen to you. Read the first book first! Then you will not want to wait to read this one. As others have said, these books will take you to another time and another place. You will be so enveloped in the story that your friends and family will have to keep repeating your name to get your attention!"},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"Sequels often are big let-downs, but fortunately that is not the case with &quot;Dawn on a Distant Shore,&quot; the second book in a projected five part series that started with &quot;Into the Wilderness.&quot;Elizabeth and Nathaniel Bonner are still the focus of the story, which moves along at a fairly brisk clip, although it does falter toward the end when the action moves from Canada to Scotland. Elizabeth still exhibits the same moral and physical courage as she did in the first book of the series. When her husband Nathaniel follows his father Daniel to Montreal, the younger man is also arrested and is likely to be hanged as a spy. Elizabeth, having given birth to twins, takes her babies to Canada in the dead of winter to try to save him. As in the previous book, no one is ever quite who or what they seem, and the Bonners encounter many shady characters in trying to determine Daniel Bonner's heritage....the secret of which lies in Scotland.Sara Donati is a gifted storyteller. She has a good ear for natural sounding dialogue, her plotting is refreshingly original, and her characters are appealing -- even the &quot;bad guys&quot; have shades of gray in their character. My main criticism of this book had to do with the slowing of the action once the story moved to Scotland, and the fact that Nathaniel's daughter (Hannah or Squirrel) from his first marriage has started to take center stage. For some reason authors seem to feel compelled to make children in historical novels into little adults, and Hannah is no exception to that &quot;rule.&quot; Her emotions are simply too adult-like to be appealing to this reader. However, I still highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for something a little different in an historical family saga. The fourth book in the series will be out in hardcover this fall."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"After anxiously waiting for the continuing saga of Nathanial and Elizabeth...when i received the book..I couldnt put it down. I was totally enthralled. I think James Fenimore Cooper would be proud of what Sara Donati has done with the characters he immortalized in The Last of the Mohicans. I look forward to reading her next book and hope that she continues the saga with many more."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"Sara Donati is one of the best writers fiction has to offer. She is a master at creating emotional and exciting stories which are absolutely un-put-downable! In Dawn on a Distant Shore she continues the story of Nathaniel and Elizabeth Bonner and their family. For two days I traveled through upstate New York in the dead of winter, bit my fingernails in Canada, traveled the high seas and found my self up to my eybrows in intrigue and villiany in Scotland. Ms. Donati's marvelous writing style had me right there along with her characters. This is a wonderful story that's beautifully written. An absolute gem. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"Having read and greatly enjoyed the first book of the \\"Wilderness\\" series, I was eager for a chance to continue with the adventures of the Bonner family and their friends in the early 19th century.This second book, however, largely happens outside their hometown of Paradise, NY. First, Nathaniel, his father Hawkeye and their friend Robbie are being held against their will in Montreal, and wife Elizabeth decides it's up to her to bring them home. With the help of her friend - former slave Curiosity Freedman -- Elizabeth sets out for Montreal with her newborn twins and 10-year-old stepdaughter Hannah.Yet once they've taken care of business in Montreal, the family is far from a happy ending. The babies are kidnapped, forcing the others to set sail for Scotland. Again, against their will, the Bonners and company must negotiate with various shady characters and come to grips with long-buried family secrets in their hopes of returning home.Besides taking them away from the familiar small-town setting that made the first book so enjoyable, \\"Dawn\\"'s storylines are too confusing, involving a revolving door of villains, politics and overly melodramatic situations that seem a bit too unlikely to occur in anyone's lifetime, let alone a six-month period.Still, fans of the \\"Wilderness\\" series will probably want to pick this up, even to give it a nominal scan-through, as many of the stories begun in the premiere novel -- even those of secondary characters -- are continued and expanded. Similarly, new characters -- such as Jennet in Scotland and the Hakim, who begins Hannah's medical training -- are introduced."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"I enjoyed the rest of the series, but I found this book boring compared to the rest. Much of the story is spent on a ship, and I did not feel that the characters that were introduced were developed very well. The other books in the series are much better."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"This follow up to Into the Wilderness was very enjoyable. I was not too thrilled with the first book, but thought I would read the next book anyway. I was pleasantly suprised and got a better feel for the characters. I will buy the next one with interest!"},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"Enjoyed this second in the Donati series. Like the way history and narrative make an easy read."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"After falling in love with Nathaniel and Elizabeth in Into the Wilderness, I was thrilled to continue on with the series. Much to my dismay, this book did not live up to my expectations. Is it a coincidence that Gabaldon's Voyager and this book, both set mainly upon the high seas, were my least favorite out of each author's series? Hmmm. The only thing that kept me going was the promise of the third book Lake in The Clouds. The book is worth reading, don't get me wrong. Especially for those who continue on with a series. The Scotland thing seemed unnecessary to me. I would have been happier if they'd stayed in North America. Oh well. Artistic license."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"Sara Donati did not disappoint with the second book in the series. DAWN ON A DISTANT SHORE picks up where INTO THE WILDERNESS ended.As the reader expects, a peaceful calm life is not in store for Elizabeth and Nathanal. Their family has grown with the birth of the twins, plus early into the story, we learn that Nathanal has a son he didn't know about living in Canada.Hannah was given more exposure and it's a pleasure to watch this young girl grow. Watching her start to reconcile her Indian and white halves is an added bonus.Once again, Ms. Donati presents the reader with a story filled with historical detail, plenty of action, adventure and romance."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"For all those Diana Gabaldon fans, Sara Donati does not disappoint. Well written and researched, Donati's books are a must read. Her characters are multi-layered and three dimentional, and the plot intricate and captivating, to say nothing of educational. Anyone reading these books will not be disappointed, but especially those with high standards. Into the Wilderness, and Dawn on a Distant Shore kept me burning the midnight oil many a night. I highly reccommend this series, for which there is a third soon to be published. If you want depth, and hate &quot;fluff&quot;, then these books are for you. Thankyou Ms Donati for giving me something worth reading."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"Second in the wilderness series and very enjoyable. Good story line and strong characters. A book I couldn't wait to get back to."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"I gave the first book two stars as well, but now I realize how much better it was than this sequel. The first half was so slow and boring that I contemplated pulling out my hair on a few occasions. Once again I found no spark to the characters and thought them shallow. The situation in Scotland with the Earl was just too unbelievable, and yet the ending was the only good part in it. If I had owned the book I might have burned it out of frustration. Perhaps one of the reasons I just couldn't get into this book is probably because it is so false. If you're writing a sequel to \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\" then there is no Nathaniel Bonner because Cora Munro dies in the book, unlike the 1992 movie which its really based on. Plus, I hate hearing and reading that it is as good as Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series. WRONG!!!! Outlander and the rest of the series is perched on a golden pedestal a mile above this stuff. I don't think I'll finish the rest of the \\"Into the Wilderness\\" series, unless all the other books in the world are destroyed."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"I read Into the Wildnerness in November 1999 and liked it so much that I did something I've never done before ... I went to Amazon.com and looked up the author and discovered that the sequel was on it's way! I actually marked &quot;March 2000&quot; on my calendar to remind myself to reserve the first copy the library had.What a disappointment!I found the first 1/3 of the book very tedious and hard to follow; I couldn't follow the Scottish dialect easily, which forced me to re-read entire paragraphs. It seemed very disjointed, with characters thrown in almost as footnotes, and I found it funny that one of the characters, midway through the book, actually admitted that SHE didn't understand the connection of all the people involved. Me neither!The whole premise for the voyage to Scotland and the insistence of the Earl that Nathaniel and his father come there was anti-climatic and lame. I expected much more drama. No doubt this plot was rooted in complete historical accuracy (for isn't truth stranger than fiction?), but it wasn't, in my opinion, riveting enough to immortalize in a novel."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"I am a huge Diana Gabaldon fan and love complex characters and stories.

My only complaint is that this book did not have a Kindle edition."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"When I had read Into the Wilderness I went out to the library immediatly and got Dawn on a Distant Shore. Sara Donati makes the characters in the book seem so real. I felt like I was part of the book. I felt their pain, joy, and worry with them along the way. I can't wait till the next book comes out so I can meet up with my friends again, and go along the new journey! This is the best book anyone could ever read!!!"},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"The kind of book that makes you turn off the phone and ignore the kids. Those two reviewers here who said &quot;boring&quot;? I'm wondering if they read the same book. I suppose they need a nuclear explosion or the like to keep them happy.

Miss Donati has come into her stride. Bring on Hidden Wolf!"},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"Very disapointing. I loved Into the Wilderness and could not wait for DDS, signing up for delivery before it came out in print. I found it difficult to get into and just didn't keep my attention. I actually had to force myself to sit down and finish it. Sadly, DDS lacked the excitement and sexual tensions of Into the Wilderness. Definately not Sara Donati's best work."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"Like all the others, I couldn't wait for the sequel to &quot;Into the Wilderness.&quot; The bond between Elizabeth and Nathaniel was obviously growing strong and I was ready for late night reading. But when &quot;Dawn on Distant Shore&quot; arrived I felt as if it distanced itself from the characters. Keep in mind you HAVE to read &quot;Into the Wilderness&quot; first or else you'll have no appreciation for the characters! Donati assumes too much for the new reader to know.Encouraged as I was to see little Hannah blossom into a curious, independent child, I was disappointed that Elizabeth and Nathaniel's relationship remain as stagnant as a relationship can get after little ones arrive. The characters seemed to be caught in a bad nightmare and just wanted to wake up back in Paradise.Obviously the third book will bring us back to real issues that Elizabeth and Nathaniel faced -- trying to live peacefully in a community that has its own issues with diversity.I'm afraid this second book is a distraction to a story that still wants to be told back in Paradise! Bring back Richard Todd and Judge Middleton!"},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"Her first book was a real page turner and I couldn't wait for this one to come out. This was a sleeper. The ocean voyage went on forever. I felt like I was actually on the voyage with the voyage never ending. I couldn't wait to get of the ship myself. The story line at the castle was a pick-me-up, but you had to read several hundred pages before you got there. I was extemely disappointed in this book and the only reason I finished it was because I didn't want to see the money I spent on the book wasted. The scottish dialect was also very distracting and I had to keep reading passages over and over to get the just of it. Save your money."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"I was extremely disappointed in this sequel. I had read &quot;Into the Wilderness&quot; and loved it for the writing and characterzations. It was done so well. This book hardly seemed to have been written by the same author. It was rushed, badly written and I could not get into it. Such a shame from someone who had been my new favorite author."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"Sara Donati's first book (Into the Wilderness) was one of the best historical/romance novels I've ever read. Unfortunately, this sequel doesn't live up to the first. Story line not as compelling, characterization much weaker, even the romance scenes don't have the fire and sexual tension of the first novel. It's gets somewhat better towards the end of the book, but it's slow going to get there. I hope the author's next work is truer to her literary background and not so much influenced by stock ideas of what historical fiction or romantic fiction should be."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"Except for a very small portion toward the end of the book, I thought the rest was just plain BORING and struggled to get through it. I was really hoping to like this series but have been extremely disappointed after all the great reviews and comparisons to Gabaldon."},{"Title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"I'm reading this wile waiting for the seventh novel in the outlander series to come out.It's very good.

(You're the One!)","review":"Overall I really did like this book. Although it is very predictable, towards the end you are in for a surprise. I did not put this book down the whole time. I recommend this book for a 12 or 13 year old girl who enjoys book with romance and a little bit of suspense. At times in this book I found myself confused, but don't worry it will all come together towards the end. I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did!"},{"Title":"Era: The Dawn of a New Age","review":"Do you hear that buzz? Don't worry, it's not a swarm of killer bees. It's the buzz surrounding this highly anticipated first novel by Justin Strauss. Justin is an academically trained paleontologist, so you can be assured that he knows his dinosaur details.The book? Entirely gripping. If you like crackling, intelligent fiction, dinosaurs, and futureshock stories with twists and turns, then put on your bloody running shoes and sprint to the store to pick this up. Alternatively, whip out your credit card and get it now online!The characters are hewn from classic science fiction material and the action is first-rate. The reader will immediately notice that Strauss swings effortlessly between heart-pounding imagery and the subtleties of humanity without ham-fisted literary tactics common in the science fiction genre.Somebody should contact the movie studios about this. On second thought, they'd just screw it up. Go. Get this book."},{"Title":"Era: The Dawn of a New Age","review":"This book is a fun read. I spotted a whole of three typos.

A must-read for any who love dinosaurs - especially recommended young teens"},{"Title":"Era: The Dawn of a New Age","review":"This book is an entertaining read, but it does seem like the author took a decade to write it, and then a day to proof it. Grammar and spelling errors are fairly common, which I'll blame on the lack of an editor.When the book has dinosaurs or the three main human characters as protagonists, it's going somewhere, and doing it quite well. Andredea, Ham, and Josh are good people, with flaws, emotions that take the better of them at times, and moments of stunning heroism. The dinosaurs...you can't help with being emphatic towards. The early chapter following the life and death of a Compsognathus was really moving.Then there's the sticky parts. The book somewhat suffers from trying to spin too many plates at once. This affects the book, negatively, in two ways.One is that the USA is dealing with three major global catastrophes simultaneously. This over-complication of things doesn't affect the situation for any of the protagonists (majorly), it just introduces an unnecessary global component to the book. This book never needed to introduce the president and vice president of the United States.Two is that there already were a lot of plates spinning before two additional major global catastrophes were introduced into the book, that seem to be completely forgotten about. Like 150+ people who were passengers on a plane that just...sorta disappears as a subplot.And the ending kicks you in the face and is a (pardon me, Pantera) vulgar display of power.This is the author's first book, and I believe he can write well, but Era might be a case where his dreams were too big to put down into words. With editing and a sharper focus, his future work could be great."},{"Title":"Word Biblical Commentary Vol. 2, Genesis 16-50 (wenham) 556pp","review":"There is no question that this is one of the best commentaries on Genesis today. This commentary is one of the essential starting places for research on Genesis. His interaction with critical views is thorough, though if you have a problem with all forms of source criticism, you will definitely find yourself disagreeing with him in many places.However, Wenham is no skeptic. Many times in both volumes he points out places which clearly point to the antiquity of the text. He clearly holds a high view of the historicity of Genesis, as can be seen in his interpretation of the mention of camels in the patriarchal narrative (he sees them as a 2nd millennium luxury, rather than a historical anachronism). There is also extensive comment on the broader literary dimensions of Genesis, such as palistrophic and panelled structures, which highly suggests, at the very least, a high degree of editorial activity, so as to make source/form/traditio-historical analysis virtually irrelevant, and you get the sense that Wenham is on board here. I can't think of a single place where he allows source criticism to derail his exegesis. He clearly is treating the canonical version.The only place that conservative readers may find troubling is in his treatment on \\"The Religion of the Patriarchs.\\" If you are familiar with his other work, you know what I'm talking about. Wenham believes that there is good evidence that Yahweh of the Old Testament was earlier worshipped as El, head of the Canaanite Pantheon. One line of argument he uses, for example, is that Baal eventually replaced El, and is presented in the Bible as one of Yahweh's big \\"contenders.\\" In this respect, he is very similar to F.M. Cross.When all is said and done, however, Wenham is definitely a 5-star commentary. The good pastor/student understands that he must read critically, not swallowing, hook-line-and-sinker, everything is put in front of him. Nevertheless, both volumes by Wenham are well worth the money you pay for them, and will pay for themselves in edification and knowledge gained."},{"Title":"Word Biblical Commentary Vol. 2, Genesis 16-50 (wenham) 556pp","review":"No doubt Wenham and Hamilton have written the best conservative's commentary on Genesis. Longman said that \\"between Wenham and Hamilton, Genesis is well covered.\\"But to have both means you must buy 4 volumes because both Wenham and Hamilton separated their commentaries on Genesis into two volumes (Wenham: Genesis 1-15 & 16-50; Hamilton: Genesis 1-17 & 18-50).I have read all of the four volumes and found that for the first part of Genesis, Hamilton tend to be more conservative than Wenham (e.g. compared their interpretations on the \\"spirit\\" in Gen. 1:2), but for the second part Wenham has given me more insight (He always can find fresh meanings and applications from the famous Christian stories that I have been reading since I was in the sunday school!).My suggestion is if you have enough money buy all, but if you don't buy the first book of Hamilton and the second book of Wenham."},{"Title":"Word Biblical Commentary Vol. 2, Genesis 16-50 (wenham) 556pp","review":"Great Technical/Critical Commentary.A little heavy on Source Criticism and weak on the possibility of Mosaic Authorship.Does a great job of handling Hebrew and Literary structure.A must have for the Scholar/Pastor."},{"Title":"An introduction to the study of insects","review":"Borror and Delong's weighty &quot;Introduction to the Study of Insects&quot; enters its 7th edition as the standard text for students of North American insect taxonomy. This latest edition is brought up to date by Charles Triplehorn and Norman Johnson after a 15 year gap.As in earlier editions, Borror and DeLong is a comprehensive survey of North American insect diversity, containing identification keys for the insects and other arthropods along with brief overviews of each family and tips for collection and specimen preparation. Keys are mostly at the order and family levels of the Linnean hierarchy, with subfamily keys presented for select groups. This text is not a field guide; many groups are not illustrated, or are represented only by line drawings of particular parts of their anatomy. Rather, it is best used as a laboratory reference, a single-volume source for identifying insects and spiders to family. No other single reference has the breadth of this text, so Borror and DeLong should retain its place on the shelf of any serious entomologist.&quot;Introduction to the Study of Insects&quot; also contains chapters on insect ecology, physiology, and systematics, but these are brief. More appropriate texts for these areas are available elsewhere (for instance, Gullan and Cranston's &quot;An Outline of Entomology&quot;.)The 7th edition has been sorely needed. A recent wealth of DNA sequence data and rapid advances in the methodology and philosophy of systematics have produced a flowering of research on insect relationships. As taxonomic improvements accumulated, the 6th edition- the only resource of its kind- had grown increasingly out of touch with the state of the field. So it should come as no surprise that the most noticeable changes in the new edition (aside from the leafy green cover and smaller font size of the text) are in the classifications. Gone is the order Homoptera, sunk at long last into Hempitera. A number of families have disappeared into synonymy (e.g., Anthophoridae into Apidae), while others have been split out (e.g., Stenopelmatidae from Gryllacrididae). Other changes include a completely new beetle key, a considerably improved treatment of spiders, and the inclusion of a newly-discovered order of African insects, Mantophasmatodea.Triplehorn and Johnson unfortunately are uneven in adopting taxonomic updates across groups. For instance, the wasp family Sphecidae is retained in spite of a long-standing consensus among Hymenopterists that it does not represent a natural group, while other groups like the calyptrate fly family Fanniidae are split out in spite of a lack of consensus among Dipterists over its status. The authors also mix Linnean ranked categories (Family, Order, etc.) with non-ranked clades in several places, with confusing results. Given the extraordinarily dynamic state of the field, however, the authors can be forgiven for some of their decisions.Many of the revisions appear hasty, as though the book were primarily product of a publisher's deadline. For example, the utility of Michael Ivie's improved beetle key is marred by its incongruous insertion into the largely unaltered text of the previous edition. The chapter introduction treats the user to explanations of 6th edition characters that no longer appear in the new key, while scores of new and often complex characters are not explained in the text, do not appear in the glossary, and are not illustrated. I had to refer to Arnett's American Beetles numerous times to make sense of the new characters. In fact, with few exceptions (like Trichoptera), the figures have not been updated for several editions and users are left to puzzle over scores of unexplained couplets. Microsetose antennal grooves in Coleoptera? Dorsal versus ventral abdominal spiracles in Lygaeoid bugs? Adequate explanations will not be found in the text.The editing is sloppy. The formatting of taxonomic synopses appears not to have been checked as there are errors in indentation (e.g., the Calyptrate muscoid fly families are indented equal to their header). Page headers for keys persist well beyond the keys themselves. For instance, scale insect descriptions (pg. 324-328) are found on pages labeled, oddly enough, \\"Key to the Subfamilies of Cicadellidae.\\" The index is conspicuously error-laden (e.g., the beetle family Ciidae is nowhere to be found, but appears erroneously as \\"Cidae\\" and \\"Cilidae\\". And who knew that \\"Cermanbycidae\\"(sic) were long-horned beetles?). Some figure references in the keys have not caught up to the new arrangement of the illustrations; couplet 53 in the fly key points to an illustration that has since moved elsewhere.Distressingly, a few errors from the previous edition are left uncorrected, and new errors have been introduced. For example, couplet 11 of the Hymenoptera key still asks users to decide if certain wing crossveins are \\"present\\" or \\"present\\" (11' should read \\"absent\\"). Couplet 14 shunts wingless wasps to couplet 16 (the Apoidea) instead of couplet 106. Most moths in the common family Noctuidae will be incorrectly identified as Pantheidae because of a text error at couplet 59 in the Lepidoptera key.The family descriptions that follow the keys in each chapter are a mixed bag. Usually they are succinct and accurate, but some of the assessments of North American species numbers are dated. There are occasional taxonomic errors that result from outdated text carried uncritically over from older editions. For example, our Nearctic army ants have been classified in the genus Neivamyrmex since the 1950s, yet the text several editions later still refers to them as Eciton.The Borror and DeLong text remains without an equal as an all-in-one volume for the identification of North American insect families. As such, it is a shame that my impression of the 7th edition is one of missed opportunity. 15 years since the 6th edition should be plenty of time to draw up new figures to keep pace with taxonomic advances and illustrate the updated keys, and certainly enough time to put the text through the rigorous proof-reading that it apparently never received.(note: the reviewer uses this text in teaching a field entomology class at the University of California at Davis)"},{"Title":"An introduction to the study of insects","review":"I don't study Insects proffesionaly, I am simply curious about living things around me.

Remember this is only MY opinion, I could be wrong..."},{"Title":"An introduction to the study of insects","review":"Everything about insects is fascinating, and this book gives a comprehensive overview of their behavior, anatomy, and classification. For non-experts in entomology, such as this reviewer, the book provides the necessary background for further study. Topics such as the molecular genetics of insects and the genetic engineering of insects are not covered, but there are plenty of other books that treat these topics in detail. Only the first four chapters were read by this reviewer, but only chapter four will be discussed here.Early on in chapter four, the authors dispel the prejudice that since insects have small nervous systems and have short life spans, they are not automatons and can exhibit a remarkable degree of spontaneity. Insects can adjust to the circumstances of their environment and the organization of their activities can be extremely complex. What is most interesting about their discussion of insect behavior is the emphasis on how it depends on the internal state of the insect, and not only its nervous system but also its internal organs.The authors view the basic unit of behavior in an insect as being a \`reflex'. A receptor that is stimulated will cause a particular group of insects to contract, which is observed as a body movement of the insect. A \`releaser' is the stimulus that actually triggers a specific collection of movements. This results in what is called a \`fixed-action pattern', which, as the name implies, occurs the same way every time it occurs. To be contrasted with these are the \`modal-action patterns' that adapt to changes in the body position of the insect relative to external objects. A \`central pattern generator' the authors write, is responsible for the leg and wing movements of insects, and allows them to navigate in noisy environments. All of these considerations of insect behavior are interesting in themselves, but even more so considering that they are being applied to unexpected fields such as artificial intelligence. Indeed, the learning abilities of insects are being emulated in various machines in the last few years, with good success. And even, a new area of artificial intelligence called \`swarm intelligence' has arisen that is based on the behavior of ants.Along these same lines, the authors discuss four categories that he believes are useful in characterizing insect behavior. These categories clarify to a large extent the difference between \`preprogrammed' and modified behaviors. The first of these are called \`closed instincts', which are fixed programs. The second is more flexible and are called \`open instincts', where experience feeds back and changes the program. The third consists of \`restricted learning' and is the analog of classical conditioning. The last one is \`flexible learning', wherein experience can result in significant changes in the behavior pattern. All of these categories have found expression in machines, as well as the types of learning that the authors believe exists in insects: habituation, and associative, latent, and insight learning. The authors admit though that insight learning, where familiarity with relationships among (neutral) stimuli is obtained, has not been established without controversy in insects. Honey bees though they quote as examples of insects that can engage in insight learning. Very interesting also in this discussion of the behavior of insects is the use of mathematical models. As expected intuitively, these models involve control theory, but even more \\"exotic\\" approaches such as optimality theory and dynamic stochastic modeling. Optimality theory is used with the assumption that insects evaluate their state variables and engage in decision-making that optimizes their gain according to some criterion.Needless to say the learning abilities and behavior of insects is fascinating, and no doubt there are many surprises waiting for future entomologists. Their research efforts will not only assist in the better understanding of the most important representatives of the animal kingdom but they will be immediately used by those who are attempting to emulate this \\"primitive\\" intelligence of insects in machines."},{"Title":"An introduction to the study of insects","review":"This is a ***** book.

There is also information about common genera and/or species that often provides answers to frequently asked questions. At the family level one can usually make generalizations about an insect's role--this book is excellent in providing such information.

It was never intended to be a text in physiology, behavior or ecology. There are texts for these subjects available and just covering the systematic aspects of insects thoroughly is enough of a task.My only quibbles have to do with some changes in arrangement of orders that I am not sure of (such as the union of Hemiptera and Homoptera, and Anoplura and Mallophaga - the latter was also true of the 6th ed.) and the fact that scorpion taxonomy was apparently not revised at all, despite numerous changes in the last several years.However, that said, this edition is a continued improvement of a great classic of entomology. Among highlights are Jeremy Miller's and Darrell Ubick's excellent revision of the spider section and the new format for keys to the insects making them easier to use.Without a doubt this will remain the best standard textbook on insect taxonomy available and I recommend it with only the minor reservations noted."},{"Title":"An introduction to the study of insects","review":"the best book of its kind, i bought this book for a class but will defiantly be keeping it to refer to for years to come."},{"Title":"An introduction to the study of insects","review":"Great book , in great shape. very excited to get it.

Many places give the wrong page number for family info, many family descriptions are vague at best, and they present many terms in the dichotomous keys that they never define or describe in the book. So there were many couplets where I was left wondering \\"wtf is an antenna comb???\\". I don't know how all of the hobby bug people are finding it to be so great as with my educational background I find the text impossible at times.

The authors, both renowned biologists specializing in entomology from Ohio Sate University have greatly added to this compendium by focusing primarily on updating the area of Systematics (nomenclature) that includes the most recent data on insect evolution: - this area of expertise requires keen knowledge of Latin and Greek (for the authors) on nomenclature.Herein is provided an overview of insect behavior: - a discussion of their anatomy, physiology, & development; an overview of insect systematics, classification, nomenclature & identification, and finally descriptions of insects from the phylum Arthropoda to the Hexapoda and 26 Orders along with the distinguishing characteristics of many, many individual Genus species to be precisely characterized. For the uninitiated student, individual insects identification goes far beyond size, color, shape, and gross markings, but delves into the microscopic anatomy of appendages, mouth & head parts, sexual organs, detailed descriptions of their molting's, metamorphosis, generation frequency, migration, & distribution (ecology). Most recently, DNA studies are being used to determine evolutionary origins.In the case of Order Lepidoptera (Butterflies & Moths), the various Families within the order uses wing venation as a primary key, and with the myriads of these 4-winged members we are not or should not be surprised to find a plethora of pages of wing venation keys (precise drawings), depicting the individual vasculature all regularly numbered. We might suppose the 2-winged Diptera to be more quickly identified - and perhaps this is often the case.If you fashion yourself to be a budding or learned entomologist, this is the book for you to have: - too big for a field manual but just right as a desk reference to the bugs, beetles, spiders, flies, ants, etc. Highly recommended.finis"},{"Title":"An introduction to the study of insects","review":"It is the most appropriate book I have seen for graudate student who want to be an entomologist.

The book on Twitchell was pure fiction and Steiger played the role of publicist. Twitchell fed Steiger fictional information that was never verified or researched by Steiger, and Steiger basically entered into a conspiracy with Twitchell to defraud the public. It would seem that Steiger writes a book every-other month or so. Once again, this author has no creditability what-so-ever with me. He has distorted the truth so much in the past that I don't see why the general public can trust anything or any subject coming from this author of fiction passing itself off as truth!

This morning, I took the real College Board AP Spanish Language exam and it was a little different. Not completely different, mind you-REA got all of the basics right-but something about the tone and feel of the exam was different. The reading passages weren't actual narratives, but factual writings, two of them were reprinted from newspapers. On the listening section all of the accents in this book were from Spain (use of &quot;ceceo&quot;) but none of them were on the actual test.

The old saw of the mystery between God being all powerful and all knowing and all good has been challenged on all sides, conservative and liberal. Here one finds intriguing and vigorous pieces between two types of thinkers...process theologians and free-will theists. Process theologians deny various things about God being all powerful and all knowing. They tend to limit his knowledge and make God as open to internal change as we are. Free-will theists place more weight on the Biblical tradition and traditional categories of theology. They tend to argue for a self-limiting of God and occasionally limit God's knowledge of the future.Contrary to my fellow reviewer, these debates are not disrespectful towards God but seriously engage with the understanding that God exists. Grappling afresh with the big questions about God does not mean one despises the creator, but that one seeks to love with one's whole mind.Bravo for a stimulating book, worth a read to those caught in the wake of such debates."},{"Title":"Searching for an Adequate God: A Dialogue between Process and Free Will Theists","review":"This book is crucial for sorting out whether Open Theists are really evangelical Process Theists. This book's spirited, yet surprisingly irenic, dialogue demonstrates that while the two perspectives share a few commonalities, they are undoubtedly very different from one another. The 'Crucial Difference', as Open Theist William Hasker puts it, is that Process Theism dismisses Divine Intervention in human affairs, while Open Theism wholeheartedly affirms this treasured evangelical truth. While I do not adhere to either system, I cannot in good conscience label Open Theists as closet Process Theists, heretics or non-inerrantists for that matter. This book proved to me that the writings of Open Theists need and deserve to be taken at face value. There has been far too much eisegesis of their claims and not enough exegesis of them, particularly from the Baptist General Conference, the Evangelical Theological Society and the overall Reformed hegemony. While I believe Open Theism is wrong on many counts, I certainly wouldn't call it heresy. I highly recommend that those who wish to engage in fair, even-handed investigation on Open Theism's relationship and deviation from Process Theism read this book. It has proven to be the most profitable book on Open Theism I've read to date. I'm certain it will put many allegations levied against Open Theists to rest. So lay your presuppositions concerning Open Theism aside and allow its proponents to be heard on their own terms. You'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"Searching for an Adequate God: A Dialogue between Process and Free Will Theists","review":".Size matters. Many Christians know of J.B. Phillips classic book, Your God is Too Small. But few consider the possibility that their God is too BIG. When believers zealously attach all the \\"omnis\\" they can imagine to God, perhaps who emerges is not the God of scripture at all. What seems required is a God neither too small nor too big.Constructing an adequate vision of God is the principal goal for essayists in Searching for an Adequate God. Of course, as contributor William Hasker remarks, \\"it is our conceptions of God that must be evaluated as adequate or inadequate, not God himself.\\" Most essayists contend that a concept of God adequate to scripture, tradition, reason, and experience (the Wesleyan quadrilateral) is required or, as Hasker puts it, a conception of God \\"adequate for the faith and life of the Christian church.\\" Whether explicitly or implicitly stated, both sides consider their own theistic conceptions to be more adequate given these criteria.Given classical free-will theism's ties to evangelicalism and process theism's ties to liberal Christianity, it may seem unlikely to outsiders that the visions entertained by these camps overlap to any degree. However, even insiders may be surprised to find the large extent to which these visions can be harmonized. In many ways, Searching for an Adequate God serves as a bridge-builder. It reveals to the evangelical community that the process vision is more palatable than many had previously thought. The book also reveals to process theists, who typically run in liberal theological circles, that free-will/openness versions of evangelical theology are more palatable than they had assumed.Tenets pertaining to divine love sit atop the list of convictions shared by these process and classical free-will/openness theists. Both sides affirm that God is love; God lovingly interacts with the world; God is genuinely affected by give-and-take love with the world; and God's primary, if not exclusive, modus operandi is persuasive love. Free-will/openness theist Richard Rice comments, \\"Process thought is often described as a metaphysics of love, an attempt to develop a full-fledged metaphysical system from the fundamental insight that God is love. The open view of God [a.k.a. free-will theism] shares this emphasis upon the priority of love.\\"Consistent with this emphasis upon divine love and love's implications are the emphases by both traditions upon relationality, freedom (e.g., both reject compatiblism and determinism), and the social nature of the God-world relationship. Additionally, both reject the argument that God can have certain knowledge of the entire future. Given these emphases, it is understandable that both theological perspectives sharply criticize notions -- which theists derived from classical metaphysics -- portraying God as aloof, impervious, or all-determining.Both process and classical free-will theists affirm that God is providentially active in both human and nonhuman life. Both process and classical free-will theists hold that God is personal, purposive, and pantemporal.It may surprise some to find that the issue of biblical authority does not arise as a major obstacle in this free-will/openness and process dialogue. In this volume, the process theists never chide free-will/openness theists for the latter's insistence upon the primary authority of the Bible. Free-will/openness theists only occasionally scold process theists for failing to appreciate the biblical witness. In fact, both sides appeal to an interpretation of scripture they believe supports their own theological vision.The leg of the quadrilateral stool on which these theisms seem to differ most is Christian tradition. For instance, essayist David Griffin considers the tradition's doctrine of creatio ex nihilo indirectly damaging to the claim that God is love. A God able unilaterally to create the world is culpable for failing unilaterally to prevent genuine evil. He proposes, instead, a doctrine of creation grounded upon divine persuasion, theistic evolution, and a God-initiated Big Bang cosmology. Free-will/openness theists, however, accept creatio ex nihilo. For free-will/openness theists, the traditional creation doctrine supports a strong eschatology and explains God's miracle-generating activity.At the heart of their theological differences are the theories of divine power, although each can agree on a formal definition of divine power (e.g., God's power is supreme, and deity possesses all the power it is possible for any being to have). On one hand, free-will/openness theists contend that God possessed, at least at one time, absolutely all power. Furthermore, these theists contend that God can unilaterally determine some events or situations -- should God choose to do so. Free-will/openness essayist Hasker believes that a God who can both unilaterally determine (coerce) and act cooperatively (persuade) is greater, and therefore more adequate, than the God who only acts persuasively. Process theist Griffin, on the other hand, avers that God never possesses a monopoly on power, which means that God never entirely determines an outcome. Griffin contends that the problem of evil, among other problems, remains insoluble for theists who believe God that is able to determine unilaterally.Many of the essayists share fascinating autobiographical material. Nancy Howell, Wheeler, and Rice disclose how, in their own journeys, they embraced or rejected various aspects of process and evangelical traditions. For Wheeler, to cite one, the evangelical faith of his youth and the process theism he discovered in graduate school are not mutually exclusive. To varying degrees, these scholars live inside, outside, and/or between theological traditions. To use Howell's image, these authors maneuver among theological boundaries.Conceiving of a \\"right-sized\\" God truly matters. The risks and fears that Pinnock describes indicate just how politically-charged the task of formulating theology can be. This book provides a valuable resource for adventurers undertaking this all-important quest.Thomas Jay Oord"},{"Title":"Searching for an Adequate God: A Dialogue between Process and Free Will Theists","review":"I got this book, because I wanted to gain a greater understanding of Process Theism. I was familiar with free will theism, but certain aspects of it were troubling to me.

I enjoyed the debate format that gave others a chance to respond and point out weak points and strong points in each of the articles."},{"Title":"Searching for an Adequate God: A Dialogue between Process and Free Will Theists","review":"\\"Searching for an adequate god\\" is an anthology promoting a dialogue between Free Will Theists and Process Theists. One of the editors is Clark H. Pinnock, apparently something of a red cloth to the evangelical bull. (Just read some of the other reviews.) Most of the articles are frankly uninteresting. I never understood the difference between Free Will Theists and regular Christianity (minus the hard line believers in predestination). Perhaps the Christianity I'm familiar with *is* Free Will Theism? Didn't Abraham argue with God about the destruction of Sodom, didn't Jesus change tack when the Jews rejected him, etc?The main attractions are the two articles by David Ray Griffin. He seems to be one of the leading process theologians. Griffin very self-consciously wants to adapt Christianity to modern science and philosophy, in other words, evangelize people like myself. I can't say I was impressed. He ends up having the worst of both worlds. Unless I've misread him on some crucial point, Griffin believes that Jesus was an ordinary human with psychokinetic powers who wasn't really resurrected. Rather, he lived on as a spiritual \\"personality\\". So will everyone else. Already here, Griffin will loose most scientists, who will find it hard to believe in parapsychology or an immortal soul. Also, the admittedly fascinating metaphysics of Alfred North Whitehead probably don't square very well with the vaguely positivistic metaphysics I take it are most common among secularized scientists. On the more religious side, Griffin attempts to solve the problem of evil by denying God's omnipotence. Griffin's God is all-good but powerless. In fact, he is less powerful than humans! At the very least, that's the logical consequence of the process view.Why would a modern like myself want to convert to a creed that's just as unscientific as regular Christianity, while having no answer to the existential problem of evil and suffering?At one point, Griffin indignantly wonders what a Free Will Theist (or classical theist, for that matter) might want to say to a mother whose children are being burnt to death in a concentration camp. Presumably, the Free Will Theists must say that God could stop the murders, but has chosen not to, for some unfathomable reason. (The predestinarian response would, of course, be even worse.) But what is *Griffin's* response? That God *cannot* stop genocide at all, even in principle? In what sense is that different from the atheist answer? Griffin believes in life after death, but some process theologians apparently don't even do that! Small wonder Griffin calls for a world government (sic) in his article. Without the inadequate god of Process Theism, only a superior military force can stop genocide...You may interpret this review in any way you see fit. But yes, I like Pinnock's \\"inclusivism\\". ;-)"},{"Title":"Searching for an Adequate God: A Dialogue between Process and Free Will Theists","review":"This book proves Mr. Pinnock, rather than dialoguing with Conservative, Evangelical Providence-Theists, is himself an extreme libertarian ultra-arminian attempting a synthesis & amalgamation with Processism in reaction to his perceived brand of hyper-calvinism (which few embrace and none of the authors who devastate free-willism like Millard Erickson).This is Quasi-Processism plain and simple.CHAFF OUTWEIGHS THE WHEATMORE STEAK SAUCE THAN MEAT"},{"Title":"Searching for an Adequate God: A Dialogue between Process and Free Will Theists","review":"Mr. Pinnock does genuine Evangelicals a favor with this book and his more recent Most Moved Mover (the most Mormon of his writings to date, where he espouses an embodied deity not necessarily pure spirit-being, rejects a biblical hell, waxes processismically poetic about God 'actualizing his temporal pole', claiming Jesus misprophesied and a Bible full of errors).With this book, Pinnock proves that he and his followers like Gregory Boyd and John Sanders are neither evangelical nor pure Processers, but a dysfunctional hybrid of both/neither: in a class all their own, but not in the Biblical category in the areas where they depart from Historic Christianity.His writings in this book should be taken at face value: facing away from an Inerrant Bible and faced with a stinging rebuke from the True God,&quot;I am angry with you because you have not spoken of Me what is right.&quot; (Job 42)The main problem with this book and all Pinnock, Boyd &amp; Co pontificate and fabricate is: they have drunk deeply of Process Theory (see Boyd's TRINITY &amp; PROCESS for definitive proof), assuming much of Charles Hartshorne's philosophic framework is correct. But this bi-polar beverage has blurred their vision when it comes to reading Scripture and formulating theology. Instead, they have contrived a 'Neo-logy' which is less Biblical and more mormonistic, processismic, liberalistic, evolutionistic with every new book.Credit is given (thus the one lone star!) for being a master of Eisegesis (reading faulty presuppositions into the Bible that are distortive figments of fertile, vain imagination). But without mastery of Exegesis (author-intended drawing out of the supernatural textual meaning via Holy Spirit's inerrant revelation without presuppositional legerdemain), Pinnock gives the reader untraditional bi-polar neo-process contra-biblical false teaching, aberrancy, heterodoxy, heretical inadequacy."},{"Title":"Searching for an Adequate God: A Dialogue between Process and Free Will Theists","review":"While attempting to build a case for Open Theory of Bible Interpretation,which selectively/artificially literalizes much of Bible's God-analogous-to-man language (conveniently excluding physical form texts or Divine Unknown Question texts like \\"Saul,Saul,why do you persecute Me?\\" \\"Cain, why is your face downcast?\\" \\"Moses, why do you cry out to Me?\\" and dozens more)all the author has demonstrated is the debt Openness owes to Charles Hartshorne,Bi-Polar Processist (see separate review of Hartshorne's 'Omnipotence&Other; Theological Mistakes',so seminal/paradigmatic for Open Theory).He tries to distance Open deity from Process deity, and many points are valid [God is not identified with the world pantheistically or unable to use His power from time-to-time to intervene and make adjustments to the course of history, or of necessity dependent on Creation(merely by free loving choice),Trinity,Creation Ex Nihilo,etc.]Openness is not equivalent to Process, but the commonalities and co-presuppositions are striking and ramifications on how they do theology are often unwitting, yet like Greg Boyd,he acknowledges philosophical/metaphysical/rational/paradigmatic indebtedness to Hartshorne,without whom Open Theory would most likely not have come to be.Some excerpts from Pinnock's recent Evangelical Society essay highlight how far he has trespassed over the borderline separating Orthodox Christianity from Process and Free-Will theories:SELF-EMPTYING DIVINE ATTRIBUTES -We could think of Open view as a theology of kenosis,i.e. 'Self-Emptying'.God freely chose self-limitation for the sake of covenant with humankind,just as the Son of God,surrendering the divine glory to become human,chose to enter fully into the human condition and share in human suffering. It is characteristic of love to be Self-Emptying and the Incarnation reveals how God likes to use His power,not to dominate,but to love. In creating,there was Self-Emptying of Omnipotence (see Hartshorne's book above). There is also Self-Emptying of Eternity. By bringing into being a Temporal creation whose nature is expressed sequentially as unfolding history,the Creator granted reality to Time and ACTUALIZED IN HIS DIVINE NATURE A TEMPORAL POLE such that He knows things as they really are temporally in succession. There must be in God BOTH THAT WHICH IS WHOLLY FREE FROM VARIATION BUT ALSO THAT WHICH CORRESPONDS TO VARYING CIRCUMSTANCES OF A TEMPORAL universe. INCARNATION INVOLVES SO DRASTIC AN INVOLVEMENT WITH TEMPORAL reality we conclude Time is not foreign to Divine Self-Emptying Nature.This is enough of an idea from Pinnock's recent public teaching to conclude:1)It is unashamedly BI-POLAR as a theology,jettisoning the Biblical concept of MONO-POLAR Theism. Pinnock even used the processistic buzzwords of'actualized in his divine nature a Temporal Pole', and God is 'both free from variation and varies with varying circumstances',i.e.poles of changing and non-changing. The free-will deity is Bi-Polar in regards to divine attributes,thus double/dual/binary poles/terminals/loci/foci/cores of reality/nature/being/existence/relationality - straight from the Process Playbook as this book abundantly shows him in dialog with Process Theists.2)It's fine to emphasize the Incarnation of the Second Person of the Trinity,since that's the core of Scripture/Christianity.However,to violate Paul's dictum of \\"Do not go beyond what is written!\\" is to transgress Evangelical Boundaries into illegitimate territory:neo-Processistic Bi-Polarism. For Pinnock to conclude that since Christ became incarnate (remember this was a miraculous 33-year manifestation of Son of God on earth in human flesh to accomplish the sin bearing mission) means a continual/permanent norm of Trinitarian Revelation or change in God the Father and God the Holy Spirit or 'Self-Emptying of the Trinity to accomodate to mortal/temporal reality' is heterodoxy of the First Order.As the Bible actually teaches, the Son of God added a human nature to His Divine Nature without compromising/reducing/evacuating His Deity -FOR A SEASON ONLY (Pre-Glorification).To assert that the Father and the Holy Spirit also are Incarnatized,Finitized,Self-Emptying,Temporally Limited,Bi-Polar is to encroach WAY BEYOND what is written! Scripture knows of no such aberrant/overboard novel heterodoxy.3)If according to Pinnock God's Divine Attributes are all Self-Emptying (Omnipotence,Eternity, Omnipresence,Changelessness,etc.)then too must Omniscience be Self-Emptying/Temporalized/Limited/Finite. That's why he arrives at God not having any DEFINITE EXHAUSTIVE awareness of self-determining free-agent futures since they don't exist in God's 'present reality' to be known.The Future is NOT REAL!In summary, Pinnock here and elsewhere with his conditional solidarity with Processistic thought as evidenced by his dialogue with Process/Bi-Polar theorists to shape his theology ends up to no surprise with a deity quite different from the Bible as held by Jews/Rabbis,Church Fathers,Prot.Reformers,Roman Catholic,Eastern Orthodox,Evangelical Historical interpretation of Scripture.The Incarnation of the Second Person of the Trinity for a specific,33-year miracle of Redemptive Revelation now becomes normative for the First and Third Persons of God as well who also share in the Incarnatization on an ongoing basis to properly,lovingly relate to us,distorting clear Bible teaching and making a mockery of the true doctrine/purpose of Christmas (it wasn't after all 'Patrimas'-Father's sending; or'Pneumas' -Spirit's sending; or 'Trinimas' -Trinity's sending,but CHRIST-mas:Christ's,Jesus',Son of God's mission.There is profound Mystery in the Incarnation and Triune Godhead, but to twist and tweak Cardinal Biblical Truth into Mystical/Mythical speculation/conjecture about the Father and Spirit being also in a sense Incarnatized similar to Christ,and even the Risen,Ascended,Glorified,Enthroned,Yet-to-Come Son of God being 'Self-Emptying'beyond His Resurrection/Glorification/Exaltation is Aberrant Heterodoxy of the First Magnitude on Cardinal Doctrinal levels.(See separate review of Pinnock's more recent 'Most Moved Mover' detailing its almost LDS/Mormon conception of an embodied/not-necessarily-pure-spirit-being-sort of deity and an errant Bible as well as amisprophesying Christ and other contra-biblical speculation).This is what John MacArthur in 'Bound Only Once' has to conclude about Pinnock's brand of 'Self-Emptying Theism'-In C.S.Lewis' Narnia Chronicles,Aslan,the fierce but loving lion,represents Christ the 'wild,not tame lion,both good and fearsome.People who have not been to Narnia sometimes think a thing can't be good and terrible at the same time.'That same basic false assumption was the starting point for the heresy of Open Theism. New-model theologians assume God could not be good and terrible at the same time,so they set out to divest Him of whatever attributes they didn't like ('empty' him of them)and pad the ones they like (Love,Relational,Vulnerable,Intimate,Risk,Learn,Share,etc.)Like Socinians and liberals(processists)before them,they are on the misguided quest to make God 'good' according to humanistic/rationalistic definition of what they consider 'good',devising a deity of their own making (see Norm Geisler's book BATTLE FOR GOD refuting Open Theism).In the final book of Narnia,a wicked ape drapes a lion skin over a witless donkey and pretends it to be Aslan,a sinister,dangerous pretense leading countless Narnians astray. The Open deity is like the donkey in an ill-fitting lion's skin,leading many sincere seekers away from the glorious Son of God of Scripture.Aslan(Christ) is both good and fearsome,loving and wrathful,benevolent and terrifying,deliverer and destroyer,rewarder and punisher,blesser and curser. His wrath is just as real as His love,His fangs are just as real as His fur,His claws are every bit as real as His cuddliness.If only Pinnock would have read more C.S.Lewis and Scripture and less of Hartshorne,Cobb,Whitehead and non-evangelical,liberal theorists,books like SEARCHING FOR AN ADEQUATE GOD would never have been written or need to be exposed as an artificial lion skin covering revisionist fantasy."},{"Title":"Searching for an Adequate God: A Dialogue between Process and Free Will Theists","review":"This book joins a growing number using peculiar adjectives to portray God: 'Adequate','Open','Possible','Vulnerable','In Process','Progressing',etc. It's enough to make one wonder what the True God in Heaven has to say about the matter of His Glorious Person! The one strength of this book - exposing many of process thought's incoherences and unbiblical concepts (which can't help but make 'free-will theism' more palatable by comparison!) - is overshadowed by multiple deficiences of exegesis, theology, philosophy, logic, Control Beliefs(epistemology), Biblical adherence. The main problem seems to be an almost 'theistic evolution' concept: but the novelty is that instead of applying to creation, it here applies to no less than the Creator Himself! He too is evolving, progressing, in transition (changing as it becomes virtuous to do so), growing to be all He can be along with His evolving,in process creatures. This innovative conclusion arises from authors'Control Beliefs. These constitute interpretive grids, faith filters,believability indices, possibility parameters, internal discriminators, thought templates that are instinctively, involuntarily activated in the mind which generate values, paradigms, a priori presuppositions that adjudicate and arbitrate data gathering, processing, assimilation. They act as 'contact lenses' through which life is viewed and interpreted. Of course while wearing them, we don't see them; it's much easier to see what we perceive others are wearing. These non-objective (or partially at best) lenses inform us as to what is tenable or untenable; welcome or unwelcome; acceptable or not; tolerable, intolerable; logical/Biblical or not; friend or foe; true(as perceived) or untrue. With theological interpretation and formulation, Control Beliefs - our lenses - not only shape/shade what theories and beliefs we want to hold, but what evidence we will even be 'open' to in the first place; how much weight we attach to data; how we define terms and formulate conclusions; how we compare/contrast and analyze what is perceived to be Biblical,factual, logical, valid. (The old saying: 'We are entitled to our opinions, but no one has the right to be wrong with the facts.') All too often our Control Beliefs orbit around a few selective concepts integrated into our thinking patterns/grid from experiences, education,intellectual exposures, personality, influences (Holy Spirit, evil spirits, self-deceptive inner spirit).The authors' Control Beliefs are not documented,discussed, evaluated,compared for plausibility or correspondence with Biblical facts. It is tacitly assumed that their lenses are clear,20/20,unwarped, unfogged,uncolored,objective,correct universal prescription vis a vis opponents' lenses. Until this is addressed, no genuine dialogue seems possible with historically evangelical positions, since all the 'proof texting' or citation of witnesses or evidence will be automatically skewed or distorted by the sincere,but sincerely wrong undisclosed and unrecognized Control Beliefs, lenses 'seen through without being seen'. Neither 'process' nor 'openness' Control Beliefs align with the inspired divinely corrected lenses of the Biblical authors when all Scriptural data are considered in a balanced,plenary way. As long as process or openness Control Beliefs continue to control Biblical Control Beliefs (inaccurately and selectively drawn or eisegeted from 'friendly' texts), philosophy - whether Aristotle or Whitehead or Hartshorne or Hasker,et al; logic and extra-biblical lensing will retain a controlling and magisterial role viz.Scripture's controlled, ministerial role.

Meloni shows that Plone's remit is at a higher level of organisation. More to do with workflow between several users.Plus, these users need not be in one physical location. Plone lets a group distributed over the Internet work together. Plone can help enable new types of dispersed \\"multinationals\\" of just a few people.The book also has merit in showing how to use Plone to construct wikis and blogs. Two topical subjects. And very closely related. So both are described in the same chapter. Daresay that some of you will find this the most useful section of the book."},{"Title":"Plone Content Management Essentials","review":"A good introduction to Plone. But, there are a few typographical errors in code samples that will send you on minor troubleshooting trips. The author also covers some add-ins that cause errors when you try to remove them, again, causing you to do some troubleshooting. Not all bad. A little troubleshooting helps you learn the system."},{"Title":"Plone Content Management Essentials","review":"If you're looking to buy this book now for use with a modern incarnation of Plone, you may want to rethink your decision and look elsewhere. Aside from being written against Plone 2.0 (Plone is currently at version 2.5.1, with 3.0 looming in a few months), and thereby having some tips and instructions that no longer work as originally intended, the book includes some typographical errors (as do many books), a few of which are horrible and misleading. I've actually done everything from inquiring with the publisher regarding errata (you won't find any on the publisher's site for the book) and writing to volunteer the corrections myself (which went unanswered).The book is an excellent introduction to Plone and quite helpful as a kick-starter, but I would not by any means recommend it for use as a \\"bible\\" for what Plone is, can do, and can be customized to do today."},{"Title":"Plone Content Management Essentials","review":"The book starts out promising, with the first chapter being a very good quick intro to CMS and Plone and the types of things that CMS can do for you. However, once you start getting into the specifics, it quickly become clear that this book is now outdated. Many of the examples are hard to follow because the current version of Plone has different options or features. Also, the examples cover only the \\"low hanging fruit\\" - the easiest of tasks, many of which you can figure out on your own just by sitting in front of a browser and navigating Plone using common sense. (Which I ended up having to do, since the examples in the book are outdated.) You won't find the real-world answers you need in this book. Need to authenticate the users based on some authentication you already have, such as LDAP? This isn't the book for you. Only 1 page is dedicated to user and group admin, and that is basically a rehash of what you see on the screen in that admin panel. Want to know how to allow users to publish their own work rather than wait for the admin to approve it? Not in the book, you have to just figure it out by experimenting.This book does have its moments but a large portion of it is easy to learn just by playing with Plone on your own."},{"Title":"Plone Content Management Essentials","review":"This book has maybe six pages of useful info. It tells how to make a custom portlet.Much of what it describes is obvious from looking at the Plone interface. Moreover, I suspect that the author may not know Plone or Zope very well.Save your money. The other Plone books are better."},{"Title":"Plone Content Management Essentials","review":"This book is extremely readable. Concise and to the point. It gave me only the information I needed to do what I wanted to do. Perfect. All the other documentation I've found on Plone has been mostly geared towards coders and developers. I've found it a headache wading through it all. This book explained how to do exactly what I wanted to do with plone - get my website up and running, with the content I wanted and the look I wanted.A lifesaver, and an end to the headaches."},{"Title":"Plone Content Management Essentials","review":"If you are a designer who wants to know how to customize Plone's look beyond changing colors and fonts, you'll be disappointed in this book. Sure, the introduction is still good, but chapter 6 (for example), which instructs you to work with the Plone Base Properties file is giving you an outdated method, not well suited to upgrades and maintenance. I believe that stylesheets are the way to go, now...but I'm still trying to figure it out, no thanks to this book. The instructions for adding slots in Chapter 5 were just impossible to follow and did not even vaguely work. Yes, the text is in English, but the descriptions bear little resemblence to the Plone 2.1+ experience.This book will, however, give a somewhat glossy overview of the entire application. I would get a recent version of Andy McKay's book, and look elsewhere for customization help."},{"Title":"Plone Content Management Essentials","review":"The premise of the book is very good. The book gets you up and running on Plone if you're a beginner, and explains concepts and features well. That until you hit one of the many snags. There are several parts where the instructions are missing, vague, or utterly contradictory. It will definitely send you on a \\"troubleshooting trip\\" or you might just have to skip the section altogether. Just a warning."},{"Title":"El poema en prosa en Hispanoamerica: Del modernismo a la vanguardia : estudio critico y antologia (Poesia Hiperion) (Spanish Edition)","review":"This study and anthology is one of the most recent in the Prose Poem genre.

It isn't no coinsidence that Coopers photographs document Graffiti art during a period when the NY Art World was exploiting Urban aerosal artists. It is also very clear that she stopped documenting Graffiti when the \\"trend\\" ended in 1985. Though Coopers work documents a moment in time when aerosal art was King and Hip Hop was not yet a corporate advertisement, she does come off as an outsider/tourist when asked about documenting Graffiti, \\"I'm sure wildlife photographers feel the same way\\" about photographing animals when they run around. There is also the claim, by her publisher and graff-artists that she was the first photographer to document the origins of Hip-Hop. Jamell Shabazz's book \\"Back in The Days\\" never made such a claim nor did it need the fanfare that Coopers book fabricated. Jamell Shabazz,like Debra willis, Martin Chambi and James VanDerZee, documented a personal life and environment in New York before and after the trend came and went. Something to keep in mind!"},{"Title":"Hip Hop Files: Photographs, 1979-1984","review":"Anyone who is interested not just in the idea that such an underground culture could exist, but also the history and progression of it should check this out. Much of the text is done through quotes which gives a really great idea of the mannerisms of the people who lived during that era, though it's sometimes hard to get a complete grasp of the ideas that they are presenting.It truthfully surveys the elements of the Hip Hop culture and gives a nice history to each. A good introduction for anyone who does not know too much but it's also great for anyone interested in learning more."},{"Title":"Hip Hop Files: Photographs, 1979-1984","review":"I have read many, many books depicting the Hip Hop Culture (graffiti, breakin, rap/hip-hop, b-boy'in). None of these books have come close to the pictures and stories captivated by Martha Cooper. I remember when I was in High School and I first heard about Martha Cooper. I read her first publication and I was amazed by her dedication and accuracy. There have been many books that have attempted to capture what Martha has and does.........they are light years away.As an end note, I received this book as an XMAS present, I finished this book in its entirety in 4 hours. That should explain to how much I enjoyed the book; this one is a keeper for an old school b-boy."},{"Title":"Hip Hop Files: Photographs, 1979-1984","review":"Graffiti art has seen a revival of late. In Melbourne, Nike commissioned several graffiti artists to illustrate cartoony characters in an ambient media tie-in to its \\"You're Faster Than You Think\\" TV campaign. In October of 2004, Spiewalk streetwear hosted a gallery exhibition in which a dozen artists - many of them clearly inspired by graffiti or graffiti artists themselves - designed one-of-a-kind parka jackets that were subsequently posted on eBay for a charity auction. That same month, The New York Times Magazine wrote an article about the Web site woostercollective.com, which is a showcase for street art. So what better time than for Martha Cooper, the pioneer (along with Henry Chalfant) of graffiti photojournalism, to throw in her two cents, or subway tokens for that matter. But rather than simply come out with outtakes of her and Chalfant's seminal book \\"Subway Art\\" (Thames & Hudson, London), Cooper was clever enough to expand on the graffiti scene in the aptly titled \\"Hip Hop Files: Photographs 1979 - 1984.\\"In it, Cooper (along with interviews by Akim Walta) entertainingly chronicles the course of the hip hop movement of the late seventies and early eighties: the graffiti artists; break dancers; hip hop DJs and MCs; the influence of graffiti on the downtown Manhattan art scene; graffiti's transition onto canvas; main media coverage of hip hop; and hip hop's influence on fashion and culture. The photographs are accompanied by interviews, mostly with the participants themselves, which are spoken in a dialect as colourful as the graffiti that dominated the New York City trains of that era.A large portion of the book is devoted to break dancers, MCs and DJs, which is difficult to capture, in spirit, on paper. Cooper acknowledges this in one chapter (\\"You have to hear rapping and you have to listen to somebody spinning records\\") but, even so, the photographs in question don't have the photojournalistic dynamism and artistic merit of a Mary Ellen Mark, Eugene Richards or Larry Fink, which would have helped enliven the acrobatic skills and spinning turntables. Still, \\"Hip Hop Files\\" manages to achieve what no other hip hop based book has done to date: to unite the whole of the movement into one coherent package. And that alone makes \\"Hip Hop Files\\" worth the fare.(This book review originally appeared in \\"L&uuml;rzer's International Archive\\" magazine, Volume 6, 2004)"},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"I purchased this book several months ago,but didn't pick it up until I left for a road trip.I wished I had picked it up sooner.

From his engagement until nearly the end of the book, every woman in Greg's life does something to make him re-evaluate what is going on. Greg is drawn closer to his mother, who left the family when he was a child, and sister, who becomes a religious zealot. And we won't even get into what his fiancee puts him through.

When All Hell Breaks Loose was not perfect, but it sure was exciting and it kept me reading. I don't think she set black women back at all. If nothing, she finally showed that we as black women can be just as deceitful as black men. And the church issue was real too for people who think they are too holy to make mistakes.

I only wished that Ms. Spencer elaborated more on the mother and all the hurt and dissapointment with the family and all the drama that was inflicted by the good Rev. Dixion with his conniving self. Realistically, all hell would have broken loose if this was a real family. Maybe near the end with all of drama each memember was having would have brought them closer together, but pretending and keeping opinions to yourself, I don't think so. There were several scenes in the book that could have really highten the finale. I did not see thru Adrian at first, but the oral dial and the observation of the mother made me pay a little more attention to the imposter. I thought that the person was going to be Shareese, all Hell would have definitely broken loose then. The ending was cool. I like the way Ms. Spencer added that touch from Adrian. Even though the sister should have left well enough alone and hide under a rock somewhere, but after reading I guess person of her nature had to justify her actions.

YOU'LL GET CAUGHT-UP IN THE STORY, AND THE LIVES OF THE GREG AND ADRIAN. THIS BOOK MAY GET YOU BIG TROUBLE IF YOU TAKE IT TO WORK. TAKE IT TO WORK, READ IT ON YOUR LUNCH BREAK, BUT PLEASE TRY NOT TO GET CAUGHT UP, TO MUCH. BECAUSE ONCE YOU START TO READING THIS NOVEL, YOU WILL NOT WANT TO PUT IT DOWN."},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"It took me forever to find this book. When it came in the mail, I immediately started reading it. I finished it in one day. It was well written. The flow was great. Didn't get bored or slow at any point. I really felt so bad for Greg when he found out about Adrian. I kept wondering why his mother didn't like her. This book will keep you turning the pages to find out more."},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"After I finally found the book it was really worth it. Greg was so in love it hurt me to read what Adrian did to him. That goes to show you everything good to you is not good for you!!!!!! The key to the book was when his mother told him she heard Carla &amp; Adrian fussing over Tim. A must read book by a sister!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"In reading the book &quot;When All Hell Breaks Loose&quot;, one gets a feeling that this is the beginnng of a new era in African-American fiction. Not only are the people and situations real , they have depth. Camika seems to have a fresh feel of the African American culture. Her insight into the black church as well as different perspective on the black male may force many to re-analyze the way they view black men in general. A quick and easy read. Five stars...best book I've read since, &quot; Hazed&quot; by Walter Anderson."},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"Due to my long hours during the school year as a school teacher, I find it relaxing to save most of my books for the summer to read. I decided to read this over the summer and it only took me about 5 days(I have a 1-year old) to read. This was a great book. I enjoyed it. I would recommend it to anyone(male or female) who likes reading about our lives and situations. I was able to find a character that I could relate to."},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"This Book was a page-turning from beginning to end. The narrator, Gregory, had no idea what he started once he decides to propose to his girlfriend of three years. Everything around him just spins into disarray. His sister, Shreese's begns to see a precher, who Gregory believes has somehting up his sleeves. His &quot;long lost&quot; mother reappears back in his life and tries and start off again before she decided to leave to pursure her music career. Gregory's Dad appears to falling in love again with the woman who left him. What else can go wrong? Gregory's buddies don't make life much easier, but they just add to the humour that lies within this book. In the end everyone benefits from the &quot;DRAMA&quot; and grows individually. I enjoyed this book and await for another read."},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"This one was funny in places, a lot of truth, but sad in a lot of spots. I loved the character of Jamal. I thought that brother had it going on. The rest of them I was concerned about. It was a good page turner. Peace and love, Breezee"},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"This novel was truly a page turner from start to finish! I believe my pleasure with it lies in the author's ability to delve into the minds of men to reveal how they cope with and feel about women who betray, lie and reject them."},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"I picked up this book and from there it was on and poppin'. I'd read the reviews after a friend told me about the book and the reviews seemed (for the most part) pretty supportive. I like a good fast book too. With little mouths to feed and job and school, reality is all too much of my life so I needed some good fiction. When All Hell Breaks Loose was it. Even though Adrian wasn't honest and disrespected Greg, I know sisters out there who are foolin' brothers so it wasn't far from a certain truth (no insult to the real lesbians of the world but Adrian was confused, don't act like you don't know). Does anyone know about Cubicles? Will it be a sequel? I agree with the movie idea too. I loved this book! Oh, the language was a bit much, but I gave room for Ms. Spenser being a first time novelist. She'll get better because her story had all the great qualities of a good novel."},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"I feel like I've missed something since most people gave this book 4 or 5 stars but it wasn't anything special to me. The book was a fast paced, easy-to-read book but the plot just did not grab me at all. I bought this book because I was told how great it was but, after I was finished reading it, I felt like I read a different book than my friends. My major problem with the book, and thus the 3 star rating, was the plot was just too predictable. I felt like the book took way too long to get to the conclusion I could see coming after about the first 30 to 40 pages. I think Camika Spencer has a lot of potential, though, so I would definitely try another book of hers in the future."},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"I'd read the reviews and for the most part the reviews did nothing for me in the way of swaying me. This book was good. No, it wasn't Invisible Life or Disappearing Acts, but it was funny, thrilling, the characters were real, the story line flowed and above all, this book told it's story from a 20-something perspective, which I totally enjoyed. Sure it was predictable, but what Black story isn't. For once, this author told a side of our lives that we dare to address and I applaud her for it. I'm waiting on the next book."},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"This book was great, but any person with a bit of perception could see where it was going. Don't get me wrong, that didn't take from it. Sister got skills. I'm talking about the author, here. Mad props are sent to Camika for such a suspense filled book."},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"I THOUGHT SHE STARTED OUT KIND OF SLOW. HOWEVER, CAMIKA DOES A GOOD JOB OF GETTING YOUR MIND TURNING AS YOU READ THE NOVEL. YOU KNOW SOMETHING IS NOT RIGHT AND YOU KEEP READING TO TRY AND FIGURE IT OUT ON YOUR OWN. I WAS ABLE TO FIGURE IT OUT BUT I WAS STILL SURPRISED AT THE END. THE LAST FEW CHAPTERS WILL MAKE YOU SPEED READ IT'S SO GOOD. SHE DID A GOOD JOB OF TOUCHING ON AN ISSUE MOST PEOPLE DON'T LIKE TO ADMIT IS OUT THERE. I'LL DEFINITELY LOOK FORWARD TO HER NEXT NOVEL."},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"This was a very good book, but long and a bit drawn out, I believe that Greg needed to get over some of the issues with him mother earlier on, but that is usually the reality of things. I also found it hard to believe that his sister was so naive. Overall I would read her again."},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"I really enjoyed the book. The funniest part to me was when Greg told his friend to bring their own glasses the next time they vist his home. I am a faithful reader of black authors, and I rank them one as a one to read. I am looking forward to the next book."},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"This book was so good, that I finished it in 12 hours. My Book Club (The Black Online Book Club) will defintily read this book next month. Congrats go out to Ms. Spencer, for a wonderful, can't put it down, funny first novel."},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"This was a very exciting book. I finished it in 2 days. I cant wait for the next book."},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"BASED ON THE REVIEWS I EXPECTED A MORE SCANDALOUS SECRET. I kept turning pages hoping to get to the good parts. I did find it funny at times. I think there's some good stories in this author head. I'll give her another try."},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"In the beginning of the book I thought that she was going into too much detail describing every scene to the tee. But let me tell you nothing would have prepared me for what happened in this book. It was full of surprizes however one thing was apparent if you know how to read into things. My suggestion is get the book! Read it for yourself and laugh to you cry. As another reader said relationships are full of surprizes!"},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"I must really be suspicious of people but I feel alot like Greg when it comes to personal relationships and end being let down, constantly. Maybe, I'm choosing the wrong people or think that with the successes I have realized that the people that I interact with are quality people. Maybe, I'm too gullible or soft. Whatever the case, the story line was another of those reality checks. I really liked the book. It was very true to life. It strongly expressed the point that we can not truly know everything about a person and disappointments lie at everybody's door. This book was realistic for the society we live in today. Adrian had all the status symbols that spell &quot;conformist&quot;, &quot;successful&quot;, &quot;safe&quot;, and &quot;assimilation&quot;, and she still failed the test in the end. It's great to know that life goes on and &quot;after the rain, the sun (truly) does shine again&quot;!"},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"I thought this was an excellent book. The characters in the story seemed realistic. I really got into the story when Gregory's mother came back and how he dealth with her return in a very realistic way not with deep hidden anger. The title is so true, once Gregory proposed to his girl, Adrian, all hell does break loose."},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"This book was so good! I mean who would have ever thought that Adrian would turn out the way she did, I mean I was truly shocked. When you can read a novel and not know what to expect you got yourself a good read! Keep up the good work Camille and I look forward to reading Cubicles."},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"There comes a time when there is a need for a tale of comedy, betrayal, and relationships that is actually written from a view point where both the author and the reader are taken to a familiar place. &quot;When All... is a fantastic torrid story that keeps in step with the modern times. I can actually imagine people at our old alma mater playing lead characters. You have major love in Los Angeles. We need to support our young authors,because in time, who will tell our story, who will be our windows to the world. Read the book with an open mind and discover some people you may already know. Reciprocity, Ms. Emotion Brown!"},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"Camika, I couldn't put this book down. I received it for my birthday, this was the best gift ever. The charaters are so real. I can't wait for your next book. Keep up the good work."},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"Camika was always serious at ETSU, so to see her actually write a book with humor almost sent me to my grave. I enjoyed the book and it's good to finally see the author relax and live a little. I never thought she'd be an author either. All she ever did that made her smile was play Spades. The book was all that and I'm really just glad to know that I know someone who is taking the bull by the horns and following her dream. Hey Camika, remember that water gun fight with the Omegas and the time we kidnapped the guy we thought was on line for Alpha? Those were the days. I'm a supporter for life! Oo-oop!"},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"When All Hell Breaks Loose was indeed funny and emotional. I know all the characters too! It was the first time in a long time, that I've read a book that was just breezy and enjoyable without over narrating or under telling a story. Most of the things I assumed, I was correct about. The only thing I had to deal with was a mother who would leave her children. It was definitely a different twist that I've never read in any other book. I heard about Cubicles and I cannot wait to get my hands on it and see how Camika deals with a female telling her story. I heard Greg is coming back in Cubicles as well. Is that true? If so... THEN GOOD!"},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"I just went and saw The Best Man and that movie has nothing on what When All Hell Breaks Loose would do if it was put in movie form. I would like to see this book on the big screen. I can see Greg now walking in that room with Jamal and Eric. Woo! This book is definately a good quick, funny, get away! What can I do to let some big time producer know that they are missing out on this one at the box office?"},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"Camika Spencer is the best new author that I have read in quite a long time. This book was so great that I could not put it down. The best part that I enjoyed about Ms. Spencer's writing was how real it was. I felt like she was sitting next to me telling me the story herself. I really felt myself being a part of this book and the characters. I loved the fact that this book was written from a male's perspective and how he really felt about love. I could go on for days about this book and Ms. Spencer's creative talents. This was a wonderful book and I would like for Camika Spencer to know that I would recommend this novel to any and everyone I know. Keep up the GREAT work and I will look for your other books."},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"This book needs serious work. It is not worth the paper it was written on. Cameka set the whole race back by sterotyping Black women. she certainly has some major issues concerning the &quot;church&quot; and hairstylists."},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"I was shocked and when I read this book. I went out and purchased it because I support black authors. When I found out she was my sorority sister, I was sick to my stomach. How dare she put down Jarvis Christian College, an historically black college that you she has never attended. You made my alma mater look as if the degree i received from there is worthless. I have a very successful life as do other JCC alumnus. It is up to our black authors to protray us in a positve light not degrade us. Before she writes another book she needs to get her informations researched thoroughly. Just in case Ms. Spencer reads this I can be reached at delta4620@yahoo.com"},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"I really enjoyed the writing in this book. Adrian did my boy wrong from beginning to end. The author really put this all together to make a really interesting story."},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"For a first effort, I found this book to be well-detailed in creating imagery and character development. Although Shreese's situation with Reverend and Adrian's scandal were easy to predict, Ms. Spencer does a good job with this one...I felt like I was in a jazz club when reading the scenes between Greg's parents. There was some good research put into making that jazz come to life. And for those who felt that Afro-Americans were being insulted and stereotyped, lighten up...It's only fiction! You know, creations from the imagination..."},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"This book was okay. It is very predictable after the first couple of chapters. The author leaves very little to the imagination. The book gave away too many details too soon. I didnt have to read the whole book to predict the ending. But overall if you dont like suspense, it's okay."},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"When I first started reading the book I kept putting it down, it just wasn't grabbing my attention, but once I got further into the book my curiosity got the best of me. I couldn't put the book down. I could not believe that a woman would do the things that she did. Adrian Jenkins was confused and deceitful. All hell does break loose. Gregory's relationship with his mother was sad. I understand her point for leaving but at the same time it was selfish. It not only destroyed Gregory but it also destroyed his little sister. I am definately looking forward to her next book."},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"I found that story line too predictable. I felt that the author made the female characters in the novel nothing but ...air heads. She made no effort to prove that a woman does not need a man to complete her as a person. I am just very disappointed that a sistah feels so lowly of her own kind."},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"Kudos to Camika for effectively writing from a man's point of view. I have no idea how she did it, but it was good to get inside Greg's head. This book actually helped me understand the opposite sex a bit better. I found myself falling in love with Greg and wishing he were real so that I could hop the first plane to Dallas :) Adrian was a sick and confused sistah to say the least. I would easily rate this author's first effort five stars if it weren't for the very predictable outcome. It was bizarre that Greg didn't see the warning signs as he told this story first person when the average reader could see right through Adrian's schemes. Well anyway, the twist that was added to the ending almost made up for the lack of surprise. I recommend this book to the fullest."},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"The only reason, I didn't give this book a rating of 5 is because I predicted a part of the story, but it didn't play out at all like I'd predicted. This book was thoroughly entertaining.I laughed out loud on several occasions which caused people to inquire about the book. This book was better than I expected. I don't think I've come across a more appropriate title in a long time. Although it seems like more than hell broke loose.Despite having predictable points, the plot was well developed. I did not expect for the plot to unfold as it did. While the Alston family first appeared to be a simple family, you soon learned that life had made them all quite complex. Greg, the central character, was an interesting man-caring, sensitive, intelligent, and bitter. His relationships with his family, friends, and fiancee often led him--particularly the women in his life. Although Greg was this intelligent man, I'm puzzled as to why he didn't fiugre out certain things about Adrian.I understand the significance of exploring Greg's friendships, I could have done without Phil. The ignorance of this friend and his lack of respect for women, was too over the top at times.Shreese was probably the most interesting character in this book because it was hard to believe that she was as simple/naive as she was. At first she seemed nothing more than a &quot;Holy Roller&quot;. Although things about Shreese were simple, her reasons for being were deep rooted in pain. Camika Spencer is a great storyteller, I'm looking forward to futher works from this author."},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"This book was off the chain, I had to keep looking at the back of the book and remember it was a woman writing this book. Greg and his crew sounded like typical men. Especially Tim. The mom, ummmm. Pops, was the man. Shreese girl get yourself together. Adrian, you skank. Needless to say I thoroughly enjoyed the wook, read it in two days. I look forward to more work from Camika Spencer."},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"This book was okay, don't watse your money. Borrow the book from a friend."},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"I purchased this book several months ago,but didn't pick it up until I left for a road trip.I wished I had picked it up sooner. I found myself not putting it down,I always wanted to know what was going to happen next.Greg &amp; Adrian appeared to be the perfect couple,that is until he popped the question.What seemed to be the perfect relationship,turned into complete maddness.I could not get into some of Greg's womanizing friends. But I love the fact,that with all the hate Greg had for his mother,he looked beyound that and moved foward.But my heart ached for Greg when he found Adrian with Carla.It showed that, fairy tales don't always come true.Great first work for Ms.Spencer,I can't wait to see what you have in store for your second book."},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"Camika Spencer's debut novel is about black twenty something. It is fast and funny. The author will have you laughing and looking in the mirror to see if she's talking about you (whether you're black or white).On a Sunday morning Gregory Alston has asked Adrian Jenkins to marry him, but when he does all hell breaks loose and he gets more than he bargained for. His mother returns from France, where she has been living since she left the family 20 years ago. His Holy Roller sister Shreese thinks that Adrain is too worldly for Gregory. His dad has locked himself in the bathroom and refuses to come out after his dog dies. His son thinks he is just plain crazy. And if that isn't enough he has Adrain who has more skeletons in her closet than a haunted house. What's a brother to do?I get the impression that the author, who is black, wrote this book for a black audience. But after reading it I feel it could be about any American family. I know all can enjoy it. What a wonderful read this was. If you liked the movie SOUL FOOD you will love this book."},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"When All Hell Breaks Loose is a page-turning, entertaining, hilarious, easy to read novel written from the main character, Gregory Alston's perspective. In the midst of preparing for his wedding, Gregory is trying to keep it all together while those close to him appear to be falling apart. His sister, Shreese is carrying on in a scandalous love affair and his mom is back on the scene for his wedding and to rekindle the fire with her husband and a mother-dear relationship with her now grown children. Of course, we can't forget Gregory's male cronies who bring a new meaning to the word dysfunctional or Adrian his fiancee who &quot;has more skeletons in her closet than a haunted house.&quot;I enjoyed When All Hell Breaks Loose and Believe that as Ms. Spencer matures/grows as a writer so will her writing skills; HOWEVER, as a first time writer she's included all the elements which make a book entertaining....crafty/vivid scenes, witty dialogue, interesting characters... and managed to tell a predictable plot in a humorous manner. Additionally, Ms. Spencer was able to tell the story from a male perspective and add sub-plots that smoothly fit into the storyline.I agree that Ms. Spencer writing reaches folks who probably wouldn't think of picking up a book for pleasure; however, When All Hell Breaks Loose even had some of the 40-something, love to read crowd LOLROTF(laughing out loud rolling on the floor)....and that suits me just fine.If You Want To Forget About the Responsibilities of Today and Don't Take Yourself Too Serious Then Check Out Ms. Spencers book."},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"HELL-o! This book had me crackin' up! I read WHEN ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE over one weekend. I thought my weekend was going to be boring because I had nothing to do, well it was just the opposite. I have never laughed so hard while reading a book in my life!Camika Spencer has such a unique talent of being able to express life from the male perspective, which is very challenging for a female author to do, which is all-the-more reason to have respect for such bright author.Gregory Alston, the main character, has it all; a fiance, a promising career, a cool posse to hang with and a strong sense of self-esteem. All hell breaks loose when the women in his life start to wear him down. Greg's sister goes even more church-crazy than she already is, his runaway mother returns and fiance unleashes the key to hell for Gregory when her true colors fly and she gets caught.I guarantee the fact that every woman who is looking for a good man or believes that a good man is hard to find will want to slap Greg's fiance, Adrian, by the time she has read the entire novel. Why? Well, you'd have to read it to find out.WHEN ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE is also great because it is what I call a unisex book, meaning that it's enjoyable to both men and women. I thoroughly enjoyed the fact that after I read this book I could not only talk to other women about it; but that I could converse with men about it as well.I look forward to more work from Camika Spencer."},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"After reading many(good)reviews for this book, I decided to check it out at the library. I think the book was overrated. There were some good moments, but it seemed like the book was put together over night."},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"This book is about a 29 year old man, Greg, who proposes to his girlfriend of three years, Adrian. Greg believes that everything is great until all HELL breaks loose. First his sister, Shereese, begins to date a bogus minister from her church. Then all of a sudden Greg's mother comes back to Dallas for his wedding. It doesn't sound that bad, but it's a problem for Greg because the last time he saw her was nineteen years ago, before she left to go to France to pursue her singing career. To top it off, Greg finds out something about Adrian that is going to shock him and change the way he feels about the love of his life.I had a good time reading this book. It took me like a day and a half to finish because I couldn't stop laughing at Greg's friends. It's pretty cool how Camika Spencer can get into a mans head and write this book. If you didn't know who the author was, you would think that it was a man writing this book. Overall, I recommend this book to those that have a sense of humor and just want to read an easy book after they have read something mind blowing.:)"},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"Well my bookclub enjoyed every page of this book she was a new author for us and we got our money worth. Boy Adrian was something else but we knew something wasn't right about her and to do a man like that you are what you are and she didn't have to bring Greg into her life like that, but his mother was a for real women and I'm glad the sister got her head on straight. You will enjoy this book I passed it on and everyone say the same thing I couldn't stop reading."},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"This book was an easy read and funny from beginning to end. I am an avid reader of African American authors and Camika Spencer kept my attention throughout the entire read. I don't know how she attained such a vivid man's point of view but it was excellent. Thank you for giving me something to do during a boring week of jury duty. I read Cubicles the first day and When all Hell Breaks Loose the second. This is definitely a book that I will recommend to others!"},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"This book was okay. I wasn't as explosive as the good reviews nor as horrible as the bad reviews. I think that her writing could use a little fine tuning. (Just a thought, you should take a look before offending people in your audience) I have to agree with some or the outrages from the beauticians and small town college graduates. Hopefully, when she does novel #2, she should slow down and think"},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"When all hell breaks loose, it really breaks loose. The main character Greg is a positive role model and has it going on in his life. His business is booming, his friends are challenging and things are working well with the lady love in his life, enough so that he proposes.As in real life, what happens when things go well, all hell breaks loose and when you think it cannot get any worse, it does.This is a page turner and a nice debut novel. It is easy to complete in one setting. It was easy to predict what was going to happen in the end and the author took a few twist to arrive there. One downfall was that the prediction came to early in the book if you are a suspense reader, but it did not detract from the book. A little more developing of the characters will come as Ms. Spencer continues to write, and I expect we will receive more writings from this author."},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"I read this entire book in one sitting...as usual. Though the book was an easy read that held my attention... I didn't walk away with anything. When I closed the cover at the end... it was like I had hadn't read a thing! I suggest checking this book out from the library... and not spending any money on it. One big plus... the ending was hilarious...though kinda predictable!"},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"Camika, I feel you girl. You are an awesome writer. I knew this story was too good to be true. What was wrong with Adrian? Mother knows best. Gregs mother knew something wasn't right about Adrian.Church going Shreese. She was just plain silly. I didn't feel sorry for her at all. My heart went out to Greg because he was all ready to settle down with Adrian but she had to go and mess things up.Camila, I await your next novel. Keep up the good work. Be Blessed!"},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"This book was ok, to be her first novel. I felt she could came up with a better story line. Hopefully her second novel will be better!"},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"I just closed the book (finished 5 minutes ago), this was an awesome book, for this to be Ms. Spencer's first novel. I loved the male characters, especially Tim. I am really looking forward to reading her future projects. Hope we can get them here in Sicily. I commend you ! You go girl!"},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"I dont care what was wrong with this book. If I couldn't put it down then that says a lot! I read the other reviews where people were disappointed and all that, but it takes work and commitment to even write a paragraph let alone a book. Camika, don't let those other comments hinder you because I've yet to read their work. YOur book did have flaws but who's book doesn't? All I can say is the book grabbed my attention and I had to finish it no matter what. That's the definition of a good book. I don't like sappy endings either and yours allowed me to come up with my own conclusions. I'm sure Random House is helping you with everything else. I'm forever in your corner because you've done what most of us only dream about."},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"I visited the Amazon site several time before buying this book. I don't like incohesive contemporary African American tales and there are many out there. But I finally gave in after so many people said they had read it in two or three days. When I first picked it up I was amazed at the way the author spoke in Greg's voice. Except for a few things (never saying much to his mother) Greg was on point. I liked his homeboys and I even laughed when the Reverend was praying at the table. The imagination put into this book is to be commended. I think this author will go far if she remains pure to what makes her writed such interesting books."},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"This book was an emotional rollercoaster for me. I bought it and read it in 3 days. By the time I finished I was breathing hard and mad at Adrian. She knew better. Maybe she didn't. I need a sequel!"},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"I have an original copy of Ms. Spencer's book. Although there were errors and things of that nature, the story grabbed me and pulled me in so much that I knew all she needed was some touch ups. I was surprised to see the book in Hard Cover and glad to see that Random House saw this diamond in the rough. Keep writing and pushing Camika! I am telling everyone about you!"},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"I am also a graduate of East Texas State University and I am glad to see a fellow alumni do so well. This book is absolutely AWESOME. I read it in less than 24 hours and I could not put it down. I read a lot of books and this one is definitely in my top five. I would recommend this book for anyone, male or female. I feel Camika did a wonderful job writing from the male perspective and I look forward to buying her next book."},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"I just finished reading When ALl Hell Breaks Loose, and I must say I was deeply impressed with the writing and creativity displayed by Ms. Spencer. Her characters were exciting and three dimensional and her words seemed to leap off the page and electrify my mind! I particularly loved her male character Greg, and the fact that she wrote so well from a male perspective. I predict great things are on the horizon for you, sister Camika, and I am happily spreading the word about your talent and strong literary voice. You were wonderful to indulge us with a few paragraphs in Philly, and I look forward to reading CUBICLES. Peace and blessings!"},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"When ALL Hell Breaks Loose, was excellent it kept me turning the pages. I can't wait for Cubicles."},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"i was very pleased to read that not only do us ladies go through what Greg went through. it is also so nice to read that there are some men who give ladies a benefit of a doubt before going off about some he say she say mess. but futhermore it was a very funny book with a lot of twists and turns in it. a must read if you have a sense of humor and a soft spot about relationships."},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"This book ia a great page-turning read! Character development is good and the plot has substance! The subtle hints dropped throughout the story line, makes the reader WANT TO KNOW, as opposed to setting the book aside, assuming the outcome. I look forward to the author's upcoming novel - I think Ms. Spencer's presence will be definitely felt, especially in the African American literary community. For those of you who haven't - pick up this book and Njoy!"},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"I loved reading this book. It's &quot;The Best Man&quot; with a twist. I agree with one of the other reviews, You don't know who or what you are dating. It's a serious game and sometimes it can be deadly. It's true that when you are not honest about who you are or what you want with your mate you do end up wasting their time and yours. Besides if you're not honest from the start you end up making decisiona for them that should be theirs. I would recommend this book to everyone. It's a real page turner."},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"that is exactly what happens in this book. appropriate title. good fast read for all"},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"Do we really KNOW the people we are dating? Well Greg soon finds out that the person he plans to marry, has plenty of skeletons in the closet, and it blows him away. This was a page turner. My heart went out to Greg, because he really loved Adrian. She should have been upfront with him. The story was so realistic. Thumps up to you Camika, this was a very good book."},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"AWESOME AND QUITE INTERESTING WRITIN"},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"This was a very interesting book, with a twist. At first the book was slow pace; however, as the characters were developing, it started to pick up. The author did a very good job with her first novel and I recommend this book to others. I am still a little confused on the title since I was left a little disappointed on when the REAL Hell BROKE LOOSE ... I gave this book a 4 star rating because the author did a very good job in her writing skills where it was easy to picture the scenes."},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"YOu go girl Camika....You did a great job for this being your first novel.. Once I got past page three I was hooked (reading the book at traffic lights) I hope your next book is a page turner like this one was... Again thanks"},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"This book was great. I found myself laughing aloud at the outrageous, yet all too realistic situations that the characters got themselves into. This was a really well-written, very entertaining, and quick read. One of very FEW books that I would not mind seeing on the big screen... the author is to be commended for her excellent work. I can't wait for Cubicles."},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"This was an excellent book to read. Camika did a first-rate job writing this book. Some characters are somewhat neurotic but very real, mixing church house drama with love and betrayal makes for an excellent discussion and that's just what we experienced for our book club. I predict wonderful things for this inspired young diva."},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"First of all, I would like to say thank you for coming out to our book club meeting to discuss When All Hell Breaks Loose. We focused on alot of topics except for &quot;A Thought from Adrian.&quot; She made a strong point that I think your e-mailers should think about.... &quot;I think people spend too much time weighing the costs, which only leads to confusion, self-denial, lies, broken egos, and broken hearts. Maybe one day, it won't be necessay to pretend.&quot; I belive there all alot of pretenders out there..............................Take care and good luck Camika on your second novel.Karen Combs (Sisterhood Book Club)"},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"From page one I was engrossed in the lives of the characters. I wish that Adrian was honest with Greg from the beginning. I kept wondering why Greg's mother didn't approve of Adrian. She wanted to be supportive but knew something wasn't right about Adrian. As the old saying goes, Mother knows best! I have recommended this book to several of my sister/friends. Camika, you have an unique writing style. I awake your next release. Be Blessed..."},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"There is one time that you want to run for cover and that is when ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE. This book is a valiant effort by the, young, black female, self published author Camika Spencer. I was impressed by her ability to make one feel as though these were close personal friends you are reading bout. I finished the book within 48 hours of picking it up. I would hihgly recommend this book if you are looking for drama, suspense and good down home folk to read about. I guarantee that once you pick it up you won't want to put it down. It is far from a slow read which is a good thing for those of us who can be easily bored bybooks that drag on.. This young lady is destined for a dynamic stint as an author and I can't wait to see what she produces next. Not only was her book a good read but she was very friendly and perosnable at the book signing I attended in Atlanta. BUY the BOOK...it is well worth the $12.00 you'll spend."},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"Let me first say that I read the reviews of this work and rushed out and bought it. I wish I had slowed down and read a few pages in the store, because I would have left it there. I found this book insulting on more levels then one, to the point that I was unable to finish it. All of the characters were simple and single minded with no signs of intelligent life anywhere to be found! I am at a lose of words to describe how bad this book is. I would recommend, despite what you have read here, don't buy it. For the record, I am an avid reader who enjoys the likes of Toni Morrison, Alice Walker, Anne Rice, Terry McMillan, Valerie Wilson Wesley, and many others. If you want a good, easy read about African American life, I would suggest Tryin' to Sleep in the Bed You Made. It is a much better read!"},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"It took exactly 100 pages for this book to even begin to be interesting! Ms. Spencer had a tendency to go on and on spatting what seemed to be her own opinions, and voicing them through Greg, her main character. While this can be good, her voice should not smother that of her characters. I thought Shreese's character was too the extreme. She just seemed like a stereotype. It was not until further into the book that you can see she is a true person rather than a stock character. It was a slow read that did not pick up until page 100!! From then on, I was just waiting for something to happen. The climax was smooth and well written, and the book closes giving you, the reader a sense of closure as well. It was refreshing since the beginning was so stale! Spencer used stereotypes instead of modeling her characters after real people. It is almost as though this book was written by two different people. This book should have gone unpublished."},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"The book had mixed reviews but I gave it an average rating. I was just not moved by this book. This was the author's first book so I'll give her props for that. Her character development (Adrian) could have been better. What I did enjoy was how the author wrote from a male's persepective. I will look forward to reading her next book."},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"I usually don't give bad reviews but I must make an exception. I purchased the book sometime last year, and have struggled to finish it after pickin it up and putting it down a couple of times.After seeing all of the &quot;glorious&quot; reviews I decided to give it another try and FINISH IT! I must say that I was truly disappointed. I am sure Ms. Spencer's next book will be &quot;da bomb&quot; but this was a dud for me.It was tooooooooooooo slow - and it was sooooooooooo predictable. I mean I figured out the book's ending in the first portion of the book but it took Ms. Spencer 200 pages to finally get to the end of the story.I'm sorry...I just was expecting a lot MORE based on all of the reviews that I read. But then again...who am I to judge!Try it you might like it!"},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"I've been a member of a book club for several years now, and as a group we rated thisbook a \\"1\\". A \\"1\\" in our rating means \\"a waste of time\\". We've never rated a book thislow in all the years I've been reading with them. I was very disappointed!"},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"I just read this a few months ago, after passing it up several times. I was pleasantly surprised once I started reading this one. I felt so bad for Gregory but at the same time I wanted to slap him upside the head and yell \\"WAKE UP\\". He was a good \\"Black Man\\" and I hated to see him get mistreated by Adrian. Gregory's friends added a little variety and had me laughing much of the time. I loved the story surrounding his parents and his father deserved much respect for buckling down and raising his children on his own after Louise left. What can I say about the holly-rolling sister (Sherise), somebody should have given her a clue. Unfortunately, there are sisters out there, being taken by \\"No-Good, Fraudulent Men, Supposedly Doing God's Work\\". I'm glad she finally got it in the end. Loved this story and the characters were so real. Great book, Great read."},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"After reading many(good)reviews for this book, I decided to check it out at the library. I think the book was overrated. There were some good moments, but it seemed like the book was put together over night."},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"When All Hell Breaks Loose was a great disappointment. I thought the story was building up to be something more. I knew what the ending was going to bring before I got there and it was anticlimatic. I didn't like the synopsis of all the characters at the end. Ms. Spencer didn't make me really like and grow attached to any of the characters and I couldn't care less what happened to them. All the male/female bashing and hatred was disheartening."},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"I was sorry to see a fresh new author with such potential resort to stereotyped shallow character development, especially of her lesbian characters. These charaters (or shall I say caricatures) make the story lose its believablity and will distance many readers whose understanding of or expeirence in gay/lesbian culture goes beyond what they have learned from Jerry Springer."},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"This was one of the most explosive books I've read in a hot minute! I couldn't put the book down and it turned out that I read the book in day and a half. Shreese and the Pastor. Greg and Adrian. Greg and Louise. Louise and Adolphus. Louise and Adrian. Adrian and Shreese. Phil and Simone. Tim and Simone. Tim and Carla. This was a good book!"},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"I was very disappointed in Cameka Spencer's - When All Hell Breaks Loose. This book was poorly written and contained several grammatical errors. The characters kept me reading but the ending was very predictable. However, since this is her debut novel, I would like to applaud Ms. Spencer's effort."},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"After reading all of the reviews for this book, I thought it would be pretty good. However, I found it to be predictable. The story-line seemed be dragging at several points in the book and I just wasn't buying THE REASON for Adrian's betrayal- it seemed unrealistic."},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"Although this is the author's debut novel, it was written as though she is a seasoned author. While I figured out what the deal was with Adrian early on, the events leading up to her true identity were captivating. I kept wondering if the author would actually have Greg catch Adrian in the act. Well, he did, which was really the climax of the book. I particularly liked the way the author brought Greg around and allowed him to reconcile with his mother. The author was particulary skillful in showing how we can oftentimes assume a lot of things that aren't necessarily the way we assumed them to be, which was the case with Greg. He assumed so many things about his mother that turned out not to be the case at all. The author did an excellent job of progressing the novel in such a way that didn't leave gaps or a disjointed feeling. Camika Spencer is an excellent writer. Move over Terri McMillian and Bebe Moore Campbell. Make room for Camika Spencer!"},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"It was okay. It had its moments. His friends were jerks who couldn't buy a clue. His mother had her reasons for leaving her family, which his father understood, but somebody should have clued the kids in a long time ago. Their lives may have taken a different direction. As for the girlfriend? Please. She couldn't be honest with herself, how could she be honest with him? It was an okay book. I think I would have like it better wiithout a couple of his jerk friends. It made you wonder why he was even friends with them. Of course, I haven't told anyone they just HAD to run out and get it. I wished I had borrowed it rather than bought it."},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"This is a wonderful first effort from Camika Spencer. Drama, however, is a perfect word to describe it. I thought the ideas were set on a great stage of characters, personalities and situations. We were able to follow our main character (Greg) throughout some very difficult and stressful times in his life. I absolutely love the interaction between Greg, his friends, his family, and his coworkers. The character development was absolutely great. There weren't too many that we were confused of who was who or what aura they possessed. I was quite pleased with the book. It was a fairly easy read and there was just enough suspense to keep you looking for the plot and the outcome. Personally, I was pleased to be able to follow Greg as he matured in this situation. I would much rather find my characters changed and mature at the end of a novel, than falling into the same scenarios. Ms. Spencer has done an excellent job with her premier novel. I look forward to more of her work."},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"Sometimes bad things do happen to really good people ! Such was the case of Greg, his siter and father . Greg was hopeful Adrian was the one for him! How could he compete ? You could certainly feel the love he shared with her ! What a shame to hurt a guy in this way ! Why couldn't Adrian just be true to herself and be upfront with Greg. She was entitled to live her life but not hurt another in the process ! Sherese( his sister ) on the other hand learned a hard lesson in life. A man is a man! Even if he is a so called man of God ! I was so glad their Dad regained the love of his life ! I guess sometimes you have to follow your dream which was the case of his Mom , but her heart was still there ?"},{"Title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"This book was poorly written and contained information that was purely insulting.

I read it cover to cover during the 10+ hour flight and had to put it down several times for fear of waking other passengers with my fits of laughter. It has quickly become a staple reading selection amongst my friends and family. Though I don't trust much of the advice, especially about the traditional medicinal remedies, it is a great book to pick up for a few laughs and makes an excellent conversation starter.Much of the book is straight forward simple sentences. I am a Home Ec. teacher and have read several passages to my junior high students to get them to think outside the box about resourcefulness. Overall I don't recommend it as a cover to cover page turner (unless your sense of humor centers around Laura Ingalls) But as far as a conversation starter and reference books go, it is one of the best."},{"Title":"The American frugal housewife: Dedicated to those who are not ashamed of economy","review":"This was a quick and enjoyable read for me on the Kindle. I loved reading about keeping house in the 19th century. It's amazing how far we've come, and yet what was relevant and useful then is still so today.

This is a modern woman born in the early 1800's who wrote down all her hard-won wisdom for being a good housewife, about the only job available to women at the time. Her children must have felt so comforted to have this book to guide them in their lives as well. And I would imagine what a treasure this would have been to hand to a new bride as she started her life with her husband. Lydia M.

Are your children full of shenanigans? Well, this is the book for you!Okay, modern American women may not be able to relate (because we aren't just housewives anymore and because of technology), but Mrs. Childs does have matter-of-fact advice that many of us need to pay attention to. For example, she speaks positively of education being the foundation for all children, and she also speaks of assigning children chores (what are those?) to complete with their brothers and sisters (because other children can or may be bad influences if they have nothing to occupy their time). I enjoyed how she spoke of living under our means, which is something that we rarely do in a world full of credit cards and 0% financing for blah, blah number of months. She believes that sickness should be the only \\"extra\\" spent out of the strict budget.With this being said, I would have enjoyed reading this better if the information was better organized (I read about preserving eggs and her trip to the mechanic all in one paragraph).

The section on home remedies and recipes wasn't quite as pertinent to me (certain things have changed over the years, after all).

It is, without doubt, THE best book of its kind.The American Frugal Housewife is fascinating on a variety of levels, not the least in that Child wrote the book with the emphasis on &quot;AMERICAN.&quot; Other such books existed at the time, but they were written in England and for English women. Child was one of the Transcendentalists who were huge advocates of personal self-discipline and restraint, but believed to their core the importance of fighting for what they knew to be right. It wasn't just a religious fervor -although Child's Christianity, like that of Catherine and Harriet Beecher Stowe, was extremely important - but a belief that the still relatively new United States had a unique destiny that set it apart from the rest of the world, specifically the old, decrepit world that was Europe.Child was no blindfolded nationalist, however. She saw the flaws and contradictions that bound the new Republic. Child, like many other Transcendentalists, was a fervent abolitionist and a proponent of women's equality, and worked all her life toward achieving those ends. Even with its problems, Child was an ardent American. She saw Americans as a unique race of people with a unique and powerful destiny. Americans, she believed, were new and unique, and that the American destiny was far different from the degenerate, rotting hulk of Old World Europe.So what does all this have to do with the American Frugal Housewife? Well, Child wrote the book specifically to address AMERICAN houswives and what she knew to be their unique problems and issues. It's much more than just a recipe book; it embodies Child's philosophy that the only way toward virtue was self-restraint and sobriety, and that the way to tutor the new nation in these values was by teaching the nation's housewives - the hand that rocks the cradle, Child believed, did indeed rule the world.The new nation was becoming prosperous, and Child saw that then, like now, people had a difficult time learning how to restrain themselves financially. One part in particular has to do with how mothers should raise their daughters. Child believed they should teach their offspring the virtues of frugality, that it was better to put savings &quot;out at interest&quot; and earn wealth from it, then to indulge in the latest fad - one in this case being something called a Brussels carpet. As new brides went out to set up their household, Child lectures at how they drive their husbands to bankruptcy by embracing fads and trying to keep up with the Joneses.Other, cheaper types of carpet &quot;will answer just as well,&quot; Child wrote. She also recommends using cheap illustrations, nicely framed, as wall art, rather than going overboard to buy the latest European style.Some of the best sections are on frugality. Child was the &quot;Hints from Heloise&quot; queen of her day, and she's got a solution for everything that could possibly beset the early 19th century housewife. The interesting thing, as others have noted, is how so many of her tips still work so well.I don't know that I'm ever going to need her instructions on how to brew my own soap in a backyard kettle or how to keep my homemade pickles in a barrel from turning soft, but I did get a burn mark out of an antique chest by using rottenstone and oil, just as she prescribed.What's rottenstone, you ask? Well, you can buy it at a hardware store, but if you want the recipe, buy the book! It's a fantastic window on early American life, but the sound advice inside, about not getting into debt and how to &quot;do up&quot; your brass so it doesn't tarnish, is still amazingly useful.I guarantee you'll become a Child fan, just like me! :)"},{"Title":"The American frugal housewife: Dedicated to those who are not ashamed of economy","review":"I bought this book at a Revolutionar War event this past weekend and I've read it 3 times already (Purchased Sunday, and it's now Tuesday morning).

I mean fragments of time as well as materials. Nothing should bethrown away so long as it is possible to make any use of it. However trifling that usemay be; and whatever be the size of a family every member should be employed either inearning or saving money.\\"This is for the most part, the only proper \\"Introduction\\" that the reader encounters when starting \\"The American Frugal Housewife, for Ms. Lydia Maria Francis Child plunges right in and begins dishing out advice left and right, providing a veritable flood of information. She advises, for example, that children not be allowed to frolic about until 13 or 14 years of age.\\"This is not well. It is not well for the purses and patience of parents; and it has astill worse effect on the morals and habits of the children. Begin early is the greatmaxim for everything in education. A child of six years old can be made useful andshould be taught to consider every day lost in which some little thing has not been doneto assist others.\\"Other advice consists of how economize and how keep what you have in good repair. Everything from stockings to hearths, from apples to sausages. In addition, there is medical advice, and instructions on how to cook a variety of foods. Everything from porridges to cows brains, herbed wines to pies.STEWED PRUNES.Stew them very gently in a small quantity of water till stones slip out. Physiciansconsider them safe nourishment in fevers.BEANS AND PEAS.Baked beans are a very simple dish, yet few cook them well. They should be put in coldwater, and hung over the fire, the night before they are baked. In the morning, theyshould be put in a colander, and rinsed two or three times; then again placed in akettle, with the pork you intend to bake, covered with water, and kept scalding hot, inhour or more. A pound of pork is quite enough for a quart of beans, and that is a largedinner for a common family. The rind of the pork should be slashed. Pieces of pork alter-nately fat and lean, are the most suitable ; the cheeks are the best. A little peppersprinkled among the beans, when they are placed in the bean-pot, will render them lessunhealthy. They should be just covered with water, when put into the oven ; and the porkshould be sunk a little below the surface of the beans. Bake three or four hours.THE SKINNY:::To be perfectly honest, there is some sound advice here. Some of it inspired by Ben Franklin, and some of it coming from friends and articles read by the author.I found this an absolutely fascinating book that gives some wonderful insight into the daily life of early American families. We get to see what the concerns of housewives were, and how life was lived amongst a class of people -- the less well-off -- that is frequently overlooked by historical studies.Ms. Child was born in 1802. She was raised by a strict Calvinist father and later she married a lawyer who proved to be an improvident dreamer who at times was imprisoned for his debts. As a consequence she knows frugality quite well.The American Frugal Housewife is extremely well written, and was extremely well received at the time it was first put up for sale. In fact, it was republished 27 times between 1835 and 1841.I HIGHLY recommend this work to students of history and those who are interested in early American life.As for the \\"Kindle\\" format, I must say that this particular version comes with 'highlights', some of which are definitions. These are easy to access or ignore. (Which is why I can't tell you what they all are.) Being a FREE book it's hard to complain, but I should note that there are images from the original book that don't appear in the Kindle copy. They pertain to the parts of animals -- rumps, chops, etc.-- and aren't particularly valuable.

The greater lesson was, of course, learning their own importance in society.

Kern, who was a key figure in the post-war German far-right movement until his death in 1991, wrote this account of his service to the Third Reich while in an internment and reeducation camp for former members of the SS and Nazi Party. Kern began his career as a journalist for a right-wing Austrian newspaper in 1936 and continued his career as a Nazi journalist even while serving in the Waffen SS, an organization in which he rose from the rank of private to major by the end of war, serving in such noted organizations as the Leistandarte Adolf Hitler, Das Reich, the Viking Division, and various and sundry obscure smaller units of the Waffen SS. Though a Nazi scribe, he was no coward, serving in combat on the Eastern Front at various times from 1941 to the end of the war. His thoughts on combat, on the nature of the war with the Soviet Union, and his observations about how the many errors committed by the Third Reich in the conduct of that war, particularly in its treatment of \\"Eastern Peoples\\" (a broad category that includes Poles, Russians, Ukrainians, Cossacks, etc.) contributed substantially to Germany's defeat. Though he is critical of how Germany prosecuted the war, he remains an unreconstructed Nazi throughout, who rarely critisizes Hitler and doesn't even mention the Holocaust at all, a subject about which he is suspiciously mute. These faults notwithstanding, Kern's book is noteworthy because he was one of the first officers of the Waffen SS to \\"go public\\" and admit his participation in the war as a member of that organization, and provides intriguing insights into how some of the Third Reich's \\"insiders\\" percieved the war. Overall, I gave the book 5 stars, not only for its content, but because Kern is a good writer, a point that comes through even in this translated version."},{"Title":"Dance of Death (English Edition, Copyright 1951)","review":"I looked long & hard for a copy of Erich Kern's \\"Dance of death,\\" before finally locating a copy thru Amazon. It was worth the wait. It easily rivals Guy Sajer's forgotten Soldier in its combat descriptions, & is often very gripping. There are many first person accounts on the brutal war on the Eastern front, but all too few written by former Waffen SS men. This book is head & shoulders above another first person SS account by Peter Neumann titled \\"The Black March,\\" which I consider fiction. And Kern's descriptions of Soviet atrocities, not only against the Germans, but their own people as well, are eye-opening. I consider the Red's conduct of the war far worse than that of the German's, hands down. Though Kern never apologises for the third Reich or it's war in Russia, he often criticizes the stupid decisions of the Wehrmact high command. Decisions that lead to the German defeat in the East.This book is a classic. My only complaint is that it isn't long enough."},{"Title":"Maurizio Cattelan (Contemporary Artists)","review":"Beware that this is a mini book, which makes looking at Cattelan's artwork almost impossible.

Although American gardeners must proceed cautiously when trying to replicate English garden ideas--owing to differing moisture conditions, the chalk base under British beds, and latitude/longitude considerations, i.e. the effects of the sun--THE ART OF PLANTING contains much to recommend it.For example, Verey shows us Mrs Pugh's bog garden at Docton Mill in Devon. Devon has a climate comparable to Zones 7 &amp; 8 in the U.S. but the sun does not get nearly as hot in the summer months in Devon as it does in most Zone 7 &amp; 8 U.S. areas. Devon is further north and it is warmed by the Gulf Stream like New England.Mrs. Pugh grows Iris, ferns and Hosta lillies in her garden. Her ferns include the osrich plume fern 'Osmunda Regalis' which grows wild in the eastern U.S.--I have found them in drainage ditches but you can buy them at a good nursery. Mrs. Pugh also grows Iris pallida. I have been able to grow a similar plant in Virginia--Iris siberica which requires both dampness and sun. Most Hosta lillies would not last in the same garden as the Iris or the fern, however. Hostas mostly prefer shade like the ferns, but they also like dry conditions. In fact, they are a mainstay in my shade gardens. If you try to replicate Mrs. Pugh's garden, you may have to improvise with plants that like both the U.S. sun and dampness.In addition to the wide array of growing conditions, Verey discusses the use of color, shape and texture in planting. She says, &quot;Some plants need shining leaves to set them off, particularly...white flowers with green centers. Other, like potentillas merge with their foliage.&quot; In other words, consider not only the juxtapostion of flower color and size but the neighborliness of leaves. In one photo shows the iceberg rose 'Schneewitchen' growing in a bed of 'Stachys' or lamb's ears. The glossy green leaves of the rose contrast nicely with the soft green fuzzy leaves of the Stachys and the large white flowers of the rose blend beautifully with the contrasting green leaves.There are several sets of photos and text discussing the use of monochromatic color schemes. The most famous example of the white scheme is the White Garden at Sissinghurst, but Verey shows the reader Anne Dexter's tiny Oxford garden where a white hydrangea stands next to a hidden door. Another monochromatic scheme might be purple, using Campanula persicifolia and Stachys byzantina, and blue pansies and hyacinths.The U.S. gardener might not be able to copy the designs Verey shows exactly because blooming times for plants vary from place to place. Verey's color schemes could be executed with local plants, however. The easiest way to discover what might work is to take a trip to the local nursery and pick out plants blooming close to the same time. Ask the nursery staff if the plants came from a hothouse, because sometimes plants bloom out of season owing to sheltered conditions. This is less of a problem during the warmer months. Our local nursery divides the shade loving plants from the sunny border plants which is a big help.This wouldn't be an English gardening book without a discussion of borders, and Verey doesn't fail to supply the requisite text and photos. Again, some of the ideas cannot be executed in the U.S. in the exact detail shown, but there are many possible exceptions. For example, she shows Perovskia growing behind Viola cornuta which will work in some areas in zone 6 and 7. Hoever, the Viola may burn up under some condtions.I recommend this book to anyone who loves beautiful garden photographs, and/or is searching for garden design ideas. Although you may not be able to replicate the gardens shown in every detail, you will find Verey's suggestions useful if you live in growing zones 6-8."},{"Title":"The Art of Planting","review":"Crisp, clear photography. A masterful guide to companion plants --you'll want to recreate them in your own garden. Drawing from her years of experience and knowledge of gardens of the world Rosemary Verrey shows you in narrative photographs how to create color palletes that are soothing to the senses. Even those photographs of brightly colored combinations avoid the glaring and garish look of some boldly colored gardens. Multiple photographs of similar plant combinations make it easy to create the look that you want and still exercise your own creativity. Includes beds of mixed borders, bulbs, woodland, ground covers, and damp/ boggy sites.Worth buying for the photography alone."},{"Title":"The Art of Planting","review":"This book by the late Rosemary Verey is stunning and most inspirational. The plantings and pictures are gorgeous. The concepts of color contrast and harmony--painting with color-- are worked into the text and captions, with the detailed botanical and cultivar names fully cited. The only great problem is that these are English gardens, adapted to a moist and cloudy regime that rarely exists in America with its climate extremes and strong seasonality--as ex-patriate Thalassa Cruso (Making Things Grow) discovered years ago. You won't get the green lawns and misty colors shown everywhere here, and you'll need another source book to check for USDA hardiness zone or cultivation information. While Verey has visited North American gardens she has little to say about them. Nevertheless, Verey's concepts of seasonal associations of disparate yet harmonized plants are spot on. The picture captions are highly informative alone, and the extensive text is like a personal journey, including which English garden first inspired which idea. (She published other books that contain the garden plans, especially for her own estate at Barnsley Hall.) I found her ideas to have late climbing plants emerge through early blooming shrubs most interesting. This is a lovely, large, and inspiring book of color photographs and concepts."},{"Title":"The Art of Planting","review":"If I had to give up all of my scores of gardening books but one, this would be the one I'd keep!!Rosemary Verey is a master of gardening and her ability to create exceptional combinations of plants is unsurpassed. This is what she does in this book. She combines plants - annuals, perennials, shrubs, trees - into groups of exceptional beauty. You can find a color combination that delights you visually. If you actually plant her combination you can also have fragrance, four season interest, and solutions to problem sites. Her combinations - and the photographs of her plantings - are so satisfying to peruse all year round. You'll be motivated and can have the most exciting garden ever!"},{"Title":"The Holocaust Odyssey of Daniel Bennahmias, Sonderkommando (Judaic Studies Series)","review":"This Holocaust survivor account is unlike any other in that it chronicles the fate of the Greek Jews in detail. Daniel's narrative is orderly and factual, bringing forth important items of history I have not seen in other studies. The description of the deadly cattle car ride to Auschwitz is broken out in great detail, to the degree that Daniel and the author place the reader in the midst of the un-imaginable dehumanizing experiences told there. The day-to-day tasks of the Sonderkommando are told in a slightly different light than one would read in Filip Mueller's \\"Eyewitness-Auschwitz\\", yet they are instructional from Daniel's point of view. His life was saved in some of the deadliest circumstances in what I believe was Divine intervention. One part of the book I especially enjoyed from a historical aspect was the fate of the ss officer Otto Moll, who I read of in other Holocaust literature (several survivors write extensively on this person-no morbid fascination with him, however). There is one account in the book that is a black cloud over an otherwise fine work, and that is the treatment the Greek Sephardic Jews were given by the European Ashkenazic Jews---the Greek Jewish people were looked down upon and reviled as \\"whores\\" and \\"cholera\\" by their fellow inmates. I highly recommend this work to any serious student of history, and I wish that I could meet Daniel Bennahmias someday. God bless you, sir!"},{"Title":"The Holocaust Odyssey of Daniel Bennahmias, Sonderkommando (Judaic Studies Series)","review":"This work gives insights into the fate of Greek Jews, their deportation to Auschwitz, and the work of a sonderkommando who lived to tell about his experiences.

For instance, the Sonderkommandos' gruesome task of \\"processing\\" each train shipment of victims was not finished until they had pulverized the bones from the cremains, and dumped them in the Vistula River. (p. 51).Much has been written about Christian prejudices against Jews, and how this is supposed to have paved the way for, if not caused, the Holocaust. In actuality, prejudices were universal. For instance, Ashkenazi (northern European) Jews used to look down on Sephardic (Mediterranean) Jews, calling them \\"cholera\\" and \\"korva\\" (whore). (p. xxii). Even in Auschwitz, Polish Jews ridiculed Greek Jews for not being able to speak Yiddish. (p. 56). Someone betrayed the location of the dynamite hidden in preparation for the revolt. (p. 68). The Nazi-German roundup of Greek Jews itself enjoyed the assistance of Jewish traitors Pepo and Costa Recanati. (p. xiii).While beginning his work as a sonderkommando, Daniel received a verbal and cut-throat gesture warning, from a fellow Jew, as to what would happen to any sonderkommando who seemed unfit for work. (p. 40). (This adds refutation to the claim, in Claude Lanzmann's SHOAH, that a similar gesture made by a Polish peasant implied a mockery of the doomed Jews.)The author, Fromer, shows subtle Judeocentric bias in her characterization of the Polish inmates: \\"The Polish Gentiles, who were the first prisoners in Auschwitz, were able to set up a sophisticated network that was able to smuggle individuals and information in and out of the camps; in addition, they were able to protect various persons deemed important to their mission of chronicling the atrocities and in preparing for the revenge they hoped to take when the Germans lost the war. To them, a physical revolt was considered to be an option only, one to be resorted to only in the case of a Nazi decision to annihilate the entire prison population. The Resistance in the forest was ancillary to this underground and acted as couriers; as such, they maintained contact with the main body in the camp. As long the Nazis were preoccupied with killing Jews, however, the Polish Gentiles evinced no urgency to implement their plans for a revolt.\\" (p. xx). What Fromer forgets is the fact that the Auschwitz-incarcerated Poles also did not revolt on behalf of those Poles who were being murdered, and, likewise, the Auschwitz-incarcerated Jews did not revolt on behalf of those Jews who were being murdered. All revolts were symbolic (and suicidal) in nature, incapable of halting the German killing process against either Poles or Jews.A fair amount of detail is provided about the abortive Sonderkommando revolt itself. Unfortunately, Fromer (p. xx) repeats the false accusation about outside Polish help. For the truth, seeFighting Auschwitz: The resistance movement in the concentration camp."},{"Title":"The Call of the Canyon","review":"I'm a long-time Zane Grey fan and thought I'd read all his Westerns, but apparently I'd missed this one. While I agree with the other reviewers about his compelling descriptions of the West and its beauty, overall I found the story both boring and didactic. Missing were the memorable characters of many other of his books; missing also was the kind of action that makes it hard to put my Kindle down. I'm afraid that I can give it only two stars."},{"Title":"The Call of the Canyon","review":"I must beg to differ with the other reviewers. I found this book to becompetently written and full of beautiful images of the landscape of themagnificent American West, but the love story, the social commentary,the cardboard characters, and the rigid, intolerant, and sometimesabsurd ideas left me cold.Glenn Kilbourne returns from the First World War in Europe and goes westto recover his health. His old New York City fiancee, Carly Burch, goesto visit him in hopes of luring him back to New York. But Glenn haschanged. He's become a man of the west, a farmer and hog raiser, amanual laborer, an outdoorsman, a man among men. Carly tried mightilyto prove her worthiness by riding horses and sharing his life, butultimately returns to New York. Once there, she sees the shallowness ofher city life and finally goes west again.Grey's idea of manhood and womanhood are about as stereotyped and malechauvinist as one can get. I can't cite page numbers here because Iread the book as a Gutenberg download on a PDA, but I've got the exactquotes. Let's listen to a few of them:Glenn to Carly speaking about Carly's female friends:...\\"The best of you girls regard marriage as an escape,instead of responsibility. You don't marry to get yourshoulders square against the old wheel of Americanprogress -- to help some man make good -- to bring atroop of healthy American kids into the world. Youbare your shoulders to the gaze of the multitude andlike it best if you are strung with pearls.\\"...Perhaps you didn't realize that the American soldiers who went to Francein 1918 were fighting to keep the Germans from violating the women ofNew York and Wisconsin.Glenn's injured friend Rust from Wisconsin, speaking to Carly:...\\"You see, we soldiers all had feelings. And in onething we all felt alike. That was we were going tofight for our home and our women. I should say womenfirst. No matter what we read or heard about standingby our allies, fighting for liberty of civilization,the truth was we all felt the same, even if we neverbreathed.... Glenn fought for you. I fought forNell.... We were not going to let the Huns treat you asthey treated French and Belgian girls.\\"...Perhaps there are some women in the U.S. who don't feel a need to marryor raise children. Maybe they even like to dance or listen to jazz!And to think that instead of raising good American kids, they're lettingforeigners come in and pollute our race. For shame says Zane Grey....\\"Nothing wrong with jazz -- where the lights go out inthe dance hall and the dancers jiggle and toddle andwiggle in a frenzy? Nothing wrong in a country wherethe greatest college cannot report birth of one childto each graduate in ten years? Nothing wrong with racesuicide and the incoming horde of foreigners?\\"...I know that this was written in an earlier period, but even in the1920's there were people in the U.S. who struggled for women's rightsand who did not see \\"the incoming horde of foreigners\\" as bringing aboutAmerican \\"race suicide\\". And while many disagreed about why we shouldor should not fight in the war, I should think that everybody with anyunderstanding of current events in the 1920's understood that World WarI had nothing to do with protecting the women of America from Germanrapists.Grey was a throwback to a primitive mentality, anti-urban, anti-foreign,anti-female, anti-intellectual. The \\"love story\\", such as it was, wasnothing but a story of a woman's complete submission to a man. Therewas zero accommodation of the man to the woman. It was 100% the otherway around.I couldn't take either the ideas or the love story seriously. I'll giveit two stars for its beautiful depiction of the west and for it'scompetent writing. But I think that even that may be generous."},{"Title":"The Call of the Canyon","review":"This book is real good, but there is some places where he does tend to over write. He talks a bit too much on mormons."},{"Title":"The Call of the Canyon","review":"As a teen I read every Zane Grey book I could get my hands on. Now in my 70's I enjoyed it as much as then. Am I reverting to my childhood? Thoroughly enjoyed my trip back if that's the case!"},{"Title":"The Call of the Canyon","review":"What can anybody say about Zane Grey. His books and short stories are always entertaining and fun to read anytime."},{"Title":"The Call of the Canyon","review":"Zane Grey gives a good description of the emotional attachment people develop to the canyons of the West. I grew up there, and I enjoyed the book."},{"Title":"The Call of the Canyon","review":"I was slightly disappointed in this book, knowing it was a Zane Gray. The storyline is a love story, but the author dwells more on his views and tries to usealot of words to explain the surroundings. The physical dimensions of thebook was too large & bulky. Again, if your interest is in love stories, thenyou might enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Call of the Canyon","review":"It is 1919 and Carley Burch is a young orphaned woman who lives a socialite's life of ease and pleasure in her New York City family home with her aunt Mary. Her fianc&eacute; Glenn Kilbourne has come home an injured, sick, and broken man after fighting in France during World War I, so he has gone West to Arizona, near Flagstaff, that he might recover his health. However, Glenn's letters to Carley are becoming increasingly puzzling, so she makes a surprise visit to see him. While there she stays in the lodge run by his neighbors, Mr. and Mrs. Hutter and their daughter Flo, who seems to be sweet on Glenn, and meets their hired men, Charley and Lee, the latter of whom had been Flo's boyfriend. She also meets the rude, crude Raze Huff, a sheep dipper who has eyes for her.Glenn has become a hog farmer and realizes that he can never return to his former shallow life. Carley, while she loves the West, thinks that she can never be the wife of a simple hog farmer, so she breaks their engagement and returns to New York. However, even though she throws herself back into her socialite's life, she finds it empty and unsatisfying. Finally, she decides that she must return to Arizona and marry Glenn. When she arrives, Glenn and the Hutters are away to buy hogs. She even purchases land near Glenn's farm which he had earlier expressed a desire to obtain so that he might expand his operations, and has a house built on it. So what will she do when she hears a rumor that during her absence Glenn has married Flo? Zane Grey was one of the favorite authors of my father, who enjoyed Westerns. Not all of Grey's books were bang-bang, shoot-\`em-up cowboy stories of the Old West, like his most famous one, Riders of the Purple Sage (1912).The Call of the Canyon is a more contemporary, romantic tale, yet it still is characterized by a love of the West that shines through in his so many of Grey[s other novels. It is filled with beautiful, lengthy descriptions of the Arizona countryside and a passion for the West and its scenery. I found it an enjoyable book. Carley's ultimate conclusions about the emptiness of her life in response to her friends' pleas are just as relevant today as they were in her time. This excellent story opposes drinking, smoking, immodesty and strongly opposes idleness, selfishness, and living for high society, and it strongly advocates man as bread winner and woman as homemaker, wife, and mother. But it is marred by a few profanities. There are also several references to dancing and one reference to the Grand Canyon's existence for \\"millions of years,\\" but many instances of gratitude to God for blessings and beauty are found. I recommend it for teens and adults."},{"Title":"The Call of the Canyon","review":"This is primarily Grey's diatribe and condemnation of the lack of support of returning WWI combat veterans. A historical note: Those vets received no benefits and more than 200,000 U.S. soldiers suffered physical or mental injuries during The Great War, but in 1919 only 217 had completed rehabilitation programs. That sad chapter has similarities with the Walter Reed Hospital scandal over substandard treatment of U.S. troops wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan.Bless Grey for taking up the cause back in the day, it must not have been very popular to do so at the time, but it got weary hearing one of the primary characters wax on and on about that issue. In addition, I had a real problem with the ending...suffice to say it would not have played out that way. He wrote better books."},{"Title":"The Call of the Canyon","review":"Less western, more what makes a woman tick. Not a favorite, skipped whole paragraphs after one too many trips through this girl's two page at a thought train."},{"Title":"The Call of the Canyon","review":"I forgot how good a writer Zane Grey was. Much more than aWestern writer. This book shows his skill."},{"Title":"The Call of the Canyon","review":"I like reading any book by Zane Grey. Some of his books should be ranked among the Classics. There is no reason for excluding westerns from this accolade"},{"Title":"The Call of the Canyon","review":"I can't beat Zane Grey for a good ole western. I have read them all and enjoyed every one. Most are free also!"},{"Title":"The Call of the Canyon","review":"Let's start with the price: You can't beat free!Now on to the book itself:From a technical standpoint, the formatting is pretty clean as far as free e-books go. No weird typographical issues and no maps or pictures to worry about.I'll assume that if you're reading reviews you might actually want to read the book, so I'll try not to include any spoilers, but some brief plot summary: It's the story of a wealthy young Eastern socialite whose fiance has returned from the first World War a changed man, physically and mentally. He goes West to find his health and himself, with the idea that he'll return when all is well. They correspond until she eventually heads West to find and woo him, in the process realizing that she too has changed. Their fate together remains in doubt until the end.The author includes some wonderful descriptive passages about the Oak Creek Canyon/Sedona/Flagstaff area of Arizona in the early decades of the 20th century, which I very much enjoyed, having lived in that area, but also sprinkles the second half of the tale with what can only be described as diatribes about the loose morals of the time: revealing feminine attire, which he blames for enticing rape; jazz music (the horror!); automobiles (with back seats!); along with birth control (race suicide!) socialism and the influx of foreigners."},{"Title":"The Call of the Canyon","review":"I downloaded this on a whim after reading the previous reviews, and it turned out to be a good find from the public domain. It is both an engrossing love story and a social commentary that is surprisingly in line with our own times. At times, the characters could be talking about the early 21st century and not the early 20th century. I loved Carley's journey towards authentic womanhood even more than the beautiful descriptions of the West. The story grabbed me completely and I found myself rapidly skimming large sections just to get to the end. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Call of the Canyon","review":"Never read a Zane Grey novel so when it was offered on my Kindle for free I decided to give it a try. I was surprised that such a \\"vintage\\" book would be so relevant to current day. It is full of beautiful description and passion for the West and its scenery. I enjoyed the well written story and was surprised by the woman's journey into a life with purpose. Will read more of this series of books."},{"Title":"The Call of the Canyon","review":"First let me say I am am avid western book reader and author myself. I regard Zane Grey's Call of the Canyon as one of the most powerful romance books ever written. I know many people who regard this and Rider's of the Purple Sage, to be Zane Grey's best books, and amoung the best adventure fiction books ever. Each year visitors by the thousands do their best to retrace the footsteps of these eastern lovers who had Gone West. It is a tale that never seems to go out of fashion, and indeed seems to fulfill some great need in each reader lucky enough to hear the Call of the Canyon."},{"Title":"The Call of the Canyon","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect from Call of the Canyon. I've download a lot of free titles to my Kindle, assuming that most are going to be terrible. This was a pleasant surprise! Not knowing much about the author or the period in which this book was written, I eventually determined that it was likely to be written around the same time period of the story. The biggest give-away to me was the at-times lengthy social commentary, which I could have done with less of. Not that I agree nor disagree with the sentiments shared by the author, the way it was handled felt a little out of place.I will also add that I found myself skimming the lengthy descriptions of Arizona, mostly because I've never been and some of the imagery was a little hard for me to visualize. They say a picture is worth a thousand words, and I definitely feel like that applies here.Overall, it was a great love story (which I admit I am a sucker for) that was hard for me to put down, and at the end, I wished it would continue. Because of that, I've already downloaded a handful of other works by Zane Grey to read."},{"Title":"The Call of the Canyon","review":"The story set in the 1920s New York and Arizona is a wonderful romance. The descriptions of the canyons and desert make me want to pack up the car and head out for an extended vacation in Arizona right away. The descriptions are indeed moving.The downside of the novel for me is just a little bit too much \\"philosophy\\" out of the post WW1 era. Grey harps a little to much on his ideal American Woman, American Family, the contrast between the idle rich in New York and the working folks out on the range in The West. There is way too much writing on the plight of W.W.I vets when they returned to America. But in spite of a lot of pages devoted to teaching Grey's message there is a wonderful romantic story to be enjoyed."},{"Title":"The Call of the Canyon","review":"I am 73 years old and always loved to read.

Thank you Kindle.The Call of the Canyon"},{"Title":"The Call of the Canyon","review":"If one understands the time between WWI and WWII and the excesses of the 1920's this book is excellent! Remember this book was written in 1934 at the height of the great depression! Yet it reflects on the era of the 1920's. While some of the values that Grey espouses in the book seem out of date and old fashioned, I think his themes are timeless.The book also provides beautiful descriptions of the Arizona desert and rural life in the western U.S. The story line is quite good and Grey deals effectively with love, conflict, jealousy, and what makes our struggles worthwhile. Enjoy this classic!"},{"Title":"The Call of the Canyon","review":"This is my first Zane Grey book I've ever read. I was expecting an old-fashioned Western with cowboys, six shooters, \\"purty\\" school marms and villians in black hats. This book isn't about that at all.What it is is part condemnation of America's shoddy treatment of its returning soldiers after World War I, and part condemnation of the modern women of the times.Zane Grey, using the voices of his fictional characters, rants against \\"modern feminine unrest\\" (AKA feminism), the immoral dress of the flapper (Heavens, her ankles are showing!) and says the women are, and I quote, \\"idle, luxrious, selfish, pleasure-craving, lazy, useless, work-and-children shirking, absolutely no good.\\"In one memorable scene, Grey has his heroine Carly preaching about the evils of such things as motion pictures, automobiles, jazz, birth control and plucking eyebrows. Oddly, Grey seems to be obsessed with a low birth rate in the nation and refers several times in the book to the fact that women aren't having babies like they should. It makes me curious as to what exactly was going on in the early 1920's.So while this book wasn't what I was expecting it to be, it turned out to be an interesting take on what post-World War I America appeared to be to one man."},{"Title":"The Call of the Canyon","review":"While on vacation in AZ and after my tour of the Grand Canyon this past September (our guide recommended to read \\"Call of the Canyon\\" by Zane Grey.) I decided to purchase the kindle version after the tour (started reading while in AZ) and actually got it for nothing, so it was even better. I really enjoy the way Zane Grey writes. In my mind I can visualize the scenery as I did when I drove through Oak Creek Canyon. It was absolutely beautiful and breath taking! I have to admit that USA does have the best mountains in the world. I'm from NY but not Manhattan and I could almost compare myself to the character of Carley Burch. She travelled to AZ by train, myself by plane (4 flights to different airports!). Following her true love after her many situations and indecisions, she finally makes her last attempt to return to Glenn. As they say, true love conquers all. Right now I am reading another one of his books called \\"Greatest Hits of Grey\\". I also have 2 others which I can not wait to read! After reading \\"Call of the Canyon\\" it keeps my memories fresh of my visit to Sedona and travelling through Oak Creek Canyon!!! I've become a fan of Zane Grey!!"},{"Title":"The Call of the Canyon","review":"The Call of the Canyon is another of Zane Grey's \\"war novels\\" which is to say, it deals with the subject of the mistreatment of returning veterans from the first world war. But it is also the coming of age of a modern \\"sophisticated\\" woman who learns the real meaning of love, and what it means to love someone. The story has several scenes which take place in New York City as well as at Oak Creek Canyon in Arizona. For pure romance, this book can not be beat. Carly Birch is one of Zane Grey's finest female characters, and again I will say he often wrote from the woman's point of view which is why the vast majority of his work was published in the leading \\"women's\\" magazines of the day, and his readership was more than half women. So, ladies, please don't dismiss Zane Grey as a \\"western\\" writer; he was so much more than that."},{"Title":"The Call of the Canyon","review":"I just love this book, so far I've only read it 3 times, but it is certainly one of my very favorites. Zane Gray describes with exacting detail the wondrous beauty of the west, with the the struggles of a romantic relationship between a wounded returning WW1 veteran and his girl friend, who just happens to be a headstrong New Yorker used to having things her way.The story is timeless and exciting and I highly recommend it if you enjoy the west, love and a turn of the century American adventure."},{"Title":"Journal of Roman Military Equipment Studies 12/13 (v. 12-13)","review":"This journal is dedicated to the study of weapons, armour and fighting within the Roman World.

I would have preferred his story of being close to the Rock and Roll scene. Reading some of the articles that were over 20 years old became somewhat boring and outdated. I did learn quite a bit in some of the stories and Fong-Torres does provide some narrative on each story although it is limited.

In it are each of the hierarchies recorded:- when they became active,- which planets were formed by which hierarchie- how hierarchies are related to each other (only mentioned notexplained in detail with the highest hierarchies).In the book are also mentioned:- The zodiac and how they are related to the hierarchies; andwhat it means when a certain sign is active.- Some about what parts of the physical body of a human werealready formed in spirit world by the different hierarchies...Cancer as symbol for the ribcage which was formed for example.- The seven oracles in Atlantean time (Sun oracle, Venus oracleetc.) and that the one who had the most developed ether body ofthe oracles (the leaders) were selected to work through the 7rishi's in India in a later time.- The lowest hierarchies (Angels, ArchAngels and Archia) areexplained in great detail: (a) how they relate to the mineral,plant and animal kingdom and that their physical body, ether body, astral body and the I are located in different spheres (Angel only physical body in the Earth, ArchAngel physical body and ether body in the Earh, Archia physical, ether and astral body in the Earth while Humans have all four parts in the Earth (in this time!!!).Also mentioned is difference between Copernicus' astrological system (viewed from physical viewpoint) and the Ptolemeus astrology (viewed from spiritual perspective - i.e. the spiritual hierarchie view).I found the book to be really intruiging, but it lacked (for me) how the different entities are active now in the Earth, and how can be seen which people have interacted more with certain entities than others... In the book is recorded that Venus entities were present in the Earth to bring greater wisdom at one time, and Mars entities brought about other influences but not beyond: how do they play a role now, when and how did they made their presence felt over time (as the Earth developed) etc.So: very intruiging book, explanations about several things, but only when they first appeared. Only briefly mentioned activity later on in the 7 rishi's, Jesus, but not on when/how the different entities made their presence felt in the Earth in more recent times (or other times) with the exception of Angels, Archangels and Archia.

A big aquarium exhibit is coming to Tidmouth and the docks are hustling and bustling with activity. Cranky the Crane is unloading Bulstrode. Harvey is loading small crates of aquarium glass, while James and Salty are busy with their own tasks.The only problem is, Thomas wants to help and he keeps getting told that he is too small to be of assistance. Sad because he can't find a job \`his size', Thomas is about to head back to the Station when he comes across Salty with a huge, toothy shark in a see-thru tank. Surmising Thomas' sad state, Salty takes pity on Thomas and tells him that small engines **can** be useful, which is exactly what Thomas finds out.When Percy is surprised by the shark in the tank, he loses control and runs right into Henry who then crashes into Harvey's freight car. This accident is so noisy and unexpected that Cranky gets spooked and drops a crate of seaweed on James, causing James to go off the track.As we say at our home, everything was goomeywammered. And to make matters more complicated, the docks are such a scene of chaos that none of the large engines can move about. They are just too *big*.On cue, in comes Thomas. He steps up and because of his smaller size, he is \`Just The Right' engine to clear up the whole mess. The story ends with everything back to normal and everybody waiting in anticipation for the big exhibit to open.Five Stars. Good Read-aloud. This book has good artwork (versus the photos that are taken from the TV show). Steamies abound. So many that almost any Thomas fan should be content.Our small blue friend gets to be a hero. This confirms for small fry that you don't have to be big to be helpful. This book can even be used to help children to understand that no matter how big a mess is made, if everyone pitches in to help together, that mess can be cleaned up.Pam T~Mom and reviewer at BooksforKids-Reviews"},{"Title":"Down at the Docks (Thomas & Friends)","review":"My 3 year old son is a big fan of Thomas and Friends. This was one of the first books I bought for him. Since this book, I bought another one (\\"Cow on a Line\\") and the second book does not even come close to this one. \\"Down at the Docks\\" is illustrated not with photos but with drawings - and I think the drawings are far more effective in telling the story than the photos. \\"Down at the Docks\\" has a story line that is more plausible, and complete, than other books I've seen so far.

Thomas notes the excitement, and decides to look around. He was amazed that several of the cars were like none he had seen before: they were clear, full of water-and held an octopus and a shark! Thomas looks for his friend Salty and asks where the special cars are going. Meanwhile, Harvey was crossing the tracks with a fragile load of empty fish tanks. Percy was in a hurry, and noticed a huge shark looking at him from one of the tanks. He was so surprised and scared that he ended up crashing into Henry, who crashed into Harvey-yikes! What a mess!There's a neat set of trains that corresponds to this book-the aquarium cars. I highly recommend those, especially as companion toys to go along with this book.

A true Westmoreland Glass book would have a great bit of it in there."},{"Title":"Westmoreland Glass: Identification and Value Guide","review":"This is an excellent book that details the history of Westmoreland Glass as no other book has provided before this one. Wilson makes the strong and persuasive argument that Westmoreland was THE leader of decorated glass production in the 1920s and 1930s in the United States, was the first company to produce carnvial glass, and was the leader in the design and production of candy containers. This book details the family history of the author's grandfather, Chas West, and great uncle, George West, in the founding of Westmoreland in the late 1880s till the changing of the guard in the late 1930s to the Brainard family. It is well organized in content and photographs. However, if you are looking for a milk glass book or a book on paneled grape, then do not buy this book.

Photos are not always identified. Many items are discussed but not depicted in photo or sketch. The price guide in the back uses different names/descriptions than what is used in the text of the book, so you can never be sure if you are checking value on the correct item. I enjoyed the book, but if you want to learn more about various pieces of Westmoreland glass, you will need to buy other books.

Therefore what a pleasure it is to find that Betram D. Wolfe's &quot;Three Who Made a Revolution&quot; is back on the shelves. I read it first when I was in school -- one of the first serious or challenging &quot;adult&quot; books that I read with pleasure. I'm a little chagrined to recall some of my own responses. On the one hand, I remember entertaining the uneasy sense that the book was probably too much fun to be &quot;real scholarship.&quot; Maybe a little -- but in retrospect, I think most of the fun comes not from mere clowning, but from Wolfe's real engagement with the humanity of his subjects. On the other hand, I remember writing in a term paper something along the lines of how the book would probably put a damper on further research. I think I knew as I wrote it that this was a pretty fatuous remark, but hey, I was on a deadline. Anyway, it is nice to be able to recognize in retrospect that (a) it of course certainly did nothing at all to dampen further reserach; but (b) despite the torrent of further research, it still repays rereading.Wolfe wrote at a time when the left was still pretty gullible about Communism. There was, of course, an anti-communist opposition: in the long run the antis have proved to be more right than the apologists, but it is not so clear how much this is the result of careful research, how much of lucky accident. At any rate, giving a few points for hindsight, Wolfe's moral clarity is in retrospect pretty clear. And whatever his imperfections, he probably motivated me to read a lot of stuff I might otherwise never have come to: I remember particularly Trotsky's own autobiography, Adam Ulam's &quot;Unfinished Revolution,&quot;, and Robert V. Daniels' &quot;Documentary History of Communism,&quot; all of which I read in the weeks after I had finished Wolfe, and while I was still operating in his wake -- to say nothing of whatever I have picked up in the generation or more since. Any book that can stimulate that kind of inquiry has justified itself, no matter what its intrinsic merits -- and in this case, the intrinsic merits are pretty strong, also."},{"Title":"Three Who Made a Revolution A Biographical History","review":"A study of the events leading to the Russian revolution through a biography of its three main leaders: Lenin, Stalin and Trotsky. Bertram Wolfe wrote this book in 1948. He didn't have the access to official documents that today historians of the Russian revolution have. But as one of the founders of the US Communist party, he knew some of the Soviet leaders himself (including Stalin) and he did a thorough job looking at the Soviet press, the Soviet propaganda, the autobiographies of the exiled leaders (Trotsky and the Georgian Mensheviks were particularly useful in this regard). Through this \\"archaeological\\" work (his own term), seeing how different accounts confirmed or contradicted each other, he was able to find a lot about the beginnings of the Russian revolution. Only in writing about the early life of Stalin he made some mistakes, since the Soviet leader himself try to disguise a lot of his early life through the official hagiographies (Wolfe, for example, states that he was born in 1879, not 1878, that his father died in 1890 and not some two decades later, and he downplays his early role as a revolutionary in the Caucasus, following Trotsky). Wolfe's viewpoint is very interesting, and original at the time it was written, that of a disillusioned believer. Many of the things he charged the Soviets were learned some years later to be true, following Khrushchev's secret speech. Overall, a very good work that has stood the test of time."},{"Title":"Three Who Made a Revolution A Biographical History","review":"This hefty volume, long considered a standard work, follows the minutiae of international socialist squabbling over decades, but comes to an abrupt end with the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914.

Attorney Kunich's inside look at the law is the most compelling reason to read the book."},{"Title":"The Naked Clone: How Cloning Bans Threaten Our Personal Rights","review":"The subject matter is human freedom, and this book is one which raises fundamental issues about the freedoms of man in relation to cloning. If freedom and cloning are subjects of concern, a more appropriate read cannot be found. The book is fascinating, bold and powerful, one of the most important books about the cloning controversy. You may agree or disagree with the author on his conclusions but you'll never be bored for a minute.We have freedoms now that scarcely existed five hundred years ago or even one hundred years ago.

The money doesn't go towards supporting an affluent lifestyle; this down-and-out divorcee is living in a dive motel, drinking cheap vodka, and driving a battered minivan. But poker money has to come from somewhere.Jack, who's found all the ways to dodge work a bureaucracy can offer, must investigate a massive bomb threat. A desperate man planted the bomb hoping to force the FBI to finally solve his daughter's murder. Jack partners with Ben Alton to follow some leads.The two couldn't be more different. Ben, a family man, is a go-getter who worked his way up from the projects. He sets his mind to something and doesn't give up. But he's not working at 100% because he recently lost the lower half of his leg to cancer, and though he's back a month early to help with the investigation, the boss assigns him to desk duty for his own safety.Of all the available agents, these two seem the least likely to succeed, but Jack's sharp powers of deduction and Ben's unstoppable energy work together well, and with some luck, the old crime is solved. But questions still remain, and the pair dig deeper to find another more-horrifying layer of murderous revenge. They must stay one step ahead of the villain and his traps; Jack's got to stay ahead of the FBI's internal police.This audiobook had me hooked from start to finish. The pace never slows, nor does it move too fast that you can't understand what's happening. I'm no expert on the FBI, but the author certainly made me feel I was inside the organization, with its politics and personalities. Some events stretched the limits of disbelief, but I don't think they went too far.As for the performance by the reader, it was mostly OK, but I have a few compaints. The voice of Jack was very gruff. At first I didn't think I'd want to sit through a whole book with that voice. I got used to it, but I never really liked it. He also mispronounced \\"interment\\" as \\"internment.\\" My biggest gripe however is how his voice dropped off at the end of sentences. Since I listen while driving, hearing those words was quite a problem.And sure, the \\"odd couple\\" pairing of Ben and Jack has been done to death, but this author pulled it off. They fire off some funny lines and it never became tiresome. The writing style is clear, never overwrought. This book isn't the same old thing. It's actually darn good."},{"Title":"Traps: A Novel of the FBI","review":"It has been three years since his daughter has been kidnapped and the FBI still has not the slightest idea what happened to Leah Ziven. Her father Conrad builds a bomb and plants it under the Cook County jail, which houses over 15,000 prisoners. Only he has the combination to disarm the bomb and he won't give it out until they find his daughter.FBI agent Jack Kincade, a man who robs banks as a sideline is partnered with Ben Alton, an amputee victim with something to prove. The hastily formed team finds the girl's body and the ransom at an abandoned shack. Leah's father gives them the data they need to remove the bomb but that doesn't end the case because the killer is still out there. Ben and Jack (not Jerry, silly) are on his case, trying to break him, a very dangerous thing to do to a psychopath with nothing left to lose.TRAPS is a fascinating crime thriller due to the enigmatic anti-hero Jack Kincade. He's a drunk and a gambler who cut off all communication with his son. He robs banks to support his gambling habit yet in spite of all these failing, readers feel drawn to this bad boy because they sense there is a kernel of decency and goodness buried in his heart, waiting to bloom under the right conditions. Paul Lindsay will appeal to readers who like the novels of Patricia Cornwell and Robert W. Walker.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Traps: A Novel of the FBI","review":"This is definitely one of Mr Lindsay's best FBI novels to date. Jack Kincaid, our tragic hero, is someone I felt sorry for, yet admired at the same time, flaws and all. Loved his detecting skills. The story was riveting and came to a thrilling climax. I'd pretty much figured out the ending, so was kind of reluctant to finish because I didn't want to be right. Overall, a very enjoyable FBI procedural, with a likable tragic hero. Looking forward to what comes next from Mr Lindsay."},{"Title":"Traps: A Novel of the FBI","review":"As readers of Paul Lindsay novels know, the former FBI agent often portrays the modern day FBI in a less than flattering manner. What John Grisham did for layers in his novels, Paul Lindsey has done for the FBI. However, usually Paul Lindsey novels have at their core an agent hero fighting a flawed system where stats and appearances weigh more heavily than actual police work. In this thoroughly depressing novel, which also lacks any shred of humor found in his other works, the hero is fatally flawed on so many levels; the conclusion becomes anti-climatic and expected.Jack Kincade is an alcoholic, a degenerate gambler according to his ex-wife's attorney, a non-existent father to his son, Cole, and a burned out FBI agent. Emotionally dead to himself and others, he spices up his life by robbing banks using a technique perfected years ago involving night deposits. Assigned to investigate those same cases, which are very low dollar in terms of risk and reward, he has managed to dead end them all to this point. However, a lie can only be sustained so long.Thanks to the unexpected re-opening of a three-year-old kidnapping case after the frustrated father plants a bomb under the local jail, Jack Kincade's world slowly begins to its final collapse. Partnered with Agent Ben Alton who is currently in remission form cancer after doctors amputated part of one leg, they begin to work the case. But in so doing, while successful on one level, Alton makes a fatal error in judgment with massive repercussions for everyone. With all the speed and emotion of geologic plates, this novel grinds toward a steadily darker life for all the characters involved in this novel.This certainly is not the best that Paul Lindsey has to offer. Virtually all the characters involved in this 260-page novel, are robotic in thought, emotion, and deed. That fact coupled with the incredible amount of loathing and self hatred expressed by many of these characters is appalling. The redeeming motivations found in his works are sadly lacking in this effort. Hopefully, this book is not a sign that like his fictional characters; Paul Lindsey is burned out as an author."},{"Title":"Getting Rid Of Bradley (Harlequin Temptation #480)","review":"I read four chapters and put the book up for sale without finishing it.

The book was a total of 248 pages of nothing but a dingbat heroine and somewhat boring hero. I was truly surprised. The plot should've been excellent. Instead it dragged and the heroine Lucy and hero Zach seemed to jump on each other the minute they met. I never got to see where they fell in love or when they even became friends. The lines are blurred. Even now I am not convinced they loved each other, more like they settled for one another because Zach was getting older and Lucy was lonely and they needed companionship.The 'funny parts' the reviews talked about I thought were contrived in light of how the story was progressing and didn't help. Zach was too...I don't know...he got under my skin. We are supposed to believe this guy was a hottie and a 'bad boy cop' ect, ect, but all I got was he was in some sort of midlife crisis at age 38. Lucy had other major issues I won't even get into, lol. I am surprised she made it through life as a teacher, that's all I am going to say, lol.~Lucy Savage is not having a good day or week. Her cheating, loser of an ex-husband didn't even have the nerve to show up in court for the divorce and the dye job has left her hair green and breaking apart. To make matters worse?

Apparently Bradley is not only a cheater, but an embezzler too. How will she finally get rid of Bradley???Zach will protect her round the clock until they catch whoever is trying to kill her by blowing up her car, her bed and breaking into her house. But who is worse? Bradley the cheater-embezzler-ex, the guy trying to kill her, or Zach-the-sexy-cop? And how in the world is she going to fix this hair!Really dissapointed.

This is the second Crusie novel I have read (after Welcome to Temptation) and it runs along the same formula as the first. This is an engaging, quick read--some romance, a little mystery, some mild humor, but nothing, in my view, spectacular. Still, though, I can see that many readers love Crusie's work, and if that's you, I think you will enjoy this novel. She's just not someone I can rave about (but I will keep reading her novels when I come across them)."},{"Title":"Getting Rid Of Bradley (Harlequin Temptation #480)","review":"I was glad I'd read some of her other books first before this one. Getting Rid of Bradley was somewhat slow and confusing. It seemed like any type of action took forever. It was frustrating to keep track of which Bradley was which and there were lots of dogs to keep track of also. Although I did think the \\"dead dog\\" thing was funny. Lucy was a cute character and Zack was funny. They got together fast and Zack changed his mind quickly about not wanting to be commited, but that's fiction.The book was okay. I finished cause Crusie wrote it and I did somewhat want to know what was up with the Bradley's and how things would turn out with Lucy and Zack, but it wasn't one of my favorites by her."},{"Title":"Getting Rid Of Bradley (Harlequin Temptation #480)","review":"Lucy Savage doesn't live her life according to impulse or whim. Everything she does is logical. So, when the second law of thermonuclear dynamics seemed to suggest that she marry Bradley Porter, she went ahead and did it. Obviously, that decision was moved by impulse and spontaneity masquerading as logic, because it didn't work out at all. Freshly divorced, Lucy promises herself that things are going to change. For one thing, she's going to be more independent. No letting her sister tell her what to do, no letting a man take care of her. From now on, she's going to do things on her own.Lucy's first test of her independence comes right outside the diner where shejust had a post-divorce lunch with her sister. When a crazed (rough and sexy, sure but definitely crazed) man pulls her into an alley, Lucy asserts herself by clobbering him with her physics textbook laden purse and sprinting away. As she tells her dogs later that afternoon, standing up for yourself is strangely exhilarating.That thrilling feeling lasts right up until Lucy's erstwhile mugger shows up at her front door. It turns out that he's neither crazed nor a mugger, he's a cop - Detective Zack Warren. Zack thinks Lucy's ex, Bradley Porter, is somehow tied to fugitive master-embezzler John Bradley. Furthermore, Zack's convinced someone is trying to do Lucy harm, possibly even trying to kill her.Zack figures that once he's outlined the situation for Lucy, she'll be sensible and do exactly what he says. He figures wrong. Lucy doesn't believe her ex, rat though he is, would ever get involved with anything criminal. And, she informs the pushy detective, if someone really was shooting in that alley, they were most likely aiming for Zack. So no, she's not going to go stay at her sister's house. That leaves Zack with one choice. He'll just have to move in with Lucy until he sorts the whole mess out. Now Lucy has to deal with a dangerous attraction inside her house as well as (possibly) a dangerous criminal outside.Jennifer Crusie's second novel ranks right up there with some of her best. Lucy and Zack are extremely likable, both as individuals and as a couple, and the romance is realistic and fun. The mystery of the Bradleys adds an additional element to the story and keeps everything moving along with extra zip. Getting Rid of Bradley is a blast to read from beginning to end."},{"Title":"Getting Rid Of Bradley (Harlequin Temptation #480)","review":"I'm 3 years too late, but I just came across this book and finally.......an author who got it right!!

I like this one because details like Lucy's green hair, and the \\"dead dog joke\\" not being \\"that's no lady, that's my wife\\" are great and make lasting impressions. I really fell in love with the characters in this book, and I hope that anyone who reads Jennifer Crusie and doesn't like her reads the three I have recommended, because they are worth it, and that's why I watch out for her books.

She's just been &quot;stood-up&quot; at a divorce hearing by her cheating husband Bradley, her pushy sister Tina keeps telling her what to do, and she has just acquired the hair-do from hell. On top of that, it seems that someone is trying to kill her. In the middle of all of this mayhem, she meets a handsome cop, Zack Warren, who is certain that Bradley is guilty of embezzlement. He also believes that Bradley, for one reason or another, is also behind the attempted shootings and mild bombings aimed towards Lucy. Hoping to protect Lucy and catch Bradley at the same time, Zach moves into Lucy's home. Zack, who doesn't consider himself the marrying type, is certain he'll be able to maintain his hormone level throughout his time with Lucy. Lucy also believes that she'll be able to contain her attraction, but somewhere along the way both her and Zack's plan seems to crumble away, revealing a passion that neither have experienced before.&quot;Getting Rid of Bradley&quot; is one of those novels you just can't help laughing out loud to. Bestselling author Jennifer Crusie manages to tell an entertaining story by blending humour and sexual tension. The characters and situations they are thrust into are so crazy, so left field, that you can't help believing that it could actually happen. The interactions between Lucy and Zack are very entertaining to read and it's nice to watch their relationship develop in such a short time period. What begins as an innocent attraction quickly turns into overwhelming passion and eventually love for the two, who seem hell-bent on preventing just that.If you're looking for a light-hearted, romantic novel, check this one out.

She doesn't want or need another man in her life but when she spots dangerously handsome Zack in a caf&eacute; she figures a fling might not be a bad idea. But when he accosts her in the parking lot all of her sexy thoughts fly out the window and she beats the crap out of him with her textbook! She's thrilled with herself until she discovers he's an undercover cop who was only trying to save her life. When further attempts are made on her life he moves in to protect her and ends up falling in love with her dogs and, although it scares theheck out of him, her.This is one of my favorite Crusie books. The heroine is easy to identify with as she has a perpetual bad hair day throughout most of the book. The hero looks tough, and tries to act tough but is a big marshmallow on the inside, especially when dealing with Lucy and her dogs. When he brings her a special gift I was a goner - and so was she. There's a lot of humor, love and touching moments in this great book. I had a blast reading it."},{"Title":"Getting Rid Of Bradley (Harlequin Temptation #480)","review":"This book first came out in 1994 and despite beating a path to bookstore doors for the release of Ms. Crusie's last 4 books...I was caught unaware by this one. But, I snagged it off a shelf, brought it home and couldn't stop reading once I had started it. Phone calls went unanswered, dog went unfed and frankly, I'm not sure if I remembered to feed myself!A more unlikely couple would be hard to find then Lucy, a wacky, recently divorced teacher looking for some changes in her life, and Zack...a cop that feels his age weighing heavily on his tall muscular body, even though he's only 36. The verbal exchanges they put each other through are some of the funniest I've read and that includes Jennifer Crusie's more recent offerings. This book is a delightful experience of laugh-out-loud, foot stomping, eye watering exercises. Along with the hysterically zany moments, we're awarded some of the most enduring, red-hot steamy romantic displays between Lucy and Zack that rivial anything I've read. This book is a whoop and a keeper!"},{"Title":"Getting Rid Of Bradley (Harlequin Temptation #480)","review":"What fire-cracker humour! What rapier wits and zany zest! When you pick up a Jennifer Crusie book, you know it's a laugh-till-you-drop affair and in a succinct yet marvellous short narration of around 245 pages - Crusie puts her deadpanned humour to such hilarious effects on a tale of love and sabotage. Not since MANHUNTING has Crusie ever been so sharp-witted with fast quips and meticulous observations, and her characters Lucy Savage Porter and Zack Warren is one hell of a firebrand couple.Lucy Porter just had a bad week - what with all the bad hair day that made a green moss out of her mane (which would probably attract male Tolkien fanatics, as her sister Tina puts it), getting a divorce from her mundane husband Bradley after seeing him cosy up with a blonde, plus an irritating embezzling investigator Zack trailing her - she turns feral and savage (ironically her middle name) to get a grip on her life. It never rains but pours - Lucy becomes entangled when Bradley is a suspect of an embezzling case. She laughs. Even the insipid Bradley is playing a joke on her - life isn't what it seems.Things get funnier and hysterically comedic when Zack comes in to protect her from a vicious sabotage. He believes maturity is death and is a cynic at romance, but Lucy with her antics and three cute dogs changes his perception. He yearns a more domestic life, picking up cooking and ripping floorboards and even picks up stray dogs. Lucy's ex-lovelife is based on a thermonuclear equation and she is going to be sterile of it - go illogical. Can their romance last? But before they can get until there, the sabotage intensifies to a potential life-threatening situation....GETTING RID OF BRADLEY proves Ms. Crusie's mastery at weaving a tight smalltown mystery with keen observations on woman's psyche in change and love. It brims with dry sardonic wits and humour and charms with a big heart. Lucy is sympathetic and endearing; Zack is a passionate guy. It is a boost to our faith in love and fun. This book is needed as a reliving panacea for anyone who is on to getting rid of (depression or husbands) badly."},{"Title":"Getting Rid Of Bradley (Harlequin Temptation #480)","review":"Jennifer Crusie is one of the rising stars among romance writers, and deservedly so. Her books are clever and quick-moving.GETTING RID OF BRADLEY is a re-issue of an earlier novel, and it will delight her newer fans who missed the book on its first go-round.Her characters are distinctive and well-developed, and the plot is far more detailed than in most conventional romances. Heroine Lucy Savage is endearing and compelling, with foibles that seem all too real. The dogs are real and compelling, also. Reading Ms. Crusie's CV on the back of the jacket, it is easy to understand how she has become such a star in her field.The only complaint is that once this plot reached its inevitable climax--every pun intended--the story becomes more about lust than about mystery. This is a pity, because Jennifer Crusie has crafted a romance novel that has far more depth than the genre usually requires."},{"Title":"Getting Rid Of Bradley (Harlequin Temptation #480)","review":"Fresh from a divorce and living with her menagerie of dogs, Lucy just wants to get her life back and answer to herself. But when shots are fired and bombs go off at her home, the police are convinced that her ex-husband Bradley is either behind it or the intended victim, as he is being investigated for embezzlement. To protect Lucy, sexy detective Zach Warren is called in for protection duty. As the two banter and try to gain the upper hand, they fall for each other. The on-going battle of whether she could beat up Zach will have the reader chuckling.I am convinced that Jennifer Crusie could write the yellow pages and keep me on the edge of my seat. Her awesome ability with dialogue, character development, and setting up a romantic mood are unsurpassed and excel even in the most inane story. The plot in this isn't great, and overall it is an average read, but what will keep the reader's attention is the relationship dynamic between Lucy and Zach, and of course her pack of pets. You gotta love a man who can look beyond green slime hair and see the inner you."},{"Title":"Getting Rid Of Bradley (Harlequin Temptation #480)","review":"You don't read a romance novel for the plot which is a good thing for Jennifer Crusie's &quot;Getting Rid of Bradley.&quot; All the defining elements of a great contemporary romance novel are here - an extremely sexy copy hero, witty dialogue, lots of sexual tension - and you'll really enjoy the book if you don't get distracted by the contrived plot. The hero, Zack Warren, is very well drawn. Thanks to Crusie's vivid prose, you really get a strong sense of his edgy energy and intense emotional reactions. The heroine, Lucy Savage, just got a quicky divorce, and lives in a great house with her rather unique dogs, including one who performs a dog joke. Even though she's suffering from a bad dye job that left her hair green, she is enjoying feeling independent and adventurous - handy since people are shooting at her and planting bombs in her house. Zack, a police officer, moves in to protect her, and there's lots of fun reading as these two strong personalities try to come to grips wih their strong attraction. A classic contemporary romance scenario. My problem with the book is that the unknown threat that brings them together doesn't work. The jumping off point for the back plot is Lucy's ex-husband, Bradley. Zack believes Bradley has something to do with the bombs, etc.; Lucy is adamant that her ex is too staid and boring to be involved in a crime. First, I couldn't reconcile the Lucy we see in the story with the doormat that married a man she always found extremely dull. Second, the crime isn't very interesting, and the bad guys' motivation for threatening Lucy just isn't believable. If you concentrate on Zack and Lucy and their relationship and ignore the rest, you'll enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Getting Rid Of Bradley (Harlequin Temptation #480)","review":"Jennifer Crusie's second romance novel, Getting Rid of Bradley, has a lot to offer. For those who enjoy light, fun, easy reads -- this one works; for readers in dire need of romance and sex -- this one fits the bill; or for those who love a good mystery -- well, need I say more?Getting Rid of Bradley starts off in the middle of all the action: Lucy Savage Porter is stood up by her husband, Bradley, at their divorce hearing, so she and her sister, Tina, take a break for lunch at Harvey's Diner. Meanwhile, police officers Anthony and Zach are at Harvey's, too, following up on a tip of the whereabouts of their latest case, embezzler John Bradley. Of course, their efforts are fruitless when John Bradley doesn't show, but there may be a break in the case afterall -- Zach overhears Lucy mentioning something about \\"getting rid of Bradley,\\" and everything snowballs from there.Is Lucy's Bradley the same guy Anthony and Zach are looking for? Is it possible that Lucy did not know her husband AT ALL? And what about Lucy's unfortunate luck with men -- will Zach help turn her frown upside down? Discovering the answers to these questions is plain, pure fun. I will admit to being a bit overwhelmed in the beginning since it jumped in with all these characters and all this action, but it did not take me long to settle down comfortably in the plot. Jennifer Crusie is a master of her art -- light, frivilous, juicy stories in a concise, sharp, easy language that make her novels a pleasure to read. Perfect for the beach, by the fireplace, or a vacation from heavier books. I look forward to more!"},{"Title":"Getting Rid Of Bradley (Harlequin Temptation #480)","review":"\\"Getting Rid of Bradley\\" by Jennifer Crusie is one of my favourite books. I read a lot and I know what I like, and this is definitely it! The book is character-driven and both the heroine and hero are entertaining and endearing. Lucy Savage, previously Lucy Savage-Porter - which, according to her sister, made her sound like an angry bell-hop - is quirky and crazy. Between her ever-changing and often increasingly bad hair days and her lovable dogs - who are rounded characters in themselves :) - she keeps the pages turning. She meets the love of her life, Zack Warren, after mistaking the unsuspecting sexy cop for a mugger and beating him up in the street - although he maintains that he let her do it, of course. What with her obsessive soon-to-be-ex-husband on the loose, at least one criminal running around shooting at people and a mystery to solve, Zack decides that there is simply no other way around it than that he should move into her beloved house - which she likes more than her ex - with her. Lucy soon finds that Zack - who is in denial that he is in his thirties and could soon be *gasp* old - is a mix of mischievous little boy and mature sex-on-legs man, and Zack swings from commitment-phobe to realising quite quickly that he never wants to leave Lucy, the dogs and the house - heck, he's even loving her cooking lessons! - and just has to figure out a way to get her out of the divorce court and straight back down the aisle - with him! This book is fast-paced, well-written and just plain funny! Highly recommended for romance readers or anyone with a sense of humour."},{"Title":"Getting Rid Of Bradley (Harlequin Temptation #480)","review":"On the day the divorce from her womanizing husband, Bradley, is final, Lucy Savage can't stop looking at the dangerous looking man in the diner--so different from her banker ex. Maybe it's time to do something spontaneous instead of logical. Outside the diner, the dangerous looking man proves himself--by trying to mug her! Luckily, Lucy is able to fight him off with her physics textbook, and goes home feeling quite pleased with herself.Zack Warren can hardly believe the woman he tried to protect from gunfire outside the diner actually assaulted him with her purse. He didn't even have time before she ran to tell her he was a cop. Now he has to figure out who was shooting at her and why, and what information she has about Bradley, the embezzler he's trying to catch.When Lucy won't leave her home even though it would be safer for her to stay somewhere else (after all, she can't leave her three dogs), Zack stays with her to protect her, and the incendiary devices fly fast and furious. The fire between Lucy and Zack seems to be even stronger than the fire that Bradley--or someone--is throwing at them.If you've read other books by Jennifer Crusie, you know about her quick humor, witty dialog, memorable characters, yummy love scenes, endearing pets...stories that you'll happily devour in one sitting. All those elements are present in this Romance Writers of America RITA award winner.

My caveat is, it's my understanding that this is one of her earlier books, one written before she had perfected her craft to the level it is now. That being said, this book was so disappointing I almost put it down.The problem? Well while it did have some humurous moments, Lucy was so stupid she was almost unendurable. She seemed to have no logic, Crusie, tried to put the reader inside of Lucy's mind to better understand her, but who would want to be in the mind of such a twit. What reasonable person would doubt a police officer when they were told their life was in danger? What reasonable person would resist the police department's attempts to keep them safe. Yep, Lucy was a nuisance.You can see in this book the beginnings of what Crusie does so well, which is to bring humor to her characters while making them relatable and realistic. This book was more of an unpolished version of her later work, there were parts that were so farfetched I was too exasperated to suspend disbelief to enjoy them. Lucy wasn't so much funny as annoying as hell and she certainly wasn't relatable or realistic.The good news, Crusie does a much better job in other books in refining her characters so they seem much more three dimensional.

She is witty, compassionate, and excellent at crafting characters I come to love. But this book was just so predictable and. . .and. . .okay. Boring. It was boring. From the female protagonist's ever-changing hair color to the easily-predicted action sequences (you know--the heroine has to brain the hero at least once; there has to be funny danger that you don't really take seriously; they have to fall in love with each other post-haste)--this one left me cold. It's not that I hated the characters; it's just that they aren't substantial enough to be reprinted and up-charged. For $3 or so a pop, they're okay. Not great, but at least okay. But for $7? No way.Please stop reprinting old romances in new mass market form! Give us new characters and new plotlines. Pretty please?"},{"Title":"Getting Rid Of Bradley (Harlequin Temptation #480)","review":"The ONLY reason I am giving this book a MARGINAL 2 stars is because it is entertaining in how bad it is.

Lucy tries so desperately to assert her \\"independence\\" it's irritating... and the bad boy sexy mytery cop? The whole mid-life crisis thing made him not so mysterious... and defiantly not sexy...Honestly there were times when I had to stop reading in the middle of a chapter and just walk away because it just raditated with... stupidity.If you want to read about a smart, funny airhead, with not one but TWO sexy men than please check out Janet Evanovich Stephanie Plum series.Trust me, you're wasting your time by reading the title."},{"Title":"Getting Rid Of Bradley (Harlequin Temptation #480)","review":"Too short and too fluffy for the money.

I am a bit of a goody-goody. This is a great book for beginners like me. I thought it was funny and sweet. I loved it!"},{"Title":"Getting Rid Of Bradley (Harlequin Temptation #480)","review":"Lucy Savage, like a lot of Crusie heroines, has decided to take control of her life, but so far it's not going well. Her husband Bradley stood her up in divorce court, the blonde dye job that was supposed to symbolize her independence turned out greenish, her sister keeps telling her what to do, and the sexy guy in the leather jacket turned out to be a mugger. At least she stood up for herself there--she beat him off with her physics book.Except he wasn't really a mugger--he was a cop, and he'd knocked her down to keep her from being shot. Zack Warren's after an embezzler named Bradley, and when he overheard Lucy tell her sister she was going home to \\"get rid of Bradley\\" (throw out all his stuff), he put 2 & 2 together.Now he's adding protecting Lucy to finding Bradley.Getting Rid of Bradley is fast-moving and witty, with wonderful screwball-comedy dialogue and characters whose view of the world is just slightly skewed, but in their heads they're completely reasonable.It just occurred to me that that's one thing I always enjoy about a Crusie novel--how clearly you can see the characters. Even when you're in their POV (point of view, not privately owned vehicle), you can see the contrast between how they see the world and how the world sees them--because everybody's a little off-center--it's part of being human.And there's a dog--three of them, in this case, including Heisenberg, who does a \\"dog joke,\\" and cracks me up completely.I loved watching Lucy and Zack fall in love and merge their lives. You can see it happening, kind of like those clocks with clear cases so all the little gears are visible. There's no sudden about-face, no unmotivated actions, it's all right there on the page. I'm not explaining this well, I realize, but it makes perfect sense in my head. At any rate, it makes the book a joy to read, and re-read."},{"Title":"Getting Rid Of Bradley (Harlequin Temptation #480)","review":"Very humorous, although I would have liked a little more between the sheets.

Thank you jennifer for writing this book!"},{"Title":"Getting Rid Of Bradley (Harlequin Temptation #480)","review":"It was a very cute story but I personally prefer ANYONE BUT YOU over this story. The character Zack in this story is a bit rough around the edges for me. Although at the end he did soften up a lot, but I felt his character was very rough. However it was a nice, humorous story, and it does keep the reader interested through out the plot."},{"Title":"Getting Rid Of Bradley (Harlequin Temptation #480)","review":"Something was repetitive and a little boring about the conversations during the first third of the book. This was one of the author's first books and it wasn't as good as her later books. I was annoyed that Lucy kept saying she didn't believe she was being shot at and that she was in danger, even though a bullet hit her cheek, and a bomb went off in her car. She went out for a jog and to a beauty parlor when she should have stayed home where she had police protection. There were a few humorous lines, but I'd recommend skipping this book unless you're a die-hard Crusie fan. It was ok, but not what I was used to from her. Sexual language: mild. Number of sex scenes: one. Setting: current day U.S. Copyright: 1994. Genre: mystery romance."},{"Title":"Getting Rid Of Bradley (Harlequin Temptation #480)","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

I love her! Her writing is top, and she keeps it realistic enough to be believeable, but humorous too. This was one of her earlier books from the Harlequin &quot;Temptation&quot; line, and we can see what appears to be Harlequin holding her back in someways. &quot;Getting Rid of Bradley&quot; isn't as funny as some of her earlier works. It feels like she's following the rules laid down by Harlequin. However, despite this, it allows her voice to come through.

I can't wait to read the author's other books. Share it with your girlfriends. I actually laughed out loud at many parts."},{"Title":"Getting Rid Of Bradley (Harlequin Temptation #480)","review":"This is the first Jennifer Cruise novel I've read, and I'll definitely be a repeat reader. Lucy and Zack are an incredibly likeable couple, and it's nice to see a male character who relies on his &quot;intuition.&quot; Lucy's dogs are also a hoot, with personality to spare. My only complaint is that Tina, Lucy's sister, and Anthony, Zack's partner, were under cast. This is a light read, a great beach book."},{"Title":"Getting Rid Of Bradley (Harlequin Temptation #480)","review":"When her husband has an affair, Lucy Savage, with encouragement from her sister, divorces him. But Bradley has promised he'll explain everything and Lucy goes to the greasy-spoon where he's promised he'll meet her. There's no Bradley there, but there is a sexy cop--one who's so disreputable looking, Lucy believes he's a mugger. And he really does almost mug Lucy when someone takes a shot at them when they leave the diner.Cop Zach Warren had been sent to the diner by a phone call promising him he'd find an embezzlement suspect, Bradley, there. There has to be a connection between Lucy's Bradley and the Bradley he's after. Searching the things Bradley left in Lucy's house--things he left because Lucy's sister bought all new locks the instant he headed out the door--has got to lead to a clue. Unfortunately, though, instead of a clue, Zach finds an annoying cat next door, and continued threats against Lucy. The threats don't seem designed to kill her, exactly, but they certainly are scary. Zach's answer is to stick around and body-guard the sexy schoolteacher.Lucy believes in logic, not love. And logic tells her that 'her' Bradley would never embezzle a million dollars. It also tells her that Zach is exactly the wrong man for her. But logic doesn't have any explanation for why she wants him around.In this early novel by Jennifer, Cruise combines humor, endearing (if very odd) characters, and a bit of adventure in a completely enjoyable fast read. Originally published in Harlequin's Temptation line, GETTING RID OF BRADLEY went a long way to establish Crusie's reputation as a star in the romance genre. More than ten years later, the book remains fresh and fun. Zach is a charming character--worried about being in his mid-thirties, insistent that Lucy didn't really beat him up when she'd thought he was mugging her, delighted with his ability to cook nachos and other simple dishes after eating in restaurants for years (as Lucy insists he learn to cook). But Lucy is the real star of the story--concerned about being independent, with frequently changing hair color, flaky enough to ignore Zach's most basic safety requests, but with a real strength that drives the story forward.Crusie has made a career out of throwing dysfunctional characters into danger and creating a mix of laughter and suspense out of it. In this early novel, she already has the touch. I'm happy to recommend GETTING RID OF BRADLEY for those of us who missed the novel on its first release. (GETTING RID OF BRADLEY was initially released as Harlequin Temptation #480, January 1994)."},{"Title":"Getting Rid Of Bradley (Harlequin Temptation #480)","review":"Lucy Savage is having a streak of bad luck. It all started two months ago when she married her husband, Bradley, because of the second law of thermonuclear dynamics. Well, maybe it was actually to get the house of her dreams, a big old Victorian. But after catching Bradley with the blonde, it was time for Lucy to move on. Then things went from bad to worse. Bradley stood her up in divorce court; she was tackled in an alley by a gun-wielding hoodlum, who turned out to be a cop. Of course, she didn't find that out until after she beat him up. She's been shot at, her car blew up, and experimentation with color has left her hair green.Zack Warren, the sexy detective Lucy attacked, is sure her ex-husband is the same Bradley he's trying to arrest for embezzlement. Now Zach has moved in with Lucy to provide police protection. But they both may need protection, more from each other, because the case is not the only thing heating up!I have read a couple of other books by Crusie, and while this story was good, I didn't feel it was her best work. Overall, it was cute and the dialogue witty, but it lacked the laugh out loud humor found in her other work I've read thus far. It was a fast-paced read, but I did find it relatively easy to lay the book aside when I needed to. Lucy and Zack were likeable main characters, but not very memorable.Ms. Crusie hooked me upon reading my first book by her, \\"Welcome to Temptation\\", probably one of the best novels I've ever read. Since then, I'm working on her backlist, which is how I came across this story. This looks to be an early work of hers, and I can see her growth as a writer. As for a recommendation, if you're a Crusie fan, I'd recommend trying this one. If you've never read her work, start with \\"Welcome to Temptation\\", instead of this one."},{"Title":"Getting Rid Of Bradley (Harlequin Temptation #480)","review":"Despite having seen Jennifer Crusie come up time and again on reviewer's favorite lists, I didn't buy them right away. I think that's because humor is a relative thing, but many times I have read a book that other people have found funny, but I was thinking \\"Where's the humor?\\" I finally gave it a plunge on \\"Getting Rid of Bradley\\" and much to my surprise, this book was really FUNNY! This is a book full of zany people doing zany things, and everywhere they turn, something zany happens to them. They are funny, but they are likable too. It's hard not to feel sorry for our heroine - while some of us could have an unlucky day, there's nothing like having an unlucky LIFE to make you feel really, really, really down in the dumps! I loved the people, I loved the dialogue, I loved the hero/heroine, I just thought they were sweet.The book starts off with our heroine deciding that she's finally finished letting everyone else tell her what to do, and now that her divorce is final, she'll tell her busy body sister that she's now in charge of her own destiny. Right away we are getting a bad feeling, and yes, as they say in Murphy-land, everything that could go wrong promtly goes wrong. What we end up with is an hilarious tale of cops and robbers, and what the reader gets out of this is three hours of laughs, plus a really happy ending (did you ever see a guy fall in love with a woman with green hair? Not grass green, but slime green? When that happens, you know it's for keeps.)It's funny, but the style of this book reminds me a bit of Rex Stout's Archie Goodwin. (This is an older book, for those who don't know him). But unlike Rex Stout, the plot of the murder mystery is really hardly anything to write home about. Especially the Bradly part - I kept waiting for some tie-in as why they are both Bradley - but it never happened. It seems that it was just a coincidence - that's just a little bit too coincidental, even for a book that's not based in too strongly in reality.This book is definitely recommended to anyone who like to laugh."},{"Title":"Getting Rid Of Bradley (Harlequin Temptation #480)","review":"After reading and loving Jennifer Crusie'sBet MeI quickly downloaded a few more of her titles. I was looking forward to more light, quirky and amusing fun. I should've been a little more specific.Lucy Savage just got divorced. Her newly ex-husband didn't even bother showing up for the final signing. Her controlling, though well-intentioned, sister is ready to remove body parts off the man, but Lucy is feeling more confused than heartbroken. She wants answers for why her husband was making time with a blonde bimbo in their house. Over lunch, she tries to explain to her sister that she's okay but ready to take control over her own life...as soon as she gets answers from Bradley for why he did what he did.Across the restaurant, two cops working on an embezzlement case overhear Lucy talking about Bradley and officer Zack Warren realizes that the tip he and his partner got to show up at this dive to nab Bradley the embezzler just went live. He confronts Lucy as she's leaving the restaurant...and then bullets are flying and he's getting beat up by the woman who's life he just saved.Lucy feels nothing but empowered as she realizes she's successfully defended herself against a mugging and takes off after the police show up to grab the wretched scruffy guy in leather who put his hands on her. She feels so empowered, in fact, she decides to die her hair. Blonde was a mistake, so she tries for brunette. Just as she's realizing that the attempted dye job left her hair dead and...well...green...the doorbell rings and the thug she'd beat up is standing there...with his policeman's shield in hand. Oops.Today Lucy got divorced, shot at, manhandled, dyed her hair green, and beat up a cop. She isn't having a good day.What started out as a sort of loony but amusing premise was quickly strained by an anorexic plot that pushed beyond the boundaries of plausibility or credulity and by characters that lacked more than superficial development. Zack is the Peter Pan who equates committed relationships with death and Lucy is the pushover who is so intent on remaking herself she's willfully blind to common sense.Though I prefer more three dimensional characters and found Zack's abrupt about-face on relationships as soon as he spends time with Lucy a bit hard to swallow, I honestly liked him. He's pretty uncomplicated and generally a nice guy - and any male who still wants a woman with ugly green hair is worth something. His character and his reaction to things is where all the humor in this book lays for me. I didn't find him believable, and he's pretty two dimensional, but I did generally enjoy him.What really turned me off this book was Lucy. I found her character to be so irredeemable - between her lack of common sense and worse, lack of intelligence, her absurdly obtuse reactions even after things started blowing up, and her apparent lack of self preservation, I couldn't figure out for the life of me how Zack could even tolerate her, let alone love her. I actually found her distasteful as a character and difficult to read when paired with Zack.Unfortunately, for a book like this to work for me, I have to like both leads - like I did Min and Cal in Bet Me. I so disliked Lucy that what would have been a silly and unrealistic but entertaining light romantic comedy, Getting Rid of Bradley, was ruined for me. 1.5 Stars.Originally reviewed for One Good Book Deserves Another."},{"Title":"Getting Rid Of Bradley (Harlequin Temptation #480)","review":"Lucy Savage and Zack Warren are the main characters.Einstein (sheepdog), Heisenberg (\\"walking mop\\"), and Maxwell (mutt) are Lucy's dogs. Wonderful characters, as only Ms. Crusie writes!Lucy meets Zack when he mugs her after she lusts after him (a little bit) in a diner she and her sister (Tina) go to after Lucy's divorce from Bradley is finalized. Lucy beats Zack up with her purse filled with physics books for the high school science classes that she teaches, and gets away from him. She runs into the police, sends them after Zack, and goes home.Zack isn't a mugger...he's a Detective in Property Crimes with the local police department. He tried to question Lucy about Bradley, as he is wanted for stealing a million dollars in bonds from the bank he worked for.Zack and Lucy are immediately attracted to one another. Lucy is upset scandalized because she just got divorced. Zack is terrified because he doesn't want to die (which he equates responsibility and commitment with, and as precursors to). Zack knows that Lucy isn't a \\"good-time\\" girl, but one that you marry. Lucy knows that Zack is wonderful...but scared.The secondary characters (Anthony, Zack's partner; Tina, Lucy's sister; Phoebe, the neighbor's psychopathic cat; and Pete, the new dog) add solid layers to the storyline.I laughed aloud many times while reading this story. However, the BEST laugh came from the following scene:\\"'...All the time,' the patrolman said. \`I'll just have to call this in, sir...' he began, looking at Zack's ID, and then he, too, screamed.\`Shoot the cat,' Zack said. \`It's assaulted two officers and resisted arrest. Do it.\\"In response to Phoebe's first attack on Zack. (Spoiler: Phoebe doesn't get shot...and lives to maim many another day.)As with almost all of Ms. Crusie's books (the only ones I didn't LOVE were the two with Bob Mayer - \\"Don't Look Down\\" and \\"Agnes and the Hitman;\\" \\"Tell Me Lies,\\" \\"Strange Bedpersons,\\" and the short novella in \\"Santa Baby\\" (the latter, only because it was too short to do justice to a Crusie work); and the only one I couldn't even read \\"Manhunting\\"), the story was incredible, I have read, re-read, and will continue to re-read until the end of time."},{"Title":"Getting Rid Of Bradley (Harlequin Temptation #480)","review":"Is what this book should really be called. Overall, this book is fast paced and a fun read. The hero, Zach, is definitely worth the read but what spoiled the book for me was that Lucy was a complete ditz. For a woman who is a physics teacher and lives by logic and reason, she certainly lacked common sense. Every time Zach called her a &quot;dummy,&quot; I found myself nodding in agreement.If you don't mind a clueless heroine in an otherwise entertaining story, than read this book. It will take all of a day and you do get some laughs out of it. But if those types of heroines frustrate you, then skip this book and read &quot;Manhunting,&quot; which is a far superior book that Crusie wrote in her early years."},{"Title":"Getting Rid Of Bradley (Harlequin Temptation #480)","review":"I picked up this book because it looked funny and cute, and was happy to see it was well written. As I read it became clear that the author, who obviously likes dogs, is a real cat hater. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I don't have to pay good money to read a book where people hurt them. In the beginning of the book, the neighbor's cat is nearly killed by a bomb explosion, and the hero and heroine react as if it's too bad the cat wasn't killed. Later in the book it says that the cat attacked Zack's (the hero's) leg while it was trapped in their basement,and \\"he smacked her away with his fist, provoking a scream that could have peeled paint\\" (actual quote from the book!). A few pages later, he says,\\"I want to spend the rest of my days plotting with the dogs to kill that damn cat next door\\". If the cat hadn't triggered the explosion at the beginning of the book, the heroine, Lucy, would be dead. They should be spending the rest of the book feeding that cat fresh tuna!I know it's not a big deal to some people, but it is to me. I have several cats, whose gentleness and love brings happiness to my life. And people who think that dogs are the only good pets should remember how many children are mauled and killed every year by dogs, not cats.I will be telling all the people I know to avoid this book, and will never read another of Ms. Crusie's again."},{"Title":"Getting Rid Of Bradley (Harlequin Temptation #480)","review":"I like Jennifer Cruisie books, which are rather more intelligent romantic fiction than most of the alternatives available right now. This book is a charming example of what she can do best, which is create believable characters while avoiding stereotype and putting them in believable and authentic situations that somehow retain a sense of humor and sense of the absurd.It is an accomplishment most modern romantic fiction writers somehow avoid, to their eternal detriment.In this particular missive, Cruisie chronicles a take on the time-honored mistaken-identity plot, in which our hapless heroine, recently divorced and swearing off all but the most irrelevantly physical of relationships, gets intertwined with the the town's police officer who's investigating her former husband on charges of embezzlement. Of course, the two have a disproportionate attraction to each other, which interferes with the task at hand. Of course, there are myriad opportunities for confusion and conflict. Of course, this being a Cruisie novel, there is a dog (or, in this case, three dogs, including Heisenburg, the moppish dog who has coined his own joke).This is a great example of escapist modern literature. While Cruisie might not be Shakespeare or Homer, she aims for another chord altogether... it's a worthwhile, fun, intelligently wrought chord. Try it!"},{"Title":"Getting Rid Of Bradley (Harlequin Temptation #480)","review":"Lucy Savage was not having a good day. Her husband, whom she was trying to divorce for cheating on her, didn't even do her the courtesy of showing up at the courthouse where their marriage was dissolved. Her brassy blonde hair, which she had just had done, looked terrible and her sister was nagging at her to take more risks again. More risks?! Didn't she realize that every time she took a risk it ended in disaster? Still, the day wasn't a total wash, there was a pretty cute guy in the diner where she had lunch with her sister. Well, she thought he was pretty cute until he tried to mug her in the alley. Then he had the gall to claim to be a police officer trying to save her life after someone took a shot at her!Detective Zack Warren has never seen anyone as in need of protection as Lucy Savage, but he definitely doesn't want to be the guy trying to do the protecting. All he wants is for Lucy to lead him to her ex-husband Bradley whom they suspect of stealing several thousand dollars from the bank he worked at. Only problem is Lucy told Bradley she never wanted to speak with him again and hasn't seen or heard from him since. Still, Zack has a hunch that Lucy is key to breaking the case so he moves in with her and her two nutty dogs to provide 24 hour protection. Next thing she knows, Lucy has accidentally turned her hair green, adopted another dog off the street and fallen head over heels in love with Zack! But she knows that Zack isn't serious when he says that he loves her and wants to marry her, after all, he is way too big of a risk for her to take...Getting Rid of Bradley is a fun, fast read that I enjoyed, but it is nothing special or spectacular. This is a bit disappointing as Jennifer Crusie's books are usually pretty memorable - for her zany characters if nothing else. Lucy is a fun character, but a little too bubble brained for me, teacher or no. She was a little too quirky for me to identify with and I was not sure why Zack, a seemingly normal guy would fall for someone like her, but they say opposites attract, right? The plot is a little thin and it is pretty easy to figure out &quot;the mystery&quot;, but this is a good summer beach book or something to read when you don't want to concentrate too hard."},{"Title":"Getting Rid Of Bradley (Harlequin Temptation #480)","review":"The first book I read by Crusie was 'Welcome to Temptation', and I have been hooked since! 'Getting Rid of Bradley' is a feel-good book that will keep you smiling and laughing till the end. Unlike some romances that have their boring parts, Crusie livens the plot with mystery + sexy cop Zack. I absolutley loved this book + it is a great read."},{"Title":"Getting Rid Of Bradley (Harlequin Temptation #480)","review":"What fire-cracker humour! What rapier wits and zany zest! When you pick up a Jennifer Crusie book, you know it's a laugh-till-you-drop affair and in a succinct yet marvellous short narration of around 245 pages - Crusie puts her deadpanned humour to such hilarious effects on a tale of love and sabotage. Not since MANHUNTING has Crusie ever been so sharp-witted with fast quips and meticulous observations, and her characters Lucy Savage Porter and Zack Warren is one hell of a firebrand couple.Lucy Porter just had a bad week - what with all the bad hair day that made a green moss out of her mane (which would probably attract male Tolkien fanatics, as her sister Tina puts it), getting a divorce from her mundane husband Bradley after seeing him cosy up with a blonde, plus an irritating embezzling investigator Zack trailing her - she turns feral and savage (ironically her middle name) to get a grip on her life. It never rains but pours - Lucy becomes entangled when Bradley is a suspect of an embezzling case. She laughs. Even the insipid Bradley is playing a joke on her - life isn't what it seems.Things get funnier and hysterically comedic when Zack comes in to protect her from a vicious sabotage. He believes maturity is death and is a cynic at romance, but Lucy with her antics and three cute dogs changes his perception. He yearns a more domestic life, picking up cooking and ripping floorboards and even picks up stray dogs. Lucy's ex-lovelife is based on a thermonuclear equation and she is going to be sterile of it - go illogical. Can their romance last? But before they can get until there, the sabotage intensifies to a potential life-threatening situation....GETTING RID OF BRADLEY proves Ms. Crusie's mastery at weaving a tight smalltown mystery with keen observations on woman's psyche in change and love. It brims with dry sardonic wits and humour and charms with a big heart. Lucy is sympathetic and endearing; Zack is a passionate guy. It is a boost to our faith in love and fun. This book is needed as a reliving panacea for anyone who is on to getting rid of (depression or husbands) badly."},{"Title":"Getting Rid Of Bradley (Harlequin Temptation #480)","review":"There was something missing in this book and I believe it was the lack reality. I thought it was very funny but it was too unrealistic. I mean come on- a woman meets the man of her dreams the same day she is going to court to get a divorce- which yes that by itself could happen- but then the dream man happens to be severly commitment-phobic (he equates commitment to marriage and marriage to death) but after living with her for a few days he falls in love and asks her to marry him and obssesses over the idea of marrying her (oh yeah and it just so happens that he moves into her house the day after they meet because he is protecting her from a psycho ex-husband). It was cute and all but as I was reading it just got more and more unbelievable. When I'm reading a book I like to believe that the story could potentially happen in real life. This story is too far fetched. The whole book (newly divorced girl meets commitment phobic boy, move in together, fall in love, and decide to get married) happens in less than two weeks! It is funny though with all the dogs and the dialouge. so it's an easy funny read but it doesn't leave a warm fuzzy feeling behind because it's based in la-la land."},{"Title":"Getting Rid Of Bradley (Harlequin Temptation #480)","review":"I will admit to being a bit overwhelmed in the beginning since it jumped in with all these characters and all this action, but it did not take me long to settle down comfortably in the plot. I adored how Crusie allows the reader a certain amount of imagination when it comes to the lustier moments. The characters had a wonderful blend of humor, intelligence, and chemistry. Also, the plot was interesting and had a few twists and turns, but nothing that seemed outlandishly implausible."},{"Title":"Getting Rid Of Bradley (Harlequin Temptation #480)","review":"This book was a fabulous read. A funny, down-to-earth, modern-day romance,&quot;Getting Rid Of Bradley&quot; is a book I'd recommend to any romance-lover. Jennifer Crusie has a wonderful way of telling stories.

This is a great book to indulge yourself with. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Getting Rid Of Bradley (Harlequin Temptation #480)","review":"What a fun book!

Though the characters were a bit unbelievable and there were a few aspects of the story that seemed a stretch, the overall plot was pretty straightforward, and she even included enough clues that you could, at times, be \\"ahead of\\" the characters.

While I'm a fan of the romance genre, this is my first foray into the \\"romantic comedy\\" type book. I have to say, this book was amazing! The characters had a wonderful blend of humor, intelligence, and chemistry. Both Nick and Lucy have this great blend of strength (often that they're not aware of in themselves, but which the other character sees in them) and sensitivity. Plus, I really enjoyed the animal loving aspect to both characters-- it made them seem like people I'd want to know, or might know in real life! (Who among us can't relate to the tug of your heartstrings when you see a stray dog or cat?)Also, the plot was interesting and had a few twists and turns, but nothing that seemed outlandishly implausible. All in all, I'd highly recommend this book and plan to try to read anything Ms. Crusie puts out!"},{"Title":"Getting Rid Of Bradley (Harlequin Temptation #480)","review":"This is a book written by Jennifer Crusie before her blockbuster best-sellers. It's shorter than her recent books (written to that short, digestable romance format), so the characters aren't as well developed as you'll find in &quot;Tell Me Lies&quot;, &quot;Crazy for You&quot;, &quot;Welcome to Tempation&quot;, &quot;Fast Women&quot;. But Crusie is such a solid writer (and was back then, too) she rises above the limiting format and delivers a solid, fast-paced, enjoyable tale. She has a gift for humor and believable, but witty, dialog. You do come to care for the characters. I'd recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Getting Rid Of Bradley (Harlequin Temptation #480)","review":"This book was a fun, quick read. Personally, I prefer characters to have a little more edge. I did enjoy this book for a quick read."},{"Title":"Getting Rid Of Bradley (Harlequin Temptation #480)","review":"Even though the story is dated, (police officers typing on a typewriter) the characters were delightful, the sex scenes steamy enough, it was worth reading."},{"Title":"Getting Rid Of Bradley (Harlequin Temptation #480)","review":"This is definitely one of her better reads. It has a hint of mystery to it, and not to much of her love making writing...."},{"Title":"Getting Rid Of Bradley (Harlequin Temptation #480)","review":"Each of Ms Crusie' s books that I have read have been simply delightful. Her sense of humour is fresh and her characters are interesting. OK, so this isn't War and Peace. What it is is a perfect way to work away a few hours with a story that allows you to relax, unwind and laugh. These days, that is, in my estimation a true gift."},{"Title":"Getting Rid Of Bradley (Harlequin Temptation #480)","review":"The story line is the typical Crusie formula but plot was weak and felt rushed. Characters fall for each other almost immediately and without reason so the tension between them is lacking in comparison to her other books."},{"Title":"Getting Rid Of Bradley (Harlequin Temptation #480)","review":"I love Jennifer Crusie books, and I think this may be my favorite. The book was delivered in perfect condition and in a timely manner."},{"Title":"Getting Rid Of Bradley (Harlequin Temptation #480)","review":"I've read a number of Crusie books, and the first few were enjoyable enough fluff, but then they all started to blend together. This was no differetn The stories and characters are WAY too similar book to book, right down to the physical descriptions and situations they find themselves in, the secondary characters, the settings, and even the way it all ends up.Also, I listened to this on audio book, and for the life of me can't figure out why the narrator assigned Lucy's sister a Staten Island-ish accent. If they're sisters who grew up together, why would one have that accent and the other not? It was so stupid it was distracting!"},{"Title":"A Century of Spells","review":"This is a great book...It's filled with a hundred spells from various cultures, religions and traditions that work independent of any specific culture, religion or tradition. What's wonderful about it, is that Draja focuses on making magick PRACTICAL. How refreshing! A lot of the spells are simple to perform and require items that are easily available to most people. There are a few spells that i find to be rather peculiar or overly time-consuming, but they're an interesting read at the least. He provides practical spells for most of the situations that people encounter in their daily lives...money, health, jobs, luck, relationships, etc. He does have a slight paternal tone in telling people not to alter the spells, but i take that to simply be a guardrail for the novice magick user. It's a great little sourcebook for spells and as inspiration to help you create your own. Definately a &quot;must-have&quot; for me! =))"},{"Title":"A Century of Spells","review":"Draja Mickaharic's books A Century of Spells, and Spiritual Cleansings have been in my library since the 80's, and although many magical books, and spell books have been bought afterwards, I always seam to go back to Draja. A Century of Spells dabbles and mixes well Southern Hoodoo, Santeria, Christian Magic, and Caribbean Magic. This book is filled with wise wisdom on how to create excellent and powerful ritual incense such as High Spirit Incense, Meditation Incense, and House blessing Incense, it also gives you good instructions on how to fumigate, \\"smudge\\" with incense. The Herb section is just a quick basic intro to herbalism, and some of the herbs used in Hoodoo Magic such as Solomon's Seal, Snakeroot, and Poke root to name a few.There are spells using loadstones, how to create Four Thieves Vinegar. Methods for Spiritual Bath., oils, water sprinkles, spoken spells, and written spells are also discussed. If you are an opened minded person, because the book has spells using Jesus Christ, the Archangels, The Seven African Powers \\"Orishas\\", and Allah, then this little handy book belongs in your library."},{"Title":"A Century of Spells","review":"When I bough this book I thought this would be just another bogus book.

It's always the first volume I grab when in need and I've had some great results."},{"Title":"A Century of Spells","review":"An excellent little collection of spells. Not wicca or CM, so if you're looking for those you might be more pleased with some other selection. But it's good solid folk magic, largely of a mixed African and European flavor.I wouldn't say the book is indispensable for the advanced or intermediate practitioner. It's largely addressed at the beginner. But it's a pleasant read, well organised, and contains more useful practical spells than most books on the market these days.I definitely class it as a good value, especially at the price."},{"Title":"A Century of Spells","review":"I liked this bok very much. I have an older printing with a different cover so Im not sure if the new edition is any different. I really enjoy the author's style in writing and his material seems well researched. This is NOT a wiccan book, this is based more on a mystical catholic style and contains wisdom from african and african based tradtitons. There are a lot of spell books on the market, this is one of the few good ones."},{"Title":"A Century of Spells","review":"I was very happy to find this book. When i first came across it, a friend of mine showed it to me. Later on I decided to purchase a copy and it's been a staple of my spirituality ever since. This book is filled with folk wisdom, simples, recipes, and more. If you are looking for a non-wiccan spell book then this is for you."},{"Title":"A Century of Spells","review":"I really wish I had come across all of the books by this author several years ago. Then Amazon wouldn't quite have as much of my money as they do!There is a clarity and a delightful lack of the condescension that one so often finds in many authors writing in this genre today. His writing style is fluid and the instructions and cautions are presented in a simple and clearly stated manner.I have 6 of his books now and, I've just discovered a couple titles that I don't have already so Amazon will be getting some more money."},{"Title":"A Century of Spells","review":"Nicely written and easy to understand, I found this book a good reference search for magical works. Most of the ingredients are quite easy to find except one had me scouring the local hardware stores for almost 8 months before I could find the stuff. But in the end, all's well that ends well. I like the author's work and I feel she has set a certain style when it comes to appealing to general needs and senses. Even the title of this book is very enticing. Who can possibly ignore such a treasured find? Imagine..a century of secrets tuck between the pages for a small price. Well, as for whether the spells work, I cannot really say cos I did perform some protection spell and I know nothing is 100% full proof. But again, perhaps it did in its own mysterious ways; although for real dramatics,&quot; The Truth About Witchcraft Today&quot; by the late Scott Cunningham did grab my total awe for immediate results."},{"Title":"A Century of Spells","review":"The bad: The book begins with a number of moral caveats that I find unnecessary and a waste of space, since those who most need such warnings will undoubtedly ignore them. A fair number of the spells included will be valueless to most modern practitioners, one example being a spell to protect against gypsies. Another is a method for creating a wand that takes (literally) years and would be simply impossible to complete even for most people living in rural areas. Some other spells seem to leave out necessary information. The author was much in need of a good editor to remove some useless material and make some directions more complete. There's a good bit of material that more properly (in my opinion) belongs in the category of folk medicine. The overall length of the book is less than 140 pages, so unnecessary inclusions bring the useful sections of the book down to a minimum.The good: The information about incenses and oils is very worthwhile. The overall scope is broad and will appeal to those whose practice is eclectic and who don't mind borrowing from various folk magic traditions. I particularly appreciated the references to the Pennsylvania Dutch traditions of pow-wow.I recommend the book to those whose libraries are fairly extensive. If you have only a small shelf of books on this subject, I wouldn't suggest this as one of them in spite of my respect for the author."},{"Title":"A Century of Spells","review":"Draja Mickaharic's \\"A Century of Spells\\" (along with all of his other books) are one of the few natural magick spellbooks out there that can actually be called a spellbook. Draja doesn't spoon feed you or dumb his writing style down for the average 13-year old. He begins by recommending preliminary books, and gives you an important daily relaxation exercise that will help you train to do properly and effectively perform magick. You can tell just by reading the introduction that this book has been written by a true master, who certainly doesnt take any of the BS and nonsense so common nowadays in mainstream books (*cough* *cough* Llewellyn) that make it seem as though you can perform miracles with out any training. As for the spells, well, actually, there are some spells and formulas here that I've never heard of anywhere before. This book contains a little bit of everything from everywhere. So before you go ahead and dive into the \\"New Age\\" section of your local Barnes & Nobles/Borders, buy this book along with all of Draja Mickaharic's other books and get some sense before attempting anything stupid. Highly recommended book."},{"Title":"A Century of Spells","review":"Excellent Resource and Reference Guide.

This book is full of interesting spells like reversing spells, protection spells,and even making baths. I would reccomend this book to anyone who intersted in this kind of magick."},{"Title":"A Century of Spells","review":"I have a vast collection of books on magick, spells and witchcraft - some good, some not so - but this one is my bible! It's always the first volume I grab when in need and I've had some great results."},{"Title":"A Century of Spells","review":"The book begins with caveats that were common in books related to magic and alchemy written over the past several centuries and personally I highly appreciate them. After all the author does bear the responsibility for sharing the information and mentioning those caveats absolves the author if someone chooses to misuse the information. It also helps to remind those who are still listening to their conscience, but may have become temporarily blinded or become deaf to it due to some hurt. In my experience, I have discovered that people do help each other to live higher lives by reminding each other of better ways, by reminding each other that they can solve their problems by blessing, rather than cursing. We live in a world where we are subject to all kinds of temptations, and even those who are truly committed to living a spiritual life, may find themselves slipping and considering things they never thought they would do before, and at such times we can indeed help each other to make healthier choices in life.This book begins with a simple protection spell, or if you will a simple and effective affirmation for spiritual protection:\\"The Lord surrounds me with light, love and protection. I am safe within this sphere of love from all which may seek to harm me.\\"When working with spells, magic, prayers, hypnosis or whatever name you may give to mind power, what makes it work is subjectively experiencing the reality of that which you would like to manifest in your outer world.The book then has a chapter with simple reversing spells using different elements (water, fire, earth, air, and even iron). The purpose of these spells is to break the influence of the person who may have cast a spell to influence you in some way.Then there are water spells, which consist primarily of having spiritual baths. And if you have had any interest in esoteric studies, you may be already familiar with bath consisting of epsom salts and sodium bicarbonate (baking powder), which is effective for cleaning and rebalancing your energy field. While sitting in this bath, use appropriate visualizations, affirmations chants, prayers and/or psalms (e.g. psalms 23 and 51).You will then find different simple incense recipes for general use (a popular resin incense for general use is made out of frankincense, myrrh and benzoin in this book called \\"High Spirit incense\\" - which you can mix yourself, or buy it as Three Kings incense), and there are other recipes for specific purposes such as for protection, meditation, concentration, abundance, etc.Then there is a section on making herbal oils - one of the popular ones is Holy Anointing Oil (elswehre called also \\"Abramelin Oil\\" which is made by mixing cinnamon, cassia (a variety of cinnamon), myrrh and calamus with olive oil, as well as instructions for making blessing and magnet oils.A number of herbs are listed with their magical use, so you can create other oils for your purposes.You then learn how to put together charm bags, also called \\"wanga\\", or \\"mojo bags\\", or \\"hands\\" in different traditions of African origin, like Hoodoo rootwork.Provided are variety of chants (spells) mostly of Christian origin, though there are few Islamic chants (surah) from Kur'an, and even a chant to Seven African Powers. Few chants / spells are from the book Long Lost Friend, used by Hexenmeisters.You will also find few written spells and loadstone spells.While each section has very few spells or herbs, if you are mainly interested in your spiritual growth, these will be sufficient for cleansing, protection, meditation and helping you to deepen your spiritual awareness and deal more comfortably with daily challenges. Also the book may appeal more to people who enjoy working with Hoodoo, rather than to those that are looking for books related to Wicca or ceremonial magic. Personally I love this book, and all other books written by Draja Mickaharic and am grateful that he has written them. They are all small and rather simple, but I consider them all very useful."},{"Title":"A Century of Spells","review":"very good book. This book deals with spiruality and goes to the Christian aspect of magic. It is all very good reading and I haven't tried any spells yet but it is very interesting how Draja wrote this book. I highly recomend book to any one intressed in magic and it is good for reference it looks like."},{"Title":"A Century of Spells","review":"I enjoyed this book even more than the first one--Spiritual Cleansing--andfound the use of common herbs for magic fascinating and fun...but the mainpoint is that the spells work--who knows why--because they focus one's thoughtsand energy--because they focus energy that is collected and available in theuniverse--or simply because magic has been around for thousands of years and plantshave a cooperative energy when a human breathes a desired result into theiralready-willing-life-force? No matter 'Why,' the 'Whats' are all here and theauthor actually knows what he is talking about.This book is my favorite of Mickaharic's and if I had to take one book on magic withme if I moved to a new city this would be the one. If you are looking for darkmagic you need to keep looking, but if you want one of the simplest, most complete,little reference books on spells for protection, healing, cleansing and attractingpositive energy in love and money this is certainly worth reading over and overuntil you own the information. Master every spell in this book and your life willindeed be more harmonious!"},{"Title":"A Century of Spells","review":"An interesting compendium of over a hundred simple to use spell. Draja Mickaharic was born in Bosnia and ended up immigrating to America back in 1939. It seems that he has picked up his spell for a variety of sources. Some sources are books while other seem to be from his travel. Most of the magical practices are not from any organized form of Witchcraft but seem to be folk remedies used by the common folk. THe author seems to have a good sound knowledge of how to make incenses,oils and baths. Most of what is collected in here in my book is not spells per se but rather simple remedies for problems.The author at the outset of the book cautions the reader not to use black magic. What is black magic? Black Magic is the use of magic to influence or control somebody else's will. It is bad and it has bad karmic consequences. Our main purpose for living is to serve the divine and praise the divine. Whatever helps us towards that end should be encourage and what ever takes away from that end should be thrown away.The author recommends a daily regimen of prayer as a way as a way of spiritually purifying yourself. He advises to keep our center and warns that we are under constant spiritual influence from outside forces both overtly and covertly.I give the book an over all four. There are many useful things in this book andd there are no complicated rituals. He has a good knowledge of herbs and how to make incenses and oils. He has reversal spells,protection spells, spoken and written spells and spells using herbs, incenses and oils. This is real good for someone who likes working with herbs."},{"Title":"A Century of Spells","review":"This is a must have by any spiritual worker. It covers cleansing by means of water, herbs, incense and fire. Each area is explained as to the purpose and method of how it should be done. Draja also explains what can be done to attract love, money, and spiritual development by means of baths, incense burning among other practices. Even if you are a beginning this a good introductory guide."},{"Title":"A Century of Spells","review":"As always, Draja's work is comprehensive and thorough. In this book Draja doesn't so much supply spells as he supplies information about types of spells with some examples. What I found useful about this book is that it serves as a ready made reference guide that a person can draw on if s/he wants to use types of spells. This is a good book to have. It's not Draja's best, but its useful for whatever circumstances the magician might need."},{"Title":"Curing the Cross-Eyed Mule","review":"My father got this book as a gift from my grandmother for his birthday.

I recommend this book to anyone, especially as bedside material, or as bathroom reading material.

I would say it's better for people to read BEFORE deciding whether to buy a Great Dane to prepare and make sure you're up for all that's involved, but as far as a complete book for a Great Dane owner, I would recommend getting a book that has more specifics on the various topics rather than just an overview.

Taryn has just lost her grandmother, and is suffering heart break because of the lost. Mean while teenagers are getting snatched by some unknown source, and going out at night for teens is getting riskier. There are people from the world, Neworld, whose job is to protect the teens from earth, Oldworld. Erick is one of those people. One night, when Erick is out trying to stop the kidnappings, he comes across Taryn. Erick is dispatched far away from Taryn, and her rescue seems impossible. When the Zumarian warrior, working for the bad guy, comes to take Taryn he grabs her. Whenever a Zummarian warrior grabs a person of the Oldworld they immediatly freeze, but Tary doesn't freeze when grabbed, Taryn fights back. Erick, who witnesses this, knows there is something different with Taryn, and goes to meet her. Erick and Taryn build a relationship over time, but one night Taryn is taken, and Erick decides it is time to attack the bad guy. Taryn is confronted with the bad guy and learns that he is her father. Taryn is presented with a choice that will decide the future for everyone. Taryn is left with the choice to choose love or power, and whichever way she chooses she betrays someone.This book is about choosing. Throughout the book the characters are met with choices. Taryn faces the choice between love and power, while Erick faces the choice between following the rules and following the heart. The choices the characters choose are pretty alike, but one does the right thing while the other does the thing that goes against what is considered right. I thought the book was interesting because it showed how heavily the choices weighed upon each character. It showed how the characters ended up at least trying to do the right thing, but how their choice always seemed to out weigh the other choice. The characters were interesting together because one character knew what was going on while the other was learning. The characters were also interesting because they were different. One of the characters was a warrior, in perfect health, while the other was more of a thinker, who had to fight hearing loss and was battling a disease. Their differences extended deeper than that since one of the characters was born into a good family while the other was born into an evil family.The story itself was pretty good. The author did a very good job in describing the scenes in detail, and the thought processes that the author wrote for the characters were also detailed, and because of that the reader could get more of an insight into who the characters were. This book was a good book that could hold the readers interest easily and had main characters that you could easily like and antagonists that you hated but pitied.Reviewed by a student reviewer for Flamingnet Book Reviewswww.flamingnet.comPreteen, teen, adn young adult book reviews and recommendations"},{"Title":"Sign of the Crescent","review":"Sign of the Crescent is a book my grandmother gave me years ago. Admittedly, when I read it back then, it confused me and I could not quite understand what was going on.Fast-forward to the present day.Now that my mind can comprehend the words, I have read the book multiple times and enjoy it thoroughly. The book follows interesting characters in an intriguing plot that mixes new with old, and powerful with the weak. As you progress through the book, you learn more about what happened as rules are broken and secrets unveiled.Readers will be drawn into the story and left with the urge to keep reader - to visualize more of what happens after the final climax.This Fantasy novel takes what could have been a clich&eacute; and turns it into something more. Debbie Federici did well to keep readers interested and make things understandable, despite there being a fairly large cast later in the novel.My only problem with the book was that at times, the pace slowed to a crawl. At those times, it was only the intrigue that kept me going - the need to know what would happen and how things would end.Even with the issue in pacing at times, this is a book I gladly recommend to anyone interested in a good fantasy story that takes a new approach on the already known.Pick it up if you have the chance. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Sign of the Crescent","review":"this book was pretty good. it's about this girl who gets cought up in whole other world that includes a weak dark sorcerer, her \\"heart's mate\\", and Haro knights. i suggest you read it."},{"Title":"Sign of the Crescent","review":"Mature adult here, didn't even realize when I grabbed this book that it was meant for teens...

I do recommend this to anyone who enjoys fantasy stories. A bit more simplistic (but not overly so) than many of the fantasy novels out there, but sometimes that's refreshing when your brain is tired.

Merritt uses them effectively to put us into his time and environment."},{"Title":"Where the Rivers Ran Backward","review":"I was in country two years. Bill Merritts book has refreshed my memories of the Cu Chi and Phu Cuong periods. I was on the bridge with Bill Merritt just minutes before it blew. We played chess, I walked away, it was a full moon, what could happen? Boom, right behind me it went up. He remembered the names of our Chinese/Vietnamese soldier friend-\\"Ha\\"-and our housegirl \\"Loi\\". I have many pictures of them both. Ha was the best RVN soldier I ever met, and I met quite a few.Bill's memory of dialogue and events is astounding,very entertaining, but sometimes doesn't fit with my own. I believe I am one of the characters in his book. Check out the photo in my profile. I loved the book and have to give Bill his propers, even though the memories of all that subsequently happened are not good. Many of my fellow countrymen/soldiers were hurt that night, killed or injured, and many in the months to follow.I had to argue constantly about getting resupplied with enough ammo and safe explosives to throw into the river. I refused to use the pound blocks of tnt or c4 w/det cord or to have my men use them. The poor GIs who had to light fuses inserted into pound blocks of tnt suffered the most as they did not know if the cigarette/lighter they would use to light the fuse actually lit the fuse as it did not sputter or flash like the ones in the movies. Consequently I saw many soldiers blow their hands&arms; off or get blown into the barb wire protecting the columns holding up the bridge. There they would hang like a bug in a spider web of razor bladed concertina, screaming their hearts out. It was impossible to pull them out, as we needed boats and wire cutters to get to them. I was finally allowed access to chopper resupplies of hand grenades & ammo when I asked my platoon commander to come to the bridge to argue with the first sargent who refused to resupply us with ammo. He put that first sgt in his place, and I enjoyed seeing \\"Top\\" eat his words, back down, and leave me the hell alone. He wasn't so outspoken when my 1st lt. got through with him. Thanks, Lt. Yamaguchi! A man willing to call a gook a gook.When the choppers would come in with nets full of ammo, c-rats, sundry boxes, I did not care about anything except getting resupplied with 50 cal ammo, 7.62 belts for my M-60, and multiple rounds for my grenade launcher, flares, HE and shot gun rounds, and, of course, my favorite, cases of grenades, so many, they would fill the jeep and cover the front hood, and unable to see over the cases of grenades, I would drive back to the bunker hanging out the driver's side and my buddy holding the grenades and ammo, keeping the cases and belts and boxes of ammo from sliding off the hood of the jeep.I would personally blow 6 cases of grenades. We would have contests to see how far we could throw them before they exploded, or throw them so high they would air burst out over the water and wake soldiers who though on guard duty might be sleeping or sometimes holding 10-12 grenades in my arms with all the pins pulled, I would just let them drop into the drink. Ploop, Ploop,ploop ploop.., wait 4 seconds, rumble, (louder, Louder, Louder!) and so on nightly, I won't even describe what it was like to shoot continually at junk floating downriver toward the bridge-just blast it with whatever you're holding, 50 cal, M60, M16, we even had guns from WW2 era, a burp gun which shot 45 cal and had a giant breech which absorbed all the shock from the recoil, but it was a bear to load and the mags weighed a ton compared to the 16, but more accurate up close, no climb to the barrel on full auto.If the infantry guards were dozing in the bunkers on the bridge catwalk, I would drop a little surprise in the water just below the bunkers, making the bridge feel like it was being blown up one more time! The bridge would rock back and forth from the multiple explosions emanating from the deep Saigon river. They would shout and scream some even coming up on the bridge to pound the crap out of me. I had my grenade launcher held like a baseball bat saying \\"c'mon if you want...\\" they would back down warning me they would \\"tell the captain!\\".I never heard a word, and continued with my nightly fourth of July celebrations with multiple forms of explosives into the river listening to AFVN radio out of Saigon, sometimes dancing/bebopping on the bridge to various soul songs like the Dells-\\"There Is\\", \\"Stay in my Corner\\";the Temps-\\"I Wish It Would Rain\\" or \\"25 Miles\\", skipping rope, doing push ups to stay awake on guard all night, thinking how I would be in shape for the Golden Gloves in Lowell, Mass when I got back summer of '70, still so long off though I had been in country 4 months when the bridge was hit, and I had 19 to go;it seemed endless, and the guys most of them coped with alcohol or dope, and it was iteresting to see the cliques emerge-dopers who minded their own business,watching the flares, outgoing artillery missions, 50 cal tracer rounds, and far away jets bombing and strafing, while the boozers were on fire with bottles of rum, vodka, canadian club or johnny walker black mixing it with packaged/presweetened lime KoolAid or coke, sometimes getting frustrated and violent with each other or anyone who looked at them askew. I actually knew one fellow sgt. who pounded on his vehicle with his M-16 that had that huge site profile at the end of the barrel. He just stood there in the road at dusk mad as hell at something pounding on the jeep hood with his rifle seemingly trying to beat a hole in the hood of his jeep, muttering..\\"SofaBitch! I quit, csuckn' bastards..\\" apparently one of his own guys had some complaints about him, embarassing him in front of the platoon. He wanted to pound the guy to pulp, but had to eat the embarassment.I was almost courtmartialed after falling asleep on guard. A major inspecting the lines had to wake me up as my head fell on the horn of the steering wheel of my jeep. I had passed out listening to the rain hit the canvas over my head, thanking God I had shelter from the monsoons, but it was so soothing...It was impossible to sleep during the day due to the construction on the bridge.Where we slept under the bridge was like a thruway with all kinds of civilian, RVN soldiers, GIs roaming through our sleeping area,enginiers repairing the bridge and trying to take over our shrinking space under the bridge. The Vietnames soldiers eating cooked rat with their families was bad enough. They had to go. Plus the choppers and patrol boats would land just over the sandbag walls blowing the area into a fine dust storm. The dust would settle on our sweaty skin creating a scummy film as most of us never wore our uniforms. Then we would try to bathe it away in the river, but the river contained every kind of bacteria in Southeast Asia and we would come down with the worst skin infections one could ever imagine. Things would never heal and we had the Phu Cuong Itch. Some only cleaned up with the \\"Whore's Bath\\" in an empty steel pot. Lucky for me and my guys we could eventually go back to Cu Chi to base camp to get a shower.Getting back to sleeping on guard-because we lived in such a high foot traffic area and the noise of the generator next to my cot the size of a truck with no muffler, it was hard to sleep during the day and we were up all night guarding the bridge and other things. During the rainy season I would sit at the highest point of the bridge in the open jeep with the canvas roof. The sound of the monsoon rain reminding me of fall rains in NH sitting in front of apple wood fires, remembering feelings of home. I did not hear a thing until the major shook me awake to the sound of my jeep horn blaring. I had fallen forward with my head leaning on the horn totally unaware of the noise of the horn. He was mad,threated me with courtmartial but gave me another chance, and I stayed at the bridge for 8 months, being left alone to do my job as various infantry companies rotated through.We guarded two bridges, another further down the road and loaded with mines in the road. Any time we went there we had to be sure it had been checked by mine sweepers, guys walking in front of a tank swinging the apparatus which looked like a metal detector with head phones. As the book mentions we did have that run in with the mine. After being up all night guarding the small bridge and fighting off the rats attracted to the c-ration garbage dumped by the potsmokers (it was good weed) and others, my partner Regdos wanted to return to the big bridge where they served real eggs. I said \\"yeah,after the mine sweepers go by..\\" Finally, I wanted the eggs too and we took off, I was driving the jeep. The dirt roads were covered in oil to keep the dust down but it also made it easier to hide a mine. A coffee can full of c4 plastic explosive would total any vehicle. Alongside this road to Cu Chi on both sides were signs warning of mine fields, dead bodies of civilians who had been traveling on the roads before the sweepers had gone by blown into these fields by the VC. Because of the mines and razor wire the bodies were left where they lay next to scrap Lambretta taxis. On our return to the bridge approximately 6:30 AM I had warned Regdos that we would be flying as I wanted to be going as fast as I could if we hit anything. Out of the morning fog in the middle of this narrow dirt road was a huge tire taking up most of the road. Unable to straddle the tire I hit the brakes and cranked the steering wheel sliding horizontal over the tire without touching it. Did someone up there like me? I looked down from the drivers side, saw an ammo box in the center of the tire with wires leading off into the village at the side of the road. We had slid exactly far enough to turn the wheels back in the direction we were headed and took off. We told the mine sweepers, when they returned, they said it was not there. I shrugged, maybe just another close call.The small bridge, aka Cau Ba Bep, is another story, and another river tributary, alot like \\"Apocalypse Now\\" in its physicality, and the attitude when one is on the river and going up canals...Is it fun or is it battle,probably both. Try going up one of those canals as they get smaller and smaller waiting for the VC to pitch a grenade or RPG fired into us point blank...Sometimes it's a turkey shoot on our part, sometimes \\"the Bar eats you,\\" regards to the Dude.Base Camp commandoes and officers looking to cause a ruckus would come out to inspect our position;I would debate with them why I had two of everything I was issued, you know, one for inspection and one for fighting. Why didn't they understand? C'est la vie, c'est la guerre, l'audace, l'audace, toujours l'audace! Aux Armes! Ride to the sound of the guns! Hey, Bill, you left us too soon.

He is what I would call a poet's poet because of his versatility and technical mastery. His poetry uplifts and entertains us with images of a spiritual and compassionate philosophy. In a poem with funky edges called, \\"Meeting at Erica's Place\\", we are told about a poetry reading. In the poem Mr. Salacan defines the artist: \\"I am passionate. The passionate one. See me. Know me.\\" This has been every poet's cry and lament through the ages - a plea for the individual self to be known and united in oneness with the beloved. In \\"Long Ago,\\" Mr. Salacan speaks for all artists: \\"Once I was sculptor, Searching deep in stone, I found a friend inside there, The best I've ever known.\\" The artist's search to find self-expression and union is ironically answered through his art. In another poem, \\"Chthonian Archetype,\\" stones are equated to words that hauntingly speak of lust, rendering \\"...inconsolable the two black ends of time in their yearning to meet and know the other.\\" In \\"Tanabata,\\" a poem based on the Japanese legend of lovers separated by the Milky Way, we see yearning for union made all the more poignant because of the vastness of the lovers' separation. But while the poet is no stranger to separation, in \\"Ecstasy of Seeing a Flower,\\" he tells us that even in pain and loss there can be an unexpected awakening to beauty. The poet's philosophy here is very near to the Buddhist or Sufi philosophy. The majority of his poems are not abstract at all but are reflections in modulated timbres of saints and sinners and concrete experiences we can all identify with. His great variety of poems celebrate every moment, through conscious living of the moment. He makes each activity of the day, each person he meets, a meditation, of beauty, art and feeling. I love Mr. Salacan's poems. I am awed by them. I have been a poet all my life and I feel redeemed by them."},{"Title":"Woman's Book of Changes","review":"A wonderful way to keep track of everyday thoughts and feelings.

It is this narrow definition that is prone to the boom-bust cycles Galbraith discusses in earlier historical works on the history of modern economics, and is part ofthe current recessional problem.This book is a cry for human-based economics, and would be a good book study or resource for businesses, community organizations, or churches around North America."},{"Title":"The Good Society -","review":"Mr. Galbraith presents a book straight from the party platform of the Democratic left. His \\"good society\\" is a highly regulated, big government welfare state. It favors all the correct things (no discrimination, a right to housing, right to food, right to health care, right to a job, right to subsistence at government expense for not working). About the only current cause it doesn't expound is gay marriage, which wasn't a strong enough issue in the mid 1990s.The book slants the facts, but what book doesn't when expounding an agenda? Mr. Galbraith claims there was no unemployment before the industrial revolution and denies there was poverty in the United States before the 1900s. He acknowledges conservative ideas, but only his own government based ideas really work. In fact, conservatives are presented as desiring economic stagnation and high unemployment to maintain their positions of wealth.While the book pays lip service to the triumph of capitalism over socialism (stating that socialism doesn't work), the ideas of the book are largely a call for a big government welfare state which supervises all aspects of the economy. As an example, he states that private investment is for \\"frivolous consumer goods\\" while government spends for \\"social urgency\\".I'll leave it with one last comment from the end of the book. Mr. Galbraith states that the conservative victory in the elections of 1994 was a mandate of less than 1/4 of the people since less than 1/2 of the voting age population participated. He is certain that if all the people had voted they would have naturally voted in his liberal \\"good society\\"."},{"Title":"The Good Society -","review":"Galbraith's insight on society unfortunately gets lost in a maze of double negatives and confusing sentence structure. His ideas are sound, though he has a very off-putting pompous delivery. In fact, his verbosity and poor structure is so bad, that it turns what should be a slim read into a fairly mind-numbing experience. The book really needs to go back to an editor."},{"Title":"The Good Society -","review":"Galbraith is an economist who could only operate in academia--in any other setting he would be a joke. In his many books, which are widely cited, he attempts to provide an economic justification to socialism. The principle flaw in this book, from which all the others radiate out, is that all spending is equal. That government spending is just as productive to the economy as personal or corporate spending. He uses this assumption to justify confiscation of wealth by the government through the tax code. Of course, we know now that most of the taxes collected by the government is at best wasted money, and at worst counterproductive to society (welfare, subsidies, foreign aid to countries that hate us, etc.)All that being said, I highly recommend reading this book. It's important to know the enemy."},{"Title":"The Good Society -","review":"Mr. Galbraith is smart, accomplished, and learned man who knows what is best for all us. His view of a good society differs from past visions of societal utopia. Rather than a completely coercive state directing the actions of its citizens to some hirer calling, Mr. Galbraith aims to be \`practical' and just further defines the third way. Nonetheless, his proposal of what makes a good society is not the classical liberal view and it is more attuned to the European model of society. Many of his proposals are so silly you won't take them seriously. But sadly, he is quite serious. For example, Mr. Galbraith states that in a good society everyone should have a rewarding life. Of course, he never defines the standard by which society should judge whether or not a life is rewarding. Neither does he address what one should do if their life is un-rewarding and what the obligation is of society to fulfill that vision of a rewarding life. And, of course, who is the \`rewarding life judge' and does this judge have the authority of the state to take something from someone (who has a life that is deemed too rewarding) for someone who has life that is too un-rewarding. Mr. Galbraith fails to convince the reader of the practicality of his proposals and ends up straddling a line between socialism and capitalism, and saying nothing new."},{"Title":"The Good Society -","review":"Galbraith is a very clear writer. He rarely uses technical jargon or mathematics. But unlike some other popular writers, it isn't because he is able to explain complex phenomena without them. He doesn't appear to understand them. This book reads like a fairy tale or child's letter to Santa Claus. Mr. Galbraith doesn't seem to understand economics well enough to pass economics 101. But he does have an excellent command of the English language."},{"Title":"The Good Society -","review":"I am writing this review on the day after John Kenneth Galbraith passed away at the age of ninety- seven. He was a legendary figure in his lifetime, an economist with a world reputation. His book 'The Affluent Society\\" (1958) made the U.S. and the world think again about the meaning of a society primarily devoted to individual consumer consumption. He was a public servant of great ability and dedication from his days working for the Roosevelt Administration during the Second World in the Office of Price Administration through his service to the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations . He served as U.S. Ambassador to India and was a strong advocate for that country in the U.S. For over thirty years he taught at Harvard and was considered one of its most popular and brilliant teachers. He wrote over thirty books, and was involved in a tremendously wide variety of public activities and affairs.This short book is an updating of 'The Affluent Society'. In it he tackles major economic and social questions >He speaks of a good society whose obligations are to provide for \\" personal liberty, basic wellbeing , racial and ethnic equality, the opportunity for a rewarding life\\".In short chapters of around ten pages he tackles the problems of the deficit, the environment, migration, the proper distribution of wealth, the providing of aid to the world's poor.Galbraith was a fighter in spirit , a person of great wit and fierce sense of social justice. His platform of a kind of social democracy as the ideal way to meet the modern world's problem certainly is questioned by many, not the least by predominant economic opinion today.Perhaps his greatest importance was in pointing out performance problems in capitalist societies, and demanding a greater degree of concern for the commonweal.He was one of those rare intellectual figures who could take a relatively dull subject and make it 'interesting' for the broader public.He worked hard, long and well and his contribution will hopefully not be forgotten."},{"Title":"The Good Society -","review":"Sometime in the 1970s, several trends started to take effect in the USA that have led to many of our troubles now. One of these was the growing divide of the America into haves and have-nots. Another one of these was the privatization of numerous parts of the US economy, and the transfer of many government functions from the public role to the private market. A third effect was the de-emphasis of public infrastructure for the public good, to public infrastructure for corporate wealth. John Kenneth Galbraith addresses all three of this trends, and shows what they have done to the American society and American communities. The result is a good wishlist of probably most political liberals. The one thing lacking from the book is a comparison of what America has become, to the economic and social transformations that have occurred in societies that have incorporated many of Galbraith's ideas, such as Scandinavia, Singapore, and Japan. Overall, an OK book and a good summary of the author's works and views."},{"Title":"The Good Society -","review":"John Kenneth Galbraith sees the eternal struggles of economics as a battle between capital and labor and as things currently stand capital is delivering haymakers and body blows to labor. Labor has the numbers but capital has the advantage of... well, capital. Capital can afford the best representation and that has never been more true than today. Meanwhile Globalization has effectively destroyed labors bargaining power.In \`The Good Society' Mr. Galbraith attempts to map out an economic plan for creating a good society for all, wealthy and poor. What sets Mr. Galbraith apart from many economists is his belief in a pragmatic rather than dogmatic approach. He even compares the Republican parties 1994 \`Contract with America' to the \`Communist Manifesto' for its ideological inflexibility. The problems seem to occur when people start believing that economics falls under the hard sciences when in truth it's more like tracking the weather where small perturbation can cause dramatic changes. One thing that the author has maintained through the years is that Feds actual effect on inflation and recessions is negligible and more smoke and mirrors meant to give the appearance that something is being done. The other issue is that Globalization has made it increasingly difficult for the Federal Reserve to adjust the levels of our economy.Occasionally the author comes off as a bit naive as when he talks about large scale modernization projects done in the third world saying, \\"The steel mills, hydroelectric plants and shiny airports, now sited among ignorant people, became sterile monuments to error - and failure.\\" What Mr. Galbraith fails to recognize is that these projects are only failures from the perspective of the recipient countries who borrowed away their futures in order to acquire them. To the IMF and the construction companies involved it was a complete success. The author does recognize that the gift wealthy countries should have offered was the much less glamorous gift of education. In another section Mr. Galbraith says in reference to Imperialism and Colonialism, \\"We speak sometimes reflectively, of the end of history; here, indeed, history has come to an end.\\" Writers who use the unfortunate term \`end of history' have a bad tendency of being proven wrong in the end.John Kenneth Galbraith is one of the few economists of late who addresses the immense danger of wealth inequality. In contrast to Milton Freidman, Mr. Galbraith believes that there are both financial and ethical sides to economics as relates to helping the poor, protecting the environment and supporting workers rights. He also supports transnational organizations and sees Globalization as the inevitable future. In most ways Mr. Galbraith is swimming upstream against the trends in the United States which is exactly why I find his views more important than ever before. The book seemed to lose some steam about half way through and many of his ideas such as the danger of the military industrial complex have been addressed in his other book, still I recommend Mr. Galbraith as a responsible voice for progressive economics."},{"Title":"The Good Society -","review":"I have two reasons for putting a high value of this book, First, I truly appreciate Mr. Galbraith's style. Its sentence is compact, logic is clear, and expression is eloquent...in short, his style is incredibly excellent. Second, it's useful. Reading this compact book,you can understand 'liberal's good society.'I believe nobody can misunderstand Mr. Galbraith's opinion. If you are a 'liberal', to read this book must be a pleasure. And, if you belong to 'conservative', missing opportunity to know your enemy is not clever."},{"Title":"The Good Society -","review":"Galbraith, the master, sums up his decades of experience and insight in this book. Well written, of course, easy to read. He makes a solid, careful case. The book is a fast read, and is highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Good Society -","review":"Galbraith's main point has less to do with any specific policy than with his belief that rigid ideologues advocate for flawed and potentially dangerous political and economic systems. He argues that capitalism is by far the most responsive and effective economic system given our nature and needs, but that pure market capitalism comes up short in many significant respects. He does exhibit his own bias in some chapters when he ignores matters of degree in favor of more dramatic claims, but his proposals are not controversial by most standards?we need a safety net, environmental regulation is necessary, etc. I couldn?t relate to most of the negative reviews/remarks here. Among them: Galbraith, onetime speechwriter for presidents, editor of Fortune magazine, and prolific author, is inarticulate to the point of incoherence; Galbraith, a onetime Harvard economics professor and head of the American Economic Association, lacks any understanding of economics; Galbraith's ideas are silly; etc. This is a book arguing that capitalism must be tempered if it is to serve society well. Someone who believes that environmental regulations, zoning laws, a progressive income tax, and organizations like the SEC are unnecessary impediments to economic growth will have a hard time with Galbraith. Others will likely recognize that the criticisms of capitalism he levels here are, to some debatable extent, legitimate."},{"Title":"The Good Society -","review":"It is refreshing to read a book by an author who provides answers and not just criticisms. Professor Galbraith truly conforms to Robert Heilbroner's colorful description of the economists throughout history as The Worldly Philosophers. Without doubt this is the work of one of our modern day Worldly Philosophers.This book was written in 1996 when Mr. Galbraith was a very old man. The title of the book suggests a utopian message. Its subtitle is The Humane Society. But being a Worldly Philosopher and a professional economist, Professor Galbraith's \\"Good Society\\" is no dreamy eyed fantasy. It is an outline of not only what should be done but what is practical and achievable in a society - particularly our society here in the USA. Of course this is all predicated on the notion that we live in a society that has a moral conscience. If you believe that you live in a world that is beyond morality or conscience or that the way things are is the way that things should be, then I would predict that this book will not interest you all that much.Richard Edward Noble - The Hobo Philosopher - Author of:\\"A Summer with Charlie\\""},{"Title":"The Good Society -","review":"The book is well written, an easy read, and makes a clear liberal case of the dozen or so economic goals for society."},{"Title":"The Good Society -","review":"This book details what John Kenneth Galbraith views as a \\"good society\\" with what can be achieved and admitting there are goals that can't realistically be reached.Mr. Galbraith observed that the percentage of the poor that don't vote is mirrored by the high percentage of rich that do vote.His view on wealth and power was insightful- \\"Power serves the acquisition of income; income accords power over the pecuniary reward of others.\\" Page 65.His assessment of corporate greed was almost prophetic-\\"Personal profit maximization, that universally acclaimed motivation, can and does extend to those who effectively head the firm.\\" Page 17.The downside with this book from one of my favorite authors on the subject of economics is the age of it.A lot has transpired in the world of politics, global business, and economics since this book was published in 1997.The book does serve very well as a primer on liberal economics."},{"Title":"The Good Society -","review":"John Kenneth Galbraith can be considered a pragmatic liberal, and what he has offered in The Good Society is a concise outline of how a country can - and should - both prosper and take care of its economically deprived citizens. Galbraith argues that the government should bear the responsibility for building an equitable society, and he discusses his view of the proper role of government in areas ranging from education to foreign policy.The fundamental problem with the book is that it lacks the depth of treatment that his topics demand. Each of the chapters, which range from 8 to 10 pages in length, concentrates on a single, unique topic that would normally fill out an entire book. Accordingly, most of the points Galbraith makes are vague and general. For instance, he points out that America's foreign policy should emphasize maintaining peaceful relationships with other nations so as to encourage free trade, but he doesn't delve much further into the issue. Specific policy proposals are never mentioned.The second problem with the book, which is a consequence of the first, is that the ideas Galbraith offers are neither novel nor particularly insightful. In the introduction, he challenges the reader by claiming that some of his proposals for society will ruffle a few feathers, but none of the views in the book fall outside the mainstream of the Democratic Party.What makes The Good Society worthwhile is Galbraith's argument, which he carries throughout the book, that policy should never be subordinated to ideology. Policy decisions, our pragmatist demonstrates, should be examined on the particulars of the individual case and should not be based on any brand of economic dogma. Also, the topics and general proposals presented in the book remain relevant today though the book was written ten years ago.On a stylistic level, the book is inconistsent. The writing ranges from concise and lucid to jarringly awkward. The frequent use of double-negatives, fragments, and inverted sentence structure make the reader go back over passages more than once.Because of the somewhat facile traetment of complex issues, I recommend The Good Society primarily to those without much prior knowledge of liberal (i.e. Democratic) policy. Generally, it is a \\"not unpleasant\\" read."},{"Title":"The Work of the Holy Spirit","review":"I was teaching a course on the work of the Holy Spirit this year, and thought this might be a good time to pick up Kuyper's text. I've wanted to read this over the years, but never took the time. Wow! What a delightful work that stirs the heart and mind to worship the goodness of God. Kuyper overs a grand all-encompassing vision of the Holy Spirit's work as bringing the person, the church and all creation into the fullness of glory. Beautiful text, and I would highly recommend!

It is one of the few literary works for which the phrase \\"unjustly neglected\\" is strictly accurate. Bage's sixth and last novel, \\"Hermsprong\\" is a romantic comedy - a he & she story ending in marriage and wealth - but it's much broader and rowdier than, say, something by Jane Austen (Austen's heroines rarely draw pistols on the men oppressing them). It also has a marked satiric aim, mostly to pillory a corrupt English aristocracy along with the servile church that defended its power and privileges.Charles Hermsprong is the son of an English father and a French mother, born in Philadelphia, and raised among Indians in the western Great Lakes region. When the story begins, he has just returned to England as a young man. Hermsprong is an odd blend of Enlightenment philosophe and American \\"savage,\\" with abundant physical energy, a generous heart, the gift of gab, and a slashing sense of humor. He is also an outspoken radical on virtually any political, social, and religious topic - an anti-monarchial, anti-ecclesiastical, egalitarian progressive in the manner of Tom Paine or Voltaire. Bage has created in his dashing hero the ideological anti-type to Edmund Burke, the prophet of romantic conservatism, whom Bage took swipes at through six successive novels.Early in the story, Hermsprong meets and falls in love with Caroline Campinet, whose father, unfortunately for them both, is the decadent, licentious, arrogant Lord Grondale, a great comic monster. Hermsprong and Lord Grondale despise each other from their first meeting, and Caroline is caught in the classic romance conflict between obedience to her father and desire for marriage with the man she loves. In his account of the struggles between Hermsprong and Lord Grondale, Bage stages debates on a wide range of contemporary topics in the kind of sparkling, intellectual dialogue we associate with George Bernard Shaw, the modern writer Bage most nearly resembles. Needless to say, the good end happily and the bad end unhappily, which is why, as Oscar Wilde reminds us, they call it fiction. The ending, though gratifying to the romantic in all of us, is virtually conjured with a magician's wand.Bage is not, to be frank, as great a novelist as Defoe, Fielding, Smollett, Sterne, or Austen. He only started writing in middle age after having spent his first fifty years or so as a businessman in the Midlands, and he remains, finally, a gifted amateur. But he is highly intelligent, broad-minded, temperamentally skeptical, and thoroughly good-natured, and he can be laughing-out-loud funny. \\"Hermsprong,\\" with its radical ideology, fell out of favor in the reactionary period of the early 1800s and has only lately been reissued by Broadview Press. It would be great if it now found its way to a new, larger audience. It's great fun to read, intellectually provocative, and offers encouragement in the continuing struggle for humane, liberal values against the reactionary defenders of the status quo."},{"Title":"Hermsprong Or Man As He Is Not","review":"Writing about a generation before Jane Austen, Blage, now known primarily for nothing at all, was an extremely popular and well-thought-of 18th-century writer (he was admiringly written about by Sir Walter Scott--damning praise there, nowadays, but grow up).This is Blage's masterpiece: his last, great, satirical work skewering the mores of British snobbishness (in the person of Lord Grondale)through the caricature of an American &quot;barbarian.&quot; The phrase &quot;pride and prejudice&quot; is used throughout in the manner applied by Austen (yes, this is a bucolic, country novel of manners--focusing more on character than plot; oh, with everyone married happily ever after by the end). A treat."},{"Title":"Manuel Alvarez Bravo","review":"The most complete collection of this wonderful photographer's work available, this book has unfortunately been printed so poorly that the qualities of most of the photographs is lost.

Any selection not done by the artist reflects a certain bias, but this collection has a very neutral one, and the book flows quite nicely.

I purchased this book for my four-year-old niece and it has remained one of her absolute favorites for over a year now. Granted, she is a \\"just the facts, ma'am\\" sort of kid -- very interested in how things work, especially the human body. With space-age detail, Germs tells the story of Pox, a student at germ academy (along with roommates Pus, Snot, and Rash) who is learning how to make people sick. Not happy with his mission, Pox is sent to infect a little girl named Myrtle. When confronted with her white blood cells (an army of mini versions of Myrtle herself), Pox decides to make friends instead and opt for a non-infecting life of leisure inside Myrtle's body. While instructive about how we get sick, the book also is empowering in teaching about our immune systems. The pastel color palette has a retro feel, and the germs are cartoonishly gross -- perfect for kids who love to say \\"Ewww!\\" -- and yet Pox is adorably cuddly and cute. I highly recommend this book for any science-minded children out there."},{"Title":"Germs","review":"We first got this book from our local Library because of the awesome pictures but after reading it knew it had to be one we added to our personal collection! Any time my 6 year old starts feeling sick, we pull this book out and it comforts him. He learned how his body's defences fight off the bug that gets inside him. We then discuss how the germ might have gotten into his body, and exactly how it comes out. Now that he can put a visual representation on what is going on, he is a bit more comfortable with being sick. I really LOVE this book!"},{"Title":"Germs","review":"I was looking for a book that I could share with my four year old niece, and found this great book about Germs! My niece absolutely LOVES it! She giggles every time you say some of the germ names while reading the book. She asked everyone to read it to her over and over and over during my weekend visit. She couldn't get enough of it.

She prefers colonial and classic stylings. She thought the flat tediousness of Wright architecture unimaginative and ugly.So, without question I learned to back up her opinions, and to interject my own solo critical assessments anytime the topic came up. I could argue against Wright architecture like a pro, even if I didn't know what I was talking about and didn't truly agree with myself! I was a LaManchian interlocutor, straining at gnats with gusto and pleasure, not knowing how frequently others must have been thinking \\"What's this guy's problem?\\"But it was good for my ill-fated marriage.The marriage ended, which created my first point of connection with Mr. Wright. Next was my residence, which for most of my life has been near Ann Arbor, the Mecca for Wrightistic designs if ever there was one. I am surrounded by it, but never knew how much until I read this biography and started to get it.This quick read gives you the basics. The man's vision for work, design, asthetic harmony and balance is actually quite inspirational. Buildings are to blend in with nature, and should be designed so as to balance and harmonize with human needs and activities. That's it!I began to notice Wright styles all around me, and to see the need for more of it, in homes and buildings I visited. I am now my own \\"anti\\"!I felt some remorse at his relationship with his father, his errant ways vis-a-vis his religion, his failed marriage and weak relationship with his children. But visionaries are often failures in their personal lives. Perhaps this is necessary.I completed reading the book in just a few days of casual reading. Interestingly, about the time I finished it, my ten-year old daughter started to talk about Frank Lloyd Wright to me. I don't think she saw me reading the book - they must have had some discussion in school about it.How cool it was, that I could converse with her intelligently, and sympathetically, about this new topic that captured her interest. And I am thankful now, that I was no longer the anti-Wright!A good and informative read. Yes, buy it."},{"Title":"Say It in Norwegian (Dover Language Guides Say It Series)","review":"To have a small phrase book like this one is essential.

It can also act as a handy book that can be kept in your pocket when you have a spare minute to review. For the price, something like this shouldn't be passed up on.

Perhaps I enjoy his books due to wishing this modern day Robin Hood existed. Perhaps it's because all books in his series can stand alone.

While the Old Testament focuses mainly on the concept of the Father, and the New Testament focuses mainly on the life and teachings of Jesus. The Holy Spirit is mentioned very briefly and though Christians do not deny the divine nature of the Holy Spirit, there are disagreement s concerning the manifestation of the Holy Spirit.Billy Graham is obviously the most well-known evangelist in the world. He is passionate yet mechanical in his faith and words. He always relies on the power of Scripture to communicate. In this book, Graham goes step by step explaining the wondrous presence of the Holy Spirit and how the Spirit dwells in us and moves through us.Graham has never been known to be concise.

I recommend you to read it. I agree with most of what Dr Graham is saying about the Holy Spirit but regarding \\"speaking in tounges\\" I disagree with him. I think it is for every believer and for edification of the induvidual believer. I also think he is to unclear about the need of baptism. I see nothing in the bible to support child baptism and think he should put more effort on making it clear that every believer fist should repent from their sins and receive the Lord Jesus and then be baptised in water.But otherwise it is a very good book."},{"Title":"The Holy Spirit","review":"It might seem odd that this Seattle boy took a look at this progressive prose written by a great man. While Graham is embraced by society at large, those from subcultures such as myself can learn from his concise and compassionate writings. It was by pure chance I encountered this book, and it was the initial lines that read &quot;No person can seek sincerely the cleansing and blessing of the Holy Spirit, and remain the same afterward.&quot; I read on, and indeed, did not remain a stagnant being with resistance to spiritual enlightenment. Through these writings I learned to trust in holy word, and let it lead where my heart desired. Being a vegan and health food nut who has always denounced meat and intoxicants, I was surprised to find that by opening my heart, I soon renounced my judgment on meat eaters, and became attracted to the meditational use of marijuana. I reluctantly smoked, and my spiritual enhancement two-folded within minutes. If it weren't for these inspirational writings of Billy Graham, I would still be eating nothing but legumes and obnoxious with a drab 3-D personality. The one dimensional sensation I have acheived has blossomed my soul. This is a must for Christians and Non-Christians alike. While Billy Graham made no specific mentions of obtaining the results I found, I can't help but think the Beat-Generation tone he uses in his prose is an offshoot of the late Dr. Timothy Leary's style of verbosity flow. This is a beautiful universe, and by opening my mind via reading this book, I have also concluded you should have up to five higher powers, be that they are kind, and that at least two are Aztec or Mayan based."},{"Title":"The Holy Spirit","review":"I love how Billy Graham writes!! It is so simplistic and so very easy to comprehend. I also love how he gets to the point in the introduction when he says, \\"Man has two great spiritual needs. One is for forgiveness. The other is for Goodness.\\" Then he doesn't stop there. He then informs us that, \\"God heard the cry for forgiveness, and answered it at Calvary. God sent his only Son into the world to die for our sins, so that we might be forgiven.\\" This is what Billy has taught for years!! That salvation comes through faith in Jesus Christs' sacrifice 2000 years ago on an old rugged cross!! Oh, but it gets better. He then goes further to point out to you that salvation \\"is for everyone who reaches out and accepts God's gift by receiving Jesus Christ as his Lord and Saviour.\\" Space does not allow for a complete and utter review of this amazing CHRISTIAN book. But one thing is for sure: it isn't about spiritual enlightenment. It isn't about reaching a spiritual high. It isn't about using any other way to activate the \\"revolutionary power\\" of the Holy Spirit any other way than by complete and utter repentance of sin and trust in Christ. Truly a wonderful and amazing book about the power of the Holy Spirit that is only inherited by CHRISTIANS who serve ONE GOD, and ONE GOD ONLY."},{"Title":"The Holy Spirit","review":"This wonderful book was a great comfort to me.

As I read, I kept thinking, \\"I miss Dr. Graham.\\" Then, I turned on the TV and one of his \\"classic\\" crusade presentations was on a religious channel.

People can never reach the pinnacle of the Christian life without a surrender to the Holy Spirit. Graham points out that the way to get the most out of the Christian life is by living a life of humility, holiness, and obedience to God's Word.Graham has a great balance of doctrinal truths in his writings. He emphasizes God's grace and the personal responsibility of the believer equally. He is always careful to stress that repentance is essential to salvation. Graham is committed to making sure that new converts are discipled. These are factors that are crucial in this era and some prominent evangelists have been negligent in this regard.This book on the Holy Spirit is typical of the outstanding work of Dr. Graham. His writings are as good as his oratory skills. Every thing this devoted man of God does is of great quality. He is a real credit to the body of Christ.

Unlike other theories, however, the NSM approach intends the primitives to be empirically discovered rather than merely programmatic; and intends them to be concrete expressions of real language rather than abstractions. They are simply universal terms having a degree of simplicity such that they cannot themselves be defined without the introduction of obscurity. There are about 55 such terms so far established and tested, including, for example, I, YOU, SOMEONE,ONE, TWO,THINK, KNOW,SAY, WORD, DO, HAPPEN, etc.The claim is that some terms are more basic, clear and understandable than others, not merely for some individuals, but absolutely for all individuals. It is based on Chapter 4 of Book VI of Aristotle's _Topics_. The idea is that (conceptual) semantics is a matter of giving definitions, and a definition ought to be simpler than what is being defined. But the validity of the claim depends upon our acceptance of the notion &quot;semantic complexity&quot; - the claim that some terms are semantically more complex than other, simpler, terms.We cannot do semantic analysis without a set of primitives, for all definitions would be inherently circular. If there are semantic primitives, then there are at least some simple or basic terms which themselves do not need definition and cannot be further defined. &quot;To understand anything we must reduce the unknown to the known, the obscure to the clear, the abstruse to the self-explanatory.&quot; Wierzbicka, _Semantics: Primes and Universals_, p. 11. The explication of complex concepts in terms of simpler ones is what we do when we explain anything. Without this notion there is no explanation.Leibniz wrote regarding this issue that &quot;If nothing could be comprehended in itself nothing at all could ever be comprehended. Because what can only be comprehended via something else can be comprehended only to the extent to which that other thing can be comprehended, and so on; accordingly, we can say that we have understood something only when we have broken it down into parts which can be understood in themselves.&quot;The present version of the NSM theory as presented by Goddard is strong and insightful in some areas, weaker and more dubious in others. The chief difficulty I see with it is a familiar one, conceded in effect by the author himself: simplicity is often a trade-off between different sorts of economy. The NSM theory does indeed get along with a relatively small number of primes; however the reductive paraphrases themselves (i.e., the definitions) become quite lengthy and complex, even allowing for the use of &quot;semantic molecules&quot; (terms not themselves primes but already defined in terms of primes, and which recur in many reductive paraphrases), especially for natural kinds.Two of the valuable insights of this approach are (a) that it allows for the description of referential indeterminacy in discrete terms and (b) it develops a notion Goddard calls &quot;functional logic&quot; which relates the visible attributes of an artifact to its use, rather nicely dealing with Labov's famous example of _cup_ vs. _mug_ and the like.Ken Miner"},{"Title":"Blake's apocalypse: A study in poetic argument","review":"Serious students of Blake would do well to start here. Lucid, informed and methodical, Bloom's &quot;Blake's Apocalypse&quot; leaves no page unturned amid his exhaustive investigation into the influences, ideas and hopes that comprise Blake's vast and complicated &quot;poetic argument.&quot; Though Bloom's erudition can sometimes undermine his clarity, the book glows with the confident understanding and purpose he built his name on. Delving into Blake's main influences -- Milton, the Bible and the ancient Greeks -- Bloom focuses much of his time on Blake's epics while making the good point that these greater works are often neglected in favor of the more managable and straightforward &quot;Songs of Innocence and Experience.&quot; &quot;Blake's Apocalypse&quot; is an endless resource comparable to those other masterpieces of Blake scholarship: Frye's &quot;Fearful Symmetry&quot; and Erdman's &quot;Prophet Against Empire.&quot; I've been relying on it for months now and can't imagine any session with Blake's mind being complete without it."},{"Title":"Blake's apocalypse: A study in poetic argument","review":"Some facts about Harold Bloom.

Green has done an excellent and painstaking research juxtaposing these two men who advocated for love, peace and brotherhood than anyone else in these two centuries.Though Gandhi had traits of piousness and adherence to truth in him from an early age, his unshakable belief in non-violence, selfless service and simple living had not became his sole doctrines until he came across Tolstoy's teachings through his books, most notably \`Kingdom of God is within you' much later when he was in jail in South Africa. Though Tolstoy died within couple of years since Gandhi had made his first contact with him at the age of forty, it was Tolstoy more than anyone else from whom Gandhi had continued to draw inspiration throughout his life.Even while considering Tolstoy as his role model, Gandhi could never completely agree with Tolstoy on many of his views, most importantly his views on religion. The Tolstoy whom Gandhi knew had renounced religion, its superstitions, science and politics whereas for Gandhi religion and its teachings were as essential as the air he breathed. Tolstoy was against any kind of organization when Gandhi was part and parcel of Indian national congress and freedom movements. While Tolstoy was against class structure of any sort Gandhi supported the caste system in India.For Tolstoy, the nationalism and patriotism were two meaningless words used by politicians, which he considered as ideology of slavery, imposed by the institutions to justify their own existence. Gandhi never considered himself a patriot or nationalist in the sense Tolstoy defined them. Gandhi had a political problem to solve and hence had been an ardent activist unlike Tolstoy who had been advocating his principles passively and often bogged down in his domestic issues. Tolstoy forecasted that Gandhi's Hindu indoctrination to the Indian politics was going to cause great deal of troubles which Gandhi's colleagues realized decades later. \`Gandhi's Hindu nationalism spoiled everything' remarked Tolstoy for Gandhi's excessive application of Hindu school of thoughts to Indian politics for achieving his political goals.Gandhi's growing repulsion for industrialization had a parallel to Tolstoy's denunciation to art and intellect. If the lack of truth, and the existence of Eros when stripped of religion from the art was what concerned Tolstoy, the machines and its mass production refusing humans its physical labor was what Gandhi despised in industrialization. According to Gandhi, western civilization, deprived of its efficacy for spiritual harmony but conducive of material advancement becomes a body of corrupted, immoral and incorrigible institute.Gandhi's insistence on bread labor has the backing of Tolstoy's teachings which Gandhi imposed on the inmates of his Phoenix and Tolstoy farms in South Africa. When Gandhi tried to sell the same principle (in the form of spinning and weaving) to Indian national congress leaders, many objected and more repudiated. Both Nehru and his father vehemently opposed this just as Romain Rolland opposed it when he was advised to do the same by Tolstoy when the former approached him for an \`intellectual breakthrough' in his life. Both Rolland and Nehru considered themselves as belonging to prerogative class which Tolstoy despised. Here we see two distinct classes; one consists of Nehru and Rolland, the intellectuals and the other consists of Gandhi and Tolstoy, the reformers.In his book, Martin highlighted Gandhi's not so well known episode of his life; his \`relationship' with Saraladevi Chaudhurani, grand-niece of Rabindranath Tagore, whom he considered as his \`spiritual wife', a story that is published in his grandson's memoir of Gandhi - \`Mohandas - A true story of a Man his People and an Empire'. Apart from Martin, other historians including Judith Brown in her book \`Gandhi - a prisoner of hope' and Stanley Wolpert in \`Gandhi's Passion' has attempted to analyze Gandhi's \`relations' with his women disciples. These studies are of great significance especially when one consider Gandhi's claim of him as a devoted (in thought and deed) \`Brahamachari'. As Martin correctly pointed out \`Gandhi's acquaintance with Sarladevi and his acquisition of the national leadership was more than just accidental'. It is safe to assume that Gandhi drew immense energy from his spiritual relationships with his women disciples to sustain his political goals. Then there was Madeline Slade, the aristocratic lady who came to India to work for Gandhi's cause, too had spiritual, platonic relationship with Gandhi that is evident from numerous communications they had between them. In comparison, earlier life of Tolstoy was rife with nefarious relations with multitude of ladies including local serfs and servants of his house who even bore his children. Tolstoy's erotic relations with ladies served him with themes and inspirations for the creation of such classics as \`Anna Karenna' and \`War and Peace'.This book does not give you the details of political upheavals of Russia during the second half of 19th century which among many other events had had a great influence on Tolstoy resulting in his eventual transformation that we started seeing in him in his 50s; from one who wrote such classics as \`Anna Karenna' and \`War and Peace' to one who wrote \`Death of Ivan IIyich' and from an aristocratic intellect to a divine philosopher.Though an understanding of Gandhi is not required to know Tolstoy, knowing Tolstoy could be the first step in understanding Gandhi's Byzantine yet simple psyche, whose principles were basically Tolstoyean though tailored to the Indian cause. Probably we could not see a better known man than Gandhi who with relevant teachings from scriptures and lives of great people combined voice of his conscience to formulate such powerful social/moral techniques to help the humanity achieve an understanding and harmony.This is a definitely good book for anyone looking for a comparative study of these two men but not a good one for an in-depth study of them."},{"Title":"Nietzsche's Corps/e: Aesthetics, Politics, Prophecy, or, the Spectacular Technoculture of Everyday Life (Post-Contemporary Interventions)","review":"Waite's book illustrates a series of &quot;problems&quot; with Nietzsche and Nietzschean-ism: 1/ The Big Lie; 2/ The Double Code; 3/ The Master/Slave Thing; 4/ The So-Called Secret Agenda; 5/ The Will to Power; 6/ The Hellenic Thing; and 7/ The Proto-Postmodernism. It avoids 8/ The Migraines and the Pain, a subject belaboured by Pierre Klossowski in Nietzsche and the Vicious Circle (1969).An initial reading of both Geoffrey Waite's masterful tirade against the Nietzscheans, Nietzsche's Corps/e, and Pierre Klossowski's (in)famous Nietzsche and the Vicious Circle suggests damning evidence of a misappropriation of Nietzsche (most tellingly by poststructuralists and the Left). Waite points to a very famous symposium, held in July 1972 at Cerisy-la-Salle (Normandy) and attended by the illuminati of the French structuralist-poststructuralist camp (Derrida, Nancy, Klossowski et alia), as the time and place that Klossowski first 'broadcast' his idea of the &quot;secret&quot; Nietzsche.Waite's book is a demolition of this edifice constructed by the French illuminati and a denunciation of Nietzsche Himself by way of a high-rhetorical romp through the drug-like nature of Nietzsche's thought: &quot;Nietzsche is a type of H/Meth, arguably the major type of post/narcotic 'quiver between history and ontology'.&quot; Waite is quoting Avital Fonell's &quot;Our Narcotic Modernity&quot; from Rethinking Technologies (1993) and setting the stage for his investigation of how Nietzsche's writings insinuate themselves into consciousness without necessarily being processed by the rational vectors of the brain. Waite's premise is that Nietzsche indeed, pace Klossowski, encoded a subliminal message into his work. The Genealogy of Morals (1887) and The Gay Science (1882) - plus Thus Spake Zarathustra (1883-85) - are the principle examples of this narcotic prose style.Perhaps the most rewarding portion of Waite's book is the section &quot;Nietzsche's Esoteric Semiotics&quot;, wherein he takes on Klossowski's reading (and therefore the structuralist-poststructuralist camp en masse) and goes about the ravishing analysis of the so-called secret agenda. Nietzsche, it would seem, is the true avatar of postmodernism (nihilism and/plus relativism) and purposely buried his message in the paradoxical, ironic posturing of his works. His message is, in Waite's reading, proto-deconstructivist and attempts to condition all possible futures. Nietzsche has become second nature to our collective postcultural selves - essentially self-deconstructing selves - underwriting almost every discourse that pretends to demolish power in the name of heterogeneity. Perhaps Waite is at his best when he is positing what has been lost; i.e., a possible communism and/or a possible utopian project called enlightenment. Nietzsche, in other words, demolished all pretexts that might underwrite such an agenda."},{"Title":"Nietzsche's Corps/e: Aesthetics, Politics, Prophecy, or, the Spectacular Technoculture of Everyday Life (Post-Contemporary Interventions)","review":"Waite sets us up for a full explication/penetration of the most destructive Nietzsche virus yet imagined. It should be asked, however, whether he is truly trying to destroy/discredit Nietzsche/anism or create/make stronger the very virus he discovers/invents. This question may not be asked, that of the author's intention, as it pertains to Nietzsche or to Waite. Waite makes writing/reading into a psychotic activity. More frightening is that even my own attempt to discredit Waite's reading only makes stronger, or increases the power of it."},{"Title":"Nietzsche's Corps/e: Aesthetics, Politics, Prophecy, or, the Spectacular Technoculture of Everyday Life (Post-Contemporary Interventions)","review":"This book is hands down the most intelligent left-wing book on Nietzsche in existence! Waite correctly dismisses the playful postmodern Nietzsche of dance and mask worshipped by soi-disant intellectuals and thus gets far closer to the heart of Nietzsche's purpose than they ever do. Waite is unafraid to ask the question who should rule. Also, unlike virtually all 'leftish' Nietzschean commentators Waite is very familiar with the esoteric nature of Nietzsche's writings. He has married the politico-philosophical esoteric readings of Leo Strauss with the revolutionary ideals of Marxism and has given us the only left reading of Nietzsche that is worth reading twice. It now seems, ten long years after the publication of this book, that this marriage between Marxism and esotericism is going to produce no heirs. Which is a pity; I would very much like to have seen a comparison of the dialectical method and the esoteric method that is not simply a hatchet job. By that I mean I would very much like to have seen a study that compares esoteric and dialectical thought written by someone who is adept -and recognized as such by all practitioners- in both these extraordinary philosophical methods. ...But it now seems likely that this will never be. Why?I would begin to answer that question by noting how remarkable it is that the none of the earlier reviews of this extraordinary book even mentioned Leo Strauss. But, as anyone who has read this book knows, the Straussian understanding of philosophical texts is crucial to Waite's argument. So why this silence among reviewers? One of the problems, if not the main problem, is that in a propaganda war one is at pains to either downplay or ignore the acute contributions to thought of ones enemies. The danger, intelligently alluded to in an earlier review, is that rather than making 'Nietzscheanism' weaker, all Waite has done, by making Nietzsche seem so intelligent and interesting, is make him stronger. In a similar manner and for similar reasons, much of the left would rather ignore Strauss, or excoriate him, rather than present him in an intelligent manner.Now, these are tactical issues that I do not pretend to be competent to judge, but I will point out that all tactical concerns are temporary and local. If the Marxist-esotericism that Waite here pioneers is a genuine contribution to thought (i.e., if both the esoteric reading of texts &agrave; la Leo Strauss and Marxist dialectic are indeed genuine contributions) then it would be sheer madness to ignore either Waite or Strauss. It was Merleau-Ponty, I believe, who once observed quite correctly, in the heat of a similar ideological confrontation, that 'we must not leave our enemies any good ideas'. If Merleau-Ponty is correct in this, that it is always a long-term strategic mistake, for what is at bottom momentary tactical considerations, to ignore genuinely intelligent contributions of enemies then Waite's contribution has been foolishly ignored by the left. But if you believe that long-term strategy is trumped by tactical concerns than Waite's book, regardless of the accuracy of his esoteric reading of Nietzsche, must be ignored.For myself, a mere observer of this conflict, I continue to hope for a confrontation and/or dialogue between the two greatest 'schools' of political philosophy - the dialectical and the esoteric - that is rigorous, critical and informed. ...But who ever really gets what they want?"},{"Title":"Nietzsche's Corps/e: Aesthetics, Politics, Prophecy, or, the Spectacular Technoculture of Everyday Life (Post-Contemporary Interventions)","review":"I used to think that Nietzsche was a dangerous thinker.

He is hiding in your brain and in the cyberspace jungle, issuing commands to his faithful corps via his corpse become corpus become everyday life.Waite's thesis is that Nietzsche's esoteric and indeed exoteric agenda is the extermination of the weak and the enslavement of the masses with the object of giving the elite male genius the time and the wealth to pursue his masturbational projects of self-creation and self-glorification. Decent people, communist or not, should (should you say?) have nothing to do with this murderous project. Leftists should find someone else to quote.The most closely held premise of Nietzsche was (is) that some people are better than others and that society should be ordered accordingly. Now I don't see how anything, including superior power, could make someone objectively, metaphysically better than anyone else. But Nietzsche would unflinchingly reject the terms of my characterization. Or possibly just chase us angrily with his umbrella.Unless you happen to be one of Nietzsche's Supermen (and you had really be sure that you actually are a Superman and not someone who has been unwittingly duped in to thinking that he is the Higher Man) then you ally yourself with Nietzsche at your own peril.Now all of this may be hyperbole, but given what is at stake, hyperbole may be in order."},{"Title":"Nietzsche's Corps/e: Aesthetics, Politics, Prophecy, or, the Spectacular Technoculture of Everyday Life (Post-Contemporary Interventions)","review":"I bought this book with the honest wish to encounter a real criticism of Nietzsche's thought.

After using the Princeton Review book before my PSAT, and then the Rocket Review and Up Your Score, I felt like I was being duped. I wanted to really learn how to improve my SAT scores, and I was willing to put some work into it. I thought a test-prep book would have lots of practice and detailed answers to explain your mistakes to help you improve. But these books kept insulting the ETS gratuitously, and tooting their own \\"secret methods\\" that I started to suspect that the emperor had no clothes. They would explain a trick, and give an example, but then there was almost no practice, and their \\"tricks\\" hardly worked at all on the real SAT. \\"Joe Bloggs\\" is truly a joke that helps perhaps only the most naive student in the world. Reading these books, I felt like I was being patronized by a bunch of smart alecs. The SAT isn't a joke, folks: I'm serious about learning and doing well on the SAT.Then I found this book, and I discovered that someone really got it. The way to prep for the SAT is to take a realistic practice SAT, then get good feedback about your mistakes that shows you what you need to practice in order to improve your score. This book is BRILLIANTLY organized. It's huge, but you will probably end up using only a part of it. The vocabulary units are great and very effective, and the lessons are so systematic that you can't help but learn. Whe I did the lessons, I finally understood so much that I learned in math years ago and never really had understood.

Not really sure it it's the original 1855 edition but I presume it is."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"I was familiar with the well-known poems and wanted to own \\"Leaves of Grass.\\" I'm not going to review the poetry, but describe, hopefully to help others figure out what took me some research, its various editions.In 1855 Whitman self-published \\"Leaves of Grass\\" as a 12-poem book. Up to 1892, he added poems and revised the original twelve poems -- books also published under the same title, \\"Leaves of Grass.\\" In 1892, Whitman published (by then, recognized, not self-published) its final version, the edition he wanted to be thought the definitive \\"Leaves of Grass.\\" This is the commonly called \\"Deathbed Edition.\\" It contains over 300 poems. It does contain the original twelve, though not in their original or other previously-published forms. By then, they'd been many-times revised over the years, and released within other publications between the first and the last. In essence, \\"Leaves of Grass\\" was a nearly 40-year evolving work, under the same title, each edition containing the prior editions' poems further revised, plus additional poems.I wanted to read the original poems. I also wanted to see their final versions, and was curious to see their evolution. I noticed that some books include so many evolutions of the poems/book, they fill at least two volumes. I wanted to own \\"Leaves of Grass\\" but I didn't need to become a scholar of it; I wanted to read the book. However, I didn't want only the Deathbed Edition -- I was both curious about the original and wanted to see more than 12 poems.I decided to buy an edition of the book that contains the entire Deathbed Edition, plus a few of the poems in their original form, and some commentary. I believe, after researching, I found the best I could. That would be my recommendation: if this is your first purchase of \\"Leaves of Grass\\" make sure to see some poetry from 1855, some poetry from the Deathbed Edition, and some poetry in between. That is, if what you want to read is the poetry and not own a collector's item or only the \\"definitive edition,\\" as Whitman viewed it (Deathbed). To me, seeing only the final version detracts something from its core -- and after reading the poems and comparing them, I feel this even more -- so in that sense I disagree with Whitman; he chose to make public many books over 40 years, yet wanted only the last to be considered the true version.As a reader, I find it unfortunate that this is a work that evolved over a lifetime under the same title; it renders each addition of poems to the book not books of their own, and also difficult to find on their own. So, for me, the compromise was to choose a book that includes the Deathbed Edition and part of the original, without having to read multiple books, or 1,000 pages, or a scholarly journal (though I would love to see the full original 12 poems).I understand a book will be released soon that includes both the full original (12 poems) and the full Deathbed Editions. I don't have it, so I don't know what else will be included."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"Having read only tid bits, here and there, from Leaves of Grass, I found that it was full of truly unique American poetry. Whitman definitely achieved his goal of becoming a truly innovative poet. The fact that he rarely uses any type of meter, rhyme scheme, or exaggerated rhetorical devices almost says that he has mastered the basic fundamentals of poetry and surpassed his peers. He is so far above the simple and frequently used methods that he must create his own fresh and new style of writing. I found Leaves of Grass to be a lot to grapple with as a high school student, especially his philosophy pertaining to Deism, and yet, it was most intriguing and made me want to simply delve deeper into it. I look forward to completing Leaves of Grass and recommend it to anyone looking for truly original forms of American poetry."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"I carry a copy of Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass with me where ever I go.

Whitman is the most enthuiastic American poet I have ever read and his passion for life and nature is amazing. He did not ever want to miss a second of life or the smallest detail of nature. He shares his limitless love for all Americans, including, of course, himself. I particularly enjoy his frequent usage of listing without commas, which I find livens his excitement for life even more. Whitman, although he may come off as a bit over eager to some, truly makes you realize how blessed you are and how lucky you are to live in this beautiful place, and he reminds us all that we should not take any of these blessings for granted.

Walt Whitman opened my eyes and my mind to the posibilities of what could be put onto paper. I had never really liked reading until I opened this book and have not stopped reading since. Walt was a true American. It is incredible that Walt Whitman can make accurate references in his poems to just about every facit of American life. It doesn't take very many pages before you feel as if Walt has been in your shoes, seen things through your eyes, thought the things you have thought and felt the feelings you have felt.

Granted, he did revolutionize poetry and writing as we know it. However, certain selections for his ever famous Song of Myself show that he can sure describe those bodily actions that he seems to love so much. I can cut him some slack, probably because he's a romantic writer, but his random stringing of words, phrases, and lists do his poetry injustice. Poor Jonathon Edwards would be turning in his grave..."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"Whitman Glorified?Whitman's descriptions of nature are inspired and his style exudes with the same passion as his subject. Yet, his self-absorption overshadows his talent. Whitman's poem, \\"Song of Myself\\" takes up a significant portion of the book, Leaves of Grass. Here, Whitman keeps no points in reserve, but spends 52 sections \\"celebrating\\" himself. He feels he, as man, is the great panacea. He suckles at its mercy until it fills not only his subject matter, but influences his technique and his structure as well. His intriguing mind leads the reader along, until disappointment is found in another laborious passage expounding god status and the call to ascend to his level of distorted thinking. Whitman's momentary descriptive nuggets are lost in a sea of narcissism."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"How come everyone constantly praises Shakespeare, Keats, Whitman, etc.?

Regarded as America's poet, Whitman wrote in the 1840s through the 1880s, encompassing both the \\"Manifest Destiny\\" ideology of the pre-war, through the Reconstruction period of US History.The poems are diverse and upbeat. The language, for the most part, is clear and easy. Nevertheless, like most poetry today, the poems are so little different from prose, except in the presentation into lines. Very few poetic devises are used.One may correctly criticize my critique as one who does not appreciate contemporary poetry. But, in comparison to rhyhming verse by Longfellow, Frost, Byron, Browning, or Shakespeare, current poetry appears meaningless.Although a classic, \\"Leaves of Grass\\" offers only one or two poems that qualify for a standard anthology. None of his poems are memorable. Not a single line is considered worthy of citing anywhere in literature.I give two stars to the work, simply because I must admit my own incompetence in modern poetry appreciation. Whitman is considered important enough to be the major poet in the movie, \\"Dead Poet's Society\\"; so, the reputation of the work must be quite impressive, though it beats me how that is."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"Mr Boston everyone has their own opinions but to call this work boring is saying that you have no idea about what you are reading.

He wrote about life. He wrote about the mundane world, and made it look so beautiful. He admired the human form, and praised the wonderful design of the body. His comments on life in America during the middle of the 19th century really carry a romantic outlook. He was passionate about himself, life, and the world around him.

Whitman was a man ahead of his time."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"While I agree with most of the reviews written here, I must take issue with them somewhat. First, I also believe that Walt Whitman is one of the finest poets that ever lived and certainly the finest when it comes to being a proud American. Although, he comes from a time in America that was like that of Socrates and Plato in the past, a time when the most important thing in life was not work, or success or career, but the exploration of one's inner thoughts. Were we living in a time when such a thing was permitable rather than the constant search for the almighty dollar, we might see more such poets. But he and his era are long gone. The art of the word is certainly Walt's. I ask you to also purchase a dictionary when you purchase this or any of his volumes, not because it is difficult to read, but because Whitman doesn't always use a word for it's main meaning, often burying a meaning of a word or line in the third or fourth meaning, completely changing the meaning of the poem. It is such fun and exactly what I believe Walt Whitman is meant to be, a journey and a trip to the celebration of life. A celebration that also includes a look at the worst that is us and the best that is us. When the reviewer wrote that his work is a study of a narcissist, I have to disagree. Yes, it begins his work with Song of Myself and it is an epic poem. But while he celebrates Walt, he is truly celebrating all of us as amazing creatures in nature. He celebrates every molecule of us, the amazing capabilities, perfumes and evilness of us. He studies us as though someone would study the amazing ability of a tree to grow or a flower to bloom. We are nature and he recognizes that and it is amazing to him. Clearly, he had bravado and self-love, but in the most non-imposing way. We wishes all of us to realize the miracle that is us. To believe that he is only about himself is to miss the point of Walt. Also, it is important to read the various editions of this volume. He wrote and rewrote Leaves of Grass continuously throughout his life adding and deleting poems as he saw them. The best way to see his journey is to read the first edition (complete with his swaggering picture), where he was not listed as the author to the final \\"deathbed edition\\" that is truly a masterpiece and you can see what he learns, what he tries to teach you and how deeply you will be moved by him. One last hint - read \\"Song of Myself\\" outloud. It becomes truly a song about life and read outloud can certainly stir your soul."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"What more can be said about Walt Whitman's &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;? This 19th century work is more than just a poetic masterpiece; it is a pivotal landmark in the history of world literature. Read &quot;Leaves&quot; and you will understand why Whitman is hailed as a poetic ancestor by poets, both male and female, of many different ethnic and national backgrounds. His is truly a universal voice.Whitman published the first edition of &quot;Leaves&quot; in 1855, and continued to revise and expand the book until it had grown into the monumental final version. While the &quot;deathbed&quot; edition is an essential text, I'd like to put in a plug for the much smaller 1855 edition, which has been reprinted with an introduction by Malcolm Cowley. The &quot;deathbed&quot; edition may be too large and intimidating a literary tapestry for Whitman &quot;virgins&quot;; the reprinted 1855 edition may thus be a good way to begin exploring the bounteous poetic talent and vision of this giant.The Cowley-introduced edition also includes Whitman's original prose introduction, which is itself a remarkable piece of literature. While the 1855 &quot;Leaves&quot; is missing vast sections of the deathbed version, it is still a stunning work of art that succeeds as a self-sufficient piece of literature and philosophy. In this &quot;embryonic&quot; version of the soon-to-evolve masterpiece, we already discover Whitman's pungent eroticism, his embrace of paradox, and his playful theological exploration. His language is sensuous, outrageous, tender, and amazing, and is full of compassion for all living beings.Whitman is more than just a great poet; his work is a sort of prophecy for both the secular and multifaith worlds. So read &quot;Leaves&quot; in either the embryonic version or the ultimate version, and embark on an unforgettable poetic journey."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"Is this FREE edition abridged?

As a revolutionist, he baisically tore up any rule book to writing, stripping away any limitations, and paving the path for further free, independent thinkers. He was unaffraid to rebel against the narrow-mindedness of his time, making himself a leader as one of the very first poets to ever use &quot;free verse,&quot; a technique rellious on its own. In doing so, this great leader was criticized and looked on disapprovingly for his work during much of his life time, and like many other artists who dare to be unique, his true genius was never fully recognized until after his death. As a historian and as an American, Whitman has taken these works of his and has combined them into the nations most patriotic yet brutally honest text book.It is in writing of himself and his own personal experiences that Whitman imbeds the history of this country, both dark and nationalistic. Through his time working as a volunteer nurse to the wounded and dying soldiers during the Civil War, Whitman writes often of the terror of war, making it one of his most recognizable themes throughout much of his work. He also brings us back to a time in history in which those who believed in equal rights for all, including persons of every race a gender, was considered rebellious; for in such beliefs, Whitman took religions that placed severe restrictions over such things as sexuality, and attacked them. The reason I am so confident in recommending this book to any reader, is that you are given a selection of editions to choose from; the edition you choose for yourself, fitted to your familiarity with the poet. I cannot promise that will fall absolutely in love with this book, every person has their own tastes, however, I can promise that if nothing else, you will walk away from this book with appreciation and understanding the value in reading it."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass is an exemplary representation of both transcendentalism and realism. Walt Whitman was one of the few writers to bridge the gap between these literary movements and Leaves of Grass was, in essence, his opus. It represented the author himself and was often condemned in Whitman's time for it's blatant descriptions and incorporations of sexuality and homosexuality. However, years later it came to be appreciated for what it is truly worth as an exquisite culmination of people, emotions, and the democratic spirit.Of the many themes covered throughout the 438 pages in the ninth edition of Whitman's masterpiece, symbolism was often used to represent allegory ideas and situations. In \\"O Captain! My Captain!\\" the captain symbolizes Abraham Lincoln and America is ship. In the captain's death, Whitman is alluding to the fact that in the absence of strong leadership guiding the \\"ship,\\" there will be a lack of order and chaos. \\"Song of Myself\\" was, on the other hand, explicit in the ideal it depicted. All fifty-two sections discuss intricacies of semi-specific people or types of people; they come together as one poem and are all part of something larger. Whitman believed not only in the individual being but also in a larger being that everyone and everything was a part of, in other words the oversoul. \\"Song of Myself\\" is truly filler in the gap between the literary movements because it is so thoroughly transcendental in meaning, yet so precise in describing reality.Emerson's was completely justified in praising Walt Whitman's work because it is still today very profound and extremely important in respect American literature overall. Unfortunately a fairly high mentality is required to take in his poetry for all its meaning and worth. Maturity and openness is key because often criticism of Leaves of Grass spurns from prudish and thoroughly conservative readers."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"Since there was some confusion in the comments section as to what volumes were or were not truly the \\"First Edition,\\" I though I'd confirm that the Penguin Classics version entitled \\"Leaves of Grass: The First (1855) Edition\\" is in fact the first, slim, volume of \\"Leaves of Grass\\" published in 1855. This version has Malcom Crowley's introduction, followed by the frontispiece, title page, Whitman's introduction, and then 12 poems. The poems cover 120 pages, making this a slim, compact volume.

And, yes dear, bikers can read."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"Leaves of Grass is a classic collection of inspired poetry by one of the most foreword poets of his time. The poetry speaks of Walt Whitman's connection to his fellow man, nature, and to God. It is not to be missed.Leaves of Grass speaks to the turbulent times in which Whitman lived, being the Civil War era. He speaks out against the horror of war and he embraces the spirit of compassion for his comrades. Yet the book is also a reflection on matters relating largely to uplifting themes. His poetry has evoked thoughts about what is of value within my life. Even though it is the product of another era, it speaks to the timeless values of humankind.As the author of a spiritually-themed novel entitled \\"The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude,\\" I look for books that provide food for my soul. This is one that certainly hit home for me. It is also a book written by a gay man. Since I am gay myself, I appreciated the affirming nature of Whitman who embraced his sexuality with little judgment. This was a remarkable example which reflected his inner peace during a time when being a homosexual was not accepted.Whether or not you are a man, woman, gay, or otherwise, this book will speak to you. It will help you to embrace humanity, your spirit, and all of creationDavis Aujourd'hui, author of \\"The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude\\""},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"One of the greatest pieces of work from the Heritage Press and, arguably, one of the more important reprints of the 20th century.The famous pairing of Rockwell Kent illustrations with Walt Whitman's poetry was first released by Heritage in 1937.

But Walt Whitman was and still is one of the most influential poets I have ever read. He began life on a farm on Long Island, but times got bad and his family uprooted itself and moved to Brooklyn. Brooklyn at that time was a growing city unto itself and trades were needed. Thus Whitman learned the trade of printer. But his soul led him to a higher calling. He became a jounrnalist and wrote poetry. His early efforts did not amount to anything major. Yet sometimes the unimaginable happens in a man's life. A sudden thrust of inspiration strikes one like a bolt of lightning. Then something new and unique is born out of this inception - a new form of poetry - what is today referred to as free verse. Yes, Whitman is the father of the form, and perhaps one of its greatest practitioners. The beat poets who were to follow in his footsteps never really rose to his great height of mystic revelation. I think that's what the other reviewers are talking about when they refer to Whitman's religiosity. For Whitman was the poet of a new world, a new nation, a growing entity that would go on to fulfill an old dream of mankind. That is, the dream of a thoroughly new man, a man who was free from the past, a man who could find his soul was one with the fathomless cosmos. Hence, &quot;Walt Whitman, a cosmos&quot; is a very telling way Whitman has of describing himself to his reader.My favorite poem by Walt Whitman is his &quot;Song of Myself.&quot; It contains the seed of everything he had lived as a human being and every vision he would realize as a mystic of epic proportions. After that, I believe his next great poem was &quot;I Sing The Body Electric.&quot; &quot;Drum Taps&quot; was also quite an interesting addition to &quot;Leaves of Grass.&quot; Also, &quot;When Lilacs Last In The Dooryard Bloomed&quot; is Whitman at his poetic best.So it is without any reservation that I am highly recommending &quot;Leaves Of Grass&quot; to all and sundry as a must read. Especially now, in the wake of 9/11 we need to reaffirm what it means to be American, and I know of no better American Visionary to help in this cause then Walt Whitman."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"I love poetry and Walt Whitman is one of my all time favorites. This volume is chock full of his poems, so grab a cup of coffee, curl up in the armchair, and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"Whitman wrote as if to me personally. He picked me out as someone many years hence from his perspective, in order to share his world in sufficient detail for me to insert myself into his skin. Through what he put down he came forward more than a hundred years. He is sauntering, noticing the sounds, sights, smells, how he lit up with joy, bittersweetness, fear, self doubt and at times loneliness. He carried me along the river bank at any pace I wanted to go. He would not miss a stride as he adapted to my pace. He taught me how to recline in the summer grass in the cemetery not much more than a stone's throw from where I live, and meditate on his leaf of green summer grass, inviting my soul to enter our picture. I am writing this as a message, an invitation for you, my reader, to get to know Walt Whitman. Don't join the crowd of hate and be put off by the fact that he was gay.I am learning much about making healthy connections, being myself one of the dots I am connecting. I do a little Lazarus raising activity in the cemetery two or three times a week, as I bring back to life my parents, my mother's parents, and her mother's mothers parents. They are in my mind, what I remember and imagine of them, increasingly clearly. There is so much more good will, mutual respect and intimacy aware to me now. I even have group therapy with them.I learned a lot about how to do this from carrying on with Walt Whitman!"},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"More as a point of clarification than review: the Oxford World's Classics edition is not the 1855 edition.

I don't really enjoy his poetry that much. I value it as important. This specific edition (ISBN: 0140421998) is a recreation of the very first edition of Leaves of Grass. Over the years Whitman added poems and changed some of these so you'd be reading the first draft of some things, so to speak. This is the best edition, in my opinion. It shows Whitman at his freshest and I think he second-guessed himself too much with some of the revisions.

And he is the one who too speaks of it at the moment of its great outward expansion and hope, as a historical progress of ever rising ever more sweepingly inclusive cosmic concentrical circles.

It is, alongside the poems of Hart Crane, Rimbaud, Lautreamont, Blake, Lawrence, Emily Dickinson and St John Perse, a totally singular experience. I have never read anything like \\"Song Of Myself\\" and \\"The Sleepers\\", and I am certain that you will love them just as much.I do, however, have certain reservations about Malcolm Cowley's introduction. It is well-intentioned enough, but I would like to issue a few words of warning, as it is certainly a very confused affair, one that will no doubt perplex many Whitman neophytes. For Cowley, the task of Whitman interpretation couldn't be simpler, one need only look towards Indian Vedic philosophy and Buddhist scripture for an all-purpose key. While this certainly seems attractive and convenient- a lazy expedient for phlegmatic types- Cowley himself realizes that it is totally incongruous with certain aspects of Whitman:\\"Most of Whitman's doctrines, though by no means all of them, belong to the mainstream of Indian philosophy. In some respects he went against the stream. Unlike most of the Indian sages, for example, he was not a thoroughgoing idealist. He did not believe that the whole world of the senses, of desires, of birth and death, was only maya, illusion, nor did he hold that it was a sort of purgatory; instead he praised the world as real and joyful. He did not despise the body, but proclaimed that it was as miraculous as the soul.\\"Having meandered into a cul-de-sac, Cowley's attempt at escape is characteristically sloppy:\\"...it must be remembered that Indian philosophy or theology is not such a unified structure as it appears to us from a distance. Whitman might have found Indian sages or gurus and even whole sects that agreed with one or another of his heterodoxies (perhaps excepting his belief in material progress). One is tempted to say that instead of being a Christian heretic, he was an Indian rebel and sectarian. Sometimes he seems to be a Mahayana Buddhist...\\"Pedants are like spiders- they love cocooning themselves in their own contradictions. All of the difficulties that Cowley encounters here stem from his insufferable compulsion to categorise, and hence domesticate, Whitman. I take issue with this preposterous statement:\\"One is tempted to say...\\"No, Mr Cowley, YOU are tempted to make these conclusions, any sober reader is willing to meet Whitman on his own terms, to delight in his incomparable vigor. Further on, we find the following:\\"Since the Indian mystical philosophies are elaborate structures, based on conceptions that have been shaped and defined by centuries of discussion, they help to explain Whitman's ideas at points in the first edition whre he seems at first glance to be vague or self-contradictory. There is, for example, his UNUSUAL combination of realism- sometimes brutal realism- and serene optimism.\\"Unusual, perhaps, if you insist on translating the poem into Vedic terms. It is a little depressing that scholars are so blind to the revelatory miracles of Leaves Of Grass. Here was a poet attempting to forge new forms of expression commensurate to his time, a capacious, all-enveloping style that would sing the songs of democracy. To thank him for his troubles, scholars do the only thing they are capable of, dragging Whitman into the malodorous mire of comparison. This line is redolent of Plato, this one reeks of Vimalakirti, this shadowy section can be illuminated with the torch of the Gita, all of it is regurgitated thought, relics coated in new varnish.What makes matters worse is Cowley's admission that Whitman had read none of the cited works in 1852. Yet, the empirical evidence admits no contestation- the symptoms of Whitman's mystical paroxysm are largely identical with prior examples. \\"Leaves Of Grass\\", we are told, is another manifestation of the 'perennial philosophy'- for all of its ornate embellishments and flourishes, it is, in fact, not very revolutionary at all. Once you master the rudiments of said philosophy, the swelling surge of Whitman's writing is easily navigable. Here we see Cowley defeated by his own epistemological suppositions. Cowley's method, after all, is that of a good Platonist. Poetry, for him, marks a poet's gradual emergence from anamnesia, a rapturous remembrance of eternal truths.In actuality, the introduction is not really about \\"Leaves Of Grass\\" at all. It is about the scholar's will to power, his inexorable urge to subordinate every literary text to precedent. In reducing \\"Song Of Myself\\" to yet another incarnation of Hindu absorption, Cowley does a severe injustice to a great American poem. He would have us believe that \\"Song Of Myself\\" is little better than a journal entry in verse, a haphazard approximation of a subjective mystical experience that has been repeated throughout history. To further substantiate his claim, Cowley compares a stanza in \\"Leaves Of Grass\\" to a Vedic text, noting their thematic and stylistic similarities. Does this not consolidate Whitman's unflinching faith in metempsychosis? In \\"Song Of Myself\\", Whitman effects the transmigration of souls, channelling the voice of the Vedas. The complacence and self-contentment of Cowley is, for this reader at least, truly vulgar.I am not disputing the notion that Whitman has a consistent doctrine beneath all of his creative output, but the system must be sought WITHIN his texts and NOT without. This is the thought that courses throughout all of Whitman's writing, that of pure immanence. To those approaching Whitman for the first time, I hope you have the good sense to treat Cowley's introduction with the bemusement that it deserves."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"One of the greatest pieces of work from the Heritage Press and, arguably, one of the more important reprints of the 20th century.The famous pairing of Rockwell Kent illustrations with Walt Whitman's poetry was first released by Heritage in 1937. Long regarded as a publishing success, this book was reprinted several times.Cloth binding over hardback boards with a sewn binding in green slipcase. Heritage followed the design preferences of Kent who chose a grass-green linen binding stamped with gold. (The grass emblem also serves as the initials WW.) Typography was executed by William A. Kittredge who collaborated with the illustrator on all aspects of the book's design.The lore surrounding the book states that Kent was so excited about the prospect of illustrating Whitman that he produced 120 pen-and-ink drawings in black and white, 50 more than his contract required. Kent designed the elegant and trippy frontispiece illustration as well as the title page of the book - which includes a monogrammatic device containing four great dates in American history.With the 1855 Preface and an Alphabetical Title Index."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"Walt Whitman is probably the greatest American poet of all time, criticised for his differences he was only recognised much later on, more appreciated in Europe than in his own country.

It has no searchable table of contents or index and I very much needed that. If all you want is to read it from 0% to 100% completion and not skip around, as I need to do, then spend your $.99. I returned mine and for another $2.00 bought the Floating Wolf Quarterly edition which is perfect for an ebook and I give FIVE stars.One other note to the publishers and to Amazon. One buys a book for two reasons. One is for the content, the story or facts that it contains and for that it could be handwritten on construction paper or kleenex. But the second reason is feel, ease of use, convenience and a certain unsayable aesthetic quality. These ebook editions lack severely in the aesthetic area but are wonderful in the convenience category. So, I wish the publishers would spend a little more time perfecting the convenience areas, even in the 99 cent versions. For many these books are what people begin with when they purchase a new e-reader and can lead to bigger sales later. You guys are missing the boat by more than just a few minutes here."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"While I love Whitman's \\"Leaves of Grass,\\" I wouldn't quite consider this a reproduction of the \\"original\\" edition. The editor has highlighted certain passages in green, and added commentary and exercises at the end of each poem. I suspect lots of folks won't mind this. For me it's cause enough to return the book.I pre-ordered this item because I was intent on finding an edition with the 1855 preface, but without some new person's additions to the classic work. I very much would like to read the work as Whitman presented it, without interjections from an editor or some other new person whose voice for me is an interruption.This editor presents this work as a means for writers to find inspiration for their own work, and attempts to guide or at least aid the reader in that project. For someone like me, for whom writing (and reading) is intensely personal, and who prefers to work directly with the text, without intervention, this is just not the right book."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"Walt Whitman is one of the most famous, widely read, and influential poets - one of the few who can truly be said to have revolutionized poetry. Free verse's true originator, he broke free of formal shackles way back in 1855, nearly three quarters of a century before it became standard. He proved that great poetry could be written without traditional trappings - and it has never been the same. Many, including me, think it has gone too far in the other direction, but this is not Whitman's fault; his work is undeniably great, and we have in many was long since suffered weak imitations. There is simply no equaling him, much less replacing him; his work is as essential a part of American literature as Mark Twain's. He is indeed the Twain of verse, to be anachronistic - as monumental, all-important, and epoch-forming as Twain was in prose. Technicalities aside, this had almost as much to do with subject matter; Whitman famously self-proclaimed \\"America has a bard at last!\\" - and so it did. He freed American poetry from European heritage, making truly national art that both defined its era and instantly became timeless, speaking to the heart of all that America and Americans stood and stand for. The great poet of democracy, he preached the gospel of westward expansion, celebrated America's natural beauty, extolled its unique history and exciting new status, championed its values, chronicled the Civil War, dramatized the struggle over slavery and other national debates, and generally held forth about the country's unmatched cosmopolitanism in all areas from ethnicity to landscapes. He also somehow managed to write about sexuality with unprecedented openness and vigor, striking a blow against Victorian prudery that would eventually prove fatal and even laying the foundations for non-heterosexual identity. Accomplishing even one of these deeds would have been truly remarkable; Whitman did them all.Yet he published only one poetry book - 1855's Leaves of Grass, which went through several updates through his 1892 death. He not only continuously added poems but extensively revised older ones, sometimes dropping some and moving others. For example, the original and final versions of his masterpiece Song of Myself are substantially different. Many key poems were there from the start, but some of the most famous and best - including the Civil War and associated Abraham Lincoln ones - came later. None of the many poems added late in life were nearly on par with prior masterpieces, but nearly all were worthwhile. Whitman wanted the 1892 edition to supersede the rest, and editors have nearly always complied; it is by far the most popular and widely available and the one that nearly all readers will want.And what a version it is! - hundreds of poems plus several prose prefaces and a prose afterword over nearly five hundred pages. To have so much greatness in one book - especially from one person - is near-unbelievable; the depth of Whitman's achievement simply staggers. Nearly all the poems are worthy, and many are great; quite a few are pure masterpieces. Included are some of the all-time great poems like \\"Song of Myself,\\" \\"I Sing the Body Electric,\\" \\"Crossing Brooklyn Ferry,\\" \\"Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking,\\" \\"When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd,\\" \\"By Blue Ontario's Shore,\\" and \\"Passage to India,\\" plus many superb short poems. Anyone even remotely interested in poetry must be familiar with these; there have always been some for whom Whitman just does not click, but even they must be prepared to deal with him, so great is his influence.Great as the 1892 Edition is, it is possible for both hard-cores and casuals to complain. Many of the latter will say that it is simply too imposing - too many poems, too many pages. I certainly would not advise anyone who has read very little or no Whitman to jump right in; it is definitely a lot to take in at once, and the poems are by no means of equal quality or importance. One would be far better off reading a selected edition first, but everyone should come here eventually; indeed, nearly all will want to after the first tantalizing taste. Conversely, diehards have always complained about various aspects, from poems it leaves out to various changes made to included ones. The most important omission in my view is Whitman's original prose introduction, which served as his poetic manifesto. The dedicated will of course want to seek out this and every version of every poem, but their complaints are of interest to very few. The 1892 Edition will satisfy nearly everyone.This is not the most deluxe version; one can find various critical editions with extensive commentary, notes, etc. as well as variorum versions. However, this is one of the most widely available and is very affordable. Taking this into account, it has fairly generous supplemental material: a good basic Introduction, a short glossary and bibliography, and an index of titles and first lines with original and final publication dates. This is the ideal Leaves of Grass for most, but everyone should have it in some form. It is one of very few books truly essential for all. Even those who do not like poetry may well like Whitman, and anyone even remotely interested in American literature, history, or culture must be acquainted Leaves, so thoroughly has it penetrated popular culture and entered the American consciousness. Bookshelves missing this might almost as well be empty."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"Choosing the fullest, most complete version of Whitman's text, before the final editing of the deathbed edition, but following the additions made after the Civil War, the Norton Critical is a must have for students of poetry, or literature, and of nature.

It is a beautiful celebration of the passions in life, awakening and tantilizing the reader as no other book of poetry has ever done (for me). I look forward to passing this beautiful book and its passion for life on to my children."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"Whitman's &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; is a collection of some of the finest American free-verse poetry ever written. Outward from his home on Brooklyn, Whitman soars out over our great nation, painting a sweeping portrait of mid-nineteenth century America and its diverse inhabitants. Whitman covers a panorama of ideas and themes, from lofty, aloof musings on the nature of man, to piercing depictions of the horrors of war. Gems of wisdom hang from Whitman's web of of verse like dew drops - easy to see but hard to grasp. This is a powerful work, and a never-ending source of beauty. Unfortunately for me, I am not a big fan of free verse, making this work harder for me to enjoy than I had hoped.Which edition do I recommend? That really depends on what you are looking for. If you are just interested in getting a taste of Whitman, I would recommend some of the abridged versions. I don't feel that reading all 700+ pages of Whitman's poetry is necessary for anyone but his biggest fans and students. For a complete version, I found the Modern Library edition acceptable, but nothing spectacular. This work has a multitude of editions, and I would recommend actually holding them in your hand before making a decision on which best suits your needs."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"Although the poems are beautiful... and I certainly don't mean to bash Whitman with this 2-star rating... it's the wrong book. NOT AS ADVERTISED. This was supposed to be the original 1855 edition. That's what I expected, and therefore (in my mind) what I was paying for. The original 1855 edition, according to modern literary analysis, was the \\"strongest/purest\\" version. It was the true starting point of Whitman's own (and consequently America's) poetic awakening. Consisting of just 12 \\"perfect\\" poems, it was THAT edition which Emerson praised so highly.Whitman never put out another book... just revision after revision, addition after addition, and edition after edition of Leaves Of Grass... until you wind up with \\"the deathbed edition\\" which is a severely bloated and different work from the original.I was very much looking forward to a slender volume of the original edition. Which is what the item description says this is. It's not. Be forewarned... it's the Deathbed Edition of 1892... nearly 500 pages. And frankly, there are MUCH better versions of the deathbed edition. Sturdier versions with nicer pages exist (this is a pretty weak paperback, printed on pulp pages), with better footnotes and more authoritive introductions. Shop around.To sum up... the 2 star rating is because lying about which edition this is, is a terrible way to sell the book. Whitman was fantastic and the poetry contained in the book itself is first rate. It just would have been nice to get what I paid for. The \\"true\\" editon, written by a YOUNG Whitman at the height of his powers..."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"Words cannot describe the complexity of Leaves of Grass. I am constantly amazed at how well Walt Whitman holds it all together, keeping is hand on one object while amorously praising another. Everything works in perfect cohesion...An unabashed love of self, of nature, of all that is divine and not divine. Leaves of Grass is a truly inspired work...its words are boundless and fluent, rising in an intoxicating crescendo of naked emotion. \\"I am the poet of the Body; and I am the poet of the Soul.&quot; Throughout Leaves of Grass there is an overwhelming theme of unity...unity of man and nature, of man and man, of man and God. Excitable sputterings of ageless wisdom become scattered, but somehow stay anchored to the intricate framework of the book. This sounds contradicting, and it is reminiscent of a line from the book --&quot;Do I contradict myself? Very well, then, I contradict myself; (I am large-I contain multitudes.) After reading this book, you will delight in how large Walt Whitman is."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"It's difficult to think of something appropriate to say about a man who spent his life trying to express the panorama of humanity through the lense of his own heart. From a drop of blood to the grandeur of a shipyard or a continent, he takes all readers on a journey wild with raving, raging, sorrow, longing, humbleness and pride. At once he is totally modern and yet rife with history.For readers new to poetry, Walt Whitman is wonderfully accessible. One can pick up Leaves of Grass and virtually start and stop anywhere and pick up something wonderful every time.Not to be missed."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"The original edition of 'Leaves of Grass' published in 1855 contained twelve poems only. The subsequent editions beginning in 1856 were to greatly expand the work. Thus I would recommed that anyone who wishes to know the true range of Whitman's work find another selection of his work of which there is a larger share of his great work.Whitman is the poet who Emerson prophesied, the American visionary poet who sang of the complex greatness of the society, and connected his own soul with its expansive facts of life."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"The 1855 edition of Leaves of Grass was the first and the best.When I was young I bought the big deathbed edition, not knowing about the 1855 one. I became a Whitman disciple. Either version is a good place to start, but the 1855 is the best version of the early poems and a fine introduction to W.W.The 1855 version was ignored for quite a long time in Whitman studies, but started recieving critical attention after Malcolm Cowley worked to revive it in the 1950's. It was his version that used to be available, until recently, as a Penguin Classic.So whats the difference between 1855 and the Deathbed one?Throughout his lifetime, Whitman not only expanded LOG, his only book, with gobs of inferior-- and sometimes truly awful-- poems (especially when he was older) but he also revised many of his early poems for later editions-- revising them almost always for the worse.The 1855 edition is realtively short and reflects the diminutive, obscure quality of the original. The poems are full of Whitman's original fire before he tinkered with them.Bloom, the author of the introduction, is in the estimation of many America's best living literary critic. He profoundly knows and adores Walt Whitman.If you have the slightest interest in reading American Poetry,drop whatever you are reading (unless it is perhaps Dickinson or Emerson) and get this book. It's still America's best. Nothing since has been (and nothing will ever be) better. The only American poets after Whitman who mattered were deep readers of LOG: Hart Crane, Wallace Stevens, TS Eliot, John Ashbury. (A Ginsberg, C. Sandberg, and O. Paz resemble him superficially but they are are wonks.)If you are interested later in getting all of Whitman's poems, skip all the in-between editions and get the 'Deathbed' Version, which has many good and important poems like 'When Lilacs Last in The Dooryard Bloomed' and 'As I Ebbed with the Ocean of Life'-- as well as many bad ones, to go with your 1855.The Deathbed Version (Whitman approved it as the final Version of his one book as he lay dying) is probably close to ten times as long as the 1855 edition.But Whitman got it right in 1855."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:A,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},W={class:"card-container"},C=["disabled"],x={key:0},L={key:1};function D(s,o,n,u,r,i){const c=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",W,[(e(!0),t(g,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),w(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",L,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",x,"See more"))],8,C)):p("",!0)])}const P=d(B,[["render",D],["__scopeId","data-v-15f83712"]]),q=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/15.md","filePath":"guide/15.md"}'),G={name:"guide/15.md"},j=Object.assign(G,{setup(s){return(o,n)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(P)]))}});export{q as __pageData,j as default};
