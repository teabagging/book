I was the only one who ready these books and i believe they are my inspiration for the reader that i am today after over 50 years. The stories from both The Story Hour and Parade of Stories are fabulous (I know them all my heart and can recite to my kids and grandkids all the time). I credit these books for not only my love of reading, but for the fact that I starting reading these all by myself within a year (I asked anyone and everyone to read these to me). Over the years and moving, I lost the Story Hour but still have the original Parade of Stories. I also still use the matching \\"things to make and do\\" and have done the projects myself as a kid and then with my own kds and grandkids. there are all levels of activities and so easy to modify so you can use what you have. A simple paperplate turns into a magic table cleaner, and an empty oatmeal box is loads of fun.

While it's primarily intended as a resource for the Dark Empire roleplaying game, non-gamers will get just as much satisfaction out of the fascinating in-depth information.

You won't regret it!"},{"Title":"Beyond the Deepwoods (Edge Chronicles)","review":"I happened across a copy of 'beyond the deepwoods' in my local libaray while browsing the shelves of teenage fiction for something that wasnt about boys, spots or the &quot;mysterious case of the missing lipstick&quot;....basically anything not based on shallow rubbish. The cover caught my eye because I noticed it was, well a pretty good drawing. On reading the back of the book it informed me of the fact that the book was about Twig, who lived with woodtrolls in a place called the deepwoods...so far so good, not a puberty related subject in sight. On the negative side it seemed a little young for me and unfortunately had the caption &quot;for those who have read harry potter and want a new world to explore&quot;. However I got it out and began reading and upon finishing decided the caption should be &quot;for those who realise that Harry Potter is an overated pile of horse poo and want to read something thats actually good&quot;. Hehe. I am using Harry potter for my comparison because a) it seems that the book is being compared to the HP series by critics and b) because I did read some harry potter and thought...yeah its okay, then a movie came out...then another movie...and I have now decided...wow harry potter is an abomination to the film industry and dare I say in hindsight (now at 16) an insult to the edge chronicles. Unlike HP which places a &quot;new world inside a world&quot; (ooo muggles and wizards in london how fabulous) the edge chronicles is completely different. It takes place in an entirely made up place. The Edge, if your interested, where many, many, many, many creatures exist. The tone of the book is darker, edgier and not at all insulting to a readers intelligence. Instead of cliched one dimensional characters who run about with wands and say &quot;Hey im late for potions class gosh darnit&quot; you have Twig a character who doesnt annoy the hell out of you and actually does things that are interesting. Adopted by a family of woodtrolls twig realises it is time for him to stray from the woodtroll path and seek his destiny (dundundun) beyond the deepwoods....His journey is riddled with challenges, dangers and the plot twists and turns as paul stewarts imaginative world springs to life. Instead of brooms(yawn)we have sky pirate ships(wayhay) as opposed to teachers (boo) we have slaughters, banderbears, waifs, woodtrolls (i wont go on and spoil the rest I think you get the idea). READ THIS and free yourself from the shackles of trashy fantasy. I mean what did Harry really do? oooo he was a baby and a wizard with bad aim gave him a scar then he goes on to encounter this wizard in every single damn book...yeah...thats well done. Give this series a try, it doesnt stop at this book as their are two other books with twig and a few more concerning other characters which were also extremely well done. Im DETERMINED to stop people (of all ages) conforming to the harry potter fan club and giving those damn books more profit! (Can subliminal advertising be executed through text?) Maybe The edge chronicles wont make millions of pounds in the cinema and you wont walk into warner brothers to find overpriced stuffed owls and plastic wands but Twig would kill Harry Potter in a fight any day of the week (without a flaming wand)."},{"Title":"The Extermination of the American Bison","review":"Beware -- this Smithsonian reprint does not contain a copy of Hornaday's famous map, even although it is referred to in the text."},{"Title":"The Extermination of the American Bison","review":"A word of warning -- this reprint does not come with a copy of Hornady's famous map -- so you're out of luck on that score.

If you have read and enjoyed Mark Twain, H.H. Hooper, George Washington Harris, and other early American humorists, you will find a kindred spirit in these stories. American frontier humor is sometimes characterized by tall tales, exaggerations, and outlandish lies - not unlike some of the Paul Bunyan tales that many people still enjoy. Each story is accompanied by a fine pen and ink illustration by Tom Elisii. Readers who are also interested in American history, historical reenactments, the fur trade, rendezvous, and muzzleloading shooting will find a natural attraction to this book."},{"Title":"The Hair of the Bear: Campfire Yarns and Short Stories","review":"I thought this book was going to have stories that people could easily remember and tell at a campfire.

Sorry."},{"Title":"Spring Into HTML and CSS","review":"\\"Spring Into HTML and CSS\\" is another in the series of quick primers from Pearson Education, Inc. about contemporary technologies, designed for non-professional website designers and developers. The author is described as one the \\"top 25 most influential women on the Internet\\", having 30 books to her credit as well as being an influential thinker.What is called \\"HTML\\" here really means \\"XHTML\\" and this book is one of a number currently promoting standards-compliant web design using XHTML and CSS. Like the others in this series, this book is written for quick reading of short 1-2 page \\"chunks\\" detailing one of a large handful of topics related to contemporary webpage design promoting adherence to the World Wide Web Consortium standards and will have its most value for less-technically experienced web designers..Ms. Holzschlag starts right from the top - describing the logical construction of a web page using the now-required \\"Document Data-Type\\" header and proceeding through the usual Head section to other page objects. These objects include text paragraphs, links, images, media, and tables which are styled with CSS. Basic CSS concepts are explained and examples of styling include styling text and tables, forms, layouts, positioning and more.Nearly every page contains sidebars of related items, illustrations, or code examples. Strangely, some of the examples involve color settings for backgrounds, lines and text but the illustrations are all gray-scale color. No matter, as the examples are simple and clear enough. There is appropriate note of browser-compatibility issues and how to work around them.The 13 chapters are supplemented by long, comprehensive annotated references of XHTML 1.0 and CSS 2.1, containing over 70 pages all together. Downloadable code examples are available at (...).This is a light introduction to the subject matter with fast-paced writing and is well-populated with examples."},{"Title":"Spring Into HTML and CSS","review":"More of a commercial operation than an attempt to bring out a good introductory text on HTML and CSS authoring, this text is very concise, direct and no fluff, but also dry and lacking in through explanations and examples. One of the most interesting application of CSS, layout management without tables, is relegated to the last chapter and receives just a cursory treatment. Also be warned that half of the book is dedicated to basic HTML tags which you should really be already familiar with unless you have lived in a cave for the last 10 years. Don't buy this book if you are interested in design. It is not a bad book after all, if you are totally new to the subject and looking for an easy and direct introduction just to get your feet wet, but from an author of the caliber and reputation of Molly Holzschlag I was expecting something more inspired and inspiring. My advice is stay clear form this book and use freely available web tutorials if you really need some material now, and wait till \\"CSS Hands-On Training\\" by Eric A. Meyer comes out. That should be the right book to give you decent training and inspiration on CSS."},{"Title":"Spring Into HTML and CSS","review":"I was a reviewer of this book, and though I've worked with HTML for 10 years, I still learned some tidbits here (tabindex would be one example). In a sea of HTML/CSS books, this would be a good pick as an intro, or a refresher/reference.The thing that I enjoyed most about the book was Molly's writing style. It gets the points across, without bogging down into complete geekdom. An HTML/CSS book can be complete, informative, and not dry. I like the honesty that comes across (\\"The use of tables for layout is the biggest hack in HTML history\\").The book is divided into two sections, which I think of as \\"structure\\" (HTML) and \\"presentation\\" (CSS). This allows Molly to lay a good foundation of how to get basic elements on the page, and then to turn attention to styling them.There are tons of examples (the HTML/CSS, and the output). They'll take you from basic paragraphs and links, to styling, boxes, and z-orders (depth).SIHaC is careful to maintain focus. Molly does not wander off into JavaScript or this or that plugin. The book does a great job addressing its core audience."},{"Title":"Spring Into HTML and CSS","review":"While there are many much thicker books on HTML and CSS on the market there is very little in them that is not in this book. There is very little extra wording here but instead the authors take a direct approach to the subject. Each item is described in a fully understandable way with examples and an easy reading style. The book also serves as a basic reference on XHTML. If you want to understand how to write, edit, or understand a web page you can easily do so with this book. If you want to know how to do something in particular it is explained in a couple of pages and you can write it immediately, not 20 pages of fluff. Spring Into HTML and CSS is highly recommended as one of the fastest and easiest ways to get up to speed in HTML and CSS."},{"Title":"Spring Into HTML and CSS","review":"Wether or not you find this book useful really depends on who you are. If you are absolutely new to HTML, and maybe even to computers, you are better off elsewhere. This is not so much because the authors assume you have mastered a lot of things already, but rather because they assume you have a certain number of reflexes and thinking habits which make things intuitive for people used to working with computers, but take a little explaining to newcomers.If you know a bit about HTML already though, not much, mind you, just what a body and head are, for instance, then you will appreciate the lean, no-nonsense approach of this book. It goes straight to the point, in a clear, and convincing manner without preaching or beating around the bush."},{"Title":"Spring Into HTML and CSS","review":"This will be a relatively short review, not because of lack of interest but because there are a number of HTML and CSS books out there, and most HTML/CSS books cover the same amount of information for the most part. Spring into HTML and CSS is no different in this respect, but it does have some differences to it that might give it more of an edge over other HTML/CSS books. The presentation is what seems to be the differentiating factor between this book and other, similar books.HTML is covered first before jumping into CSS. All of the basic elements are covered one by one with a number of examples and options for each. The book also has a number of screen shots to show the results of almost all of the given examples. So, in that way the book is very much like most other HTML/CSS books.The difference is that although this book covers the basics, it assumes that the reader is not a total novice and at least has a technical proficiency that is higher than most. This explains the sub-title of The Smart Professional's Choice.Indeed, the subject matter is very easy to read but presented in a way that avoids a lot of the cute, end-user analogies and metaphors that exist in many other HTML/CSS beginner books. The topics are concise, to-the-point, and are presented in a formal yet easily understandable manner. They're also presented in a way that does not allow much room for the misunderstandings or confusion that true newbies would likely have, thus further stressing that this book is meant for those with a higher level of technical understanding.That's not to say that this book cannot be used by those who have no HTML or CSS experience; however, the presentation is very direct and matter-of-fact whereas other books, such as those in the For Dummies series, are presented in a way that sometimes stresses simplicity and fun over direct information. People who are familiar with both the For Dummies series and books that are meant more for professionals understand what I mean. Unfortunately, it's difficult to articulate this difference if you have not experienced the style differences for yourself.The biggest difference between this book and most other HTML/CSS starter books is the inclusion of XHTML 1.0 and CSS reference sections in the back of the book. These sections contain 71 pages of examples, descriptions, and usages for each of the various tags and elements. These appendices are a great addition for professionals or those who are more technologically adept because this is the kind of material that we look for. Sure, we can always go through the index and look for the chapter that describes the goal that we're trying to reach. But most IT professionals prefer the concise nature of reference appendices. We know the command or function but perhaps not all of the options that are available. We want to zero in directly on that command or function without having to search through the entire book. (Can you say man pages?) The 71 pages of XHTML and CSS appendices are a welcome change and definitely have the appeal to professionals that most other HTML/CSS just don't have.What this comes down to is that if you prefer HTML/CSS books that give you the information that you want in a direct manner with little or no fluff, this is the book that you want. If you are looking for a book that is more laid back with cute examples and anecdotes, you should look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Spring Into HTML and CSS","review":"This book is not bloated with theory...which is exactly why I like it. Yes I've been coding HTML for over 4 years, but it doesn't hurt that this book has a healthy (X)HTML section that I can turn to to remind myself of things that may have been forgotten. This book is a good technical reference manual that requires you to build your own examples. If you want beautiful color pictures of examples to accompany the mechanics of XHTML and CSS, I suggest you partner this book with any of Eric Meyer's publications. If I have one critism of the book, it's that it treats tableless lay out in a cursory fashion, but having a book by Meyer's should compensate for that. Final analysis: excellent learning source for beginners and a very good quick reference for pros."},{"Title":"Spring Into HTML and CSS","review":"This book teaches alot of outdated and deprecated methods of web design using HTML and CSS. It also does not explain anything more than simple text and picture modification. If you're looking for something to teach you more powerful usages of HTML and CSS, I recommend looking elsewhere."},{"Title":"Spring Into HTML and CSS","review":"I hadn't worked in CSS in several years and my skills were beyond rusty. The book doesn't give you any particularly advanced skills, but if you're looking for a refresher, you could do worse.I would imagine it would work well for most people new to this as well, but it's hard sometimes to know how much previous knowledge you're bringing with you."},{"Title":"Spring Into HTML and CSS","review":"I really like the way that the author puts all of the information together. She covers all of the basics very fast with really simple examples. The fact that she uses the same basic example though out the entire CSS set of chapters makes it possible to introduce a lot more concepts without having to show all of the html for every single page. I think that the writing style is perfect for a beginner.I have already used many of the things that I have learned in this book. She covers html forms but the book does not cover how to use the forms. I understand the reason that she could not cover how to use forms becuase this is a huge subject that is worthy of a book of its own.The book is filled with websites that have more information on various subjects. The web pages could be used to help increase your understanding on a subject.This book is an excellent starting point for learning html and CSS. It is not a win all book. If you are going to get this book I would also advise getting the book published by O'Reilly Dynamic HTML. I have not read the book Dynamic HTML but I have used it as a reference book and it fills in where the Spring into book leaves off.A few complaints. In one of the early chapters the author talks about HTML Character entities and says that there is a list of many of the common entities in the appendix of the book. I have searched the appendices of the book and was unable to find the list. I had to turn to the Dynamic HTML book to find it.I don't think this is a learn all, win all book but I think for me it was a huge help. The sections are short and well written. I will pick this book up if I want to remember how to do something really fast.I don't know if I would say it is a must read for aspiring web developers but I don't think it is a bad read. I give this a great recommendation on ease of reading and being really clear on the subjects that it does tackle. I don't think the book has very much depth. I don't think it should be discounted because of that. I just think the reader should be aware of this fact."},{"Title":"Spring Into HTML and CSS","review":"I am a first year student at Oklahoma State University and had been struggling with some of the CSS and web-design code. I found this book in my school;s bookstore and tried it. I immediately understood about 98% of it. the other 2%, I haven't leanred from my professor yet. The very helpful thing, was that they would show you a picture of a finished web page and instead of saying \\"try to make this\\" without much info like my other books, this one show's you the code. Every letter. My Site is developing phenominally because of a large part to this reference. The only reason it's not 5, is because I haven't learned some of the stuff in the back chapters yet."},{"Title":"Spring Into HTML and CSS","review":"I know HTML pretty well but CSS not at all. I figured I'd get this book to teach myself CSS and since it had HTML in the title I thought it would teach the integration of both to create websites.I still don't know much about CSS after reading this book. I know some new terms but I've no idea how to implement them, never mind create a website using CSS.The book does give you a general outline of what CSS can do but other than that it didn't suit my needs at all.Besides all that, I found the book poorly laid out and rather boring to read."},{"Title":"Spring Into HTML and CSS","review":"This book is perfect for my needs. I have a background in graphic design, and have created some web sites in Adobe GoLive. GoLive writes the code for you, so you don't need to know how to do it \\"by hand.\\" But now the newest version of GoLive is based on CSS, so although I had been dabbling in it, I need to learn a lot more. Plus, sometimes you need to look into the code to get something to work or to understand what is happening.GoLive itself does not include a manual, and the online help files are extremely lame. Many other books and online articles are either too basic (especially since GoLive writes the code it for you) or so technical that I can't grasp what they are talking about.This book falls right in the middle. It covers the basics of HTML, so I can understand what I am looking at in GoLive code, but does not go into a lot more detail than I have time for. Then it moves on to CSS, and how it is applied to the web page. Having worked my way through about 2/3 of the book, I finally feel like I am beginning to really grasp the basics of how it works, and this knowledge has greatly increased my ability to work with the new GoLive version.So who is this book for? Maybe not a total newbie, but for someone who knows enough to get by, but wants to learn more and really begin to get a solid grasp of the fundamentals. There must be many other graphic designers out there making the transition to the web. They probably understand the idea of styles, since that is how page layout software works, but are new to the coding part. While this book is not specifically addressed to that audience, I recommend it as a place for those people to start."},{"Title":"Spring Into HTML and CSS","review":"This booked helped me with a lot of my codes that I have been trying to find, but after that it seemed to be a dead end. It doesn't describe things as well as it could, but it's still understandable. There are some points, though, that I became completely lost in what I was supposed to do to alter the code to my liking, which makes it severely frustrating at times. I am currently looking through other books (mostly CSS, which I agree that this book needs more of) to better fit my needs, but I'll definitely keep this on hand because it seems to be a great reference for times that you need a code that you can't find anywhere else. ^-^"},{"Title":"Christina's Courage (Thoroughbred Series #27)","review":"I love the new books just as much as the old books!

I started this series when I was little,and even though I'm probably too old to read these books now, I still love to reread the older ones. (#1-about#20) Everything fell apart after Cindy and her generation disappeared. Christina would have been alright, if she had not been made the center of attention. Any good series writer knows that the reason to write a series is to follow the main characters through their lives. Sammy and Wonder's Pride were my favorite characters, along with Ashleigh and Wonder. Anybody who has read the whole series would know that Sammy would never leave Whitebrook, Pride, Shining, or the love of her life Tor! And what's in Ireland for her ANYWAYS!? Was it my imagination or did Ashleigh have a 2nd child? Ashleigh was the reason the series was started, you can't just get rid of the main characters. Get Joanna or stop altogether! The original plot has been lost and too many mistakes have been made. READERS: do not stop reading the originals so you'll never forget the real story! Ashleigh is only a mother now, she has no real feeling about other people or horses. Racing and the love of horses were the the backbone. Without them there is no series. The original characters are ( supposed to be) in their 20s &amp; 30s now, but so what. The kids of the 90s are not stupid! If this doesn't change, I'll never buy another Thoroughbred book again! Bring back Ashleigh, Mike, Sammantha, Tor, Mandy, Cindy, Heather, Max, Yvonna, Maureen, Clay Townsend, all their special horses, and EVEN Brad and Lavina. P.S.: Sorry this has happened to your series, Joanna!"},{"Title":"Christina's Courage (Thoroughbred Series #27)","review":"I don't know about anybody else but from what I have read it seems like everyone feels the same way I do about what has happened to the Thoroughbred series. I mean like where did Cindy go not to mention Samantha, max, glory, blues king,ashleigh's other baby,wonder,pride,princess,mr wonderful,champion,honor,glorys kids, fleet goddess, fleeting moment,fleet street. Cindy and glory were my favorite not to mention shining, wonder,goddess and champion. It's just like bang champion and racing and all of the main characters are wiped out of existance. And who realy wants to hear about jumping. I like jumping and will take lessons some day but racing is more exciting to read about. I seriously say that we should all make complaints to the author. I sure hope Mrs. Campbell will take control of her series again before nobody will read these books."},{"Title":"Christina's Courage (Thoroughbred Series #27)","review":"This series is dragging. It used to be like two books in the series would equal a whole summer. Now it's been like what#24,25,26,27,28,29 and the summer isn't even over yet!!! I wish these books would speed up (But not skip 10 years)."},{"Title":"Christina's Courage (Thoroughbred Series #27)","review":"This is so stupid!Christina is a selfish little brat!!What the heck happened to Ashleigh and Samantha's babies and Cindy and Friends. An author should read the series before they take it over!

At one point in time there was a girl named Samantha McLean, she had a sister named Cindy and too many friends to name including a fiance. Used to love this sieries it was so special to me. I read them faster than they were released and had to wait months to read the next one and I couldn't wait. I don't understand how the new auther could be so stupid as to just write books with no background at all. I think she should write for Saddleclub if she likes jumping so much. If thats what I wanted to read about i would buy other books! I think Christina's jumping deal could have turned out ok but that was in the Christmas miracle when she liked to race as well. PS. I wouldn't have given this a star at all but that wasn't a choice.I WANT TO AT LEAST KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL THOSE PEOPLE THAT I LOVED AND WHAT HAPPENED TO ASHLEIGH'S OTHER BABY!!!!!"},{"Title":"Christina's Courage (Thoroughbred Series #27)","review":"The Thoroughbred series is drowning.

What happened to Sammy, Tor, Cindy, Wonder, Fleet Goddess, Glory, Jazz Goddess, Champion, Mike, Max, or any of the old characters? I am dying to know. I must know! I've already read all of the other books by Joanna Campbell that were made in to &quot;Asheigh's favorite books!&quot; They were all really good, top quality books like the ones I expect from Ms. Campbell.

Where is Ashley, and Sammy,and Cindy, Max, and Wonder, and Fleet Street, Champion?? did they just all fade away??!! Hellooooo? PLEASE JOANNA COME BACK!!"},{"Title":"Christina's Courage (Thoroughbred Series #27)","review":"What is this? Is the world coming to an end? My favorite series that I always rushed to the bookstore to get, and could never wait to read, has gone completely down the tubes, through the sewer, and out to sea! The worst thing: Where the heck is Cindy? Not only did they stop writing books about her when she was only like 14 years old, but they also completly denied her whole existance! Did the new authors even read the other books in the series? The books were getting so good. Although Ashleigh and Wonder will always be the best in the series, Cindy had a much more realistic life than any of the other charecters, and all her stories were so good! It seemed like there was a possibility that she might actually go out with someone else before she married Max, and then POOF, she magically disappeares into the mists of whitebrook farm. Not that we ever hear about Whitebrook farm anymore, no, we hear about one horse, and one horse only, Sterling!!! And Christina never even rides him there, she rides him at Mona's! And what about the Townsends? People like that don't just go away. Now, instead, for the evil character in the story we have Cassidy Smith, the new rider who is beautiful, kind, helpful, practically a saint, who never does anything wrong! Oh, how scary! And now for the thing that everyone is complaining about, What is up with the eventing? Okay, I admit, I like jumping, and eventing, but it cannot compare with the thrill of racing. I was always so proud, the series that I read was so interesting, and not like any other series. I was intrigued by the stories of triumph and tragedy. I always wanted to keep reading about the problems that these girls had to endure. Problems far worse than &quot;Oh no, my horse is afraid of water! Whatever shall I do?&quot; Okay, writers, why'd you do it? I noticed that it changed to eventing when the new writer that works in the riding place in central park started writing. Well, I don't want to sound mean, but just because you happen to like eventing, doesn't make it right for you to change the entire plot of the series! Or, was it because you thought you would get more readers? Well, even though you may have gotten a few people, who needed yet another eventing series, to read your book, but if you keep this up, you are going to lose alot more readers than you will gain. Because the people who wanna read about eventing have other places to turn, but we don't! So, please, it's not to late. Turn it back into a racing series. If you refuse to let Christina like racing, than at least focus some on Kevin or something, at least he has the sense to like racing. Well, that is enough of my complaining, but I am pleading with you, you have made this series lose everything that made it my favorite. I have not given up hope yet, but if it doesn't change soon, I'll at least start looking for a better eventing series! P.S. How can a girl that loves horses so much, and lives on a throughbred training farm, hate racing so much? END"},{"Title":"Christina's Courage (Thoroughbred Series #27)","review":"Readers: Find another series, this one bit the dust. To the writer: I don't like reading a series about eventing when there are so many eventing series out there. It started out on racing and I don't know why that has to change. It isn't hard to research, I do it all the time. I am outraged and annoyed. My advice to who ever is writing these books right now is to switch back to racing, which brought the readers in the first place, and make up a story about the people and horses that vanished. And the Ashliegh Series comes out in August. The first book is called Lightning's Last Hope. At least that's what Joanna said when she e mailed me. The Ashliegh Collection are books that were written by Joanna Campbell years ago. I know, I read them when I was little. So, please, whoever is writing these books, get some lessons on writing and figure out that your readers aren't stupid. We know that you have no idea what you're talking about.

But in #34 I don't know if they're talking about Wonder's Pride or Pride's Chance. On the cover of this book Christina and Sterling really look like a team. For all those people that say Christina is a brat, she was a bit bratty in this one, and in the beginning of #25 when she gets really mad at Melanie. I like the new authors, but I thought that Alice Leonhardt's 'Riding Academy' series was good. Allison Estes is a good author, too. When the Thoroughbred series was devoted to racing, I liked it better when Joanna Campbell wrote them. But the only thing is, is when they didn' consult Ms. Campbell before changing the series to eventing. Please, everyone, give this series a chance! It'll turn out great!

I used to read a series called Pine Hollow, the Second series after the Saddle Club.

Except for the fact it is altogether too tempting to rely on practice entirely, when you examine the available textbooks. Indeed, popular advertising texts (e.g., Kleppner's Advertising Procedure) are driven by the practical (or the industry point of view) without much attention to scholarly research. At a cursory view, it seems as if that is what students want as well - to have a practitioner with years of experience as an account or creative person to teach advertising management. After all, we who know marketing should stick to the customers' needs and wants! This, though, is lamentable to many consumer behavior researchers who aspire to the ideal confluence of teaching and research in the advertising arena. Simultaneously, business schools should be something more than vocational schools that produce advertising account executives or creative directors. As we know for a fact, they come back to school, yearning for some theoretical knowledge! Especially for the graduate level, you would ideally like to provide solid theoretical grounds on how academic research can systemically contribute to the knowledge base in the advertising world.Teaching theory-based research with the practical advertising mindset will become much easier with Chaudhuri's new book, Emotion and Reason in Consumer Behavior. Rather than relying on a general consumer behavior text (such as Hoyer and McInnis), which may already have been used for the pre-requisite course of Consumer Behavior, using this text can cover a comprehensive range of main consumer behavior topics, including attitude, involvement, and learning, while being privy to explicitly linked areas of advertising that have been rigorously investigated (mostly by the author and his co-authors).Another interesting factor in this text is the author's unique view of integrating research on emotions into the well-known areas of consumer behavior. Many students find it easy to relate that many areas of advertising are driven more by the emotion rather than cognition. For those students, Chaudhuri's new book will ease introduction of theoretical investigation of the emotion into the advertising classroom. For example, the author's research on the CASC scale (Chaudhuri and Buck, 1995) can readily be used to encourage students to conduct more rigorous research to fit their tasks at hand. Additionally, the discussion that forms the basis of the scale, of the triune brain including neomammalian, paleomammalian, and reptilian parts, is sure to fascinate and inspire readers.Not only is this book recommended for students, but also for practitioners. The way each piece of the relevant research is illustrated at the end of each chapter will help practitioners in the industry (even without attending graduate schools!) to better understand and utilize results of scholarly research in the areas involving emotions.In summary, Arjun Chaudhuri's new text of Emotion and Reason in Consumer Behavior is a definite must for those who wish to bring in scholarly perspectives of emotions in advertising into their curriculum as well as for those in the industry who wish to acquire the academic perspectives in the research of emotions."},{"Title":"Emotion and Reason in Consumer Behavior","review":"Having taught at the university level for nine years and managed the account management department of a top 12 advertising agency, I can say that I strongly prefer Dr. Chaudhuri\\"s new text to past consumer behavior textbooks I have used. The role of emotion in consumer behavior and contemporary advertising has not, in my opinion, been sufficiently addressed in the past, and this new text allows students to use current advertising models to debate emotion/reason roles in today's communication. My students found these new theories interesting and worthy of great discussion. I highly recommend this book for a truly up to date look at consumer behavior in America."},{"Title":"Beyond Psychology: Letters and Journals 1934-1939","review":"Wilhelm Reich was many things in his lifetime- a student of Freud, a political activist, a research scientist, and an inventor. His work was decades ahead of its time and is finally being rediscovered and reevaluated by the public. If, like me, you are interested in Reich and his work, you might want to check out a novel called We All Fall Down, by Brian Caldwell. it draws heavily on Reich's theories, particularly Listen Little Man and The Mass Psychology Of Facism. It's a great introduction to Reich's work and the entire novel draws heavily on his theory. It's very interesting watching an author explore his theories in a fictional setting.

It consists of Schweitzer's medical case histories, travels, hospital administrative chores, reflections on African and European culture, and general overview of his first decade and a half in Gabon on the west coast of Africa. Schweitzer's candid comments about the Africans and the harsh conditions under which he worked help make this book better than the average account of third world philanthropic endeavors. Schweitzer shows true insight and compassion for those he came to help and I found the book highly engaging."},{"Title":"The primeval forest","review":"Although a great admirer of Dr. Albert Schweitzer for some years, it is only now that the opportunity has presented itself to finally read and relish the doctor's own account of his beginnings and reasons for working in equatorial Africa.Schweitzer's reason(s) for giving up his position as professor in the University of Strasbourg, his prolific literary work, his ground-breaking work on Bach, (he was the world authority at the time) and his music... the doctor writes,\\"I had read about the physical miseries of the natives in the virgin forests; I had heard about them from missionaries, and the more I thought about it the stranger it seemed to me that we Europeans trouble ourselves so little about the great humanitarian task which offers itself to us in far-off lands.\\" (P. 9)Dr. Schweitzer has a lot to say concerning the extensive damages wrought on the native African as a result of colonialism. We take their natural resources as if they were our own; we have given them our diseases; we have given them alcoholism and we push the Word of the Lord down their throats and some how justify this pillage & plunder as \\"civilizing the savages\\". Schweitzer, first and foremost, realized that the colonized natives are experiencing great suffering in terms of the many diseases that plague the continent, and felt that he, a white man, needed to take responsibility; therefore he chose to become a medical doctor at the age of thirty. Once attaining his qualifications, he set out with his wife to West Africa amongst the many protests from his contemporaries.This book was first published in 1922, but Schweitzer set sail for Africa in July 1913, to go on and establish his famous hospital in Lambarene, West Africa. The hardships in establishing a hospital in such primitive conditions to then begin treating the natives straight away with little or adequate medical supplies is almost unthinkable, but he forged on, building the hospital, treating horrific disease and dealing with the culture of the West African. He writes about the belief system of the native's (fetishist) and the affect of their conversion to Christianity.There is a chapter the doctor devotes entirely to the most prevalent tropical diseases he comes across most weeks and months. These descriptions are graphic, truly conveying the horror and utter suffering the patient experiences if left untreated.In Dr. Schweitzer's conclusion, he writes about something he calls \\"The Fellowship of those who bear the Mark of Pain.\\" In distilled terms, anyone who has experienced great pain and has been treated to a successful outcome should realize the extent of pain and suffering of the native African. This empathy should awake the white man, and force them to help with the aid of modern medicine, the pain and suffering of the native African.Any medical student or doctor thinking about working in primitive conditions in any developing country, should certainly read this book.

Polish scholars have tended to view immigrants as part of the history of other countries and no longer germane to the story of Poland. American scholars have also largely ignored Polonia, whether through unfamiliarity with the Polish language or ignorance.Yet this immigration of millions of people from one country to the other had a major impact on both Poland and America. Millions left the Polish countryside during the crucial years of the late nineteenth century and significant numbers left after World War II and again in recent decades. But these immigrants did not merely affect Polish history by their absence. In America, many immigrants developed a heightened sense of Polishness. When Polish culture was restricted and even banned in the old country, many immigrants first heard Chopin, read Mickiewicz, or celebrated May 3rd in America. Many immigrants who came from impoverished rural areas were first exposed to the glories of Poland in Chicago, Buffalo, or Detroit rather than in Krakow, Warsaw, or Poznan.In addition, Polish immigrants sent millions of dollars to rebuild Poland after both world wars. Tens of thousands joined a volunteer army during World War I to fight on behalf of Polish liberty. Having experienced democracy, freedom of speech, and the right to vote in America, immigrants transmitted those ideals back to their friends and family in their home villages through letters and visits. If today Poland is considered one of the most pro-American countries in Europe, this is a result of attitudes engendered by Polish immigrants.In America, Poles shaped urban, industrial life. They were a driving force behind the development and expansion of major urban centers such as Chicago and Detroit. Poles played a crucial though often forgotten in role in America's first civil rights movement-the struggle for the rights of workers in the decades prior to World War II.John Radziowski's book, The Eagle and the Cross, is an effort to shed light on this often-overlooked history by focusing on the history of the first significant Polish organization in the New World, the Polish Roman Catholic Union of America (PRCUA). The Union, a fraternal insurance society founded in 1873, was based on the ideals of Catholic positivism and was in harmony with the intellectual and cultural trends that were prominent in Poland at that time. Many of its founders had their roots in a rejection of Romanticism. Instead, they sought to build up Poland's moral, economic, educational, and cultural resources through \\"organic work.\\"These ideas were adapted to the needs of Polish immigrants in America by the priests and sisters of Congregation of the Resurrection, founded in Paris by Polish expatriates in the 1830s. The Resurrectionists were engaged in a vigorous counterattack against socialism, materialism, and modernism. Through the PRCUA, they sought to keep Polish immigrants faithful to the Catholic Church, true to their Polish heritage, and to avoid the temptations and perils of the new industrial cities. As Radziowski shows, by the 1920s the PRCUA developed a major and impressive range of activities that reached out to the Polish community in America but which also mobilized that community to aid the cause of Poland where needed.The book breaks new ground in that it is the first English-language history of this important organization, which continues to play a key role in American Polonia to this day. Radziowski argues that in the past, scholars of Polonia have focused more attention on secular, radical, or dissenter organizations, often overlooking groups like the PRCUA and generally taking for granted the importance of Catholicism (in all its complexity) in shaping the character of the Polish diaspora. It chronicles the range and impact of PRCUA activities and shows how connected American Polonia has been to both American and Polish history over the last century and a half. Intriguingly, the book suggests, but does not fully develop, a connection between the ideals of late nineteenth and early twentieth century Polish positivism and the philosophical roots of Pope John Paul II.The Eagle and the Cross fills an important gap in our knowledge about Polish and American history and challenges scholars to rethink the role of the millions of people who helped build two nations."},{"Title":"The Eagle and the Cross: A History of the Polish Roman Catholic Union of America, 1873-2000 (Eastern European Monographs)","review":"&quot;Polak to katolik&quot; (A Pole is a Catholic) is a traditional aphorism, but in what sense is it true? This has never been an easy question in Polish history, esp. in the past when Poland was a much more ethnically heterogenous state. Neither was it an easy question for American Polonia, as the existence of the Polish Roman Catholic Union of America (PRCUA) and the Polish National Alliance (PNA) attest. But, as Dr. John Radziowski shows in this sympathetic yet professionally critical history of the 131-year old PRCUA, the PRCUA/PNA divide was more than \\"simply a matter of one group that stressed Catholicism pitted against another group that stressed a broader nationalism\\" (p. 87). To reduce the difference between the PRCUA and the PNA to a \\"Catholic-versus-secular division\\" (p. 89) is facile. To the degree that it presumes what Richard Neuhaus calls \\"the naked public square\\" of contemporary radical secularism, it is also anachronistic.The PRCUA/PNA difference lay at the level of ideals, emergingfrom a longstanding division in Polish attitudes that had emerged by the end of the eighteenth century. . . . The Alliance emerged out of Poland's nineteenth-century Romantic tradition. . . . Romantics saw Poland as the 'Christ among nations,' and its problems were the result of the evil actions of its autocratic neighbors. . . . . [T]he Union . . . . came out of Poland's Positivist tradition. . . . They believed Poland had lost its independence due to its own weakness, and its problems could be best solved by building up the nation's internal resources\\" (pp. 89, 90).For the PNA, priority belonged to nar&oacute;d, \\"all Poles and persons of Polish descent residing anywhere in the world\\" (p. 89). For the PRCUA, priority belonged to okolica, the local environment and neighborhood. The nationalists wanted to build from the top down, instilling ethnic consciousness in peasants who, prior to their emigration, probably never traveled far from their villages. The PRCUA wanted to build from the bottom up, starting with vigorous local communities centered on local parishes (p. 90).In PNA eyes, at least at the start, American Polonia was ephemeral: \\"once Poland regained its independence, most Polish immigrants would return home\\" (p. 90). PRCUA more quickly recognized that American Polonia was something here-to-stay, and was thus more readily invested in building it up. Paradoxically, the PNA was the greater proponent of naturalization and assimilation, convinced that American Polonia could leverage their U.S. ties to the advantage of the Polish cause. The PRCUA, more fearful that a secularist, materialist and consumerist culture could lead Polish Catholics astray, sought to forge a comfortable Polonian subculture that would keep those evils at bay. How many people know, for example, that the PRCUA launched its own colonization program? In seeking to keep Polish villagers down on the farm, it promoted settlement in Polonian communities formed in Nebraska in the 1870s. That effort was not marginal: its impact could be felt a century later. \\"In 1980, Sherman County, Nebraska, had the highest percentage of Polish Americans of any county in the United States\\" (p. 64).\\"Organic work\\" was the credo of Polish Positivism and the motto of PRCUA. Building up families and communities were the PRCUA's goals. Radziowski discusses their varied contributions, from establishing a social safety net through insurance funds and death benefits for immigrants thrust into the cauldron of 19th century industrial America to camps and sports programs aimed at maintaining Polish cultural identity among youth to efforts to provide relief and reconstruction assistance to Poles and Poland following two world wars. Polish Americans played a key role in the struggle of America's labor unions, and PRCUA assisted its working class members both by demanding workplace social justice as well as providing assistance to strikers.The changing demographics of Polonia, new patterns of immigration and the atomization of American life to the detriment of civil society and voluntary organizations all have their impact on PRCUA today. Radziowski is aware of the problems faced by Polish-American organizational life, but he keeps perspective while sounding an upbeat note:. . . [E]arlier generations faced far greater problems with far smaller resources. The PRCUA, today an organization with close to $300 million in insurance . . . began as a loose collection of church societies with no central administration, no funds, no death benefits, no headquarters, no library, no museum, and only a semi-official newspaper. The Polonia of that time was universally poor, poorly educated, politically impotent, and oppressed. The Polish homeland was little more than a colony of foreign powers. A century and a quarter later, the picture is completely different, like night and day\\" (p. 313-14).Amply illustrated and well documented, this book deserves to be on the bookshelves of all Polish-Americans. The photographs and cartoon sketches truly prove that \\"a picture is worth a thousand words.\\" A special chapter is dedicated to the unappreciated \\"Smithsonian\\" of American Polonia, the Polish Museum of America. As always, Radziowski anchors the history of PRCUA against the larger backdrop of the histories of American Polonia, Poland, and America. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The affair","review":"Lewis Eliot is the narrator of the novels in the STRANGERS AND BROTHERS series. C.P. Snow, among other things, was a social historian. Tom Orbell is younger than Lewis. He is a Fellow at the Cambridge College to which Lewis's brother Martin is attached. It is 1953. Lewis is introduced by Tom to Laura Howard. One of the younger Fellows has gotten caught in a case of scientific fraud. The man concerned is Laura's husband Donald. Laura wants Tom to reopen the case. Tom casts Lewis as a sort of elder statesman. He may be able to talk with his friends at the college. Laura decides that Lewis is no good at all.At the college, visiting his brother, Lewis sees Francis Getliffe. Lewis learns that Howard had been a moderately well-known fellow-traveler. Howard has damaged his case with college personnel by blaming his elderly advisor for the lapse. The man, very distinguished, has died recently.On Christmas night Martin and Lewis eat at the college to spare their wives the trouble of preparing another meal. Lewis is surprised to learn there that one of the Fellows, Skeffington, believes that Howard's case merits re-opening because a page received in the last batch of notebooks of the deceased scientist may support Howard's explanation of the discrepancy. When Lewis approaches Francis Getliffe to support re-opening the case, he discovers that Francis is inclined, with no particular urging of Lewis, to recommend that the matter be reconsidered. Getliffe's position in the matter is bound to sway others.In the course of taking testimony it is inevitable that Nightingale, the Bursar, be suspected of secreting a crucial photograph, (the notebook in question passed through his hands first). Fact-finding does not end neatly, but rough justice prevails.Snow's careful recital of the fictitious controversy and its solution is of great interest. The author's realistic appraisal of people and people's motives is called forth in this excellent work."},{"Title":"The affair","review":"Well, he's back on track here, with a well-paced and interesting story set in Cambridge, as was \\"The Masters\\". Snow seems so at home there and writes marvelously of the Cambridge Fellows, most of whom appeared in the earlier book.

The scales of Justice are blind, or should be so.

His answer in each of his books with this theme reminds me of that line from Jurassic Park: &quot;Life always finds a way.&quot; Having said that, *Under Pressure* is perhaps the smallest level at which he plays this game -- a small submarine whose mission it is to steal oil from an enemy country in a cold war several levels above what the U.S. experienced during the 1950s and 1960s. This might sound like a recycled sub movie plot, but don't be fooled by the premise. *Under Pressure* is more about how men bond...well, under pressure, and become something greater than they could singly. I read it first when I was in junior high, and I read it again earlier this year. It's amazing how quickly the book ends. The only thing that keeps it from earning five stars is what I've always considered Herbert's weakness -- characterization. He takes a whole book (sometimes more than a single book) to flesh characters out fully. Still, I heartily recommend this book because it deals with large themes and is better plotted than some of his more famous works."},{"Title":"The dragon in the sea","review":"This is a fairly simple and short novel. Unlike some of Frank's other work, this isnt really a sci-fi book, more of a psychological study of the paranoia that overtakes 5 men on a submarine mission to destroy an enemy installation. Its a very good read though, and id definitely reccomend it. Like the best of Franks work, it disorients the reader and fiddles with your perceptions."},{"Title":"The dragon in the sea","review":"This is probably Herbert's least well known novel, but it's a remarkable tale of a futuristic submarine war and what sub technology and tactics might be like in the future. As in his most famous novel, Dune, people and technology are often mere chess pieces in a greater political game. In Dune, despite their advanced knowledge of cognitive psychology, human abilities, and psychophysiology, the characters are controlled by the Machiavellian vicissitudes of their everyday lives. This book shows Herbert already thinking about the implications of the philosophy he was to develop more fully there.In his short story, Cease Fire, published ten years before Dune, we see Herbert's fascination with Machiavelli and with political intrigue and psychological warfare. This interest was to combine with his interests in ecology, psychology, and technology to produce his famous masterpiece, Dune. Overall this is another fine Herbert novel and one that deserves to be better known and that presages much of his later important work."},{"Title":"The dragon in the sea","review":"It is important to remember when this was written. It is shocking how much he got right before widespread use of naval nuclear reactors. I read this story when it came out, in the middle fifties, and it left an indelible impression.

A compelling read."},{"Title":"The dragon in the sea","review":"Today, the Cold War is \\"over.\\" Despite that and the United States's hegemonic status, the US's major threat, according to its own military, is Russia. With the growing threat of the EU, China, and our interests in maintaining our strength, this book, despite being written when the Cold War was still a readily apparent threat, is highly relevant today. First, at a much smaller level, it discusses the politics and conflict over a finite resource. Of course, this a theme that Herbert would expand upon in his phenomenalDune, 40th Anniversary Edition (Dune Chronicles, Book 1)series. However, in this book, the resource is not spice, but oil and the backdrop is a nuclear submarine sent from \\"Western Waters\\" to \\"Eastern Waters\\" (i.e. the North America and its surrounding oceans to Russia and its surrounding Russia) and secretly pump out oil from underwater oil fields that belong to the Eastern Powers. The West and the East have been at war for a decade.Meanwhile, these submarines are manned by a small crew. Small screw, confined situation, claustrophobic environment... sounds another set of settings that Herbert would later explore inDestination: Voidand good setting to analyze leadership. Herbert goes further than that and examines how Religion might be used both a source of social solidarity and social control, something especially important in such a confined environment with a small crew.Lastly, the psychological elements. The crews of these submarines are prone to insanity and suicide. The government sends in a psychologist to one of these submarines to figure out why. It also knows that Military Command and crew could have sleeper cells sent from Russia to sabotage the system. The Psychologist needs to figure out who...For a relatively short book, Frank Herbert manages to write a psychological-spy thriller with important themes that are incredibly relevant today. This is one amazingly good book and it is a shame that Frank Herbert is seen as the author of one good book. Was every book he wrote a home run? No. No author has nothing but home runs. But Herbert's other work should get more respect and critical reevaluation. I can only hope some others get in print. As for this one... buy it if you want a book that goes beyond the words on the page and gets you to think. No Herbert doesn't provide you all the answers, that's up to you decide. But at least he asks the questions and presents possible situations and settings. Which is all any good author should do."},{"Title":"The dragon in the sea","review":"One of the five members of the Hell Diver subtug crew is a saboteur. Psychologist John Ramsay is assigned to join the team, as they steal oil from Cold War adversaries by tugging their purloined liquid black gold loot under water; his task is to uncover the identity of the traitor. He somewhat fears being well over a mile under the water while on this mission because if exposed he will be dead.However, although he watches intently, the mission is in peril from the sabotage damage caused by one of them, but John remains unsure who he is. Soon he and three other crewmen are in trouble with no place to hide as the enemy has them in his sights. If they survive against this ruthless relentless stalker, John and the other three remain \\"Under Pressure\\" from the strength of the ocean that pounds away at their tin can. To live they must work as a team, but no one trusts anyone else as phobias bubble to surfaces of their minds.This is a reprint of a 1956 thriller that seems timelier now than it did during the height of the Cold War with the concept of the morally superior West stealing oil from the East. The tale is about a covert operation reminiscent of the Bush invasion in which administration officials helped sell the war besides 9/11 links with the belief cheap easy access oil was around the corner once Iraq became a democracy. Although none of the crew, even the hero, seems much more than action figures, fans will appreciate Frank Herbert's deep look at societal ethics.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The dragon in the sea","review":"Dragon in the Sea is quite a departure from Dune. It's more akin to The Santaroga Barrier (my favorite Herbert book) in Herbert starts with a few ordinary events and then turns them into psychological dramas. For this book, he goes one step further and leaves off the chapter divisions to create a literary claustrophobia to match the claustrophic conditions of the submarine. Some of the psychobable to explain the captain's behavior was a bit silly but I'll forgive it for the otherwise enjoyable thriller with science fiction trappings."},{"Title":"The dragon in the sea","review":"I don't consider myself prone to sea sickness, but this book gave me one.

Throughout the book I found there was FAR too much time given to detail - latches, levers, knobs, control panels, etc... Unless you're someone who's served aboard a nuclear sub, it's impossible to paint a mental picture of what was going on half the time in this book. And the ending was.. well, not much of a bang. I was expecting a big 'twist' - something I'd never expect, which never happened. On the plus side, it did have some interesting philosophical views which Herbert is good at. The characters were somewhat enjoyable, and there was some good suspense at times.

She lived with her parents Sixto and Ramona Ortega in El Rancho de la Rosas. When she was thirteen years old her father died, and her and her mother decided to escape to the United States with Alfonso, Miguel and Hortensia(people that work in her home.) They decided to escape because her uncle Luis wanted to marry Ramon. When they arrived in the United States they worked in a camp collecting fruits. Then Ramona got very sick and Esperanza needed to work to buy Ramona's medicine. Esperanza didn't know nothing because in Mexico Hortensia did everything. Esperanza learned how to cook, wash, and clean.I like the story because I think that this about how it is for immigrants who come to this country. They need learn many things in order to survive.I recomend this book because I think that all of us need to learn how the people was sad if they can't do nothing, we need to know the value of life."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"I give Esperanza Rising, by Pam Munoz Ryan 5 stars.I'm sure you now want to find out why I gave this book such a high rating. Esperanza Rising is a fabulous book about a young, 13 year old girl who's family owns a large ranch in Mexico. Her family was very rich and had many servants to work in the fields. One night her father and a few of his friends went out to fix the barbed wire fence that was clear out at the end of the ranch. Papa's friends came back, but no Papa. They reported back telling Esperanza and her family that Papa had been killed by bandits. Now Esperanza, Abulita and Mama are left at the ranch alone, until Esperanza's uncle (the mayor of the town) came and told them that the only way they could stay on the ranch was if Mama married him. Mama doesn't want to marry him, so Mama, Abulita, Esperanza and two of they're most trusted servents headed for America without any money and without the uncle having knowledge of their trip.In America, they went to a camp for Hispanic people only, because at this time, the Americans thought that they were poor and dirty. At this camp, Esperanza goes on many adventures that will keep you on the edge of your seat. She also learns what it means to be a true woman and how to survive without other people doing the work for you. There are many joyful, happy moments in Esperanza Rising, but don't forget, with every happy moment comes sad.Some other books I recommend are:The Weekend Was Murder by Joan Lowery Nixon;Nobody Else Has To Know by Ingrid Tomey;Hard Love by Ellen Wittlinger;and Monster by Walter Dean MyersI am a student from Harris Road Middle School, and I would definately recommend for you to read Esperanza Rising."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"This is a very good book adout a little six year old girl who lives in Aguascalientes, Mexico.Her family was very rich and had a lot of land, but everything changes one day when she was about to turn 13.

Well, Esperanza never did. Esperanza is a teenage girl who was brought up with a rich family. She had every thing that she could ever what. Until one day when her father had gone out to do something and never returned.After esperanza had a very tragic thing happen to her they had lost all of there money because her father had owned a business and they had to shut it down. Esperenza and her mother had to move away because they didnt have any money to take care of themselves. I would say this is a really good fiction story.I think that the story was tops because there was never a dull moment. I would recommend this book to any people who like fiction books because you get really into the book. Esperanza Rising was a real page-turner because there was so many great things happening throughout the story. It was very easy to keep your mind set on the story because you get so involved, you dont want to concentrate on anything but the story. I really like the genre[fiction] of Esperanza Rising because you get to make things up in your head of what everything looks like. The style of writing is nice. Some things were set in Spanish, then translated to English which made it very interesting. I think one of the things in Esperanza Rising that surprised me was that how quick she had adapted to her new surroundings. Not every chapter ended with a cliff-hanger, but a majority of them did. one example is when her father didnt return, and you had to keep reading the next page to see what would happen. The story had so many exciting parts that there's not a chance to get bored as you are reading. When you read the story, all you want to do is pay attention because every part is important and you never want to miss it.the plot was unbelievable because there was never a dull moment. I think readers who like great fiction stories and stories that take place with a different background/culture would enjoy Esperanza Rising."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"ESPERANZA RISING IS A FABULOUS BOOK!!I READ IT IN THE 5TH GRADE.

Esperanza, her mother and some of her old servants run to California where Esparanza, who has never worked in her life worked before, learns to work and live in her new country. When the other farmers start striking, Esparanza is torn in two.

Then, on top of all that, her mother gets ill and she must work very hard to make sure the hospital bills get paid. In the end the lesson that Esperanza learns is to never give up and never lose hope.I enjoyed this book because I liked the way Esperanza changed from spoiled to being able to take care of other people. I did not like Esperanza at the beginning because she was a little stuck up. I think that the story was well paced because the plot held my interest all the way through the book.

Then with nothing left in Mexico, they go to the US for work. This book is pretty much fantasy to cold reality and then some. It's a good book, but some points of this book are painfully annoying.

This book was written in third person point of view and the genre is historical fiction. On a scale of 1-5, I would rate this book a 4 out of 5 , because it is a really good story, it is amazingly sad at times, but also an exciting story at times. Some themes of the book are sad or emotional, such as dealing with and overcoming death, growing up and maturing, and fighting against racism.This book is set during the Great Depression , and is located in both Mexico and then California.Rich Esperanza never thought she would leave her ranch in Mexico. She always thought she would have her servants with her to pamper her. But when her papa suddenly dies, the day before her birthday, possibly caused by her cruel uncles, everything turns upside down.

The next day Mr. Rodriguez came to drop of the fruits. Esperanza opened the door and said, \\" what's in the box\\". He said \\"the fruits your father requested from me\\". She told him everything that happened to her father. He was stunned by what happened to her father. He said that her father was a very generous person. The household butler said yes I will be taken those fruits. Then Esperanza began to cry. She told Mr.Rodriguez that she really wished he were there for her birthday. She opened the present from her father it was a glass doll. Her father brought her one every year on her birthday. The next day her mother woke her up because of a fire that had started in her house. Then her mother was thinking where they would live now that her house was burnt down. She knew that Luis would make her marry him even if she didn't want to. Then one of the butlers said \\"well my brother said that I can move with him but I have to help around the farm and pay him as well\\". I can send him a letter to inform him that we are going over. Then the mother realized that her papers were burnt in the fire. The grandmother said \\" I can get that later\\". Just tell Luis that you except his proposal, but you need a week to talk it over with her family. The next day Luis came by and Esperanza's mother said that she would marry him. Luis said \\" I knew you would come to your senses\\". When he left they got all of their remaining things together for their big trip to the United States of America. They left as soon as tghe sun went down. The reason why they left at dusk was so that nobody would see them and tell Luis that they were on their way to the United States. Esperanza and her mother hid under a lot of boxes and blankets. The butlers drove the wagon to Mr.Rodriguez's house. They told him that they were leaving and that he shouldn't tell anyone until they wrote him a letter. They said they would write him to tell him they were safe.There next stop was to go somewhee they can get some rest so they can be wide-awake on the ride to the train. they covered the wagon up and sleep on blankets and towels. The next morning they left to the train . Esperanza remembered that her father took her in first class. There were leather seats and a dining car to eat in. She remebered the time she ate mango and her face and hands were very sticky She waved everone hello and good bye. When esperanza saw where they were going to be seated she asked her mothe if that was there seat .She said well this is all we can afford right now.

It's a story about a girl from Mexico in the 1930's who goes from riches to rags. She overcomes major loses in her life, copes with a completely different lifestyle, experiences poverty, the hardships of the Great Depression, and Racism. Everyone can appreciate this book, but I think if you're Hispanic, you'll really appreciate it. I didn't know much about how Hispanics were treated during this time period, so this book actually taught me something. This book is meant for older kids, but I think people of all ages will enjoy it. (I was a senior in High School) Its an awesome book and I recommend it to everyone!"},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"A multicultural book that truly transcends cultures. Although it does an excellent job in portraying the Mexican and Mexican-American cultures, the concepts and characters can be identified with by a person of any culture. The concept is interesting and not often shown, especially not in the context of the Mexican culture; the rich become richer when they become poor, than the poor do when they become rich. Esperanza's character grows dramatically during the course of the novel as she matures, takes responsibility, and overcomes many obstacles. There are many struggles and injustices the characters are forced to endure, but throughout the entire novel is this ray of hope and the silver lining. It is important for children to hear the difficult lives the immigrants had to endure around the time of the Great Depression."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"Esperanza Rising, by Pan Munzon, is about a girl that migrates from Mexico to California. The story takes place during the Great Deperesion, in the rosy plains of Mexico and the working fields of California. The main charactor, Esperanaz, is a girl that thought as she got older nothing would change.If Esperanaz's life turned out how she thought it would be, this book would be a fairytale. But when tragedy strikes she must leave her home and move to California. The reader will enjoy this book because of the vivid words the aurthor uses. If you think your life could be a fairytale, just till you see what's coming your way."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"This book is a very good book to start the children in any classroom to interest children in reading. This book is easy reading and it was made with that purpose in mind. This book helps students become interested in reading because the story is about a universal human concern which is security and this allows for further investigation through reading. The book immediatley helps you in getting started in a reading mode and the story is so intriguing and gripping that you keep reading the story until you finish the book. In the elementary school years it could be a three day project of heavy reading so the children can get interested and to have menaingful discussions about univeral concerns of security. The reading is fun and helpful. In the middle and high school level it helps to conquer fear and helps in reading.In this book Esperanza the protagonist looses it's security because bandits kill her father. Esperanza's uncle takes advantage of the situation and practically gives Esperanza's mother an ultimatun, wether to marry him or loose evrything to poverty. The main universal concern in this story is about security but at wehat price. The family had to loose it's pride and dignity in order to keep their security. The moral of the story is that the price was too high and not worth it.The family decides to become immigrants and become laborers. This new found change was their reality. they gave up being rich because they felt it was more important to have spiritual security than depend on financial security. This way they will have a life and not feel alsmost like they were selling themselves for money. This story has many universal concern and it has many moral messages that young people can relate to. This book is about a particular ethnic group and nationality that any body can relate too. this book trancends culture and clearly proves that all the peoples in the world are more alike than they are different. I highly recommend this book for any age level after third grade because it is a good book that has a good story and is not full of vulgarities and fowl language. There is zero profanity and the dstory just keeps you glued to it which for reading instruction is what is the ideal. As an ethnic culutre book it is very good, it represents the culure in a dignified manner and does not use crude stereotypes to portray it's characters. All in all this book is very good reading. In terms of it's academic value it is very good for the teaching of reading. It is a book that makes you feel good and gives you a feeling of accomplishment when you finish it. It makes you feel like if you had a good human life experience. This book will give a good insight into ethnic reading material. It was written in a manner that gives you an insight into another culture and nationality. This being the Mexican culture, however it clearly gives you an understanding that all humans are all the same just different circumstances and history is what sets up apart."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"This is a great book and everyone should read it.

After her father's death, she and her mother must leave their ranch and grandmother to work on a large California farm. It is a difficult life for Esperanza, a fourteen year old who has done little hard work during her life and is accustomed to the advantages of wealth. Despite all that she must overcome, Esperanza becomes more compassionate and matures throughout the story, learning to value family and friends, and to never give up hope. Her story is told in flowing, simple language that appeals to children without bieng confusing. Ryan also uses Spanish phrases in the dialogue and narrative to make the situations more realistic. This common theme in children's books is displayed in a new light through Esperanza's experiences in her new country."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"Yes, Esperanza rises, and she takes her readers, young and old, along with her. Unique in its perspective, Esperanza Rising weaves a masterful tale of a girl's paradoxical journey from \\"riches to rags\\".Esperanza is a privileged, haughty girl when we first meet her. We cringe at her naive pride when she confidently reminds the housekeeper's son, Miguel, that, \\"she was the ranch owner's daughter and between them ran a deep river...\\" that this river, \\"could never be crossed.\\" But soon Esperanza is buffeting a series of tragic events that push her through loss, deception, danger, and ultimately, poverty.The writing is beautifully simple. Pam Munoz Ryan imbues the ordinary with poignant symbolism. Rose bushes, a crocheted blanket, a porcelain doll, and even the fruits and vegetables that mark the seasons for a field worker, become Esperanza's emotional treasure. The story is so warmly wrapped in these simple symbols, a reader is humbly reminded of the true unshakeable power of life's gifts.Esperanza Rising also offers a unique perspective into the history of Depression-era California. Esperanza lives and works in a farm labor camp for Mexican migrants, but the competition with Japanese and Okie laborers is fierce, not to mention discriminatory. At one point in the story, the Mexican children are excited because at the new Okie camp there is a swimming pool where the Mexicans are allowed to swim every Saturday morning, just before it gets cleaned. In another instance, the Mexican workers are divided amongst themselves as some become activists fighting for better conditions, while others are simply thankful for the day's work. Esperanza is torn as well, as she struggles to understand the delicate balance between survival and dignity.Esperanza Rising is a beautiful and powerful story, a story for all, a story of hope in the face of despair, of growth in the aftermath of loss."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"Esperenza Rising was a pretty good book.Its about a pretty mexican girl who gets everything and anything she wants.Until something happens that changes her life forever."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"I am very excited to find the author, Pam Munoz Ryan. Her writing is very poetic, the imagery stunning, the content strong and stirring, and the plot always moving. I love to read stories of hope, courage, faith and family, and this story is one of the finest examples. Every 20 pages or so will leave you in tears, yet the emotional content never turns \\"sappy\\", or \\"fake\\". Too many stories for youth today seem so overly-realistic, dark, devoid of hope - not so with \\"Esperanza Rising\\".

The novel is truly inspiring and it brings hope for some many people. Not only for the ones coming from other parts of the world to the US, but also to the many changes adolescents face.

I felt sad for Esperanza some many times especially when her mother got sick and she had to work in order to buy her medicines. While being in the United States, my mother has been sick and I have sent money to her to pay the medical bills.I also loved the use of Spanish language in the book. The first Mexican proverbs at the beginning of the book, gives you a powerful glimpse of the wisdom from our Latino American ancestors. The author kept the use of Spanish especially in the very important expressions.This is a story some many people can feel related to it.

Her name is Esperanza. She had lived on a farm with a lot of workers, she was Mexican and so was the people who worked there and to add she had worked with them to and so did her father. Her uncle wants Esperanzas mother to marry her uncle because he is an accountant that worked at the bank. He only wanted the farm to make the workers work more so he could have more money. But her mother did not marry him so that he could not have the farm. Esperanza was to be about 1 0 or 11 on the day her father had died . She has always got got the doll her father had gotten her for her Birthday every year but this year was different she had not gotten the doll this year from her father.The main characters are Esperanza , Mama ( did not show her name in book), Abuelita( Esperanzas Grandma), Alfonso(her uncle), and Miguel (Her uncle). Those are the main character of the book \\" Esperanza Rising \\". They are big part of the book that I have read.My opinion is that this is a good book to show how someone has lost his or her parent or God parent. It show how you feel and what it will be like if you have just lost a parent. And I would really recommand this to a friend who has lost a parent and know what it feels like to lose one and not have them come back. Or to a person who has not yet lost a parent and will in the future and will know what it feels like to lose one.

She lived with her mother and father, Ramona and Sixto Ortega at a beautiful ranch where her grandmother taught Esperanza to crochet. El Rancho de las Rosas is a little piece of paradise. Beloved servants tend to Esperanza's every need while field hands tend to the family's vineyard. Everything in Esperanza's life is perfect right down to the preparations for her fourteenth birthday.That is, until the day Esperanza's father does not come home from tending to the ranch. Suddenly Esperanza's life is turned upside. Her father is gone. El Rancho de las Rosas is slipping away. Esperanza and her mother are fleeing to California with nothing to find work as field workers. Worse, they have to leave Abuelita behind.Suddenly thrust into poverty, Esperanza feels lost. She and her mother are suddenly equal to the servants who helped them escape Mexico. Prejudice and inequality leap at Esperanza from everywhere. Nothing will ever be the same and the more Esperanza sees of America, the land of opportunity, the more she feels like she's sinking. Will Esperanza be able to rise about her circumstances and embrace her new life before it's too late in Esperanza Rising (2000) by Pam Mu&ntilde;oz Ryan?Esperanza Rising is a Pura Belpre Winner (Pura Belpre being an award that highlights distinguished work in literature and illustration by hispanic or latino authors--I'm not sure which is stated specifically in the award criteria). It's really popular and generally well-received. And it even has a play adaptation (apparently not playing anywhere right now, but you can see hints of it in an online search).All the same, I was initially extremely resistant to this book. I did not want to like it. The story starts depressing and, frankly, Esperanza starts off irritating. Having finished the book, I greatly regret that resistance.One of the coolest things about this book is that it's based on the true story of the author's grandmother's immigration to the United States. Like most of the books I've listed as possible pairings, it is a quintessential immigrant story. Esperanza has a lot of growing up to when she is forced to move to California. She faces a lot of hardships and learns a lot about herself and her inner strength.At its core Esperanza is, unsurprisingly, a story about hope and perseverance (esperanza means \\"hope\\" in Spanish). It is also a great introduction to the immigrant experience. While Esperanza remains at the center of the story, Ryan also touches upon the Depression, the Dust Bowl, social reform, and discrimination in this rich story.This story also shines a light on the not-always-well-known world of migrant farm workers in a respectful and informative way. That is not to say that the story itself is not interesting. Far from it. Esperanza Rising is a wonderful blend of everything good about contemporary and historical fiction; Ryan skillfully presents the time period while making Esperanza and her world approachable to modern readers of all ages.Possible Pairings: Ashes of Roses by Mary Jane Auch, Drown by Junot Diaz, Middlesex by Jeffrey Eugenides, From Ellis Island to JFK by Nancy Foner, The Namesake by Jhumpa Lahiri, Imagining America: Stories from the Promised Land by Amy Ling, ...y no se lo trag&oacute; la tierra / ...And the Earth Did Not Devour Him by Tomas Rivera and Evangelina Vigil-Pinon (translator), Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck, Bread Givers by Anzia Yezierska"},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"Esperanza Rising is about a girl named Esperanza, she is the daughter of a wealthy land owner in Mexico. But when her father is unexpectedly murdered she and her mother must flee to california and work as laborers on a farm, living in very poor conditions. Through out the book you watch Esperanza grow from a spoiled girl into a responsible young woman.There were a lot of themes running through out the book, I was very excited to see how it ended. Though I liked the ending (mostly) there were some things I didn't care for. I don't want to spoil it, but I will say that the last paragraph was kind of weird, and I think the author could of just as easily ended it in a much clearer, more sweet and interesting way.Some people may think this book is too sentimental, I didn't think that, but then again I am a very emotional person who likes a lot of sentiment in a book.Overall I found this book very touching and sweet, and it really went into my heart. It made me thankful for the simple things in life, like a roof over my head, plenty of food to eat, and comfy blankets to sleep under. Though it is definitely not David Copperfield or Pride and Prejudice, and I am not sure if I could really classify it as good literature, it would definitely make a good quick read for a rainy afternoon."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"you have to read this book if you haven't it is sad dangerous ....... and it keeps bulding up but you will have to read it to find out whether her mom dies or not"},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"Set during the Great Depression, Esperanza Rising is a lovely story of self-acceptance in a foreign environment. As told through the perspective of young Esperanza, the book begins with the characters comfortably living luxurious rancho life in Mexico- that is until Esperanza's father is tragically killed. Following his death, Esperanza and her mother have no other choice but to immigrate to California in order to find work. Thus begins their journey of assimilation within a new country and social class. Having lived a privileged life, it is not easy for Esperanza to remake herself while adjusting to life as a migrant farm worker.Teachers will appreciate the book's connections between the cultural, economical and political issues of California during the 1930's. This fantastic coming of age story corresponds with a historical backdrop of strikes and the labor movement, government sweeps, and injustice. Pam Munoz Ryan's fascinating book is based upon her maternal grandmother's experience of immigrating to California from Mexico. Esperanza's struggles and her ability to rise above her difficulties will surely spark conversation within the classroom. This book is great for whole class reading and as a link to exploring historical connections."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"This story follows Esperanza Ortega and her mother on their journey from living as wealthy landowners in Mexico to becoming migrant field workers in California around the time of the Great Depression. Esperanza must deal with her new knowledge of classism and racial prejudice, and comes to rely on herself as well as develop a new definition of family.Multiple people have recommended this book to me over time and I have to admit that I never found the premise to be particularly appealing. When I finally decided to give it a try, however, I found that I really enjoyed this book. The writing was descriptive and compelling--I read it in a day! It is clear from the beginning of the story that Esperanza will need to struggle and develop in a number of ways, but she is never written in such a way that she is unlikeable. The story can be discouraging at times, as the life that is described regarding these migrant workers is harsh but the book ends on a hopeful note. Overall, I thought this was beautifully written and was a very insightful look into a culture I was previously unfamiliar with."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"My daughter who is 10 and in 4th grade absolutely loved this book!

This book is based upon the stories a grandmother told her granddaughter, the author. The grandmother is Esperanza. Esperanza and her recently widowed mother make the difficult decision to leave Mexico, where they lived the lives of royalty to come to America, the land of the free. They leave with their servants who are now their equals and Esperanza learns the true meaning of \\"The rich take care of the rich, the poor take care of the poor\\". She sees firsthand the poorest of the poor giving away their food and help to those in even more need than they themselves face, and later is both giver and taker of doing just that.*This is the first book I have read/listened to that tells the story of the Mexican Emigrants and the hardships they faced after coming to America, where \\"everybody\\" has a chance at becoming rich. It tells how they were looked down upon because they were brown skinned and therefore must be dumb, even if in Mexico, they had had a better education and/or training than the white Americans. Reduced to rags and poor poverty like conditions, they struggled to feed their families. American born Mexicans were deported to Mexico because of setting up strikes and trying to make things better for everybody. Mexicans, who were reduced to digging and laying tracks for the railroad, even if they knew the mechanics of how the engines work and how to fix them. This is one of those subjects I have never before heard as it was not taught in the schools I attended, whether for geographical reasons (Wisconsin), or because if it isn't in the books, it didn't happen or for whatever reason.*My husband's great grandparents brought their family to America from Mexico, when his grandpa was a young boy. My husband's great grandfather came here to work as a railroad worker. As his grandfather has passed away, I don't know that we will ever hear what really happened when they came to America, but I can only pray that they did not face the prejudices that the people did in Esperanza Rising. I pray that whatever happened to my husband's family when they came here, that they too, like Esperanza rose above it and became stronger people because of it, not hardened and calloused, but better people because of their circumstances."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"CHANTAL'S REVIEW- ESPERANZA RISING is a fictional book that tells the story of a girl who grew up rich and then had to learn how to live like a peasant.

I was able to completely submerge myself in the story line and create visual representations of the story events and picture them through the lenses of the different characters. The reader is able to see the progression and character development of the people most significant to the story. The language and style of the story line are in sync with the genre of the novel and accurately depict the time frame for which it is set on. Also, story does accurately portray the values and norms of the culture depicted. The language and narrative make a point to incorporate the use of the Spanish language, which make the story feel more realistic and credible. Most importantly the story line theme does make a point to bring about a relevant understanding of the problems facing this culture today as it pertained to its past. All in all, I feel this book gives much to tell of the Latino culture and the issues facing its communities in this country today. I consider the use of this book in a classroom setting because I feel students especially those that can identify with this culture will be able to draw great conversations and reflective thinking which can be transmitted in productive writing assignments."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"My son really enjoyed this book!!

This is a very inspiring and unique book set in the 1930s about a girl named Esperanza. She initially lives in Mexico and through a series of tragic events, goes from riches to rags. This includes her beloved father being killed by bandits hired by Esperanza's evil uncle, and a terrifying house fire that she almost takes her life. The family is left with a terrible decision to either give into the uncle's wretched demands or to leave the land they know and love.Esperanza goes on the road with her mother to America to escape her uncle. Though devastating, this experience helps her appreciate what she still has--family and love. This appreciation is strengthened when she finds herself actually having to work not only for herself, but also for her now ill mother. She settles into a work camp located miles away from the land she knew all her life as home, and soon learns all too well what hard work is really like.This is a wonderful book that I recommend for kids in middle school. Spanish words, Mexican culture, and traditions are woven in throughout the story, making it even more fun to root for Esperanza. Esperanza means \\"hope\\" in Spanish, so the title literally means Hope Rising. The author actually modeled this story around her grandmother's life, and I enjoyed being able to share in her adventure."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"I loved this book. I sat down and read it in one sitting because I could not wait to find out what happens to Esperanza! It is a book that goes beyond a great cultural kid's book.

But, as many of those immigrants did she rises above the deplorable circumstances and makes a life for herself. A feel good book for all ages."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"Esperanza Rising Book Review:By Camille T.

Her father is killed by robbers and her evil uncle who happens to be mayor says that Esparanza's land is all theirs. He makes his mother take his hand in marriage, but they obviously think differently because they escape from Mexico and go with their house servants. She moves to a desert land in California and she has to do common servant work. At first Esparanza is torn and she says she can never be happy working like that, but Esparanza learns from the people she lives with and especially a kind boy named Miguel.

One devastating day, a horrible event happened and Esperanza had to move to California and start a new life. Once she moves to California her madre (mother) and Esperanza have to become farm workers. Esperanza has never worked in her life for anybody or anything so it was a new life for her. Little did Esperanza know her uncles wanted a ranch for themselves and her mother wanted it also. Esperanza's uncle asks for her mothers hand in marriage so they can both share the ranch. But Esperanza's uncle was seeking revenge so he burnt down the house. While they burn down the house the uncle hurts Esperanza's Abuelita (grandmother).

I loved how it portrays a story of a young girl discovering different levels in society. In the book a young girl named Esperanza looses here father when bandits attack his caravan. Her wealthy uncle demands that her mother marry him, or he'll take away De Rancho De Las Rosa's, her fathers ranch. When Esperanza and her mother refuse the uncles burn the ranch down. With no place to go Esperanza, her mother, and her family friends flee to America to work. When they arrive Esperanza does not wish to grasp the concept that she is no longer a rich young woman but a poor immigrant with not much left. In the book everyone goes threw hardships I could not imagine happening to me. I loved this book because it showed a tremendous amount of courage and the love that your family and friends will give you during hard times. Esperanza in the beginning seemed like a spoiled brat, but when she discovers that living in America is her new life she begins to appreciate everything that she has. Esperanza was a great inspiration to me while I read this book. The only thing that I didn't like about this book was her selfishness. But it was a good way to portray her character. For me the vocabulary wasn't very strong. But then again the book was kind of for a lower level.

It is also historical fiction, based on the author's family. There is an epilogue that explains historical reality during that era (Great Depression, San Joaquin Valley) I would strongly recommend this book, as a teacher, and as a person who just loves to read."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"When I read this book it got somewhat exciting in the middle and the end but the beginning was sort of borring. other people may think differently, I have heard many great reveiws for this book."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"The book that I am reading is called Esperanza Rising. It is by Pam Munoz Ryan and she also wrote the book called Riding Freedom. This book is mostly about a 13 year old girl named Esperanza Oretga. She is living a wonderful, pleasant, rich, and comfortable life at a ranch that her father owns called El Rancho de las Rosas. Many people lived at the ranch like Ezperanza's family, the house servants, the vaqueros, the campesinos, and Hortensia, the housekeeper whom Esperanza loves very much. The next day was Esperanza's birthday and she was waiting for a big celebration like every year. But, when her papa went out with all the other ranchers to deliver grapes, he didn't come back. Alfonso (Hortensia's husband) and Miguel (Hortensia's son) just came back with a big wagon revealing Papa's body.The day after Papa died was her big celebration birthday, but she didn't have it because of her father's death. He had bought her a birthday gift before, and when she opened it, it was a doll that looked like an angel and she had a whole collection. Later, her evil uncles Tio Luis and Tio Marco came to her house and asked for Mama's hand in marriage. Of course Mama said no, and that was when all the trouble happened. Tio Luis and Tio Marco made it very hard for Esperanza and her family and later, they burned the house down. So, Esperanza's family decided to leave secretly and Mama lied to Tio Luis and said she would marry him. They had to leave to California to work there in the fields, and since Abuelita, Esperanza's grandmother was going to come later because of her broken ankle, they were having a hard time.The reason I liked this book was because it really reminded me of what I&iexcl;ve been through. Sure, I haven&iexcl;t always been in harsh situations like a fire, death of family, or separation, but it really resembles my life. The quote that really helped me and touched me said,&iexcl; He who falls today may rise tomorrow.&iexcl; Esperanza is almost like me. She is 13 years old, she is very depressed in life, and she believes that she will, someday rise again. I also believe that I will fall, but I will always rise again. This book taught me that I can be strong in life, and whenever I feel lonely like I am in a dark pit, I am sure to reach the top of the mountain and be strong again. I also liked this book a lot because all of the chapters were named after a fruit or vegetable and there was a reason why in each chapter.The reason I disliked this book was because it had a lot of words I didn&iexcl;t understand in here. They had words in Spanish I didn&iexcl;t understand so I tried to read the words surrounding the Spanish word, but I still couldn&iexcl;t understand it. Some of the words had the meaning with it, but some words didn&iexcl;t. &iexcl;Then she gave her a phony smile and said, &iexcl;Entiendes?&iexcl;&iexcl; Another reason I didn&iexcl;t like this book was because a snobby girl name Marta and all her American friends would always make fun of Esperanza just because she didn&iexcl;t know how to work. One time, because she didn&iexcl;t know how to use the broom they said,&iexcl;&iexcl;La Cenicienta! Cinderella!&iexcl; she laughed.&iexcl;My favorite part in this book was when Esperanza, Mama, Hortensia, Miguel, and Alfonso were on the train. Esperanza expected it to be pretty and comfortable, but instead it turned out to be dirty, crowded, and very uncomfortable. The train was filled with peasants that were looking for a job in California. Esperanza had to realize that now she was a peasant too. What really meant something to me was when a poor grandmother gave Mama 2 red chickens when she only had 6 chicken and had 10 children to feed. That lady also gave a peasant crawling on the floor some food and money. I couldn&iexcl;t believe that a poor person gave a peasant money and food when she was poor herself. This book is one of my favorites and I definitely recommend you to read it yourself."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"Esperanza Rising is the story of a girl gaining maturity as she is forced to experience the bitter side of life. The book is full of love, hope, and inspiration. It gives a wonderful sense of what in would have been like to be a migrant worker during the Great Depression. It was a time of great struggle and that shows through as Esperanza fights to keep her family together. As each chapter focuses of food, it reminds me of Like Water for Chocolate and the wonderful recipes that held that story together. The fruits and vegetables created very strong imagery and really tied the whole story together in the end. I loved this book and would recommend it to young and old. It is a story of struggle and triumph and one that makes your heart sing as Esperanza wins her struggle."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"I bought this book for my Children's Literature class because it was said to be in good condition, but the cover was noticeably defaced, and under my expectations"},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"Book review Esperanza RisingChelsea Morales 3/4/04This is a wonderful book by Pam Munoz Ryan about a girl named Ezperanza.

G...Period: 5The book Esperanza Rising is about a teenage girl named Esperanza who lives on El Rancho de las Rosas in Aguascalientes, Mexico. Esperanza always thought she would have a perfect life with big parties and pretty dresses, but something bad happened to her. One evening, the day before Esperanza's birthday, her father was out and got attacked by bandits. Miguel and Alfonso, Haotennsia's (the housekeeper) son and husband, went out to look for the remains of her father, but all they found was his belt buckle. The following day, Esperanza's father's stepbrother, Tio Luis asked Ramona, her mother, in marriage. She said no because Esperanza and Ramona didn't like him, he got so mad that he started a fire in their house so he could build a bigger house. During the fire, Abuelita, her grandmother got hurt. Finally, Ramona said yes, but she went with Hortensia and her family to California to find a job. Abuelita would follow them after she got well. When they moved to California, everything didn't go that well. One day when everyone was out, a big dust storm arrived. When they came back, Esperanza's mother got ill and coughed non-stop. She had to go to the hospital and Esperanza had to work hard to get her mother well and also had to get Abulieta to California. When Esperanza started working a strike was going on for more money. The government couldn't take it and tried to gather all of them and send them to Mexico. Miguel stole Esperanza's money without telling her, but surprised her at the train station with Abuelita. Everyone was glad she could reunite with her family.I thought this book was excellent because it had great characters. \\"Mija, it is all we can afford.\\" Esperanza's mother was telling Esperanza that they didn't have money and had to start a new life. Esperanza wasn't ready to start over because she loved celebrating at big fiestas and being able to wear pretty dresses. Esperanza had to start over by living in California, but if she didn't she would have to live with Tio Luis, her uncle that she hated. She gave it a try and everything didn't go that bad at all.\\"We got a message from Miguel.\\" Hortensia and Alfonso stopped Esperanza from working and had to bring her to the train station. She didn't know what was going on. When she arrived at the station, the train just arrived. Miguel came out and she still didn't know what was going on. The last person that stepped out of the train made Esperanza very shocked. It was Abulieta. Abuelita and Esperanza were so glad to see each other. Esperanza showed Abulieta where Ramona was and everyone was glad that Abuelita came back.My least favorite part of the book was when Esperanza's mother, Ramona, got ill and coughed from a dust storm. This was my least favorite part because Esperanza was having a hard time because she thought she would lose her mother after her father died and when Abuelita was far away. This was the saddest part of the book, but it ended by when everyone living happily ever after because Abulieta came after a year had gone by. This was a great book and it will want you to keep on reading."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"Pam Munoz Ryan does a wonderful job in Esperanza Rising of portraying the hardship that a family does through when devastation occurs. The trials and tribulations of losing everything you have ever known and moving to another country to find prosperity and a new life.

It has won multiple awards such as: the ALA Best Book for Young Adults Award, the Los Angeles Times Finalist Books Award, the New York Public Library Award, the Willa Carter Award, and the Jane Addams Award. Why has this book won so many awards? Only you can know, by reading this emotional book.This historical fiction story dates back 81 years to the Great Depression, and takes place in Aquascalientes, Mexico and Los Angeles, California. It is written in third person point of view. The author uses the life of the main character, Esperanza, to identify many themes. Some of the themes are coping with death and emotional pain, and learning to overcome the obstacles of life.When Esperanza was young, she lived happily. She often got whatever she wanted and thought her life was perfect. Sadly, the day before she turned 15 her papa died. Her Uncles burn down their beautiful ranch the same day in order to continue her Uncle Luis&iexcl;s plan to propose to Esperanza&iexcl;s mom. She says yes, but has another idea to move to a harvest in California with their 3 servants Hortensia, Alfonso, and Miguel. What they don&iexcl;t know is that the U.S. is in a time of crisis called the Great Depression. When they get to the harvest, Esperanza is not used to dirty work and is treated like a peasant. Unfortunately, her mother gets terribly sick after a dusty dust storm swept the camp. She is forced to be without her mother for 5 months and must pay for all the medical bills and food! The troubles and experiences that Esperanza has make her character easy to relate to. That is why I give this book 5 out of 5 stars.

Wow, the characters from this story pass really hard moments. For example, losing your dad, and migrating from Mexico to the United States, that has to be difficult, well it is. They move into bad situations; however, they find a way to get over it and make a better life.I really adore when the author adds descriptive parts in the story, because when you're reading you can really imagine the story taking action in your imagination, and that's the time of person I am. Esperanza Rising is a magnificent story that clearly releases Esperanza's feelings. It talks allot about their daily lives.

When her father is killed by bandits, she, her mother, and their servants are put in a precarious position. They cannot maintain the ranch without Papa and so the servants--Hortencia, Miguel, and Alfonso decide to move north and seek agricultural work in America. A series of events requires Esperanza and her mother to flee Mexico as well, and the five make their way to Southern California and begin working the fields to make a life for themselves. Life is hard for Esperanza because she is used to a life of luxury, but she feels the pressure to perform duties just like anyone else in order to avoid the shame and embarrassment of not knowing how to do the work. She works hard and undergoes a transformation as she adjusts to her new life.I loved this book for a few reasons. The book is gives a voice to migrant workers and is told beautifully. I think with the current climate in my country regarding immigration, this book is very valuable to understanding the mind of an immigrant worker. The book personifies the resilience and perseverance of immigrants in the United States despite working and living conditions that were less than desirable. These immigrants came to America in search of a better life which the country was known for. The poem by Emma Lazarus on the Statue of Liberty showed the welcoming of newcomers to America with these words:\\"...Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!\\"People flocked to the U.S. in search of this idea of prosperity. The characters of Esperanza Rising embody this hope of prosperity while encountering the everyday challenges that were typical during The Great Depression. Overall, whether you are of school age or an adult, I think this book is a great way to understand the mindset of many immigrants throughout history in the United States. I absolutely loved this novel and think that the subject matter could not be more relevant in American society today. I highly recommend reading it so that we can start a better dialogue in the United States about immigration policy."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"My son loves the message in this book.

Her father had just died and now Esperanza, her mother, and three of their servants leave Mexico and head for the fields of California. This is her story."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"Pam Munoz Ryan's \\"Esperanza Rising\\" is a terrific book for readers probably ages 10 and above. Some high-ability readers could succeed in reading it sooner, but it's a little emotional for under second grade. Esperanza is a very rich, very pampered and beloved Mexican girl, a girl treated like a princess on her huge grape rancho in Mexico. A tragedy strips her of her riches, her family, and her pride.She and her mother escape to the US. They find work in the agricultural migrant camps of the San Joaquin Valley. Because the story is set during the 1930s, competition for jobs is fierce among the groups: the Okies, the Japanese, the Mexicans.Esperanza doesn't want to face her new reality, that she is expected to live in a tiny hut with so many people, wear old clothes, and change baby diapers!When her mother falls ill, Experanza must work even harder, which she did not know would be possible, side by side with the women in the camp.She learns a lot about life and the importance of her family and even how to share. Money begins to take a different priority when it means food, not parties and china dolls. She begins to see Miguel, formerly a servant too low for her to associate with, in a new way that doesn't place her \\"on the other side of the river\\" as he was in Mexican society. Miguel finds America's open opportunities appealing and hopeful for an ambitious young man.This is a well-written, emotional journey. I recommend it to American parents to read with their children, children who may think life is way too hard on them."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"I loved this book. Is was funny, sad, touching, and all the ingredients to a good book. I highly recommend, and I am certain that you won't be disappointed in this novel. This is aimed toward kids, but this appeals to all ages.OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS:RulesTouch BlueEvery Soul A StarSmall as an Elephant"},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"This poignant picture of the daily life of Mexican migrant farm workers living in a California work camp was inspired by the life of the author's grandmother. It's painted so carefully that young readers experience the seemingly insurmountable situations and hardships as Esperanza lives them. The unconquerable love of family members for one another enables them to endure until things get better.As Esperanza's life unfolds so does the issue of what is fair treatment for migrants. It's an uplifting survival story simply, but beautifully, depicted as though the reader is watching on a giant screen. Teachers who use this book as a classroom study will have an open door to discussing the difficulties families faced because of the Great Depression."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"I gave this rating because I think it truly deserved and I really loved everything about this book it was awesome."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"I stumbled across this book looking for a novel that touches on some SS content.

M. (2000). Esperanza Rising. New York. Scholastic.Synopsis: The story is about Esperanza, a Mexican girl who had to immigrate to the United States after her father died and they lost their land. Esperanza had to undergo many changes in her new life in the United States because in Mexico she came from a rich family and even had servants. Here in the U.S. her mother and she worked hard in the fields of California picking fruits. Her mother became very sick after a dust storm and was hospitalized. Esperanza continued to work the field while her mother was fighting her sickness in the hospital. All her hard work paid off and she was able to bring her grandmother to the US, to help with Esperanza's mother's recuperation.Evaluation: The book tells a well written story about the relationship between three generations of Mexican women, Esperanza, her mother, and grandmother. It follows the typical literary elements. It does not include any other illustrations beside the one on the cover. It portrays a little girl with long hair which is typical of Mexican girls. The story sets around Esperanza, and how she deals with the great change that has taken place in her life after the death of her father. She is forced to adjust her new life but at first is reluctant to accept her new status. She goes from being a rich child with servants to a poor child that has to work long hours in the fields of California. During this time, the field workers were organizing massive strikes to achieve better pay and working conditions. This book provides insight and understanding about problems with immigrate workers in the past and also relate to today's problem with Mexican immigrant workers and their struggle to become legal immigrant workers. It accurately reflects the values and spirit of the time because field workers had difficulties getting proper wages and working conditions so they were and are continuously being exploited. Esperanza fears loosing her job because that is the only way she can save money to help her sick mother. Her life story is told by the seasons of the fruits being picked in the fields. This story accurately depicts the values and norms of the culture because Mexican people value their families and their work. Also, it accurately depicts the strong female bond between the generations of women. Along with valuing family and work, another value that is evident in the book is religion. The Mexican farm in which Esperanza and her mother stay, they build a throne for the Virgin of Guadalupe which is a very important religious person in Mexican culture. This adds to the authenticity of the story. The characters have the same characteristics a Mexican person would display. The dialogue also seems authentic for the time and the characters. The author uses Spanish words and phrases that remind us that their native language was not English and that at that time; Esperanza did not speak English yet. According to the author, some fictional dialogue and events are added but do not change the main plot of the story. The author provides background information about the story to inform the reader about what facts were and what was fictitious about the story. The author also provides instructions on how to make the yarn dolls that the main character, Esperanza made in the story which adds a touch of realism to the story. The appropriate reading level would be fourth or fifth grade. One classroom instruction idea would be to have students pretend they are Esperanza and they could keep a daily journal about the difficulties she is facing. There probably will not be any major issues or concerns in using this book."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"I read this Book over the weekend and it overwelmed me this book definetly desrves 2 thumbs up what I love is that even though she delt with her father dieing, being hundreds of miles away from her grandmother, and her mother being ill she still had hope that things would get better"},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"In the book Esperanza Rising,I learn that riches aren't everything.

Overall, GREAT BOOK!!!"},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"Pam Munoz Ryan's Esperanza Rising is an inspiring book that proves with hope and togetherness families can overcome unfortunate circumstances. In the novel, the main character Esperanza -which translates to hope - is a rich, pampered girl in Mexico. In the city of Aguascalientes, Esperanza's father, a ranch owner, is shot and killed by bandits while mending a fence. Esperanzas father's evil stepbrothers plot to gain the land after his death. Although Sexto left the land to his wife and daughter, one of the corrupt stepbrothers was the owner of the bank with which the mortgage was held and the other was mayor of the city. After Tio Marco, the stepbrother, proposed marriage to Ramona (Esperanza's mother) with the threat of losing her land hanging of her head, she agreed only to gain time to plot an escape. Before the escape, Uncle Tio burns down the house and much of the land.After being forced to flee their land, Esperanza and her mother escape with servants to a migrant camp in California. Neither one was ready for the hard labor, financial struggles, or working conditions. The transformation from a luxurious lifestyle to a hard-working family allows Esperanza to mature from a pampered rich girl to a compassionate young woman. In the book, Esperanza's mother gets sick and although she wants to give up, she can't. Esperanza has to rise above her difficult circumstances in order to live.---------------Esperanza Rising links with both themes: Living in Fear/Finding Hope and Families in Crisis/Families Dealing with Change. Extended family also play a role in the novel as Miguel and his family (ex-servants of the Ortegas) create family ties with Esperanza and her mother in order to help them deal with change and to find hope in the migrant community where they live. Another prevalent theme is acceptance. Miguel, who becomes Esperanza's source of hope and best friend, teaches Anza that not everyone is accepting of others who are different. Miguel drives a long distance to visit an Asian grocer instead of the many stores before that one. He says that Mr. Yakota is kind to Mexicans while others see them as uneducated, dirty, and poor.The book is a definite choice in a middle-school classroom."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"This book is the true to life story of Esperanza Ortega by Pam Munoz Ryan.

She moves to the U.S. from Mexico so her and her mama can work. Through out the book she faces allot of obstacles. But every thing eventually gets better. She realizes that other people have it worse then her. I think every one should read Esperanza Rising because it is a good example of how people over came obstacles in their lives. It is also a good book because you can probably relate to one of the characters and their situations. You can also get a good feeling on what the characters are feeling in the book.The theme of Esperanza Rising is over coming problems. The reason I say this is because she has allot of problems and always seems to over come them. An example is when she moves to the U.S. she thinks her life is going to be horrible. But then she realizes other people have it worse lives then her. Also an example is when her mom gets sick and she never has a doubt in her mind that she will get better and she does. That is what the theme of Esperanza Rising is.In Esperanza Rising you can relate to one of the characters and their problems in the book. The characters in the book have problems allot of people have. Like for example when Esperanza loses her dad aloe of people lose there family. Also in the book Esperanza and her family don't have aloe of money. Many people have that problem to. You can also relate to aloe of the feelings in the book.The setting in Esperanza Rising is very believable. I think this because they describe the house they live in and its not very good. Back then aloe of people lived in bad houses. They also talked about the field's aloe. They also talked houses the out houses. Witch they had to use back then. She also talks about how hot it can be. The setting is very interesting it makes me feel like I am in the book.Overall I think anyone and everyone who has overcame situations in there life's should read Esperanza Rising. This book gave me a strong feeling on what the characters where feeling in the book. I also felt that I could relate to Esperanza because she has allot of problems in her life and so do I. This book also helped me understand other people and their cutlers. I know if you read this book you will feel like you where in the book.

Book review.Esperanza Rising is a great story about girl who believed that her life would be wonderful forever. She would always live on her family's ranch in Mexico. She would always have fancy dresses and a beautiful home filled with servants. Papa and Abuelita would always be with her.But a sudden tragedy shatters her world and forces Esperanza and Mama to flee to California, where they settle in a camp for Mexican farm workers. Esperanza isn't ready for the hard labor, financial struggles brought on by the Great Depression, and lack of acceptance she now faces. When Mama get sick, and a strike for better working conditions threatens to uproot their new life, Esperanza must find a way to rise above her difficult circumstance- because Mama's life and her own depend on it.The day before Esperanza's birthday her father was really late for diner. Her mother send their servants to look for her father. When they came back they told Esperanza's mother that he died. Poor people killed him. Esperanza couldn't believe it. She lost only one person that she could trust. She knew after her father died everything would be different. Her mother and her couldn't stay in their house any more, because in Mexico woman couldn't own the ranch. The ranch and house will be Esperanza's uncle. Her uncle where really mean to her, he ask her mother to marry him and he burned their house. Esperanza's mother told him \\"no\\". Esperanza's mother and her decide to leave Mexico and go to the California in United States. Esperanza will have to work there, because she need support her mother and her. When she came to California she didn't know how to cook or clean. She didn't know the language too. Esperanza needed to learn how to clean, cook, and work really hard.Esperanza Rising is a great story. I learned a lot from this book. The message of this book is that doesn't matter if you have a hard time or you have a serious problem, you need to remember that people who loves you and care about you, always will help you and always will take care of you. I learned from Esperanza Rising that you need to be always strong, doesn't matter what kind problem you have you still need to be strong. In this book Esperanza is really strong. She going through a lot of problem and she still strong, she is not giving up. Esperanza Rising is a great story, its not just a story, it's a true story!"},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"As a 30-something mom, I recently started reading some newer (well, newer to ME) young adult literature. Basically, I was bored one day, had picked up a boxful of books (brand new!) from a retired teacher, and just started reading them...Let me just say there are some amazing novels out there for kids! More than just Harry Potter (which I also happen to love!). Anyhow, I fell in love with Esperanza. I cried with her. I felt I was a part of her journey. I rallied with her as she rose up with strength and determination. The ending brought me to tears. I highly recommend this book for anyone 8 & older. There isn't anything inappropriate in it for younger children, I just think that those 8 & up will get more out of it."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"I read this for Bookfest last year, and everyone else in the group hated it! I thought it was really good, though. It shows what it was like to go from riches to rags an be treated unfairly. Esperanza is kind but kind of confused because she doesn't know how to work. This is very good and I think anyone could like it if they tried. Because for alot of books, when someone looks at it, they think they're going to hate it. So then they try to hate it, and they end up disliking it. Please do not do that to this book. It's very well written with a good story."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"Esperanza Rising ia heart warming book that is portrayed through the eyes of the author, Pam Munoz Ryan. The third person narrator or Ryan makes it seem like you can feel everything they are. Expressing each character's feelings like it's a whole other character.Esperanza Rising is a non-fiction book that resembles Rags To Riches the movie. Happy, sad, than back to happy by the stories end, with the mood only making the story better.If your at home and have some time I recommend this book to anyone who likes touching stories that could change your perspective on life!"},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"Although there were parts of this book that seemed interesting, in the long-run it wasn't one that sparked my interest. I would say this book would be a drama/adventure and it's not my favorite genre. I decided to give this book a 3 because it wasn't my favorite book but it wasn't the worst book.I would only recommend this book to someone who is an avid reader and is good at taking in even the littlest details from not-all-that interesting texts. In the story I liked the structure of how one thing symbolized a whole part of the story. For example Munoz used the stitches in her sewing as a part of the life of Esperanza (up and down). Most of the conflicts I lost interest in because Esperanza wasn't a very good main character. Usually in stories the main character is up- beat about making a change, but Esperanza is stubborn almost the whole book about that and acts like a Princess. If Esperanza would have handled things like going to the camp and losing her home better, I probably would have liked the book better. My most favorite thing in the book however was how she used fruits as the name as chapters and worked them into the story about pinpointing them on that one fruit."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"\\"Esperanza Rising\\",written by Pam Munoz Ryan, brings you gracefuly into the life of Esperanza, a used-to-be wealthy girl from Mexico during the Great Depression. When a horrible fire destroys the life she once knew and after her two uncles betray her, Esperanza must learn not only how to move on, but also how to live a life of a California migrant farm worker.Ryan walks you through the hardships Esperanza faced as if she went through them as well. She does so with such an ease that when you learn in the afterward that it is based on her grandmother's own experiences you understand how Ryan accomplished such a writing feat.While reading this book I always felt that the mood was a metaphor for how to turn somthing bad into an unforgettable experience. After I finished my mind buzzed with thoughts and although it may sound cliche, it was life changing in a sense. It made me understand how that \\"when life gives you lemons you make lemonade\\".This book although is historical fiction, you feel like you are relating to the plot more and more with every turn of a page. I highly recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"This one wasnt my favorite but, it is a pretty good book.

I loved it as it interested her in woman's suffrage, history and the independence and stuff that women needed (and need). We couldn't wait for Esperanza Rising and neither of us was disapppointed. This book is simply beautiful. A truly special book for a mother and daughter to read together. It chronicles Esperanza's journey from her storybook youth in Mexico to the reality of hard work, racism and classism faced by her and her mother when they are forced to flee to the United States. The mother is elegant, strong and a wonderful role model for Esperanza. Esperanza does not dissappoint her mother's expectations and becomes strong and vibrant in her own way. Once again, Pam Munoz Ryan made history for the young so interesting, my daughter didn't want to put the book down. In addition, the book is beautifully crafted. From the hills and valley's of Abuelita's blankets to the fruit which entitles each chapter, the symbolizm is not lost on the young reader and it is cherised by the adult."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"With a story that parallels the actual experiences of her grandmother, Pam Munoz Ryan has fashioned a moving and inspirational tale. It is ably read by the talented Trini Alvarado.Esperanza Ortega lived a privileged existence in Aguascacientes, Mexico during the early 1920s. Her luxurious family home was tended by servants, and she anticipated a lifetime of ease when she grew up and came to oversee El Rancho de las Rosas.Her dream was shattered when Esperanza and her mother were forced to leave Mexico and migrate to a company owned farm labor camp in California. Now, not only were their days defined by drudgery but many of their own people did not accept them. All of this was exacerbated by the Great Depression and its attendant economic difficulties.The plight of the migrant workers is vividly presented in this poignant novel so thoughtfully read by Ms. Alvarado."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"Pam Muniz has become a \\"3 thumbs up\\" writer of \\"the changes in life.\\" She will make you laugh, feel sad, and be impressed about the books.

If you are some one that love s to read about childhood crushes then the beginning of the story is right for you. (This was also on of my favorite parts, too.)Another book that is similar to this is Out of the Dust. This book is abut during the same time period. I think if you enjoy Esperanza Rising, you will like this book, too. It's about the same but with different characters and problems."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"Esperanza Rising is a very unique story about the journey of a young Spanish girl, Esperanza Ortega Munoz Hernandez Elegart. Unlike any book I have ever read, it was easy to get caught up in rooting for Esperanza. Spanish words, culture and traditions are woven in throughout the story. Pam Munoz Ryan was inspired to write this story from the tales her own abuela told her as a child. Esperanza Rising will inspire you to enjoy what you have, persevere in the trials in your life, and not be afraid to try new things.There are many poor individuals in Mexico; however Esperanza has everything a young girl her age could wish for: lovely dresses, expensive dolls, and her own maid to play with and clean up after her. Of all these things, her most valuable possession is the abundance of love she has from her Mama and Papa. Esperanza spends her days outdoors in the beauty of nature doing whatever she feels like at the moment. Her Papa always gives her whatever she wishes; Esperanza doesn't realize how very blessed she is. Yet this is not meant to last forever.It is harvest time, Esperanza's most favorite days. Each day is long and lazy with the pleasant aroma of green vines full of plump grapes about to drop. Also, each year after harvest time there is a great fiesta with singing, feasting and gifts for Esperanza's birthday. This year was to be even more special for she was turning thirteen. Every year for her birthday, Esperanza knows she can count on receiving a beautiful porcelain doll from her loving Papa, but a tragedy causes this to be the last time that she ever will. She and her mother's lives are turned upside down and they are forced to immigrate away from the ranch they know and love. Esperanza cringes away from the dirt and poor way of life, so strikingly different from what she is used to. For instance her new chores of sweeping and caring for babies would better be done by girls half her age. In spite of her haughty attitude there is much for her to learn here from people who have genuine joy and love for each other. Will Esperanza give up or will she persevere through the trials.At first, every night she cries herself to sleep from the horrible ache of missing her dear papa. The fairy-tale life full of splendor was over and made way for the new simple life. In many ways it was better than before because of what she had learned. At first Esperanza feared she would never be happy here far from home, but all that changed. By keeping a positive attitude and not being afraid of new things, Esperanza was able to rise above her doubts and fears.Esperanza Rising will inspire you to enjoy what you have, persevere in the trials in your life, and not be afraid to try new things. Simple pleasures are the best things in life. Hard-earned food and shelter are much more enjoyable when you deserve them, Esperanza learns. She will never, ever forget her past and her heart will never stop aching for Papa, but she can live a joyful life with those she loves and is loved by."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"Yo, Yo, Yo, Pay attention I'm telling you about a great book.

I found this story educational and inspiring. Esperanza is presented as a spoiled little rich girl who slowly comes to realize what is really important to her. There are richly developed characters, including the peasant boy, Miguel, who she's grown up with, but who is now an equal, rather than a servant.I found the story educational- this is a part of American history that most everyday Americans know little about. It also seems current, given the current immigration discussions in Washington. After reading the novel, it gave me a new perspective on this issue.I highly recommend this for young adults and adults to read. This would be an excellent book to read aloud to students or younger children."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"One of the class novels for our 6th grade class is Esperanza Rising.

I'm only up to the 60 or so pages, but it's so exciting. It's sad it's sort of funny and is just the best. Esperanza has her rising and falling moments. My teacher even reccomends this to kids for reading groups, because it's sooo interesting. So, buy this book, and read into Esperanza's life, ups and downs."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"Esperanza RisingThe book Esperanza Rising is about a 14 year-old girl moving from Mexico to California. She finds out that her dad is gone and they must leave their home and her favorite grandma after the fire destroys their home in Mexico. It will not be easy to start a new life if her uncle is starting her every move. In my opinion, the book, Esperanza Rising, is one that I recommend. Any girl that is having a difficult time will love this book.The main theme in the story is mostly about Esperanza changing into a woman. Throughout the story you can see how she improves her life skills. She also learns a valuable lesson. You can't always rely on people for them to help you in life all the time. You need to try on your own or you won't learn a thing. Esperanza goes through a lot in the story. The author shows many examples of Esperanza's difficulties in the book. Her dad dieing, the house fire, and leaving her grandmother behind are just some examples in the story.The character Esperanza is growing independent by doing stuff she had never done before. She is taking baths without help, sweeping, feeding babies, and even taking care of a sick person. Those are just some of the things that she does in the story after moving to California. You can tell the author took time to develop the character because she is described so well in the story. The novel explains by inference that Esperanza really is.I think where Esperanza lives is important because it tells you about her language, culture, atmosphere, and life style. Also the life style tells what Esperanza and her family do on special occasions. Every Sunday the family would go to a party. My opinion is that they don't really talk about the city or town a lot. That is something the author could have added to the novel.My opinion on the book, Esperanza Rising is it has a lot of history in it, if you like history it would be a perfect novel for you. I also recommend the book to any girl, because of some of the parts in the story you can relate to Esperanza, and sometimes I think that is cool. I even recommend it to girls who don't read a lot it would your first and best book you ever read. I think it contacts you like that, because how amazing it is. And by how it compares thinks that they did back then to now. Like how they did laundry by hand and toke cold baths and your whole family little to big wash in it. And how they made food over fire because they had no microwaves. It well just fascinate you well want to read the book over and over again."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"This story is about a girl named Esperanza whose life was just perfect until a terrible event happened. It had changed the girl's entire life forever. Esperanza's life has gone upside down and now Esperanza must learn to accept her new surroundings. Esperanza must face new challenges in which she has never faced before. In the end, she would be a more mature and more responsible person. Her path to gain that was exhausting, but with her strong determination, this girl has proven that she can fit in with her environment.I like this book because it involves a girl going through changes in her life in which she must overcome. It tells me that determination can overcome all challenges that are in a person's path. I also like it because the author is really good at describing the story. I had a visual of the story as I read the book. I like it a lot. Also, this story has a lot of emotions that are really touching. I felt a bit of tears running down my cheek as I read it. I hope that anyone who reads this book will like it as much as I do.I would definitely recommend this book to someone who likes books with emotions. It will definitely interest people who like to read books about Mexicans and what it was for them to live in America long ago. I would also recommend it to people who would like to read stories in which there are sudden changes in a person's life. But I hope that everyone who reads this book will like it."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"When I read Esperanza rising what caught my eye was that the writer used showing not telling details. To me it felt like I was there right beside Esperanza feeling the pain of loosing her dad and having to move far away into a camp where you feel as if you don't belong. I don't know how that feels, but when I was reading this book I felt like I did! It also shows you how it was back then when people were forced to do manual labor for 5 cents and that's not far. When I was finished reading this book I felt like I finnaly understood why they did and why they didn't complain. And it was to feed their family and back then and now family is very important and family members should do whatever they can to help a person in need. That is what I got from this book. To me it was a very important concept.So yes I deffinently reccomend this book for people who like a book that you could put your self in it and feel like it's happing to you and that your there. That's a neat feeling when your reading a book. And after reading this you will understand the true meaning of family, friendship, and the goodness of learning to do things for other people and not just yourself."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"This is a great story about Esperanza, a young Mexican girl who had it all.

She had a non-stop determination to regain her happiness. You'll have to read it yourself to see if she actually found it, and where her story ends."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"The book Esperanza Rising is about a girl named Esperanza. Esperanza means hope in Spanish. Which explains her character. The story takes place around the 1930's, when lots of immigrants had come to California to work. Esperanza had ended up in the United States when her dad had died and she and her mom had to move because their house was burned down and they had lost everything. So they moved to the U.S. with their servants and started to work. Even though her life is tough and she doesn't have everything that she used to have she still makes it through.I think that Esperanza Rising is a very good book. I got into the book, and it just caught me. I was very into it. I have to admit that when there were sad parts. I was practically crying. It felt so real. Pam Munoz Ryan did a really good job of writing the book. I guess that's because she had an inspiration to write the book from her grandmother, who had told her about her life, which was kind of like Esperanza's.Like a lot of books, it kind of has a moral to the story. Though a very slight one in this case. I think the moral is that you don't need everything you have. I think that Esperanza at first missed all of her stuff. As the days went by, she didn't really miss her stuff anymore and was getting accustomed to her new life. I think that a lot of people in America have a lot of stuff. We just don't need all of this stuff compared to all the pore people in the world. When I reading this book, I realized how lucky I was to have the stuff I have. I would recommend this book to anyone. Especially people who think they don't have anything, when they really have a lot. Everybody should read it. It's great!"},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"Esperanza Rising was an interesting book to read.

Here are some comments:Ajanae:The story takes place in the 1930's, during the Great Depression,\\" in Mexico and California. It's about a girl who was very rich in Mexicao, but when she moved to California she and her mama became poor farm workers. It wasn't easy for Esperanza to learn how to be poor. One lesson she learned was how to be respectful and kind to everyone.Brandon:Esperanza didn't know how to do anything when she was rich; she didn't even know how to bathe herself. Esperanza learned how to do this stuff and to work hard and to become strong. I learned you have to work hard to get what you want.Devon:\\"Esperanza Rising\\" is about when Esperanza's father died and how she became a better person. She learned how to work hard and to treat people with more respect.Ezekial:Esperanza went from riches to rags. She had many servants to wait on her. She had everything she wanted like clothes and dolls. When her father died, they lost everything, even their house and land. In the end, Esperanza became strong for her father.Jerron:The story is about a 14 year old girl who was rich and then became poor after her father was murdered.Esperanza went from fame and riches to being poor and dirty, but she learned to be strong.Jorge:Esperanza lived in Mexico on a ranch with a nice house and a Papa and Mama and servants. However, Papa was killed and Mama and Esperanza were forced to flee to California. They had to start over in a camp for immigrants and worked hard. Esperanza learns to be a better person while learning to work through overcoming her laziness and learning to be independent. They eventually survived with their children working to have a better life.Shalonn:Esperanza and her mother had to leave their big ranch in Mexico and move to California.

The determination that Esperanza displays is truly commendable. As she suffers through and rises above much heartache it is hard to put the book down. The author did a wonderful job making it feel as if you are part of the family and are struggling right along with them. The selflessness that Esperanza displays to support her family and take care of her mom at such a young age is inspiring. The tight family ties keep Esperanza, her mother, their servants, and their servant's family close together through even the roughest times. This novel outlines the struggles that many Mexicans experienced during the Mexican Revolution. This story would spark many classroom conversations about family values, acceptance, and strength during the revolution."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"My 4th, 5th, and 6th grade students really enjoyed this book as a Lit Circle selection.

I will use this book again with students."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"An inspiring story of struggle, hardship, and hope, Esperanza Rising gave me and my children much to discuss. This is a great work of historical fiction for children based on the life of the author's grandmother.Esperanza, the daughter of a wealthy landowner, and her mother must leave their home in Mexico and start over as farm workers in California after the death of her father. Set in the early 1930's, this book gives you a feel for the struggles of the Great Depression as well as California History . Filled with Spanish phrases and words, it's a great introduction to learning Spanish and shows many cultural aspects as well.This book is rich with ideas for great discussions on empathy, economics, labor unions, race relations, prejudice, rights, family, choices, hope, attitude, work, pride, and kindness. Make sure you keep tissues by as you read. I don't usually cry when reading, but this book brought my tears to the surface again and again making it difficult to read aloud to my kids.

No, it really is uplifting, just in a different sort of way than most of us are used to.

Before I read this book I had no idea (in the 1924 time period)that there were princesses like Esperanza whos dads own huge ranches and make tons of money. Esperanza shows her love for family, her love for the earth, and most of all, HOPE. Esperanza lives up to her name in this book."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"Pam Mu&ntilde;oz Ryan tells Esperanza Rising, a loving story from her grandmother's life. In 1924, Esperanza's family is very wealthy and lives in Mexico. Esperanza has almost everything she could ask for. One devastating day, a tragedy changes her life forever. She and her mother, Ramona, must move to the United States, for a new start of life. Esperanza learns what it is like to be a pheasant. She has never worked in her life before! She has new challenges that seem simple to most people, but that are hard and frustrating to her. Ramona becomes very sick and Esperanza has to find way to make their lives better, for both of them. Even though this book may start out to not be very intriguing, it takes you through the adventures from the Mexican cultures in 1924.For instance, to start reading a book may not be very easy. Esperanza Rising is no easier to start than any other book. A tragic event happens in the very beginning. I think that Pam Ryan could have brought that out so much more to pull you into the book from the beginning. When the tragedy happens it only takes about one page. And the words do not sound sorrowful and make you feel like you're there at the time.Also, this book focuses so much on telling the story that it forgets to describe details. I like to envision things. When the author doesn't give me very much information I have to come up with my own description. With it being a historical fiction book she should tell you more detail of how things look, smell, taste, and even feel. Where Esperanza worked on the farm I did not get the feel for what it was like. I knew it was hard, but I didn't know very much of the setting and the feeling people got there. Same goes for the characters. She kind of describes the people's looks, but only a little bit about their personalities.On the other hand, this book is fantasizing because it tells of a culture other than my own. Often stories are told in a point that we can relate to. In this book, Pam explains another culture and teaches about it in her writings. It just wasn't Esperanza's family who had to move to America during the great depression; many families needed to move. The troubles lasted over years in many families.Indeed, when reading you not only have a cultural learning experience, learn about the great depression, but you also learn Spanish! Many of the words are Spanish, and then after it says what it means. The chapter names are fruit names in Spanish. All of them are fruits. Fruits are an important factor in Esperanza's life, and culture.This book teaches many common lessons. One that I think this book shows is is that it's important to have courage through trials. Esperanza goes through dozens of trials everyday. Ramona is strong and is happy through the trials. Esperanza learns from her family that courage is one of the best ways to still be happy no matter what happens. She learns that part of being happy is being grateful for all you do have.In essence, towards the end you start to feel the love that Esperanza has, while learning about her culture. Pam Mu&ntilde;oz Ryan's culture and background is very exciting to learn about. She shows us what it was like during the great depression. I would give this book two thumbs up, especially for teaching me many lessons and different cultures. This book is great for any one, any age, and even any culture; only as long as you are willing to learn. I am very glad to say that in America things are not the same as they used to be. And I'm thankful for all the men and women who fought for their rights, so that I can have friends of any race or color."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"Excellent book with many themes to be used - Used with Mexico Unit in sixth grade social studiesGreat examples for 6 traits of writingHigh percentage of interest with boys and girls in sixth gradeUsed a cd also to add variety of readers"},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"Esperanza Rising by Pam Munoz Ryan is a wonderful book.

Well this book will make you not want to receive but give more because you know what some people are going through. Have you ever wanted something and your parents wouldn't buy it for you? Think if you needed something like water but there wasn't any good enough to drink. How would you feel? I'd feel pretty bad. This book is 253 pages long and has 13 chapters. I recommend this book for kid's ages 9-12.This book has different characters that have all different feelings in the book. The main character is Esperanza. She was not excited at all about having to move and has a lot of courage to be able to move on. A supporting character is Mama which is well Esperanza's mother, she has to be very strong and not act scared to be a remodel for Esperanza. Isabel her distant relative from America is 8 years old and thinks the conditions of her new home is actually okay. Esperanza and Mama on the other hand don't.The setting in the book has different people there at different times of the book. One is in Aguascalientes, Mexico where Esperanza, Mama, and Abuelita lived at the beginning of the book and then only Abuelita lived there for the whole book until the very end. The Camp in California is where Isabel lived and where Mama and Esperanza moved. Lastly is the Hospital where mama lived for the second half of the book due to her sickness. Esperanza visited her as much as possible to check on how she is doing. Those are the major settings in the book.I think that the theme of this book is to just always be thankful. A hint is to never give up even in the worst possible situation. An example is when Esperanza's house got set on fire and all her stuff got destroyed she moved on. A message that the book tries to get you to see is that you can do anything if you want it bad enough (preserver). That is what I think the main theme of the book is.I think you should at least give this book a try because it is interesting and I bet you will love it even if you don't like this genre. The author of this book is Pam Munoz Ryan and I will tell you 3 reasons about why you should read her wonderful book. One reason is because she has detail about everything so can understand it better. Another is that there is a big surprise almost every chapter and it leaves you hanging so you want to read more. Last but not least you can relate to it because you know it really could happen. I hope you decide to read my book because you won't know how good it actually is until you read it for yourself."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"The book review of Esperanza RisingWhen was the last time you were really thankful for what you have?

Early in the story, Esperanza's father is killed, and Tio Luis inherits the land. Tio Luis gives the family two options, Ramona (Esperanza's Mother) marry him, or her entire family and their servants suffer the consequences; Esperanza, Ramona, and a close servant family fled to the United States for a new life.Along the way, Esperanza faces many hardships that she would have not encountered if she was still a Mexican Queen. She must learn to live like a peasant, which is not easy for her, she even found sweeping a difficult task. Esperanza Rising is a good multicultural book. It introduces the reader to the struggles and hardships of a poor Mexican immigrant family, and it is written from and inside perspective. Most of the details from her book came from real life stories about her own grandmother. This book creates immaculate images in the reader's mind, and describes a journey from riches to rags and from a materialistic mindset to simplistic family oriented living."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"This book is an amazing story!

When her uncles, Tio Luis and Tio Marco threaten her, her mother and their servants, they must flee to California and work in a camp. Esperanza and her mother escape with their close servants/friends, Alfonso, Hortensia and Miguel. Esperanza struggles with her new life and her recent losses.Esperanza Rising was an amazing novel. Throughout the whole book I had compassion for Esperanza, her family, friends and servants. Pam Mu&ntilde;oz Ryan made it easy for me to have compassion for Esperanza. She was betrayed by her uncles and went from riches to rags. Her whole life was turned inside out. I couldn't put Esperanza Rising down. I couldn't stop thinking about what was going to happen to Esperanza. This book was spectacular and the only downside (it was very small) was that I felt a little too much for the characters!

Munoz spins a tale of tragedy tinged with hope. Esperanza's determined spirit draws the reader into her struggles, cheering her on in her own search for security and self."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"Pam Munoz Ryan, author of books for adults as well as younger readers, gives us a story of hope, class and cultural struggle in the historical fiction novel Esperanza Rising. Set in 1920&#65533;s Mexico and pre-Great Depression United States, it is the fictional story of Esperanza, on the eve of her 13th birthday. A grand celebration is planned on El Rancho de las Rosas, the family&#65533;s ranch &#65533; and instead of presents, Esperanza&#65533;s father is murdered by bandits. This sets the stage for the consequences that follow for Esperanza and her family, and pits her against challenges that she must face in order to grow into a young woman.Leaving behind all she loves &#65533; her grandmother, the ranch with its seasonal fruits and many roses, her beloved Mexico &#65533; Esperanza, together with her mother, join the family&#65533;s mechanic and maid (Alfonso, his son Miguel and Hortencia) as they immigrate to California&#65533;s San Joaquin Valley to work in the agricultural fields picking crops on a company-owned labor camp. Readers&#65533; hearts will ache as they experience the sharp contrasts between this life and Esperanza&#65533;s former life in Mexico.Ryan presents a well told story loosely based, we learn in the beneficial Author&#65533;s Notes, on her maternal grandmother&#65533;s own experiences. Interspersed throughout the story are metaphors and sayings on the part of Abuelita (Esperanza&#65533;s grandmother left behind in Mexico) that can be fully actualized by the reader and the main character of Esperanza at the end of the book. Ryan also successfully contrasts world events of the time (effects of the Mexican Revolution, the migration of Oklahoma Dust Bowl victims to California and conflicts between the Mexican laborers and the U.S. government) with the determination of Esperanza&#65533;s family to establish stability in a new land, all while teaching readers Spanish words and Mexican customs.A powerful story with relatable characters, this belongs on every shelf with its message of growth, struggle and hope."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"The book Esperanza Rising by Pam Munoz Ryan is about Esperanza a young girl that lives in Mexico.

Not really no. It was ok, but Esperenza was nice to begin with! It says a snobby girl turns sweet when her father dies. She didnt change! Nothing happened to her! There was no point.

Well you would if you were in this book. Esperanza Rising by Pam Munoz Ryan. I liked this book because the amount of care through rough times and the adventures.This book is about a stubborn, hard working, responsible and caring, twelve year old girl (Esperanza) and her loving, polite and charming mother (Ramona) who go from being rich in Mexico to working on an immigration farm in California. All thanks to Esperanza's two uncles. Traveling with them are their three servants. (Alfonso) a good man and a brother to the family, ( Hortensia) a great care taker of their family and hers, and (Miguel) the seventeen year old son of Alfonso and Hortensia. Who are always trying to help.When the group arrives there they meet up with Juan (Alfonso's brother, a good man), Joesafina ( a kind lady, Jaun's wife), Isabel (a sweet, curios, rambunctious eight year old girl who is Jaun and Joesaphina's daughter) and of course Pepe and Lupe ( two twin babies Pepe- a boy and Lupe- a girl).

It brings alive the horror of labor and the sadness of life. I nearly cried during some parts of this book.The story is about Esperanza, or Anza, who is a rich thirteen-year-old, living on her father's El Rancho de las Rosas, which grows grapes and other fruits. Her life is happy and filled with pleasures, with her mother, father and grandmother as companions.One day, during an inspection of fence posts, her father does not return. Her family waits for hours, and it turns out he was killed by bandits.Anza's greedy uncles arrive, one the town mayor and the other the town banker. In Anza's father's will, he left the home to Anza and her mother, yet the ranch to her uncles. One of the uncles offer to buy the home, yet Anza's mother refuses.The house is burned down by a mysterious fire.Anza's uncle offers marriage to Anza's mother, knowing the town respects her, and Anza's mother accepts.

There are still too few *good* books in the juvenile literature section of the bookstore that have Native American, Latina/o, African American, or Asian American protagonists, and that tell believable, thoughtful stories reflecting the history, culture, and social realities of those protagonists. Pam Mu&ntilde;oz Ryan's book is a clear-eyed, engrossing story of a Mexican immigrant girl who comes to work in the fields of Southern California in the early 1930s after her well-to-do life in Aguascalientes falls apart.The novel invokes the history and politics of the time, touching on labor organizing, the threat of deportation, the ways that language and race divided workers even as the company farm camp created new kinds of community.There aren't many adult books in Chicano history or literature who tell this sort of immigrant story as vividly as this one does. (Although, if you want to read more, check out George S&aacute;nchez's Becoming Mexican American; Camille Guerin-Gonz&aacute;les' Mexican Workers, American Dreams; and Helena Mar&iacute;a Viramontes' Under the Feet of Jesus.)

My mother is not the first nor the last of the same story that keeps going and repeating every single day. many men and women leave their families and country just to find a better feature for their children and themselves.Some succeed and others don't even make it to see another day ."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"Esperanza Rising, while well-detailed and well-written, has some characters you won't want to hear from again. The story is about a rich young girl from Mexico, and how she goes north to California after her father is killed by bandits. In California, everything is different, especially from a new point of view; that of a poor girl's. When her mother falls ill after a dust storm and is sent away to a hospital, Esperanza is scared, and the strikers, who seem to have a constant need for more and more money, aren't helping with their rock throwing.While it is a pretty good story, and (I'm assuming) fairly accurate, the book still has the feel of \`adult writing for itty-bitty-witty children'. Esperanza is older than me, and yet she seems younger in many ways. While she does mature considerably in the story, she never really matures to a level that I'd call \`likable'. She suffers many hardships, but when you think about it, that or worse has happened to pretty much her entire camp.And let's not forget about the last line, \\"Do not be afraid to start over.\\" I know that the point was to show how she matured and became wise like her grandmother, but it just didn't work in my mind (Just so that I don't lose you, this last line was talking about crocheting, and screwing up so badly that you simply had to start over). Her character just bothers me, and no matter how wise grandmother-esque she becomes, her first personality as the obnoxious spoiled rich brat come in and takes center stage.Aside from the main character, the book is well written, and has some good details, especially about the strikers' camp and its ruined state. The lives of the other characters are also interesting, so try to follow on those details. Like, her mother for example. \`Esperanza's mother gets sick and goes to a hospital'. The main point, so I'm, like, done...right? Not really. Ms. Ryan puts detail into Mama's descent into a dust storm-related disease, and shows how no one really notices anything until something terrible happens, which is true enough. Of course, to give the story a happy ending, Mama comes home and everyone is enlightened and happy.It just screams \`Children's book', right? Well, by keeping the main character at the mental age of eight, I'd say yes, yes it is. But the book redeems itself by having so many good details and a good plot that can be read by a fourth grader or by a bored adult. Either way, Esperanza Rising is a good book, not amazing, but good."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"Hi I am doing a book review on Esperanza Rising.

This book took me places that I thought I'd never be. A takes a reallly good book for that to happen. The novel,Esperanza Rising, by Pam Munoz Ryan, tells about a magnificent story about a young girl named Esperanza. She was living the life. She was rick, she had never done any cleaning in her entire life, and she was very happy with her father, mother, and a young boy named Miguel who she had a crush on. That is untill her father died and she had to move to the United States.The setting mainly takes place in California. She moved their strugling as an immigrant with her mother, and her servent (whitch she secrtly loved0 Miguel. She lived with her Aunt. Life wasn't easy for her, her mom ,or Miguel.Esperanza had to begen to do chores. She had to take care of her little cousing Lupe and Pepe. Life was hard enough, but then got harder once she met Marta, miguels girlfriend. Marta teased her about not being able to do what a Mexican that came to the United States should be able to do. I had only a couple problems with this book. It talked about a lot of affending things agains Latinos. When the americans used the pool, the Mexicans had to use it after everyone else did, when it was dirty, so then the cleaner people could clean it. Over all though, it was a very unique book. I will remember this for the rest of my life. THe story of a girl trying to find herself and making a new life without her father.The moral of this story is to never stop trying. Never give up. Always have a little hope and everything will be okay. Life dindn't exactly work out perfectly for Esperanza Ortez, espessially after her mother almost dies: But Esperanza always had hope.

I would have to say that this book would make you cry when you first read it because there are mixed feelings that Pam incorperates into the book so well, that when you read it, you will feel the same feelings as Esperanza has during the book.In the begginning, Esperanza is the daughter of a ranch owner, which means that she is rich. But on the day before her birthday, a terrible tragedy happens. Shattering her and Mamas' world, they are forced to move to California, where they must settle in a farm for Mexican farm workers. Esperanza is not ready to deal with hard labour. She finacialy struggles, which is brought on by the Great Depression, and lacks acceptance she now has to face. But when Mama gets sick, and some people strike for better working conditions, it threatens to uproot her and Mamas' neew life. Now, Esperanza has to find a way to rise above her difficult situations, because Mama's life and her own depend on it. I hope that you get the chance to read this spectacular book."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"Esperanza rising is the saga of a girl who lived as a princess in Mexico, and her trip from there to knowing not what it is like to be rich and happy but what it is to be one of the poor people she so looked down on, back when she was the snobby, callous Esperanza. Esperanza's family consists of her, her father, her mother, and her abuelita. One year, during the harvesting season, which is the month of Esperanza's birthday, papa is out mending a fence with her family friend named Miguel, and is attacked by revolutionists who hate papa for being rich. Esperanza mourns for days and days wearing black all through her birthday, even while she recieves the porcelain doll that papa planned to give her, for she knows it will be the last. Her uncles sort out the will of her father, and it leaves the house and grapes to Ramona (Esperanza's mother), but the land surrounding the house must go to Tio Luis. Tio Luis proposes that Ramona marry him, but she does not acquiece to his proposal, and so he goes away Esperanza knowing he will get his way one way or another. Not too long after that day, a mysterious fire breaks out, and the house and grapes are destroyed. Almost nothing is left from the rubble, and the family and servants barely make it out alive. Now they must either make Ramona marry Tio Luis, or leave to America. Abuelita has broken her ankle in the fire, and so even if they decide to leave she will have to stay behind. She says that is fine, and she will come to America when she is better. The next day, they leave on a train to Los Angeles, and along the way Esperanza meets filthy poor people who she discriminates against by treating them all as if they are animals. She is confused by her mother's kindness towards the people who are lower than her, and surely not worth her time. She wonders why it is that while before she was to avoid the poor, and ignore them, now she is free to mingle with and take candy from them? She is dropped off in Los Angeles, and meets Juan, isabel, and Josefina, the people who she will be living next to while she works at the camps. Along the way they see a friend of theirs named Marta, and her mother, so they decide to pick her up. She ridicules Esperanza and acts like she is an evil person. They drop her off at her labor camp and continue on to their own.Once at the labor camp, Esperanza sees her surroundings and cannot believe the cabins size with only a bedroom and a kitchen which also has a matress in it. She tries to fit in, doing the best she can at her jobs, tending the babies and sweeping the wooden platform, but is laughed at when she tries to sweep the platform because she cannot sweep. She asks miguel how to sweep, and he tells her so she can do it right, however, she realizes she cannot ask Miguel everything and tells Isabel that she will tellher all about her life if she will teach her how to work, and and a deal is made. That Friday, a jamaica is going on, and there is a box of kittens being given away. Isabel wants a kitten, and Esperanza goes to ask Isabel's mother if Isabel can have one. While Esperanza is out Marta begins rallying for a strike, saying that things will become etterif they all strike together. A few days after that, while mama is out in the sheds, a dust storm arises and is headed for them. Esperanza hopes mama is fine while she is working, and that the trucks that go to pick up the workers reach them in time. When the dust storm is over and mama returns, she has a bad cough. It gets worse over time, and at one point it gets so bad that she must se a doctor over her condition. He diagnoses that she has sun valley fever, a disease of the lungs that cause rampant coughing, and she must go to a hospital. Esperanza decides that she must work to bring abuelita to her, so she canknow what to do, but to do that she must begin working. Her work pays off mama's medical fees, and her money is compiling to form the fund that will bring abuelita to them. Th strikers begin to interfere with work by putting things in the boxes of asparagus that the workers are unloading, which slows them down because they are extremely cautious of the crates filled with these green vegetables. The plantation owners decide that this is bad for buisness, and the immigration police comes and hauls them all away. Miguel finds at the motor shop in the train station and so the family rejoices over his newfound job. All the while, more oakies are pouring in, and willing to work for less and less money. One day Esperanza finds Marta hiding near the crates of rubber bands used to tie asparagus, and out of kindness, she does not tell anyone she is there. At the hospital mama is getting better and is allowed to come home, so long as she continues to rest. As more oakies pour in, Miguel loses his job at the train station, and while Esperanza and him are talking, a fight breaks out and Miguel leaves. He goes off to Mexico to get Abuelita in secret, and brings her back to Esperanza and Ramona. Esperanza's mother has gotten much better, and so she is out of bed. Esperanza's birthday approaches, and she isfeeling happy for the first time in what seems like ages. She goes of to the hill and sees something from her past and sommething from her future, both standing on the same side of the river."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"If you enjoy reading nonfiction, heartwarming books, that makes you have a good cry here and there, then Esperanza Rising is the perfect book for you.The book is based on a fifteen year old girl that lived in Aguascalientes, Mexico. On a property that was called El Rancho De Las Rosas. She always dreamed of her life always staying the same, always living in a big, beautiful two story house. With sevants that cooked, cleaned, and worked to make the acres of roses and fruit that Esperanza's family owned,look beautiful.But with her ugly, jerk Tio Luis around, her dream of being a queen, always living in a beautiful house in Mexico, always wearing lovely dresses, and living side-by-side with her Papa and Abuelita, will never be accomplished.I can't say how or why she had to go to live in Mexico, that is your job, to find out. So she travels to Mexico to work on a camp with three of her servants and her mom. She soon runs into problems, like having to live in and share a horse stall with other people that are family members to her. Also, some other problems she runs into is her mom getting a disease called Valley Fever, having to work so she could pay for her moms medical bills and Abuelita's train ticket to come from Mexico to come and live on the camp. In the end, she lives happily for ever after, because she has her Abuelita next to her and her mom is good as new."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"A heart warming story of hope that Pam munoz Ryan bases on her grandmothers life.Esperanza goes through a series of feelings throughout the book. First she believes all she has will not go away, but slowly her life seems to unravel like a crocheted blanket that is not perfect.In my opinion this is a very beutifuly writen story and I would deffinitly recomend it to anyone.I enjoyed the whole thing because it really shows(or what i would have thought)how a girl of riches could try to transision into the life of the poor. She is used to having everything done for her, so now when she is expected to be a little independant, she has a hard time. In a way she has to try and start over a life she has never known. Only at the end of the book does the spanish proverb, the rich person is richer when he becomes poor, than the poor person when he becomes rich, become clear to Esperanza. just like what Carmen said finally makes good sense. \\"i have my family, a garden full of roses,my faith and my memories of those who went before me.\\" This showed Esperanza to be gratefull for what you have and even the poorest of people can have the happiest of hearts"},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"Esperenza Rising is about a young Mexican girl who goes from riches to rags overnight because of a terrible fire that burns everything, even her father.

This 253 page book has long chapters, but every one of them is action-packed.Even though the main character of this book is a girl, I can see a boy reading it and not thinking it is girlish because there are boys in the story too. I hope you will enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"\\"Aguantate tantito y la fruta caera en tu mano.\\" Esperanza Rising is a very enjoyable book. It was written by Pam Munoz Ryan who dedicated it to her grandmother and also wrote it about her. Though it is a fictional story with 262 pages. Pam Munoz Ryan has also written other children's books like Mud is cake and Hello Ocean.Esperanza Rising is a novel based on a true story about Esperanza Ortega Munoz Hernandez Elgart who is Pam Munoz Ryan's grandmother. The story is about 13 year old Esperanza Ortega; when her father dies she has to move to America from Mexico because of her sinister uncles and of becoming poor. She then starts to work on a farm in California with her mother and her friend Miguel's family. Her mom then gets ill because of a sandstorm and also of depression because her Mother (Abulita) is still in Mexico. Miguel then runs away to northern California to work on the railroad. Will her mom get better; can Abulita get to America, what will happen to Miguel?\\"Next to Josefina was a girl about eight years old, wearing a dress that was to big and shoes with no socks. Delicate and frail, with big brown eyes, long braids, and skinny legs. She looked like a young deer.\\" That is an example of how descriptive the introduction of a new character is. Pam Munoz Ryan uses so many vivid descriptions I could see the characters right in front of me. Even the shortest of sentences are very descriptive just like this \\"Josefina was plump with a round face. She was smiling waving with one hand and holding a baby in another.\\" And the longest of sentences like when they introduced Abulita.Pam Munoz Ryan doesn't just have distinguishing descriptions of characters, but also of the setting. I could picture myself there, in that room, at that place. One example is: \\"Gentle slopes of the vineyard, leafy green vines draped the arbors and the grapes ready to drop.\\" And also, \\"Their cabin had two small rooms; one half of the first room was the kitchen with a sink, stove, counter, table and chairs. A pile of wood waited near the stove. Across the room there was a mattress on the floor; the back of the room had another mattress big enough for two people and there was a tiny cot. In-between sat a wooden fruit crate, its sides touching each bed. Above it was another small window.\\" Both of those were very well written with good descriptions.\\"Aguantate tantito y la fruta caera en tu mano, wait a little while and the fruit will fall into your hand.\\" Esperanza Rising is a pleasurable book. It has vivid descriptions and is a very interesting story. I recommend this book for everyone. It is written in two languages: Spanish and English. Girls will probably like this book more than boys. This book has won many awards some of them are: Ala best book for young adults, Publishers weekly best book of two thousand, and Smithsonian Notable books for children of two thousand."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"Esperanza Rising is a historical fiction book written by Pam Munoz Ryan. This book is loosely based on a true story. In the back of the book it tells about what happen to Pam Munoz Ryan. That is similar to the story.Esperanza lives in Aguascalients, Mexico on a ranch called El Rancho des las Rosas. Esperanza thinks that nothing wrong will ever happen and that she will always be happy. But this is not true for long because when she finds out her father is dies, Esperanza and mama go to California to live with the family of their servant, Alfenso. They live in a camp for migrant workers. There Esperanza has to learn to be independent as well has caring for others. Of course she isn't used to this because she always had a servant to do everything for her. With the help of her mama she makes it through. After a terrible dust storm, Esperanza's mama becomes very ill and needs to be hospitalized for a long time. Will Esperanza make it without her mother?Ryan writes with great description that you can almost imagine you are in the book. It has wonderful word choice, using very advanced words. This has no pictures so you can have your own image.Esperanza Rising is a very inspiring book. I think the moral of the this story is \\"Never be afraid to start over.\\" This novel is most appropriate for ages 10 and up. It has a lot of confusing words that you will have to read twice.

The book serves as an excellent tool for teaching about California history, the Great Depression, Mexican immigration, forced repatriation, and labor camps. Esperanza's transformation from a protected rich girl to an independent young woman is believable and engaging. Young readers will enjoy reading (or hearing their teacher read) about Esperanza's budding romance with Miguel, her struggles to care for two babies (including hand-washing cloth diapers!), and her decision to \\"rise\\" above natural feelings of jealousy and revenge to rescue another girl.

In a total reversal of fortune, she and her mother must escape with their former servants to the United States to become farm workers during the Great Depression. Esperanza must acknowledge her biases about gender, race, and class as she faces prejudice and hardship for the first time. She also discovers her own independence and takes responsibility for her actions.The reader has a very interesting relationship to Esperanza. On the one hand, we want to relate to her, like a fairy tale princess. On the other, we can see how spoiled and ignorant she is. This relationship to Esperanza permits readers to safely acknowledge their own navet&eacute; and at the same time feel proud that they know better than Esperanza - Ryan's characterization is quite ingenious. The story confronts a number of tough issues (e.g., racism and the labor movement) without shying away or sugar-coating them. Although the reality is gritty (life as a farm worker is certainly not romanticized), the novel achieves a hopeful, satisfying ending in which we admire Esperanza's evolution from a privileged and sheltered little girl to a hard-working and capable young woman."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"Esperanza RisingAuthor: Pam Munoz RyanPreview by: Ashley MoralesHave you ever thought of what or who you have in your life? Well, in this book Esperanza Rising, by Pam Munoz Ryan talks about just that. A Mexican family living in Paradise, but then everything goes downhill.I think you should read this book because the main character Esperanza goes from riches to rags. What I mean from \\"Riches to Rags\\" is she goes from having a beautiful ranch with servants and all then her father dies, also after that Esperanza's house burns down. Her mom almost has to marry Esperanza's uncle that is the governor just to live normally, but Esperanza and here mother would be apart all day because her uncle would send her to private school. Instead Esperanza and her family moved to a Mexican camp in California with her cousins.Another good quality about this book is because Esperanza learns new responsibilities like babysitting, washing clothes, cooking and many other responsibilities. I also think she learns to cherish what she has like her friends, and family.Esperanza almost loses everything and everyone she has. But she is strong and helpful, she knew some of her problems would go away, but then her mom got sick with Valley Fever. This is a fever that you can get after a really bad dust storm. Esperanza now thinks she is going to lose everything.Everything comes to an end, but I can't tell you that, it's so exciting.

I also teach Spanish and figured that using this book could help my students in learning Spanish vocabulary. I introduced the concept of Esperanza Rising during Hispanic Heritage Month, and boy was it a class charmer. The boys in my class got into the book as well.

A family who struggles, cries, and is full of fear what to come each day. If you like letting your emotions out I suggest you read this book because it is sad, tearful, but then again hopeful.Theme is what ties a whole book together. The main themes in this book are hope and faith. During this book the characters are going through a couple of large struggles as a family. The family uses hope and faith to accomplish their terrible struggles for instance Esperenza has faith in her mother to get well again and hope that they will be successful in America.Some of the characters in this book help you think about the similarities between you and themselves. This book really made me think about especially my family like when my grandfather died. Also in this book Esperenza is feeling worried for her mother since her mother had been ill for so long and I also feel the same way when my parents or else happens to them. As I read the story more and learned a little more about the character it helped me understand the book a little more than I have already.In many cases the setting in this book was not very descriptive. It only said that they lived in a large mansion and later on they traveled to California after something dramatic happened that caused the family to loose money and also to loose faith. Soon they had to go to a very small cabin in California where they worked, and worked until late evening.In addition to the story I recommend this story if you would like to know a little more about the Mexican culture and the way they do things. Although the characters in the book are very similar to ours the setting is not. I really enjoyed this book as a reader because it kind of teaches you to take nothing for granite."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"Esperanza rising is about a girl who lived in a manchen in Mexico.

When her dad had left, Esperanza's uncle asked if the mom would marry him she said, no. He had got mad and burned the manchen down.

Mom- a woman, husband died, mom of Esperanza, lived in Mexico her whole life.This book took place in Mexico and United States of America. Basically, this book is telling us about the differences between Mexico and the United States. United States has more jobs, freedom, more land. Mexico is less fortunate than us. We have the right to travel all around the world.In Mexico and the United States is where this book takes place. In the beginning of the book took place in Mexico in the farm lands. At the middle and end of the book it took place in U.S. It was in the city when it was in the U.S. They have to sell there land, move, buy new clothes, they had to give up all of there stuff.I think Esperanza rising is a good book for people who love too learn.

Her mother soon falls ill and her only hope to save her mother is to bring her grandmother from Mexico to California.One of the part I liked about this book is in the beginning, when Esperanza and her father goes for a walk and listens to the earth\\"s heart beating. It showed that everything is alive around us. I tried to listen to the earth's heartbeat too, in my back yard, but heard nothing. I will go outside with my father next time to listen to the heartbeat, just like the book.I also liked the part when Esperanza's mother and Abuelita re-unites(?) again. It was such a happy part, I was crying while reading it. I can't imagine myself being seperated from my mother for such a long time, thinking of the possibility of never meeting again.My favorite part of this book is how Pam Munoz Ryan puts in quotes from Mexico. All of the quotes have deep meanings that teaches us how to behave. My favorite one is \\"Wait a little while and the fruit will fall into your hand.\\" This means to be patient and wait. I think I should use this quote on my friends someday."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"This is a wonderfully colorful story following Ezperanza to America- beautifully written, captivating."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"This realistic book is well written about a girl who comes from Mexico to California because her papa dies and her mother can not work to support the hole ranch and then their new land lord (Esperanza's uncle) burns their home to ruins because her mother tells him that she would not marry him.

After all, they were so unlike us...poor, uneducated, etc. (you get the idea). Thankfully I grew up to reject the stereotypes and prejudices, but sadly the same thinking is still rampant today.If only I had had Esperanza Rising to read! This aptly named tale takes readers inside the Mexican immigrants' world. We see Esperanza and her family laughing, loving, living a good life in Mexico until a series of sudden changes sweeps them upside down and into a new, hard life as '30s field hands in California's Central Valley. How Esperanza, her family and friends cope -- and eventually rise -- through their struggles is a story of character, strength, determination and love that opens eyes and can open hearts. Hope rising, indeed!"},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"Esperanza Rising is a beautifully told story of a 13 year old girl living a storybook life on Rancho del las Rosas with her father, mother and grandmother. Her life consists of private school, parties and the luxuries of Mexico's upper class. However, this all comes to a tragic end when her father is murdered. Her tyrannical uncle now owns the family land and he wants to marry Esperanza's mother and send Esperanza to boarding school. To escape the marriage, Esperanza and her mother emigrate to California with a family of their former ranch workers. Esperanza must live in the labor camp sharing one small house with two other families. Esperanza also must learn how to help out and do household chores. She doesn't even know how to hold a broom! When her mother becomes ill and must be hospitalized for months, Esperanza learns how to work in the fields to pay her mother's hospital bills. This is a story about the strength of family, growing up, the harsh realities of prejudice and hope. The roots for Pam Munoz Ryan's story begin with her own grandmother who told of her experiences emigrating to the US from Mexico and working in farm labor camps. This story illustrates the difficulties of life for farm laborers in the 1930s and is a good link to children's study of California history."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"I was interested in this book because many of my students have immigrated from Mexico as the main character, Esperanza, and her family did. Although her story took place about a generation ago, the difficulties she encountered in the U.S. were similar to those faced by immigrants today. But Esperanza had been raised wealthy, and was not prepared for hard work, poor living conditions, and a shortage of food and clothing. Esperanza's hardships shape her into a mature and wise young woman. For those of us who take our bountiful life for granted, this story gives us, both young and older readers, food for thought... about personal sacrifice, sharing, forgiveness, loyalty, compassion and justice.In the taped version, narrator Trini Alvarado has the perfect voice... smooth and easy to listen to, with realistic inflection, and genuine Spanish pronunciation. Her youthful voice brings Esperanza to life."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"What is beautiful, smells good, Grows in gardens, and comes in many colors? Esperanza's flowers.

In the beginning we get to meet all members of Esperanza's family through her eyes and how each character is influential to her growth as a young lady. Esperanza is introduced to the reader as the Patron's(Ranch Owner)daughter whom lived the lavish rich life and had everything handed to her at her wish. A twist of events occurs right as soon as we meet the key characters that all seem to be a huge part of the ranch and Esperanza's life. The plot quickly starts to unfold and Esperanza's life turns a complete 360. With the loss of her father she was forced to accept the life as peasant commoner in another country. Her journey to another country made her questioned so much about her self character and how her status seemed to diminish with every step she took away from her palace(rancho de las rosas). Esperanza overall takes the role of the dynamic character in the story. I would personally recommend this book to a 5th or 6th grader ESL student who is having trouble being away from their original country.Through out the serious of events Esperanza met a lot of different people who aid in her success.

The grandmother (Abuelita) continuously said that life is full of mountains and valleys- highs and lows, which Esperanza's life consisted of after her father's death. You really see Esperanza's character grow and develop throughout the book, changing from her privileged life of living like a princess to a pheasant and accepting her new role in society. Due to all the dramatic events that unfold and the little climaxes from every event, the author captured my attention throughout the whole book. The ending leaves you figuring out what happens, which every reader can interpret from the foreshadowing provided by the author.Overall, I think this book is excellent, especially if used for a read-aloud in a classroom setting.

The main character,Esperanza, is a wealthy young Mexican girl that has grown up on a ranch called El Rancho de las Rosas near Aguascalientes, Mexico. She is used to the care-free life of riches and privileges, surrounded by her loving parents, Ramona and Sixto Ortega, parties, dolls, servants, and silk dresses. But everything changes when one night, a day before Esperanza's 13th Birthday, her father is killed by the bandits.Esperanza, her mother, and Abuelita (grandmother) find themselves in a very precarious position - they cannot own the ranch without Papa, a man, a head of the family. Espiranza's evil uncles take over the land, and one of them suggests that Ramona should get married to him. When Esperanza's mother refuses the proposal, their mansion gets set on fire at night, leaving them with nothing at all. Esperanza and her mother had no choice but to leave Mexico and flee to a migrate camp of agricultural work in California, leaving behind Abuelita and their riches and privileges. Instead, experiences of loss, poverty, separation, prejudice, humiliation and fear surround Esperanza on the way to her new life. She is no longer a princess but a worker. What's even more, her mother gets very sick, and Esperanza has to work hard to pay the hospital bills. Will she manage the long hours of work and months of separation from her mother and Abuelita? Will she find a way to rise from ashes and make a new life for herself?Set against the multi-ethnic, labor-organizing era of the Depression, the story of Esperanza remaking herself is deeply touching and emotional. Most of all, It's a story about hope and perseverance (esperanza means \\"hope\\" in Spanish). The author also touches upon the the Dust Bowl, social reform, Mexican Deportation Act, discrimination and prejudice to foreigners.Inspired by the experiences of author's own Mexican grandmother, this compelling story of immigration and assimilation is written in deeply authentic voice. The descriptive writing paints a well detailed picture for the reader. Spanish words, culture and traditions are woven in throughout the story, making it even easier to root for Esperanza.If you liked this book, you might also like: \\"Ashes of Roses\\" by Mary Jane Auch, \\"Drown\\" by Junot Diaz, \\"Middlesex\\" by Jeffrey Eugenides, \\"From Ellis Island to JFK\\" by Nancy Foner, \\"The Namesake\\" by Jhumpa Lahiri, \\"Imagining America: Stories from the Promised Land\\" by Amy Ling, \\"And the Earth Did Not Devour Him\\" by Tomas Rivera and Evangelina Vigil-Pinon (translator), \\"Of Mice and Men\\" by John Steinbeck, \\"Bread Givers\\" by Anzia Yezierska, \\"Rain of Gold\\" by Villasenor.Julia ShpakAuthor of \\"Power of Plentiful Wisdom\\".

She has presented a fictionalized account of her own grandmother's fall from wealth and privilege in the aftermath of the revolution in Mexico as she immigrated to the United States to work in a Mexican farm labor camp during the Great Depression. Esperanza, the young protagonist, experiences loss, poverty, separation, prejudice, humiliation and fear on the road to her ultimate rise from the ashes in the manner of the mythical phoenix. Ryan does an excellent job of presenting the dilemma and danger of early attempts to improve the working conditions of the laborer during this period. She points out in the author's notes the grave injustices incurred by the Mexican Deportation Act, which exceeded relocations of the Japanese-Americans during the 2nd World War and of the Native Americans of the previous century. Many of these issues of prejudice and injustice persist today.

Forced to flee her father's grand estate in Mexico with her mother, the two make a perilous journey to America and become migrant farm workers in California. The book is a modified, \\"Little Princess\\", with a far more realistic and satisfying ending. Characters are presented here with great delicacy. Esperanza herself must sort out her own previous prejudices, while learning to live as, in her mind, a peasant. Children reading this will fully grasp everything that Esperanza has lost while truly appreciating the Mexican proverb Ryan has placed at the book's beginning: \\"The rich person is richer when he becomes poor, than the poor person when he becomes rich\\".Though I appreciate much of what the book says, I had my own personal problems with the presentation. The strikers are presented as alternately foolhardy and violent. They are lead by a girl, Marta, who is introduced by teasing Esperanza for being once so rich, now so low. These strikers are never joined by any of the main characters in this book, save Marta. In the Author's Note, Ryan explains that strikers fought for better living conditions and were sometimes shipped back to Mexico without any justification on the officials' part. In some cases the strikers lost. \\"In other instances, the strong voices of many people changed some of the pitiful conditions\\". Yet we do not see any evidence of this in the book. Instead, the reader is left with the very clear feeling that it is easier to be a scab like Esperanza's friend Miguel rather than risk everything for the good of others. I know it is not the author's intent to present this point of view, but this is unfortunately the lesson learned. After all, in a section where Esperanza fights with Miguel in a field about the hopelessness of their situation, Miguel argues that, \\"everything will work out\\". Esperanza reacts violently, saying that this way of thinking is not productive. The obvious conclusion being drawn is that Miguel should do something about his situation. Quoth Miguel, \\" \`You are beginning to sound like the strikers, Esperanza', said Miguel coldly. \`There is more than one way to get what you want in this country'.\\" Maybe so, Miguel. But that particular way helped improve the lives of countless Latin American immigrants in America. It's just a pity Ryan fails to acknowledge this fact in her story."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"First of all, I would like to say that to read this book would not be my first choice.

Ryan uses Spanish idioms, proverbs, songs, and chalks the text full with Spanish vocabulary, introducing the reader to the customs and culture of Esperanza's people. Ryan titles each chapter with names of fruits and vegetables, which one by one, give the reader a timeline of the harvest and a piece of the story. The story of Esperanza, her family, struggles, and triumphs are loosely based on the life of the author's grandmother.

It is 1930. Esperanza lives a rich and privileged life with her parents, her abuelita and servants on their vineyard, El Rancho de las Rosas, in lush Aguascalientes, Mexico. She is a beloved only child and deeply loved by her family and workers on their ranch. Their family is well respected and kind to all around them. On the eve of Esperanza's thirteenth birthday and of the grand fiesta celebrating the bountiful harvest, Esperanza's father is killed by bandits. Then their elegant home is burned down under suspicious circumstances. Esperanza's corrupt and greedy uncles force Esperanza and her mother to secretly flee the rancho and head across the border to California. Abuelita is forced to stay behind because of injuries, intending to meet up with her family later in California (which she does). Esperanza and her mother are suddenly penniless, leaving with only what they could carry in a small suitcase. They flee Mexico with their loyal friends-- housekeeper Hortensia, field boss Alfonso, and their son Miguel, to seek a better life in California with Alfonso's brother. Arriving in the San Joaquin Valley, Esperanza faces a difficult life, one much different from her life in Mexico. She and her mother must live with another family in a small cabin at the Mexican camp. While her mother works in the fields, Esperanza stays back at the camp to take care of the other family's babies. It is extremely hard work for everyone, especially Esperanza, who was used to such a privileged life in Mexico. At first, she rebels, insisting that she will one day have back all that she has lost. When her mother becomes ill with Valley Fever, Esperanza must go out and work in the fields to support her family. It is the Great Depression, and there is little money for food and doctors. It is during this time that Esperanza experiences labor strikes, prejudice, unfairness, and fear as she struggles to survive. However, over time, and with many struggles behind her, Esperanza rises to the occasion and accepts her life as it is and looks ahead with esperanza--hope. Ryan's second novel (her first was Riding Freedom) is a beautifully told tale, peppered with Spanish words and expressions. This engaging novel is too good to put down and sure to be loved by many a young reader. It makes a wonderful read-aloud. In the Author's Note at the end of the book, we learn that this novel is loosely based on Ryan's grandmother's experiences in migrant camps in the 1930s. Life in those camps is vividly described and authentically portrayed. This novel is a wonderful stepping-off point for studying post-revolutionary Mexico, the Depression, migrant camps, and Mexican Repatriation and the Deportation Act."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"Esperanza Rising Scholastic, 2000, 262 pp.,...

This book is a medium reading level it just has a few hard words. Like Esperanza was a queen in Mexico she had servants do it for her and know she has to learn how to do it. I liked Esperanza Rising very much because most people have to do it for them self's and know she learns how to do chores.The characters in Esperanza Rising are Esperanza, Mama and Papa. Mama and papa do a lot of the work in and out of the house. Esperanza never did work at her old house because she had servants. Know that Esperanza moves into her new house she works so hard to earn money for her family. I could connect to them because they all work together and never fight.The setting in Esperanza Rising takes place in Mexico in a big house in a big house in the woods. When there family moves to another house in the woods. But Esperanza does not know how to do any of the work.The theme in Esperanza Rising is relying and death. Papa dies and Esperanza's family is going thought a very hard time. Mama got sick and Esperanza and her brother and sister's have to rely on each other. To work hard to pay money for mama's hospital bill.The whole book of Esperanza Rising was a good book it was very well done. It was surprising in some ways. Like how Esperanza did not know how to use a broom. The book never made me take my eyes off of it. The family pulled it they all worked together and got through it.THE END"},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"Book ReviewEsperanza RisingBy: Pam Mounz Ryan\\"Listen to the ground, the earth has a heart beat.\\" That is the first sentence of the book Esperanza Rising by Pam Mounz Ryan. Esperanza is the daughter of a ranch owner that has a dramatic lose and has to move to the U.S to get work. Esperanza and her family finally got work but with not a lot of pay. Esperanza leans a lot of things such as to wash cloths, sweep, and others. When her mom gets sick Esperanza has more trouble to work in the field.The main theme of Esperanza Rising is most of self reliance. I believe this because she has to rely on the slaves friends to help her get to the United States. Then she also has to rely on her self when her mom got sick and to get money for food, and money for the hospital bills.The main characters of this book are Esperanza, her mom, her dad, and the slave friends. Esperanza is a 13 year old girl that lives on the ranch with her mom, dad, and slave friends. She does not go to school and her closest friend is 1mile away. Her mom is an ordinary mom but she only does some of the cleaning and cooking. Her favorite hobby is knitting. Esperanza's dad is one of the coolest dads because he lets her walk throw the fields. He has to take the graphs to the market every year and this year he did not come back. Esperanza slaves are the closes friends of hers. They are the closes people she knows also. They are her closes friends because her other friends live 1to 2 miles away. Even though there her slaves they are not treated that way. They treat each other like brothers and sisters.This books setting is baste on the Mexican life. Then it jumps to the American life. The setting is described very well because in the begging it tells the most detail when her dad tells her to hear the earth's heart beat. Then in the U.S they have still very well description. The only thing is that you would not think of the United States as the setting says. I say that because it says the cabins that they stay in are not good they are a wreck.My overall conclusion of the book was one of the best I have ever read. If I rated it from one to ten it would be a nine. I think a nine because it tells a lot about the Mexican culture. I didn't like it because it had too many Spanish words and it was hard to understand when they used Spanish words instead of English words."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"I recommend you not reading Esperanza rising because I think its boring and does not tell as much details for Esperanza as much as they talk or have more detail as papa or mama. I also think somebody that is Spanish would like this book more because this book has a lot of Spanish words.In the book Esperanza rising Esperanza always has to take care of the kids. Esperanza had to take care of the kids all of the time because papa got killed by Mexicans and mama was very sick plus all of the other people in the book had to work.I think there are way to many characters in Esperanza. Also there is not enough details in the characters. I think the book would be better if there was more details in the characters or if there was not as much characters in Esperanza rising.The setting was in Mexico. Papa died in Mexico from Mexicans and they took his belt buckle. In Mexico they also crew crops like corn. Papa liked to tell the ground was breathing and they would lay there heads on the ground and Esperanza actually thought it was breathing I did not really get that.This review is why I think you should not read Esperanza rising.It does not have details in the characters or Esperanza. In the book the Author does not talk about Esperanza as much as all the other characters and the book is on Esperanza."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"The lady reading the story is amazing.

It is a sad story, but brings to light many problems."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"Esperanza Rising was written by Pam Munoz Ryan. The setting of the book started in Mexico and later when Esperanza moved to California. The genre of the book is historical fiction which takes place during the Great Depression.Esperanza was rich, but not a rude spoiled girl. She just lived a life where everything was given to her and she didn't know any differently. But a major tragedy hits her family and she has to leave her home and everything behind. I loved this book very much. It really showed how Esperanza grew as a person through the many difficult changes in her life.Her relationships through the book change with many people. Miguel, one of her servants, was close to Esperanza when they were younger. But, one day Esperanza learned that they were on two different sides of the river and that they could never cross. Later the tragedy brings them closer together and they become equals, even friends. Esperanza's Mama was another important character in the book. In the beginning, Esperanza doesn't really know her nor has a great respect for her but that later changes because of the struggles they both go through. Abuelita, Esperanza's grandmother, is a very special person in Esperanza's life. Esperanza is fond of her grandmother and loves her very much. Abuelita asks Esperanza to finish a blanket for her while they're apart from each other. Esperanza promises to finish the blanket.As Esperanza faces the tragic changes in her life she has questions that relate to the patterns on the blanket, the mountains and valleys. \\"As soon as she reached a mountain, she was headed down into a valley again. Would she ever escape this valley she was she was living in?\\" (p.160)I really enjoyed reading this book. It was based on the author's grandmother and I thought that was really interesting. It also helped me to have more of an understanding of the point of view of the Mexicans and their lives."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"This book was very true to real life, very real. I loved how it showed the young girl's feelings and emotions completely. The story itself was interesting, and it gave the reader an opportunity to experience life during the 1930's for a specific group of people in very hard times. I loved getting to learn more about the Depression era from the point of view of an immigrant. The fact that they came from wealth and were taken to poverty just adds so much more to the story line. It happened to many people. You can really feel the ups and downs of the characters as they go through their trials, because the author's writing abilities are fantastic. I think this is a good read for young people studying this time period, or for adults just wanting a good read."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"I am an adult, a mom and a teacher. Esperanza Rising is perhaps one of the best \\"children's\\" books ever written. It is visually stunning, at times heartbreaking, sometimes playful and fun, and beautifully crafted throughout. I read it with my daughters when they were 8 and 10 and my then 10 year old read it again this year at 11. She also says it's one of her favorites. This book provides many talking points about class tensions, unions, Mexican-American history, migrant workers, and more. I can't say enough good things about Esperanza Rising."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"I really enjoyed this book! If you like a sad but very enjoyable story then this is the novel for you!"},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"Esperanza lives a privileged life on her family's ranch in Mexico. She receives many presents on her birthday, has beautiful dresses to wear, is waited on my servants, and is doted on by her loving parents. But her life changes drastically when her father is killed by bandits. When her uncle tries to blackmail her mother in marrying him in order to maintain their lifestyle, Esperanza and her mother flee their home and travel to America to start over. They end up in a farming camp and Esperanza has to work for the first time in her life even though she doesn't know how to do something as simple as sweep a floor. Slowly, Esperanza begins to adjust to her new life and becomes aware of just how lucky she is, especially compared to some of the people around her. This is a good story from Ryan about hope and overcoming obstacles. Esperanza is spoiled but likeable and her trials and growth seem realistic. There are also many things to learn about this time period but they are not presented in a heavy-handed way. For instance, I had never heard of Valley Fever nor was I aware of the extent of forced returns to Mexico. Historical fiction is not my favorite genre but I do appreciate it when it just tells a good story without being preachy about learning something about the time period."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"This book covers aspects of the great depression that the average American doesn't even think about. By using a young girl who's lost everything in her life and starting her over in an agricultural laborer camp, the reader gets a fresh look at a very hard way of life. When things look to be at their worst, Esperanza never gives up and works as hard as she possibly can to make things the best they can be in such troubled times. There aren't any sacchrine moments where the prince on a white horse shows up to take Esperanza away, just honest, hard, living.Well written for both children and adults to enjoy, Esperanza Rising is worthy of the praise it has received."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"This book is required reading for the 6th grade in New York City.

Her wealthy father owned a lot of land which he shared with their servants. He and was very generous and well-loved. It all changed when Esperanza's father was murdered by bandits when he was in the fields. Later Esperanza's uncles (a banker and the mayor of her home town) came and the banker said Esperanza's mother (Mama) couldn't own the land because she was a woman and he wanted her to marry him. Mama said \\"No\\". Their house and stables burnt down and Mama felt like she had to now say \\"yes\\" to the proposal but instead they ran away to California, where the only place that they could go to was a Mexican work camp. Esperanza now had a lot to deal with, like her grandmother was left behind in Mexico, her mother fell sick and she has to work now but she doesn't even know how to use a broom to sweep! Can Esperanza rise above it all?I like how the author says that Esperanza Ortega was real (She was the author's grandmother!)!! I really liked the story line and the Miguel character. I like Miguel because he is a good friend but he is also like most boys. Esperanza Rising won many awards including the Pura Belpre Medal, the Jane Addams Peace Award, an ALA Top Ten Best Book for Young Adults, and the Americas Award Honor Book. The copy I have has an AFTER WORDS bonus section at the end of the book which has things like an interview with the author (Pam Mu&ntilde;oz Ryan), two chapters from Ms. Mu&ntilde;oz Ryan's book \\"Becoming Naomi Le&oacute;n\\", a recipe for a Mexican punch and how to make a yarn doll. I like how the story has funny sections even though the topic is pretty serious. Esperanza wasn't the typical \\"rich bratty kid\\" she is very likeable and has a good attitude to keep trying."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"I enjoyed reading this story because of its characters, the plot, and the Mexican and Mexican-American culture within it. The structure is like that of a classic 19th century tale: a character in a high place falls, then, through his/her own effort, rises. Usually the rise is centered on economic circumstances, but in this book it isn't -- the rise concerns self-knowledge, making this a strong and enjoyable book. I also enjoyed the fact that a year or more went by in the course of this book: a refreshing change from middle-grade and young-adult fiction in which the time period is usually compressed into a day, a week, or, sometimes, a school year. Well worth reading!"},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"Thirteen-year-old Esperanza has everything--a beautiful home on El Rancho de Las Rosas, doting servants, and a loving family. But when bandits kill her father, Esperanza and her mother must leave that world behind and flee to the United States during the height of the Great Depression. Between struggling to work as a field hand, avoiding trouble with striking migrant workers, treating servants as equals, and being treated as a scorned minority for the first time in her life, Esperanza isn't sure she'll be able to rise from the ashes of her old life to accept the opportunities America has to offer.Esperanza Rising is a very real story about a carefree girl whose eyes are opened to the world around her under the most difficult of circumstances.

Girl realizes all she ever needed to be happy was her family, not material wealth. The End. That sums up the book. Esperanza is an entirely unlikable and unrealistic character.

Nothing funny ever happens in this book. Even in the most sobering and depressing novels (Holes, anyone?) have humor in them to crack the ice. There's no humor in the book to liven it up. This alone makes the book almost unbearable.The book starts out almost promising enough--the girl's father is a kind, loving person who is very much involved with his daughter's life. Then we actually meet the person of our main character, the wretched Esperanza.Esperanza is over-privileged. Understandable, since she comes from a wealthy family. Heck, a lot of GREAT stories have spoiled people as their main characters. Then, they go and kill her father.Big mistake to kill her father this soon in the story. Why? Because we don't care. Literally, you don't care that her father has died because you don't know who he is, what importance he has, or anything like that. EVERYONE in the film and writing business knows that if you're going to kill off a character, you gotta give him some good camera time. If you just kill an extraneous character you don't know, then the audience doesn't give a crap that he died. It's like saying that \\"Someone in Mexico died.\\" You feel the same emotional resonance in that situation as you do in this book: none.It only gets worse from there. Then her half-uncles step onto the scene. These people have no redeeming qualities. They are just there to be one-dimensional bad guys. And if you are going to have one-dimensional bad guys in one book, then you had better plan on writing a series with more explanation because the audience will see the villain as a cardboard cutout instead of real living breathing people. But I digress. These villains are out to get Esperanza. They killed her father and now they want their farm and Esperanza's mother as one of their wives. And of course, these happen to the people who own the county bank or is the mayor of the town. How convenient! And since the mother refuses, the next logical step is to set the house and ranch (which was what the uncles wanted to have for themselves) on fire. Of course!And on goes the horror. Meanwhile, little Esperanza isn't taking it too well, as is expected of anyone. This is something hard to live with. But from the get-go, something's wrong with the picture here. Esperanza a) speaks like she's a five year old as far as word choice, and b) she whines about everything. This is somewhat understandable, but she is the protagonist of the story. You could mention in passing that she was taking it hard and complaining, but Ms. Ryan chooses to delve deep, savoring every complaint and telling you EVERY whiny thought that goes through this child's head.So, they escape to America and are forced to work in a camp. More complaining from Esperanza, while the servant, Miguel, shows some grit about the situation. Esperanza is \\"bold\\" and decides to stay in their cabin (and by the descriptions, it really isn't that bad of a place, but still more complaining comes from Esperanza) all day to feed these two babies. She finds out that she isn't supposed to feed them raw plums and disgusting descriptions of babies crapping themselves come forth. More whining from Esperanza, while everyone else shows true determination, especially Miguel.And when she must sweep a platform, Esperanza has a complete lack of dexterity. She hasn't used a broom before, but if you are used to holding ANYTHING at all, you should have a grasp of the basic dexterity necessary to hold a broom. What's worse, she seems to have seen her servant do it multiple times.And on and on it goes--my complaints are many (it's too much of this stuff!) but it's time to summarize. Esperanza is a wimpy brat who never improves in the story. You are supposed to like a main character, but I find Esperanza the most unlikable person I have ever met. I find it disheartening that people can enjoy this book. (Pick up a piece of quality literature, people!) If the book had been centered on Miguel, who showed strength and courage and even was patient with his bratty master, I would have eaten it up and you would be reading a 5-star review. But really, Esperanza was forced through the story and never took any initiative of her own. She was unworthy of the title of \\"protagonist.\\" You probably could have picked anyone else in her family but her, and I would have been happy."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"Do you know how it feels to loose everything?

I don't like all the drama because there's already enough of that on TV.

Well I have. In Esperanza Rising, Esperanza has two worlds. The first world starts with happiness and it ends in sadness or anger. In her second world it starts with sadness and it ends with happiness or peace.This book explores love, courage, sadness, and friendship. Love, because she has people all around that love her. Courage, because she has courage to keep on moving on, and having hope. Sadness, because there was death. And Friendship, because she found friends who cared.Read this book. At least five chapters, but by the time you will know you are on chapters like 20, or 35, or 40. Once you start reading this book, you could not take your eyes of it.

Her name is Esperanza. She had lived on a farm with a lot of workers, she was Mexican and so was the people who worked there and to add she had worked with them to and so did her father. Her uncle wants Esperanzas mother to marry her uncle because he is an accountant that worked at the bank. He only wanted the farm to make the workers work more so he could have more money. But her mother did not marry him so that he could not have the farm. Esperanza was to be about 1 0 or 11 on the day her father had died . She has always got got the doll her father had gotten her for her Birthday every year but this year was different she had not gotten the doll this year from her father.The main characters are Esperanza , Mama ( did not show her name in book), Abuelita( Esperanzas Grandma), Alfonso(her uncle), and Miguel (Her uncle). Those are the main character of the book \\" Esperanza Rising \\". They are big part of the book that I have read.My opinion is that this is a good book to show how someone has lost his or her parent or God parent. It show how you feel and what it will be like if you have just lost a parent. And I would really recommand this to a friend who has lost a parent and know what it feels like to lose one and not have them come back. Or to a person who has not yet lost a parent and will in the future and will know what it feels like to lose one. So if they have a friend they can relate to them a lot."},{"Title":"Esperanza Rising","review":"Esperanza Rising is about a Mexican girl, named Esperanza Ortega who lived in Mexico in around the 1930s. Esperanza lived on a huge ranch, called El Rancho de la Rosas, with servants. She was very fortunate and her family was rich-that was until her father died right before her birthday. Mr. Ortega's cruel stepbrother, Luis, forces Mrs. Ortega to marry him, but she doesn't. Knowing that if she did, her family would live a miserable life, she doesn't accept. Luis sets the big ranch on fire as a threat. The Ortegas escape with a servant family to California to search for work.After arriving at California, Esperanza and the others work and live on a camp. Because of their race and culture, they are discriminated against others. Esperanza, who is used to being a princess-treated-like girl, has to learn how to work and hope for a better life. Soon, Mrs. Ortega is diagnosed with pneumonia and Esperanza knows that she has to work harder to pay for the doctor bills. Life is hard there, but Esperanza knows that there is something to look fowrad to in her new life.I think this book teaches about the life back then in Californiaand about hope. I like this book because it gives us a chance to really know how fortunate we are. On top of all the other things, I love this book because it's really realistic and you could feel the depressing moments, but even the little happiness to you is like a miracle to them.I would recommend this book to anyone starting from third grade.

He writes, &quot;...people who give admiration and affection get them back--if what they give is spontaneous and sincere. People are irresistibly drawn to 'warm' people.&quot;He describes an interview he had with Rudyard Kipling. The famous author told Gordon, &quot;Do the things you really want to do if you possibly can. Don't wait for circumstances to be exactly right. You'll find they never are.&quot;Mysteries are explored in this reflective collection. Intuition, the unsolved, and similar musings. Life is celebrated! We're told &quot;there are two types of human beings: those who think of life as a privilege and those who think of it as a problem.&quot;Consider this poignant observation he makes on purpose, &quot;The worst that can happen to any creature is to be made incapable of doing the thing it was created to do.&quot;Perhaps the most famous Arthur Gordon quote is included in this book. It's one I've heard Guidepost writer and editor Fred Bauer use: &quot;Be bold--and mighty forces will come to your aid.&quot;This is an awesome book. Its contents are powerful. I highly recommend it.

First, the calling Raymond Brown and John Mier as \\"Conservative Catholic Scholars\\" is ridiculous. The work of Brown in particular is notorius for its liberal modernistic tendecies. For Example, an article about Brown and his co-horts can be found on the website of WWW.EWTN.COM (The Conservative Catholic TV Network) about R. Brown called \\"Destroying the Bible\\" Brown and Mier's \\"science\\" is built on a stack of assumptions like the hypothetical \\"Q\\" source. See the work of the well respected Biblical scholar Luke Timothy Johnson in \\"The Real Jesus : The Misguided Quest for the Historical Jesus\\" for more on this.Second, when criticizing Walsh's Philip II as \\"anti-semitic\\" , the same can said for the writings of Luther who was notorious in his anti-semitic rhetoric. Yet we do not discount everything he had to say. However, secular historans such as Edward Peters (\\"INQUISTION\\") acknowledge the degree of exaggeration of the Inquistion has played in Polemical tracts since the 16th Century. The BBC has recently produced a TV documentary on the gross historical exaggeration in Inquistion histories for Propaganda purposes in the 19th Century. This not to say that wrongs did not occur but impact of the Inquistion was greatly distorted by 19th century historians for highly partisan purposes. Modern, Non-Partisian Historians are sifting the records now available concerning the proceedings of the Inquistion for a more \\"objective appraisal\\"One further Point-The previous reviewer criticized the idea that Christianity improved the Roman Empire. Well, for one thing it was the Christian Emperor Constantine who abolished the extreme penalty of crucifixion as a matter of law. However, to cite Gibbon on this point is extremely suspect since Gibbon is well known for his unremitting anti-christian bias and his association with certain \\"enlightment figures\\". The issue of Slavery is more complex. The Pope as early 1435 condemned slavery in writting to various Bishops. Catholic clergy such Bartholew de Las Casas were unrelenting in their crusade for Indian Rights. Even Spanish Ecclesistical academics such as Vitoria wrote against applying Aristotle's Natural Slavery Theory in the New World. The actual picture of the church's role on the issue of Slavery is more complicated than the demagoges want to make it."},{"Title":"A Brief for Belief: The Case for Catholicism","review":"I am not a Catholic but if I were one this would still not be a good book. Frederick W. Marks is best known as a diplomatic historian, whose books on Theodore Roosevelt and John Foster Dulles were endlessly adulatory, while his book on FDR was unremittingly critical. These books were unusually tendentious for a professional historian, and that vice has cropped up in his defence of Catholicism.Much of his book is based on Catholic apologies that are six to ten decades old. Many sources are not properly footnoted at all, such as his claim that Pope Clement (d. 98) quoted the Gospel of John or the statements on p. 65 about Jewish connection to usury. Much of his work on the Inquisition is based on William T. Walsh's 65 year old life of Philip II, which has no standing in scholarly circles, and which is anti-Semitic to boot. His comments on how Christianity improved the Roman Empire ignore every historian on the subject, starting with Gibbon, but also G.E.M. De Ste. Croix, Ramsay MacMullen, and Robin Lane Fox. He asserts that Catholic treatment of slaves was especially generous, and ignores those scholars such as David Brion Davis and C.R. Boxer who have undermined that. A more up to date apologist would note that Eamon Duffy and Geoffrey Parker make arguments about the Reformation which would be more useful than Marks&#65533; dated authorities. A more literate scholar would have used Henry Kamen's book on the Inquisition. He makes apologetic claims that more intelligent Catholics do not make. For example, even conservative Catholic scholars such as Raymond Brown and John P. Meier are well aware that Isaiah 7:14 does not refer to a virgin birth, and that the siblings of Jesus mentioned in the Bible were not his cousins.There is also a certain sloppiness. Jefferson supposedly supports a bill against Sabbath-breakers that was passed nine years before he was born. The reign of the emperor Hadrian is given as 183, when it was 138. Marcion's heresy is predated by thirty years. And Woodrow Wilson, who died in 1924, supposedly announced a national day of prayer for World War Two. At one point Marks argues that all great artists and statesman were moral believers. Confronting the counter-example of Wagner, he claims that he had composed all of his major works after his adulterous liaison with Cosima von Bulow. Dead wrong, since he was clearly working on the Ring cycle while conceiving two children out of wedlock, and \\"Parsifal\\" was written after his wedding to Cosima. Elsewhere Marks tries to give the Catholic Church the credit for abolishing slavery in French colonies, ignoring the fact that slavery was abolished by the Convention at the height of the Terror, was reinstated by Napoleon, was allowed by three Catholic monarchs, and was abolished once and for all by the anti-clerical democrats of the Second Republic. And he does not mention that American Bishops criticized Lincoln for issuing the Emancipation Proclamation.One could go on. Although Marks' book is a militant defense of Catholicism, he claims as believers people he would denounce as heretics if they were not secular saints; people such as Jefferson (a deist), Lincoln (not a churchgoer, who almost never spoke of Jesus), Einstein (a socialist) and Churchill. He cites as evidence of Peter's primacy, 2 Peter, unaware of the scholarly consensus that this was the last book of the New Testament to be written, five to seven decades after Peter's martyrdom. He argues, on the basis of no evidence whatsoever, that Peter was widowed when he met Jesus, and ignores 1 Corinthians 9:5 where Paul says Peter brought his wife along with him during his travels. He tries to find a biblical basis for the Catholic condemnation of birth control by arguing that all New Testament objections to sorcery are to contraception. This clearly does not follow. It is one thing to object to contraceptive medicines as sorcery, but the reverse does not follow. And how are condoms sorcery? He gives the examples of Leonardo Da Vinci and Michaelangelo as examples of celibacy, apparently unaware that both men were probably homosexual. Confronting Isaiah 7:14 he argues that the Greek translation is better than the Hebrew original. He praises the supposedly peaceful heritage Catholicism has given Latin America. He bases this on the supposedly merciful 1954 coup in Guatamela, and does not mention the tens of thousands slaughtered by its ostensibly Catholic elite over the next few decades. The Sadducees are described as \\"theologically liberal\\" when clearly they were theologically conservative in opposing such innovations as a resurrection and the scriptures after the Torah. All, in all, this is not a very reliable book."},{"Title":"No Corners for the Devil: Murder and Mystery in a Cornish Seaside Village","review":"I would have given this book 3.5 stars, but since that wasn't an option, I went ahead and bumped it up to 4. I believe I'm correct in saying that this is Olive Etchells' first mystery book (though she has written other novels), and it's not a bad effort at all.The story starts out by introducing us to the Baxters, a family consisting of Sally, Robert and their three children. They've recently moved to village in Cornwall and Ben, the youngest son, soon discovers the body of a 17-year-old girl on his favorite beach. The oldest son, Luke, immediately comes under suspicion, since he was the last one to see the girl alive, but before long the whole family becomes involved, one way or another, with the murder.DCI Channon, a quiet and kind officer, heads the case with his abrasive assistant, Sergeant Bowles, and the two soon discover that there is much more to the case than they initially expected.The writing in this novel was solid, though I found some of the dialogue, especially Sally's \\"internal dialogue,\\" to be a bit awkward. One of the major problems I had with this book is that I just didn't like the characters all the much (with the exception of DCI Channon). Having said that, however, I would most likely pick up another mystery by Etchells, should she decide to write more of them."},{"Title":"No Corners for the Devil: Murder and Mystery in a Cornish Seaside Village","review":"I hope this is the start of a new series.

Worth reading."},{"Title":"No Corners for the Devil: Murder and Mystery in a Cornish Seaside Village","review":"The plot was good and there were enough suspects to keep me going, but the motive was a little weak.

It remains an indispensible guide for the playwright who is searching to create their own style, especially if that style has nothing to do with sofas and kitchen sinks. Kerr, the renowned NY Times Theater critic, uses this book to beg, implore, and prod playwrights into accepting, exploring and exulting in all that is theatrical and dramatic. If your idea of great theater involves the unities of time and place, and a penchant for realistic sets, then please do yourself and theater lovers the courtesy of purchasing SCREENPLAY by Syd Field.

Sure, I can read to him from the Bible, but with no pictures he is not interested.This book has gorgeous old-fashioned illustrations along with classic prayers in grown-up language.

In 1996 I was the librarian of an elementary school on Long Island, I job I had for ten years previously. My principal received a complaint about the book and in the interests of political correctness removed it from the shelf. My staff association and the local professional organization I belonged to at that time were instrumental in seeing that the book was returned.

Draper also helped fund private, racist schools throughout the state. And what is so tragic, even though he is long gone, the \\"foundation\\" lives on.

I am a secondary school teacher of chemistry in England (11 to 18 year olds) and I was interested to see whether I could pick up any anecdotes or teaching tips from the book, as well as expand my general knowledge of chemistry.I found the book to be very easy to read. The complexities of chemistry are largely demystified and the writing is both simple and full of enthusiasm for the subject. The key point that Asimov puts over is that highly complicated concepts can be broken down into a series of logical, simple steps that most students can understand. There are also lots of little anecdoates that can be used in class as throwaway lines to emphasise a point.A final comment concerning the book: although it was written in the 1960's, much of what Asimov predicts has come true, whether it concern space travel, global warming, increased use of computers etc. It is clear that he has an excellent understanding of chemistry, and the capability to put this understanding and enthusisasm over in a easy-to-read manner."},{"Title":"Asimov on Chemistry","review":"This is a collection of 17 essays written between 1959 and 1966. It's an anecdotal approach to chemistry. Plenty of history (the whos and the hows) along with the facts and figures.It makes a good booster for high school or college students looking to understand what they're learning in class. Provides a different perspective than the typical textbook. I bought this when I was in high school and just looking to round out my understanding of chemistry; I've kept it long past that because it's just plain a good book to have around. It's not comprehensive but it does an interesting job with the topics it does tackle. I'd recommend it to anyone interested in the subject."},{"Title":"Asimov on Chemistry","review":"I originally found this book at the library, as well as similar essay collections (Asimov: On Physics, On Numbers, On Astronomy).

We recognize them by the deeds they are able to accomplish because of their consciousness remaining opened through which an abundance of energy and untapped knowledge pours.Following Dorothy's own Kundalini experience, she is being guided to translate many portions of the Bible. In THE BIBLE AND KUNDALINI ENERGY, she lays bare the hidden mysteries revealing how the Kundalini energy is cloaked in the Scriptures; an ability she totally credits to Spirit working through her elevated consciousness.&quot;A deeper interpretation of the Eastern teachng on Kundalini energy, called Holy Spirit by Christians, is the theme. You will learn miracles found in the Bible are a result of Kundalini being active in a person or place. Some of the interpretations are based on a Christian foundation and some are combined with Eastern teaching. The thesis is: The Divine Energy, Kundalini or Holy Spirit, is basic to the teaching of our Judeo/Christian Bible and to our personal spiritual evolution.&quot;The Bible calls to all of us. If you've read part or all of the Bible and have put it aside because it was too difficult to interpret, read Dorothy's book as a companion. Because of the knowledge that pours forth through her and into more than twelve books thus far, we can now understand the hidden messages of the Scriptures. Finally, we can understand how the Kundalini has been a part of humanity and all life throughout time.(Paragraph in quotes used by this author with permission from Dorothy Elder.)"},{"Title":"The Bible and Kundalini Energy, The New Testament, Deep Secrets of the","review":"I practice and teach Kundalini Yoga, and as much as I would like to give this book a higher rating, I just can't. I whole-heartedly agree with Dorothy Elder's contention that Kundalini energy and the Holy Spirit are one and the same, but her book just left me cold. The passages from the Bible which she &quot;reinterprets&quot; struck me as highly contrived. This topic needs to be explored and brought forth in our modern world and this book is a valiant attempt to do so, but it just comes up short somehow."},{"Title":"Remembering America: A Voice from the Sixties","review":"Richard Goodwin clerked for a Supreme Court justice, played an important role in the politics of the 1960's, and was personally acquainted with JFK, RFK, LBJ, and Eugene McCarthy. As such, one might imagine that he's got some great stories to tell. And he does. But, lest you get the wrong idea, let me tell you some things you won't find in Remembering America.Like some others, I bought the book after seeing the movie Quiz Show, to read more about the Van Doren scandal. And, yes, the book is about Van Doren; it's also about a lot of other things, and the quiz show scandal of the late 1950's is only a small part. There's a lot more here than that.So many books written about JFK and RFK idolize them and give them godlike status. Goodwin clearly admires them both, and is not an impartial judge of either - but in all fairness, I don't believe he would claim to be unbiased. But, if you're looking for effusive, gushing praise of the Kennedys, a la Pierre Salinger, you'll probably find Remembering America a disappointment. Goodwin presents fairly well-rounded portraits of both men.Perhaps you want historical analysis, complete with graphs, footnotes, and scholarly reasoning. This isn't it. This is Goodwin's own recollections over his career, include his brief (and hilarious) Army service; his admiration of, and later pity for, Johnson; his shock and grief when Robert Kennedy (who had become a close friend by then) was assassinated; his personal impressions, memories of, and anecdotes about a wide variety of significant people, from Felix Frankfurter to Che Guevara.Maybe you want &quot;the voice of the sixties,&quot; complete with all the garbage that often passes these days for political and historical thought about that period: self-indulgence, combined with the sanctimonious suggestion that the baby boomers were the only people ever to be troubled by or try to change the world around them, topped with the arrogant idea that they are always right. Nope, you won't find that here either. Goodwin does recall that decade as turbulent, exciting, and volatile; I wouldn't be surprised if he considered those years the best times in his life. But he does not consider the era or people to be sacred.So what's here to like? A hell of a lot."},{"Title":"Remembering America: A Voice from the Sixties","review":"Goodwin was very close to many of the major political figures of the 60's, and it shows in his book. He gives insights into the men who ran the country during that decade of change, and helps to introduce the reader to the men as they really were, not necessarily who they seemed to be. I found Goodwin to be a very truthful author, which is important to me.Goodwin is very much a free thinker, often taking actions that he feels are \\"right\\", rather than those that would be best for his career. I found this refreshing, and maybe this is more of Goodwin remembering how things should have been rather than how things really were, but I have found no evidence to refute his claims. He presents everything in a thoughful way, rather than a dry recounting of facts.A note on the tone of the book: If you can't stomach liberal politics, then this is not the book for you. Goodwin wanted to change the world, and that world would have been one laden with liberal policies. Conservatives may end up beating themselves over the head with this book. You have been warned! :)"},{"Title":"Remembering America: A Voice from the Sixties","review":"Richard N. Goodwin gives a detailed analysis on of the most intriguing and eventful era's in U.S. history. His personal account and experience with the most powerful leaders was strikingly fascinating. The book begins with a brief description of his childhood. From Goodwin's Anti-Semitic dilemmas to his scholastic achievement that lead to his admission to New York's Columbia University. After his graduating at the top of his class at Harvard Law School,he received a clerical job working for a Supreme Court justice. To the justice's disgusts, Goodwin decides to work on a presidential campaign for then Mass. Senator, John F. Kennedy. Richard N. Goodwin proceeds through his exciting and successful election of 1960. JFK awarded Goodwin for his splendid work on the campaign , as a top consultant to Latin America. After the assasination, he is forced to work with LBJ. Not content at first, he sees Johnson under a different limelight. The author is more pleased and optimistic about Johnson, only to be let down with Vietnam. LBJ's erratic behavior and his paranoid personality, leads to an early exit from The White House. I highly recommend this book to to individual's who enjoy reading about contemporary American History. As someone who was fortunate to be born a decade later , I was still able to appreciate the historical significance Goodwin's rise and fall within the political arena."},{"Title":"Remembering America: A Voice from the Sixties","review":"Through Dick Goodwin's masterful retelling of this chapter in history, we are given the opportunity to be a fly on the wall inside the political machinery of one of the most exciting and, at the same time disappointing, decades in our history."},{"Title":"Remembering America: A Voice from the Sixties","review":"I thought this book was great!!! A real behind the scenes look at the Kennedy and Johnson administrations in the early 60's. Mr Goodwin graduated number one from Harvard Law School and clerked for Felix Frankfurter. Goodwin penned some of the most memorable speeches of the decade and coined phrases such as the Alliance for Progress and the Great Society. He witnessed LBJ at his best, (Civil Rights), worst (Vietnam paranoia) and hilarious, an on the toilet meeting with LBJ and swimming naked in the White House pool with LBJ and Bill Moyers. He grew disillusioned with Johnson's war in Vietnam and left the administration in 1965. He was an intimate of Bobby Kennedy and worked for both Bobby and Eugene McCarthy in 1968. The interesting thing about this book is how much relevance it has today with the war in Iraq. A president from Texas, low approval ratings, congressional investigations, and a closed and paranoid White House. Some things never change."},{"Title":"Remembering America: A Voice from the Sixties","review":"This is a great book by Richard Goodwin who's place in history is unique to no one other. He was envolved deeply in the quiz show scandal of the late 1950's, the Kennedy and Johnson administrations as well as Mccarthy's and Robert Kennedy's run for the white house in 1968.

The Paragraph? You'll know IT when YOU read it -- it is when Goodwin is out on a US Presidential Campaign Primary Trail. He opens the trunk of his automobile and peers into the gear stored there.

A couple of them openly confessed to having given up part-way through. My question: Why are you reviewing the book you haven't even read? Granted, it's not a Hollywood film, but it is perhaps one of the greatest works of the 20th century, written by an author who stands on par with Gandhi or Mother Teresa in her committment to social justice. Think about it this way: Addams' settlement house (or Hull House, as it was called) was like an ashram built in the middle of Chicago's dirtiest late 19th century slum. She was doing social work of a kind that had never been done before - working with immigrants, single mothers, orphins, troubled youth and the unemployed. The scope of her sociological experience has never been matched. Politically, Addams was an advocate for the abolition of war, and these views not only secured her the Nobel Prize, but also a black-listing with the House of Un-American Activities. I don't see what is not to like about this book. It is autobiographical in the strict sense of the term, but Addams was larger than life. If you are even vaguely interested in ethics, social work, sociology, social justice, or democracy, Addams' story will inspire and amaze you. Her life was a paradigmn of exellence. It was a life that will inspire you to achieve greatness yourself. I cannot over-recommend familiarizing yourself with this figure, and 20 Years at Hull House is the best place to start."},{"Title":"Twenty Years At Hull-House","review":"Like many of her fellow &quot;Progressives,&quot; Jane Addams was born in the midwest and received an exceptional scholastic and religious education. She was strongly devoted to her father and shared with him a reverence for Abraham Lincoln not just as a man, but as a living ideal against which all men should measure their ideas and actions. Typical of many reformers of her era, Addams was not attracted to evangelical duty. Missionary work left her with a sense of futile detachment from the wretched social conditions she witnessed in East London. After visiting Toynbee Hall, Addams decided to establish a similar settlement house in the rapidly-growing city of Chicago, where &quot;the evil and vices of American life seemed to be exaggerated.&quot; Her experiences at this settlement house are the subject of this book.Although, on the one hand, Addams seemed the typical Progressive; on the other hand she did not follow many of the ideas of the more radical reformers. She was very practical and refused to be swayed by the claims of certain social movements and untried panaceas. she did not become a socialist. Although she greatly admired Tolstoy, she found his message &quot;confused and contradictory&quot; and doubted its suitability to the situation in Chicago. She deplored any violent tactics associated with socialist and anarchist groups despite their &quot;noble motives.&quot; Addams demostrated an understanding of the ways in which strikes had a detrimental effect on people outside the labor movement (her dying sister was unable to see her family because the transportation system was blocked due to the Pullman strike. Unlike most reformers, she also had respect for the immigrant cultures represented at Hull House. A labor museum put native sewing machines and other instruments and crafts on display for all to enjoy.One observation made by this reader was the animosity on the part of European reformers toward the work of the settlement residents. Tolstoy offered petty criticisms and one English visitor concluded that reformers in America were indifferent to the plight of the poor because they could not recite the &quot;cubic feet of air required for each occupant of a tenement bedroom.&quot; Such remarks smack of a &quot;caring competition.&quot; Addams, however, was well aware that the settlement house experiment was far from complete. Jane Addams' honest and humble account--albeit long and sometimes rambling (don't let the skinny paperback fool you)--demonstrated her unwavering commitment to achieving the improvement and unity of humanity."},{"Title":"Twenty Years At Hull-House","review":"Though Addams' prose often gets mired in the florid and highly mannered style of her era, this is a surprisingly compelling book. Free of the ethnic racism and stereotyping that blight many similar works of the era, Addams' account of her groundbreaking community center in one of the worst parts of late 19th-century Chicago fairly overflows with compassion and almost unbelievable fairness. Addams's intelligence is evident, and many of her ideas and attitudes seem decades ahead of their time. It's not light reading by any stretch of the imagination, but &quot;Twenty Years at Hull House&quot; contains many gripping portraits of the desperation of immigrant life and the simple power of human decency."},{"Title":"Twenty Years At Hull-House","review":"Twenty Years at Hull House is an outstanding example of the humanitarianism movement in America at the turn of the century. Jane Addams, the author and narrator of the book, was born in Illinois. Early in her life she began to see the effects of poverty on people. She recalls one incident early in her life of seeing a homeless man on the street. She asked her father why that was, and he replied that that was just the way things were. Her father was a Quaker and the most prominate role model in Jane's life. As a child she grew up wanting to be just like him. For a while, she aspired to be a mill owner just like him. Her mother is not mentioned in the book at all. Jane went to Rockford College and soon toured London. It was there that she came up with the idea of the Hull House. Hull House was a settlement house in Chicago. It offered day care and college level classes for women. Spawning from her work at the house, Jane joined many causes that she passionately fought for. These causes included working hours for women, child labor laws, and juivenile court. She could be considered an early feminist. Also from her work at Hull House, Jane started studing the causes of poverty and the effects it had on society. She was not satisfied with just the success of her house; she wanted to know why there was a need for it at all. Later in her life she joined the womens sufferage movement. Jane Addams was a wonderful reformist and feminist that sought to better the country. Twenty Years at Hull House offer insight into one of America' most interesting time periods."},{"Title":"Twenty Years At Hull-House","review":"I am doing a History Fair project on the Hull House.

She was also a leader in women's suffrage and pacifist movements. In 1915 she helped found the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. She received the 1931 Nobel Peace Prize (shared with American educator Nicholas Murray Butler).The Hull House could boast a group of about 2,000 people a week. It had facilities including: a night school for adults, kindergarten classes, clubs for older children, a public kitchen, an art gallery, a coffeehouse, a gymnasium, a girls club, a swimming pool, a book bindery, a music school, a drama group, a library, and labor related divisions.The Hull House also served as a women's institution of sociology and Addams was a friend and colleague to the early men of the Chicago School of Sociology influencing their social thought of the time through her work in applied sociology, which became defined as social work by academic sociologists of the time. Addams did not, however, consider herself a social worker. She co-authored the Hull-House Maps and Papers in 1893 that came to define the interests and methodologies of Chicago Sociology. She worked with George H. Mead on social reform issues including women's rights and the 1910 Garment Workers' Strike. Addams combined the central concepts of symbolic interactionism with the theories of cultural feminism and pragmatism to form her sociological ideas."},{"Title":"Twenty Years At Hull-House","review":"I enjoy reading about strong women with great vision.

For decades a Hull House sojourn, or at least a visit, was virtually a pilgrimage for all kinds of progressive reformers. Jane Addams came from a conventional Middle American milieu, but was radicalized by seeing the ravages of the Industrial Revolution both in Britain and Chicago. This timeless memoir of the years 1889-1909 documents her wide-ranging concerns, embracing public health, pacifism and feminism as well as philanthropy, working-class education and poverty alleviation. Nationalist hysteria damaged Addams's reputation as a result of her antiwar stance during World War I, but it recovered enough for her to win the 1931 Nobel Peace Prize. Students had mixed views of book and author. To some she is a revelation, but others see her as rather sanctimonious (a fair criticism to some extent). Her prose is accessible but a little archaic now, sometimes appearing flowery or pompous, which deters some readers. While I respect and admire Addams, I waited in vain for the epiphany felt by thousands inspired by her life's work. People who find their own way to \\"Hull-House\\" will probably appreciate her more than those required to read her book---but such unsought exposure lies at the heart of liberal education, and brings many rewards."},{"Title":"Twenty Years At Hull-House","review":"This is an inspiring book!

Her goal it seems was to bring high society upper middle class values to the poor. She rarely talks about others who had to be involved. If it did not include her she was not interested in reporting.

If you want to read another book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever."},{"Title":"Twenty Years At Hull-House","review":"You have to be insane to like this book... wait...

I'm a romantic at heart and to say this book touched me is an understatement. Just the right touch of action mixed with romance to make me feel I was part of the story. Casey is the perfect heroine and I want to know where I can find a man like Britt Black. If this is the author's first book then I can't wait for more.It's a modern story based in the early nineties about a woman who is obsessed with eliminating the world of drug dealers. Not to spoil the plot but she finds her perfect counterpart and almost loses it all. I highly recommend this book if you just want to relax and have a good read. I couldn't put it down once I got started. Just enough romance to fill the tension and I always enjoy cliffhangers to make me want more.Beverly Brugger"},{"Title":"Round the world;","review":"A very well written travel book from 1884. Among his many talents as an industrialist and philanthropist, I have to add author. After reading this book, I consider that Andrew Carnegie is a wonderfully gifted writer. I recommend this book for capturing the world of the late 1800s. He had access to different people in politics and business around the world due to being an industrialist.Andrew Carnegie was a wealthy American industrialist of the late 1800s. I remember him best for all of the libraries he built spread out across America which were a wonderful gift to the country.When he initially traveled around the world, he made some notes which he privately published for his friends. At their urging, he cleaned up the notes and published them in this book. He is a wonderful writer, and writes better than most professional writers that I have read during my life. In addition to the expected travel book fare, he has comments on international finance and government which are very pertinent to the time. Some of the comments still apply today as they are timeless.Carnegie is a gifted observer of people and things and able to convey his thoughts in words to the reader. He traveled by rail from Pittsburgh to San Francisco, from where the steamship Belgic sailed for Japan. He captures the feel of the ships he was on with the other passengers. He brings to life the different countries he visited with their scenery, people and customs. He went to Japan, and visited Yokohama, Tokio ( spelling used in the book), and Nagasaki. In China, Peking and Shanghai, Canton, the Paris of the East in the late 1800s were visited."},{"Title":"Shepherding A Woman's Heart: A New Model for Effective Ministry to Women","review":"This book is a must for the library of all Women's Ministry Leaders, especially those struggling to express to others why it is so very important to have an active, relevent ministry for women.

It is a clear and fair examination of the pros and cons of involving students in college and university governance.The book extends its analysis through historical example and contemporary practice. McGrath concludes that students can and should play a large role in governance, but that the burden is so great that administrators need to promote and encourage such participation as an integral part of students' educational experience. Including students in governance must be a community endeavor, not an adversarial one.McGrath shows convincingly, among many points I would like to quote, that &quot;students whom faculty members consider sufficiently mature intellectually and morally to study understandingly such works as Plato's Republic, Aristotle's Politics, Aquinas' Summa Theologica, Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, Shakespeare's Hamlet and Macbeth, Whitehead and Russell's Principia Mathematica, Freud's Introduction to Psychoanalysis, Wundt's Volkerpsychologie, to say nothing of the demanding treatises in modern physics,&quot; can without much trouble &quot;comprehend and deal with the theoretical issues and the practical problems of [merely] the academic establishment&quot; (71).An extensive survey of actual practice produces much cross-institutional data about real student involvement at every level of decision-making. One hopes that a survey in this generation might be done for the purpose of gauging how far we have come toward meeting McGrath's challenge."},{"Title":"Goldoon and Professor: Memoirs and Reflections of a Bicultural Marriage","review":"Do you believe in love that lasts a lifetime?

But what it does contain is possibly &quot;real&quot; autobiographical insight into Burroughs' childhood. It was written at an important phase in Burroughs' life--just as he was preparing to return to the US of A from his self-inflicted exile in Tunisia. What is surprising about this book is that it is his only work primarily situated in childhood episodes. Are these his own early experiences with sexuality? Difficult to decipher. Also shocking (to a Burroughs' reader) is his attempt to direct his cut-up random method into a more apprehendable narrative. Also, it largely occurs in St. Louis and his early boyhood homes in America... with periodic flights to an &quot;interzone.&quot; This review is for a reader of Burroughs, and as I have said there isn't much new here nor is it his best writing, but each of the facets I mentioned about should compel an avid fan to read this strangely personal and insightful look into a man in transition and upheavel who normally and so easily eludes interpretation and any sense of emotion.

By alternating the &quot;dream&quot; or interzone sequences, he is letting out his early childhood- dreams and experiences. Having read ALL of his books, and most of the biographies- as well as seeing him read before he passed away- I think this is one of the missed gems, and should be more recognized for what it is- simply another brilliant book by WSB. (1914-1997) The mere fact that he didn't want to be a writer, and Kerouac and Ginsberg had to type all his early manuscripts for him- speaks for itself. It's incredible. If he hadn't picked up a pen,there would be a great loss in literature. As Norman Mailer correctly pointed out, &quot;He is the only writer alive, conceivably possessed by genius...&quot;"},{"Title":"Port of Saints (Paperback) (\\"New Edition\\")","review":"Perfectly readable for any Burroughs fan, but far from his best work. The main problem with \\"Port of Saints\\" is that it rehashes themes already covered elsewhere (in \\"The Wild Boys\\") and introduces themes that Burroughs later explored more effectively (in the stunning \\"Cities of the Red Night\\", which I feel is his finest novel). To be honest, I believe the author exhausted all the possibilities of the wild boy concept in a single volume but, even when \\"Port of Saints\\" begins to feel redundant, it's still packed with the kind of sad, ghostly imagery that only William Burroughs could conjure: \\"Somewhere a long time ago the summer ended. Old pulp magazines on the white steps...Remember who the Stranger was breathing the writer's self-knowledge and God guilt?...Long long how long in the lost town heard he was a caddy years later.\\"If you've read most of Burroughs's other books, \\"Port of Saints\\" will hardly bowl you over--but it won't disappoint his fans, either. It's a little like reading one of Raymond Chandler's lesser works, such as \\"Playback\\": it won't change your life, but you'll enjoy it.

Roosevelt hunted down scores of the Big Five(lions, buffalo, elephant, rhino and leopard) and the other lesser game of Africa.

The book is a collection of articles he wrote during his 1909-10 safari for Scribners.One of the questions I had before I read the book is whether it would actually provide interesting insights into Roosevelt and Africa, or whether it would just relate how Roosevelt shot up wildlife. I found the book to be a mix of both. Roosevelt is a keen observer of wildlife and provides many insights into animals that biologists consider accurate today (and that I observed on my trip). His discussion of which of the Big 5 (Lions, Leopards, Elephants, Rhinos, and Cape Buffalo) is the most dangerous is interesting and he reflects upon his own experiences to conclude that it depends on the situation. There are also a few memorable stories, such as the time when his fellow hunters had to throw several spears into a Lion to stop its charge. It is also simply fun to see a former U.S. president in all sorts of crazy situations (the book has great black & white photos from the trip).However, the most interesting aspect of the book is its insight into Roosevelt himself. He frequently calls indigenous Africans savages and praises European settlers. From these remarks, it is clear that he saw Europeans in Africa in much the same manner as he saw the American West - a new frontier to be settled on behalf of civilization. He isn't racist - at least according to the standards of his time (in the U.S., he was actually quite progressive on race) - but rather reflects a Social Darwinist view of humanity.This is a long book (over 500 pages in my version) and it seems long after a while since it generally involves the accumulated killing of animals. However, you have to remember that it was originally written as a series of articles for Scribners and was not meant to be read in one sitting. I think it works well if you read it over a few days or weeks. I read mine during the long drives from one park to the next during my safari in East Africa. That way, you won't get fatigued by the hunting stories.One final note: this book is crying out for an annotated edition. I think it would be great for some conservation biologist to expound upon Roosevelt's observations of African wildlife. While Roosevelt gets many things right, we have also benefitted from a century of field research in East Africa. For example, Roosevelt at first is adamant that there is only one species of Rhinoceros, with the Black Rhino being the common form and White Rhinos a sub-species aberration (although by the end of the book he sounds less sure). Of course, today we consider these two distinct species and in fact the Black Rhino is far less common. I would also be interested in learning whether his observations of the African tribes were accurate. Alas, this is the work of a future edition. While you're waiting, you can take this edition of African Game Trails with you on your next safari."},{"Title":"African game trails","review":"Great descriptions of some fine hunts against dangerous game and great commentary on the local human wildlife so to speak.

Written in 1909, 1910, immediately after Roosevelt left the Presidency and went to Africa in March, 1909, for the Smithsonian, to shoot a zillion animals and bring back their hides and heads for the collections. He went with his son Kermit, who shot most of the very fuzzy black and white pictures in the book, and more animals even than his father. He was about 20 then. It is a picture of colonial East Africa at that time, and of Western man's thinking about the black natives, who were \\"children\\". Thankfully, that sort of mind-set has disappeared.

But the excitement and adrenaline rush of viewing the magnificent beasts of the wild may be captured in similar ways. T.R.'s vivid descriptions of his adventures makes this depiction of Africa come to life. Through his use of graphic details of kills, life on safari, and portrayals of the people themselves makes this book worth reading. At times, I found it nearly impossible to put down.

Not only a good hunting tale but a revealing look at the man himself through his own eyes. Roosevelt's 1909 opinions on hunting, race relations and other current pertinent topics is revealing.

You hear his African stories, his opinions, his knowledge of animals and hunting. The book proceeds chronologically and contains many excellent descriptions of tracking and hunting African game (these might become redundant for some readers). Readers might also be disturbed by his description of what he perceived as the inferiority of certain African peoples, and the need for Africans to be &quot;civilized&quot; through European rule. He also believed in the rightness of making parts of Africa (the best parts of course) a &quot;white man's country&quot; for European settlers, though he insists that &quot;the African native should be treated fairly&quot;--how this would be accomplished is not discussed. Still...&quot;African Game Trails&quot; is a wonderful book for anyone interested in East Africa in the early 1900's, or for anyone interested in Theodore Roosevelt. It was his love of the outdoors, of nature, and of hunting (not contridictions in his time) that led Roosevelt to spend a significant amount of his life in the world's wide open spaces away from &quot;civilization&quot;. It is clear that he, like many great thinkers (Beethoven comes to mind), found solace and renewal in the fresh air and quiet of plains, forests, and mountains. He spent almost a year on his African safari. His book was the first by an American to popularize the idea of recreational travel in Africa (still considered a daunting prospect by many Americans today). The prose is easy to read and makes one want to keep reading. Also of interest is the appendix containing the list of books (the &quot;pigskin library&quot;) that he took with him on his safari.Roosevelt also promoted the outdoor life and its benefits in &quot;A Book-Lover's Holidays in the Open&quot; (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1916)"},{"Title":"African game trails","review":"Not only was the 26th president of the United States a great politician, and one of the most beloved men of all time he was also an adventure and an explore.

It appears that all hunting rules were suspended for the ex-president. Roosevelt and son are soon blasting away at anything and everything that comes into view.

It is odd to hear Roosevelt describe parts of Africa as a &quot;white man's country,&quot; suitable for large scale settlement by Europeans.

The hero and heroine are both strong, dynamic personalities and the children are delightful.I did not find the war section at all boring because I like espionage and found the political adventure a much more interesting backdrop for the romance than just the ton going to parties.I agree with the other reviewer's statements about the infidelity, however. Just being proud and arrogant is not sufficient justification, but since we, the reader know that Matthieu is a really bad guy, I was able to overlook that."},{"Title":"A Kind of Honor","review":"From the blurb on the book, I suspected this regency was about an affair, and I was right.The hero-Adam, is a war hero and Amanda-are thrown together when Adam is secretly trying to find a French Spy.I won't go further into the book in case you choose to read it.I personally quit this book because I don't read romances, definately regencies, to read about infidelity.I was pretty sure the author was going to set the husband up as a villian to \\"justify\\" the affair-but she made a mistake when she had the hero living at their home as a guest. And this is no school room miss-she's been married some years and has children-so the husband would have to have been truly evil for me to accept the adultery-and it was not the case.The book also gives way too much info about the war-the first 40 or so pages are predominately just that-boring.In my opinion this is not one of Miss Wolf's better regencies.

As the authors of The Harvey House Cookbook describe, initially any food available on the long cross-country trips was provided during the 20-minutes or so that it took to replenish the locomotive's water supply, and the railroads didn't think they were in the food business. The food was dreadful -- until Paul Harvey suggested to the Santa Fe Railroad that he provide the restaurants, good food, and personnel.In a few short years, someone taking the train from Kansas to Los Angeles might be served -- on white linen, by uniformed wait staff -- roast turkey with cranberries, lobster salad, and New York ice cream. Most likely, they were served by waitresses called Harvey Girls (perhaps you vaguely remember the Judy Garland movie,The Harvey Girls?). Those young women, who had to meet the criteria of \\"young women, 18 to 30 years of age, of good character, attractive and intelligent\\" often married local men... the *best* of the local men, suggest the authors, since the girls had plenty to choose from. And thus they had a profound impact. So did the resort hotels that the Fred Harvey company built or ran, among them El Tovar at the Grand Canyon and La Fonda in Santa Fe.The history in this book is excellent: well told, backed up with plenty of facts and sources, and accompanied with photos and even a Harvey House menu from 1888 (the meal cost 75 cents). It's a short, non-academic read. If you have any interest in railroad history or the opening of the American West, you'll enjoy the book.The book advertises itself as a cookbook, however, and indeed there are about 200 recipes. But they are primarily of historical interest rather than \\"What I'll cook tonight.\\" It's not that the recipes are bad; to the contrary, they're fine, though many have a 19th century imprecision that we're not used to. They're just unremarkable except in the context of the \\"Harvey System\\" whereby Fred Harvey (and later his son) were innovators in \\"quality franchise operations,\\" including such things as roast goose with cognac and apples, chicken enchiladas, or pampano in papillote. Menus were determined based on what was in season and sent by train from California (for produce) or the midwest (for meat). It's impressive and astonishing to think of that being accomplished in the 1880s at conveyed-by-railroad speed. Still, I just made a cheese fondue for dinner a few days ago, and the recipe I used was very much like the one in this cookbook. If you *do* cook from it, you won't go wrong; the point I want to make is that the recipes are, in all likelihood, \\"illustrations\\" more than they're \\"dinner tonight.\\"I know plenty of male rail fans (in the model railroad club to which we belong) who would buy this cookbook as a present for their wives (\\"See honey, I got you a cookbook!\\") and then read the book themselves for the history. Go ahead. I won't tell."},{"Title":"The Harvey House Cookbook: Memories of Dining Along the Santa Fe Railroad","review":"There are better books on dining car recipes, including \\"Dining by Rail\\" and \\"Dinner in the Diner,\\" and both available through Amazon.

I have read several books by the &quot;experts&quot;, i.e. Kluft, Putnam, etc. I could't put myself into the &quot;categories&quot; or &quot;time frames&quot; and felt I wasn't making progress the way &quot;I should&quot;. The Family Inside makes total sense to me. The authors allow a multiple her uniqueness - no two multiples are alike as no two people are alike. There are many ways I identify with Judy Kessler. Some of my alters work with &quot;subdivisions&quot; of themselves, as did Judy's. These are the ones that hold hurt, etc, and don't really talk. I was relieved to read this. I related to Judy's struggle in having to relate a memory over and over before it could even start to become a &quot;memory of the past&quot; - relating it as many times as it took. I learned that comforting the &quot;children&quot; is okay. It is not silly or odd to yearn for unmet childhood needs. I learned that multiples do not develop through many stages of their lives as they are too busy dissociating in order to survive. Wow, this makes plain good common sense to me. A multiple is too busy being a multiple to develop - we are most intelligent little beings who found a way to dissociate in order to survive - NOT DIE!! - we didn't have feelings - we couldn't show emotions. These are all things I knew inside but didn't know how to verbalize until I read The Family Inside. These little people still need to find their way through the lost develomental stages in order to recover. God bless Doris Bryant and Lynda Shirar for their down to earth insightful method of helping a multiple. They have a wonderful sense of what it takes to give us our lives back. I feel better about myself now. My feelings don't seem so strange - I know my feelings are me and are okay no matter how awful they are- because of this book. God bless Judy Kessler for sharing herself with me. I gave this book to my therapist - who loves it as well. I, too, am blessed with a very special therapist - she encourages US to be US and ME to be ME. I felt I had a true kindred spirit in Judy when I read her advice to those working with multiples. It takes a very dedictated person. There is no room for &quot;screwing around&quot;. She lets therapists know what we need - what is acceptable and what isn't. They must be totally dedicated to sticking it out through the nightmare of horrors we slowly entrust to them. These authors show a well deserved respect for MPD. They project the feeling of it being a priviledge to work with a multiple. Thank you for the best book ever on MPD. I would love to write directly to Judy and Doris."},{"Title":"The Family Inside: Working With the Multiple","review":"This is the only book I've read that talks about how a multiple's system may be structured. Now I understand why my insiders rarely come out, and when they do, mostly at night. The book also discusses and recommends co-therapy -- therapy with two therapists, which I've found therapists reluctant to do, even though I've suggested it. MPD is so bewildering. I feel for the first time, after reading this book, that I finally know where to place myself and my system in the galaxy, and what my work needs to be. It makes me feel connected, just a tiny bit, to the human race, which I've been outside of my whole life."},{"Title":"The Family Inside: Working With the Multiple","review":"As a professional treating an MPD for the first time I equipped myself with just about every book available on this topic. This book by far has been the most informative, interesting and valuable of all the material I have read. Not only did it give me insight in to the structure of the &quot;multiple&quot; mind but has deepened my understanding of the effects of trauma on victims in general. The narrative is presented from the perspective of the clinicians and includes theory and practical applications and from the perspective of the patient which gives the reader an inside view of the experience of a &quot;multiple&quot;. The material is extremely well written, well organized and structured in a way that it can easily be used as a referrence for specific issues and concerns that come up during treatment (must first be read from cover to cover). I do not ordinarily read professional texts as I do novels which I cannot put down. In the case of &quot;The Family Inside&quot;, I toted it around and read it with great interest whenever I had a free moment. A must read for anyone with an interest in this subject."},{"Title":"The Family Inside: Working With the Multiple","review":"If I were to recommend only one book on mending Dissociative Identity Disorder, this would be it. Wonderfully, thoughtfully written and helpful to therapists, individuals who experience dissociative identity, supportive others who want to understand. A full treasure chest of healing techniques. Approaches mending from a developmental and inner family systems perspective (Virginia Satir). The authors share illustrative examples of healing and integration throughout the therapeutic work from both professional and client perspectives. Absolutely stellar: this book deserves the highest rating. Concurrently, there are many books on dissociative identity that really don't convey the complexity of either dissociation or of the therapeutic mending process. This one does. There are also some books on dissociative identity that tend to sensationalize the issue or focus on detailed or graphic descriptions of horrific abuse that may or may not be applicable to all cases of DID, perhaps giving readers a less whole and layered understanding than this book can, and in this sense evading one critical core issue of Dissociative Identity: severe developmental damage in the stages of child development. This book does not underestimate the consequences of severe emotional trauma and neglect in the development of Dissociative Identity Disorder. While sexual, emotional, physical, and ritualized trauma are covered in the book, the focus is on the way trauma is processed by the developing child, and on the ways to mend those developmental fissures. Trauma forever changes a child at the moments that it is experienced, and the changes in personality structure and developmental ability that result ripple through deep waters for years afterward. This book is a gem."},{"Title":"The Family Inside: Working With the Multiple","review":"My comments are more so directed towards those who are still struggling with just the idea of have \\"parts\\", or being \\"multiple\\": After several years of dealing with repressed memories surfacing, my therapist was trying to get me used to the idea of my having \\"parts\\" (an easier word for me to accept than 'multiple'). It took me a long time to even accept the idea, but things were increasingly happening in my head and life that was proving that it was true: I had 'parts.' Because I was struggling to accept her 'diagnosis', I asked her to suggest a book for me to read that would help me to understand what she was trying to convey. She suggested 'The Family Inside'. Not really wanting to read the book, yet feeling desperate to understand what was happening to me, I simply opened the book, letting it open to where ever it fell and began reading. It opened to somewhere in chapter 4 where it explains the different personalities of the 'parts' and their interactions with each other. Once I started reading, I couldn't stop. I did not read this book from beginning to end, but hopped all over it, first reading the sections that I felt I needed that would help me to understand what I was experiencing... but, eventually reading the whole book. The truth hit me with full force as I read and saw that I could identify so closely with nearly everything in the book. I cried as I read the personal experiences in the book, because I could so closely relate to them. This book caused me to finally accept that I was 'multiple'. So, if you are in any way struggling with the idea of having 'parts' or being 'multiple', \\"The Family Inside\\" is definitely the book for you. It was for me... and I'm glad I read it (and keep referring back to it). Because of this book, I am truly on the road to recovery."},{"Title":"The Family Inside: Working With the Multiple","review":"I won't go into content of this book, as other reviewers have already done a wonderful job. But as someone who has dealt with, and continues to deal with numbers of people with DID, and who has read and owned many of the books on the topic both popular and professional/academic, I wanted to say that I still feel quite strongly that this currently out-of-print book remains one of the most rewarding books ever written on the subject.As a result, even 15 years after it's publication date, I can freely join the other reviewers in continuing to recommend this compassionate and informative book as a best \\"first read\\" for anyone, professional or otherwise, who is interested in informing themselves about Multiple Personality Disorder. I promise that you will not regret your choice."},{"Title":"The Family Inside: Working With the Multiple","review":"This book is well written with lots of useful information.

The hero is not a jockey, but an actor. As usual, Francis avoids stereotypes and gives his protagonist some complexity, best shown here in a poignant depiction of family life. Like all Francis protagonists, he's observant, wily, tough, determined, and a guy capable of thinking \\"outside the box.\\" Technology and politics are dated, of course, but the plot can still hold me gripped from cover to cover, each time I reread it.There are a handful or so of Francis books that are not set in England. Of those, SMOKESCREEN (set in South Africa) and BLOOD SPORT (in the US) rank among my favorites.The torture section of this book is absolutely harrowing. You will never forget it."},{"Title":"Smokescreen","review":"This is one of Francis' best books - be prepared to stay up all night! I am a huge Francis fan and have read all of his books, and this definately qualifies among the top three. Hope you enjoy it as much as i did!"},{"Title":"Smokescreen","review":"Smokescreen is one of those Dick Francis mysteries that take the reader to a country other than England. In this case, two countries, Spain and South Africa, are the sites of the action. The protagonist, Edward Lincoln, is an actor, in his thirties, and when the story opens, he's starring in a movie being made in Spain: Man in a Car. Talk about foreshadowing. But like most of Francis' heroes, \\"Linc\\" has lots of experience with horses. As a young man, he worked in a stable; in his early movie career he was a stuntman, specializing in horses.Given his early experience, it is only natural that a good friend should ask Linc to go to South Africa and find out why her stable of horses is doing so badly in their races after promising beginnings. His friend, it turns out, is dying. The horses are to go to her nephew in her will. And she doesn't want to leave him the horses if they aren't any good.Shortly after his arrival in Johannesburg, Linc is nearly injured in an accident. If it weren't for the fact that a female TV reporter was seriously injured, he could believe that the publicist for the movie distributor had staged it. The next accident proves that there's no joking around.Francis' prose is always clean and direct. His characters are straight forward and believable. In the abridged edition, however, much is lost of the nuances of story that are always so enjoyable. If you like Francis, read or listen to the full version. It will be worth the extra time."},{"Title":"Smokescreen","review":"Francis offers his usual fare: The same protagonist with a new name; a plot of investigation, discovery, physical pain and mental exercises; a supporting cast of believable characters who act in supportable, self-interested, and logical ways. All of which is not to say anything bad; i love to read Francis, and do so when looking for a vicarious thrill and a light read. The protagonist in this one is Edward &quot;Link&quot; Lincoln, an action picture actor ~ the sort who might star in movies made of Francis' books ~ who goes to South Africa for a little off-set investigation. At least, he thinks that's why he's gone there; he's actually gone to be killed. In a post-Apartheid world the picture of South Africa is rather sweet; i would guess Francis had some co&ouml;peration from the government in return for his portrayal of the country."},{"Title":"Smokescreen","review":"This is one of my favorite all time Dick Francis novels. Link is a character you'll love and you'll loves to plot twists as fiction can become reality."},{"Title":"Smokescreen","review":"Francis, in the Introduction to this book, tells the reader that he had recently been to South Africa when the idea to write this book came to him. Furthermore, once he decided his main character was going to be a celebrity - an actor - he decided to gain background by visiting the British film studios at Pinewood to see how movies are made. Apparently his wife used to work behind the scenes in the movie business, so they have a number of friends who are actors, giving him a good, solid understanding of the acting business.All this preparation and knowledge paid off in a particularly solid book, where you really feel like you are there while reading the story. Edward Lincoln is a well-known actor who has just finished filming a movie called \\"Man in a Car\\" (or something similar) where the basic story is that he has been handcuffed in a car and left to die. After this particularly draining experience, he is looking forward to some time with his family, but when his godmother, Nerissa, calls he immediately goes to see her. Startled by her appearance - she had always been very robust - he discovers she is very ill with lymphoma and is probably not going to last very much longer. She asks him to go to South Africa and look into her horses there as they have been performing badly in the races; she wants to leave them to her nephew, but she doesn't want him to end up with duds. Link is happy to comply.However, once he arrives in South Africa, the attempts on his life almost immediately begin and he is soon drawn into a desperate struggle to both understand the problem with Nerissa's horses, and to protect himself from harm.Beautifully detailed descriptions of the African vistas visited by Link bring us into the book fully - Francis seems to be particularly good at this sort of thing. I have definitely enjoyed reading books by this author and I believe I'll look into getting a few more."},{"Title":"Smokescreen","review":"We love all books from Dick Francis. He is a great story teller, mostly about jockeys and horse races. Can't put the book down."},{"Title":"Smokescreen","review":"I've read almost all of his books over the years.

Much enjoyed.Ron LealosAuthor of Don't Mean Nuthin'"},{"Title":"Smokescreen","review":"This is one of my favorite Dick Francis novels. The characters are superb, the plotting as clever as it gets, the climax nightmarish, the retribution delicious.I don't normally warm to novels about actors, but Edward Lincoln (Link to friends) is a thoroughly likeable guy. He has nothing in common with the superheroes he portrays in film after film. He's not a crack shot, can't fly an airplane or dismantle bombs and doesn't speak Russian. He's happiest at home with the family between films.Link's father worked in a stable, and Link would have liked to be a jockey, but he grew too tall too quickly as a lad. Anyway, he knows horses. An old family friend who doesn't have long to live asks Link to fly to South Africa and find out why her nine racehorses never win a race anymore. She's convinced that Link is as ingenious as the larger-than-life characters he plays.Just to be kind, Link makes the trip. As it turns out, he needs to be both lucky and clever to stay alive.This is not a political novel, despite the South Africa location. It should be read purely for the adventure."},{"Title":"Smokescreen","review":"Dick Francis is a master story teller. Every book I have ever read of his, almost all of them, is entertaining, well written and completely enjoyable. This one certainly falls in that category. Never start one of his books unless you have time because you will not be able to put it down. What a splendid writer."},{"Title":"Smokescreen","review":"I collect Dick Francis novels. He gave me company when I remodeled the kitchen and had no TV."},{"Title":"Smokescreen","review":"Dick Francis consistently writes books that people love to read -- again and again! I own all of his books and have had to replace some due to wear! I started in 1988 with The Edge and was hooked! Try any of his books and you will feel the same. Thank you, Dick Francis!"},{"Title":"Smokescreen","review":"Smokescreen is set mostly in South Africa, where horse exercise boy turned film actor Edward Lincoln goes at the request of a dying friend. Her horses aren't winning races, and she'd like him to investigate. Despite Lincoln's protests that while he may play a detective in the movies, but he's just an actor in real life, she persuades him to go.Dick Francis novels give the reader an immersion in some specialty, and Smokescreen is no exception. We learn about moviemaking, South Africa during apartheid, and gold mining. Edward Lincoln is happily married, so there's no love interest going on, but it's a good story, not grisly, with a mystery to be solved.Smokescreen was written in 1972, and although the plot and characters hold up well, what the characters wear can be something out of Austin Powers: \\"He was wearing another pair of pasted-on trousers, and a blue ruffled close-fitting shirt with lacing instead of buttons...the rugged male in his sexual finery...She arrived...wearing an eye-stunning yellow catsuit, which flared widely from the knees in black-edged ruffles. She looked like a flamenco dancer split up the middle...\\". Somehow clothes seem timeless in Agatha Christie, but this period is too close for comfort.I recommend Smokescreen to all who like a classic mystery thriller without a lot of psychopathology. It keeps the reader's interest without keeping her up at night."},{"Title":"Smokescreen","review":"Another one of Dick Francis' fine stories. I've always enjoyed his novels, and this is another one of his finest. I had lost (lent) my original, so it was time to replace it. The protagonist struggles but gets there in the end.

Each section has two parts: the religion presented by theologian/historian and then an essay by a member of that particular religion. Therefore the presentation of each religion is both objective and passionate.This is a great book for understanding &quot;the other guys&quot;. It's wonderful in its simplicity and even-handed approach. I recommend it for anyone who ever wonders &quot;why do they do that?&quot; and &quot;why would anyone want to be in THAT religion&quot;.

This is the first book I've ever read by this renowned historian, and it is outstanding in both detail and clarity. Admiral Morison (as he is referred to in Stephen Ambrose's history of D-Day) tells this story clearly and with dramatic narration, as much as any history which strives to be complete can be. I intend to read his RISING SUN IN THE PACIFIC next, and I may try to read the entire series on U.S. naval operations in WWII, given time. This book is essential to an understanding of D-Day and, along with Mr. Ambrose's books, gives any reader a great deal of insight into the most dramatic day of the 20th century, and maybe in the modern history of the world."},{"Title":"Invasion of France & Germany: 1944 - 1945 - Volume 11","review":"Volume 11 of Morison's history of the Navy in WW II. He received a Commission and served as a historian on the scene in several campaigns, which explains his familiarity with many of the senior officers near his rank. Morison writes as if he were fleshing out ships' log entries and action reports. There are few passages containing florid description or patriotic reminiscence, which would have no place in an official report. Thus the book is not long. A simple example--the Naval logistics of the stunning innovative concept of installing dozer blades on tanks to crash the Normandy hedgerows is covered in two or three sentences. In all his books, the vastness of the bluejacket human endeavor predominates the discussion--how thousands and thousands of landing craft crew were trained from zero, the struggle to maintain the Atlantic and Pacific amphibious forces together. There are better books for the human drama on one of the most important days in the Twentieth Century, and better books to integrate Army and Navy and British tactics together with continual new discoveries of German documents. One might consider this book a primer before reading Cornelius Ryan or Stephen Ambrose."},{"Title":"Invasion of France & Germany: 1944 - 1945 - Volume 11","review":"I decided that I wanted to have the complete 15 volume series of these books. I proceeded to buy them individually, used and hardcover. I acquired them quickly through Amazon and am very happy to have them. The supplier was very efficient. Morison's series on Naval Operations in WWII is just wonderful: readable and inspiring."},{"Title":"Gatherings from Spain","review":"Powerful observations written about the Spanish people, culture, government, it the time of the 1840s, Richard Ford has uncanny ability to observe, understand, analyze, and then put down his observations with wonderful prose, sharp wit, great philosophy, and an obvious love of Spain and things Spanish.As an interesting aside, written at a time when England is very powerful, America young, France despised (Napoleon having been beaten by the British at Waterloo), the writing gives an insight into British culture as they saw themselves at that time.If you love Spain, if you love truly superb travel writing, it is worth working through the obscure references in some passages to be amazed at the truly brilliant writing of Richard Ford. Insights into the Spanish that still hold true today, and universal insights into travel as an art that will always be true, page after page of great reading. I liked it."},{"Title":"Gatherings from Spain","review":"After reading this book, one can learn what a British traveller thought about Spain. Furthermore, and despite some mistakes in the use of the Spanish language, Ford proves to have been a really learned gentleman.This book is going to be very helpful for someone interested--like myself--in knowing a foreign opinion about Spain."},{"Title":"We're all guilty, a play for today","review":"This play is and seems to be boring.

Written by a post-Victorian intellectual mystic, who happened to be a production designer by trade, this book recounts the author's salvation from near-suicidal depression via a personal mystical experience. The insights gained through that experience inspired this book, which attacks the stagnant relationship modern Christians share with God. He exhorts the reader to open up to a richer and more meaningful interpretation of Christ's teachings, relying more on his recorded words and less on the intercession of stilted preachers who have lost all connection with his original teachings in favor of their myopic cultural programming. At their best, King's words attain the power of elegant, inspirational poetry. At their worst, they retain a few scant traces of Western cultural chauvinism, although it seems likely this pose was adopted to appeal to his intended target. If you're looking for accessibly written clues to life, this is worth a look. Stay with it to the end, it gets deeper and more impressive as it goes on. And don't be put off if you're agnostic -- King is as much an evolutionist as he is a true believer."},{"Title":"The conquest of fear (The Star series)","review":"This book could have been written for today!

You will enjoy it Trust me."},{"Title":"The naked sun.","review":"I already own this book, no chance I will pay almost as much for Kindle edition as I would have to pay for another paperback copy, it's all about GREED."},{"Title":"The naked sun.","review":"I recently read CAVES OF STEEL and after being seriously disappointed in it I had hopes that THE NAKED SUN would represent an improvement. In fact, it did represent a somewhat tighter story and the protagonist Elijah Baley acted a lot less stupidly than he had in the first novel, but all in all I found the book to be even less satisfactory than the first.The problems with this book are numerous. One of the more serious difficulties is that Asimov took what was the most interesting part of the CAVES OF STEEL -- the cooperation between Baley and his robot partner Daneel Olivaw and largely ignored it. Daneel plays a relatively minor role in the book, Baley, who is all in all a pretty dull bird, taking center stage. As in the first novel, Baley isn't much of a detective. His literary predecessors are not the Continental OP, Sam Spade, Philip Marlowe, and Lew Archer, but Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple. For some bizarre reason Asimov made the decision to follow the example of detective writers whose sleuths operated more by instinct and love to employ the technique of assembling all the key suspects before making his climatic announcement as to whodunit. As detective fiction, it is just horrible. Worst of all, Asimov violates one of the canons of such fiction: he withholds key facts, making it impossible for the reader to solve the crime ahead of time.In addition to failing in developing his characters and engaging in a literarily inferior form of detective fiction, Asimov's book is flawed by absolutely absurd assumptions about possible forms of human existence. Now, in fairness to Asimov, he wrote at a time when the insane theories of B. F. Skinner (who attempted to raise his own daughter in a box) still held current. So in fact Asimov might just be judged a victim of his time. But even before the publication of THE NAKED SUN Harry Harlow (in a series of rather monstrous experiments involving rhesus monkeys and \\"monster mothers\\") proved how profoundly primates yearned for human contact. Asimov imagines what is not merely a different form of human culture, but one that is impossible, since it cuts so deeply at what is most fundamental to human nature, namely that we are deeply social creatures for whom physical and social interaction is crucial. Asimov tries his best to make conceivable a world on which people avoid being physically present to other people, but it simply is too silly. Sure, we could suspend our disbelief, but only at the cost of suspending all critical interaction with the text.Added on top of all this is the fact that Asimov is simply not a very good writer. His prose is drab at best and in writing about characters he tends to default to extremely trite expressions. Someone says something to Baley and his reaction is to clinch his fists. It not only isn't very gifted writing, it reinforces a sense of superficiality running through the book.I've now in the past month read the first three novels I've ever read by Isaac Asimov. So far I'm baffled. I know that he is extremely famous and that he was a pioneer in many ways, but while I've found enormous pleasure in many early SF writers like Henry Kuttner, C. L. Moore, Robert Heinlein, Hal Clement, Poul Anderson, Frederick Pohl, and a host of others, I honestly have found virtually nothing of value in Asimov's books. I'm not giving up yet. I'm currently trying to work through all the major books dealing with robots, cyborgs, and other forms of artificial people. I will next finish THE ROBOTS OF DAWN and ROBOTS AND EMPIRE, in addition to finishing the last couple of stories in I, ROBOT. Perhaps my opinion of Asimov will change. But I can state with some confidence that CAVES OF STEEL and THE NAKED SUN are simply not very good books."},{"Title":"The naked sun.","review":"Too shallow, stiff and hokey. No action. No emotion. Blah. The Solarians were too extreme to swallow."},{"Title":"The naked sun.","review":"THE NAKED SUN is a witty little novel that is unmistakably a product of Isaac Asimov. Not just because of the ubiquitous robots, but because of the familiar themes that Asimov explored over the course of his decades-long career. On the surface, the novel is a science-fiction mystery story told in the author's usual enjoyable style. But by the time I reached the end of the book, I realized that Asimov had been doing something a little cleverer than his normal runaround, and upon reaching the conclusion, I immediately flipped back and started revisiting some of the earlier scenes to catch what I had missed the first time around.THE NAKED SUN starts up where THE CAVES OF STEEL left off, although you certainly do not need to have read the earlier book to enjoy this one. Earthman Detective Elijah Baley is once again teamed up with R. (for Robot) Daneel Olivaw to solve an unexplained murder. The gimmick this time is that the homicide occurred on one of the mysterious Outer Worlds, and Baley must not only act as policeman, but as an unofficial spy for an Earth government curious as to what the culture is like on those advanced, robot-dependent planets.The mystery is rather clever, although I did figure out what the murder weapon must have been before Baley did. As usual with Asimov's mysteries, I found myself enjoying the investigation more than the occasional plot logic that's thrown to the audience. In the case of this book, the storyline has some solid twists and turns, the only real flaw being that the cast of characters is so small that one could just pick a suspect at random to have a pretty good shot of correctly identifying the killer.The real star of this story is the universe that Asimov builds. The Earth is still the lagging, suspicious and enclosed world of THE CAVES OF STEEL, but now we turn our attention out to one of the colony worlds, Solaria. I could tell that Asimov was having a blast creating this society, giving us all kinds of details such as this planet's frosty relationship with Earth, its delicate relationship with other Outer Worlds, its population levels, its staggeringly high ratio of robots to people, etc. But he has even more fun giving birth to the inhabitants. He has them still as recognizable humans, but from an extremely skewed perspective. For most of the book, it's the story of these strange people and their odd customs that overpowers what is currently going on in the murder investigation. This definitely makes for an interesting read, as once we get to the end, we find that the detective portions were only secondary to the real point of the book.Often Asimov would insert little bits of social commentary into his fictions, with varying levels of success. And indeed, the summation at the end, where Baley lets the cat out of the bag and tells us what the novel has been exploring, is a little on the clumsy side. But the real triumph is how the author quietly and cunningly led us down the garden path to the end. When I opened the book to page one and found Elijah Baley nervously flying into a Washington, DC airport (by sheer coincidence I was making the same approach, albeit I started my journey in a different city than Baley had) and wishing to once again be safe indoors, I chucked to myself, recalling passages from Asimov's autobiography that discussed his legendary fear of flying and his mild claustrophilia. While reading all this stuff about people who hate flying, people who have an unnatural fear of face-to-face meetings, and people who yearn for enclosed spaces, I assumed that Asimov was doing nothing more than his usual shtick of inserting his own neuroses into his fictions (there's nothing wrong with this; it can make for very interesting reading, and it's something I particularly enjoy from Asimov). And with that assumption in place, I didn't pay much mind to what the author was actually setting up beneath the surface. So when the end of the novel rolled around and it was suddenly revealed what he had been up to this whole time, I was very pleasantly surprised.I like pulpy books that work on more than one level, and THE NAKED SUN gives us a very clever look at human fears while also providing an entertaining murder mystery. No, the characters aren't terribly deep, but the plot is a fun one and the extra bit of world building that Asimov engages in raises this book up. I like to read Asimov novels while traveling, because I find them to be a nice relaxing way to pass a few hours. Anytime the good doctor can provide me with something even better and smarter than his usual high standard of amusing, whimsical adventures, I'm a very happy camper indeed."},{"Title":"The naked sun.","review":"The Naked Sun is the second book in Asimov's robot series and probably my favorite but all are worth reading. This book continues the futuristic Sherlockian adventure of Elijah Bailey and his straight-man robot sidekick Daneel Olivaw. This time they journey to the planet of Solaria to solve a murder that has political implications across the galaxy.Asimov creates and socially interesting world in Solaria where people avoid human contact, live miles apart from each other and dependent upon robots to automate their society and keep their standard of living of high. Asimov deftly ties the intricacies of the Solarians into the mystery of the murder and ongoing multi book arc or robot progression. The whole thing is executed with Asimov's straightforward style and the character interaction and relationship between the two main characters is excellent as well.I highly recommend this series to any science fiction fan as this is really top shelf sci-fi writing from the best. The series should be read in order though and one should start with the I, Robot short story collection before proceeding to The Caves of Steel (which is the predecessor to this novel). Also this series is entirely appropriate for any one of at least high school age.Bottom Line: This series was revolutionary when it came out in the 50's. It's still one of the best ones out there."},{"Title":"The naked sun.","review":"The Naked Sun is the sequel to The Caves of Steel, and like that is a detective story set on the featuring robot-hating Plainclothesman Baley and, as if to prove Asimov really could predict the future, or movie-making of the '80s anyway, his entirely unsuited partner R Daneel Olivaw, a robot. Unlike CoS it's set on the (spacer) planet Solaria, a planet of few people and many, servile, robots.I was a little disappointed after reading CoS, and was expecting something of the sort here, but that didn't happen. CoS was set on an Earth which I found awkwardly described - you got the impression Asimov was trying to say things about the way people thought but couldn't quite get them out. No such problem with The Naked Sun, where Baley's future-Earth foibles are out in the open (figuratively and literally), and Asimov also successfully hints for the first time that a utopia made up of a world where everything is done for you and where people can live for hundreds of years may, possibly, be flawed, a thesis that becomes stronger in &quot;Robots of Dawn&quot; and &quot;Robots and Empire.&quot;Asimov wrote that CoS was an attempt to answer a critic that it was impossible to combine the genres of science fiction with detective stories. The Naked Sun is much more than an answer to that challenge, it's one of Asimov's earliest studies of humanity, and it's a well written thoroughly readable one at that."},{"Title":"The naked sun.","review":"This is the second book in the Baley-Daneel duo. And it's better than the first one, The Caves of Steel. The Science Fiction aspect is more creative--the Solarians are unlike any race I'm seen or read. The mystery is even tougher. Looking at the two books, The Naked Sun is almost the opposite of The Caves of Steel. The latter takes place in a confined Earth, with few robots. The former is on Solaria, a world with many robots and open spaces. Baley's reaction to the expierence rings true to his character--especially when dealing with the open spaces. To sum up, this is sequel will hook you and make you crave more. How fortunate there is a book called The Robots of Dawn!"},{"Title":"The naked sun.","review":"A thousand years earlier, mankind had split into two groups who now hated one another with a visceral prejudice born out of fear and a complete lack of cultural understanding of one another. Spacers, those who had seen their destiny in the stars, left earth with the assistance of positronic robot technology and colonized fifty worlds scattered throughout the galaxy. One world in particular, Solaria, was so thinly populated that the inhabitants had simply evolved away from the habit of personal contact. Birth was strictly controlled as a means of population replacement and achieved only through artificial insemination; child rearing was managed with the assistance of robots; communication, when it was deemed necessary at all, was via 3D holographic imagery; and personal contact of any kind, let alone sexual, was considered abhorrent. The taboo was so deep-seated it was capable of provoking nausea if the topic was frivolously mentioned.So when a leading scientist was bludgeoned to death, the citizens of Solaria were quite incapable of even imagining that anyone other than the scientist's spouse was guilty. But since it had also been determined that she had no weapon, the only possibility that remained was that he had been killed by his own robots, a possibility that, of course, was absolutely impossible because of the three laws of robotics that governed all human-robot interaction. Solaria had no choice but to ask for Earth's assistance in solving the problem. Only an Earth detective would have the intuitive understanding of interpersonal relationships and what would prompt someone (or perhaps a robot?) to violence and murder. And it was well known from his recent performance solving the murder in \\"The Caves of Steel\\" that Detective Elijah Baley was the only detective who could stomach prolonged contact with Spacers and Robots. So Elijah Baley was on his way to the scene of the crime on Solaria.What an incredible novel!Asimov outdoes Agatha Christie herself in concocting a compelling futuristic version of the impossible \\"locked room\\" mystery whose solution is based on an understanding of the profound differences of three imagined but superbly developed cultures - two human and one robot - all of which respond in profoundly different ways to the same stimulus. He takes a page from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's brief and has his detective quote the famous aphorism about the solution, however improbable, being all that is left after one has eliminated the impossible. Asimov takes his obvious admiration of Doyle's work one step further allowing Baley to emulate Sherlock Holmes' personal vision of justice by indulging in a debate over the distinction between legal guilt and moral guilt and how the consequences for the two ought to be quite different. And, of course, in the tried and true fashion of cozy mystery detectives ever since the first cozy mystery was written, all is revealed in a showdown drawing room setting with the master confronting all of the possible culprits as he reveals his subtle chain of logic and the now obvious solution.But only a master of the sci-fi genre of the caliber of Isaac Asimov could turn what might have been a mere 200 page murder mystery into a deeply moving philosophical essay on his imaginings for the future and survival of humankind and even what it means to be human.Highly recommended indeed for all lovers of science fiction, classic or contemporary.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"The naked sun.","review":"While \\"The Caves of Steel\\" gets my vote as \\"The Best Asimov Book of All-Time\\", this one comes in a close second place.

He contrasts humans both with robots and with aliens in the work, and though humans have the lower hand here, he offers hope for the future. The book happens to be a well-crafted mystery as well, just as it happens to be science fiction. Good science fiction posits humans in exotic locales doing ultimately familiar things. The fear of Elijah Bailey is a bit odd, since it is of open spaces and sunlight, but we all fear things, and Asimov gets to the heart of what fear is and how it can--and in the humans' situation in the novel--must be overcome. It is an extremely satisfying book, as most mystery novels are not."},{"Title":"The naked sun.","review":"The late Isaac Asimov is one of my all-time favorite sci-fi writers.

Daneel Olivaw. You don't need to read \\"The Caves of Steel\\" to understand this one, it is almost a stand alone book.Situated in a far future Earth, Humankind has divided into Spacers who dwell scattered in fifty worlds (and are the rich & advanced society) and Earthlings that remain in the Mother World, inhabiting overcrowded underground cities. Both groups distrust and despise each other.A murder occurred in Solaria an Outer World. Elijah is put in charge of the investigation due to his success in the previous investigation.Once again he will team with R. Daneel.Here different phobias interact conditioning the development of the events.Bailey is terrorized to be outside of he caves. From that fact derives the title of the novel as the Naked Sun is almost unbearable to stand for him.The Solarians avoid direct contact with other humans. They interact thru holographic system and are surrounded and served by robots that do not look like humans.Imagine in this context how a crime is possible. Well that is the task of our heroes.On this background Asimov, once again, construct a many layered novel. At one level is a classical detective's story at another one a study on alien cultures interacting. In yet another level is psychological approach to phobias.In a classical Asimovan way, each chapter introduces new elements and characters to the action until at last everything squares to a satisfactory ending.Both partners will continue their adventures and mystery solving in \\"Robots of Dawn\\". R. Daneel will resurface at the closing volumes of the \\"Foundation\\" saga.Enjoy one of Asimov's earlier works!Reviewed by Max Yofre."},{"Title":"The naked sun.","review":"The only reason I've rated this book only four stars is because some of Asimov's later books in the same series, written later in his career (e.g., Robots of Dawn) get even better. I found that there was a linear improvement in Asimov's writing through all of the robot novels.Not only do you get to experience a great mystery-adventure, but you're also exploring the social consequences of near-human robots and the continued urbanization of the Earth along with man's push into space.Daneel Olivaw, the robot partner to detective Elijah Baley, is one of the most memorable characters in the field of speculative fiction.This is the best place to start reading Asimov; however, you should begin by reading the first novel in the series, Caves of Steel.

The robot intolerance Elijah is partnered with technological masterpiece Daneel to break the case before it is too late.

The book continues the adventures of Elijah Baley, Earth Detective working with a robot partner solving crimes on colonized planets.It's a fun read with some innovative ideas around cultural development and how people can get on diverse societal and evolutionary paths when separated by space.If you are a fan of Asimov, you'll enjoy this one as well. I recommend you read Caves of Steel first though to allow you to follow the story, but it can be read as a standalone adventure.Also, I Robot short-stories are a good companion book.PS. If you've already read the extended Foundation series, this book will give you some good background on Solaria and how the planet developed."},{"Title":"The naked sun.","review":"Asimov is best when working with a fresh set of characters and I think that is what is so appealing with the Foundation series: The characters were constantly changing through the course of the books timeline. In Naked Sun we see the return of detective Bailey and his Robot sidekick and must endure 50 or so pages of getting the audience up to speed. Of course I hunger to learn more of the developments that occured in Caves of Steel, but obviously for those who have not read the book those character developments would reveal too much of the plot and ruin it for the new reader. Therefore we are left hanging on some plot threads as Bailey heads out to Solaris in search of another plot to solve.The second half of the book is quite appealing as Asimov makes great social commentary about America and its need for privacy and automation of life. I found myself engulfed in lives that appeared wonderful but at the same time quite strange and flawed.The book was completely engrossing until the very end where Asimov pulls out all the cliche's including the &quot;get everyone in the room to reveal the crime&quot; senario. Agatha Christie this is not, and too bad Asimov ended the book with that tired old senario. On top of that, suddenly everyone in that room is a bunch of quirky characters with the crime solved by Baily who appears extrodinarily competent as compared to the first book which made him far more human and fallible. On top of that Bailey acts as judge, jury and executioner and this is completely out of line for his character despite his newfound character development that Asimov weaves into this story to justify his ridiculous actions. Finally, the didactic speech at the end of the story from Baily was disappointing. I felt Asimov was just blowing off steam to end the book rather than finding his usual clever means of making social commentary.Caves of Steel was brilliant because of its social commentary and the fresh originality brought into the detective story. Naked sun feel stiff and a bit tired but it is still, despite my problems with the book, a decent read, but it is NO Caves of Steel."},{"Title":"The naked sun.","review":"I hadn't read this since middle school, and happily rediscovered the Asimov robot trllogy this past year.

Daneel Olivaw in this second book of the Robot Series. This time Baley is summoned to solve a case on the distant planet of Solaria. Baley wishes to refuse, but his reputatition for solving crimes involving Spacers leaves him as the only choice. On arriving on Solaria, he is glad to see his robotic partner from the planet Aurora, R. Daneel Olivaw, waiting there for him. It seems that many planets have a stake in solving this crime on the usually crimeless world of Solaria. Baley and Daneel discover a strange society in which humans shun personal contact and prefer to view each other through a sort of holographic transmission system. The problem with this murder case is that only one person could have committed the murder, but it is impossible that she could have committed it. Baley has to unravel the mystery of how a man was murdered on a planet where it is impossible.Asimov has a light style that is easy to read and which pulls the reader into the story.

Daneel Olivaw is one of the most important characters."},{"Title":"The naked sun.","review":"Murder mysteries are a staple of literature, so much so that it is becoming harder for authors to come up with original twists on how it was done. Created in 1957, this one remains as original now as it was when written. Set in a time where mankind has expanded out into space but split into several distinct and mutually antagonistic societies, it is those social forces that provide the uniqueness of the story. Earthman Elijah Baley, a plainclothes detective with a sterling record, is called upon to travel off-planet to Solaria, a planet where the inhabitants abhor physical contact with other humans and where a murder has been committed. Baley is also paired with a robot, Daneel Olivaw, who passes for a human and has come from a third planet Aurora. Baley's instructions are to solve the murder and gather any information that he can about the Solarians, so that the leaders of Earth can better judge the threat that they pose.I found the murder investigation to be of secondary interest to the social mores of the two societies. Asimov creates two societies with diametrically opposite social customs and Baley is forced to deal with his own fears as well as the rigid exclusiveness of the Solarians. That interplay and how human nature manages to still be present is what makes the story so entertaining. Even though the culprits and their motives for the murder are very standard fare, the backdrop is so interesting that I did not mind that well-worn portion of the plot.This is an excellent murder mystery with a setting of social structures that provide the real story and is how a science fiction mystery should be constructed. The mystery itself is largely a backdrop to the science fiction components."},{"Title":"The naked sun.","review":"Elijah Baley solves another case with his logical yet unreasonable partner, R Daneel Olivaw. This time it is not within the steel caves of New York City, but in the open plains of the sparsely populated Solaria. A world that has reached the epitome of technological paradise.Though, the book is not necessarily well written as a detective piece. The murderer is somewhat obvious, and the investigation can at times be dull. What is interesting is this new world Asimov created. A world so wrapped up with the companionship of their advanced robots, that people shudder at the thought of seeing another person in the flesh. Some people will faint at the sight. Some people will stay a good twenty feet away from a man. Some people will do worse. They are enslaved to the robots for their livelihood, their protection, and they are even mothered by the robots after birth.It turns out that Earth is exactly the same in many ways. But instead of being isolated from individuals, Earth is isolated by other cities, other planets, other ventures. Baley can barely last five minutes in the Solarian sun without fainting himself. Whereas Solaria's wealthy estates ran only by robots cause people to fear anyone one person, Earth's primitively walled in cities cause people to fear manifest destiny.PS: There was a certian individual who claimed that the nudity exhibited in this novel should have been cesnored. I am in complete disagreement in the first case because I do not believe in censorship. Despite this, I do not believe that there is anything in this book to censor. The only line that makes desciption of the female form is as followed, \\"Gladia looked down at her nudity in surprise and said, 'Well of course'\\" (61). Not a single word is used to illustrate a nude body other than the word \\"nudity\\" itself. Everything is left to the imagination and is very tasteful. I would say the taboo of nudity in this novel, though it is not portrayed in explicit detail, is what makes this book intriguing as oppose to revolting."},{"Title":"The naked sun.","review":"Asimov wrote The Naked Sun in 1956 and as others have pointed out here, it is a sequel but a completely independent story from his previous novel, Caves of Steel. For me, one of the most compelling things about this novel was how prescient Asimov was about how communication technology and technology in general, could isolate society. There is a passage in which the hero, Elijah Baley, interviews a woman who is a murder suspect on the distant \\"Spacer\\" planet. He is interviewing her by trimensional viewer - the equivalent of what we would consider a high quality, 3-dimensional webcam projection. Interestingly, she has no qualms about nudity being viewed in this way. Yet, like most of the \\"Spacers\\" and particularly those of Solaria, she is strongly abhorrent to actual physical contact and would, of course, never appear in a state of undress in the actual presence of a man like Baley. In her own words, the fact that Baley is \\"viewing her\\" over the projection and not \\"seeing\\" her in actual proximity makes \\"all the difference there is.\\" Asimov's thesis here is that having robots to do all the manual labor and having the ability to communicate remotely with so much intimacy that it rivals being in the same room, people are now so remote from one another physically that it takes tremendous effort for them to be in the same house with someone, let alone the same room. You can see some parallels with how people today communicate with chat, e-mail and webcams across vast distances with a degree of intimacy and familiarity that would not have been possible until recently. Long-distance relationships can actually be quite intimate, even sexual, due to the improvements in communications technology. Asimov was visualizing the future of what we are now experiencing some 50 years ago. I re-read this book now and then with amazement at how well he understood the impact our technology was going to have on our social and political futures."},{"Title":"The naked sun.","review":"A policeman from Earth, where the population all lives underground in close quarters, is called in to investigate a murder on a distant world. This world is populated by very few humans, rarely if ever, coming into physical proximity of each other. Instead the people \\"View\\" each other with holographic images. The mystery is, \\"How does a murder occur in a world where people can't stand to be in the presence of one another and robots can do no harm?\\" (Remember this is an Asimov book with his rules for robots firmly in place.) Asimov's variation on the \\"locked door\\" mystery is intriguing and adds in a sociological element that creates an interesting interpretation of what the future may hold in the relationship between man and machine is not carefully balanced. While the dated references that all older SF novels suffer from are to be found throughout the novel, this one does work as a good mystery. Even as the killer is exposed, you will be gratified to know that Asimov does not leave any loose threads by the time the book is finished."},{"Title":"The naked sun.","review":"Isaac Asimov returned to his &quot;Robot&quot; tales for &quot;The Naked Sun,&quot; a taut murder mystery wrapped in a heavy sci-fi cloak. If anything, &quot;Naked Sun&quot; is more imaginative and tightly-written than the previous novel, &quot;Caves of Steel,&quot; with its unconventional detecting and seemingly unsolvable crime.Cop Elijah Baley isn't too fond of robots. Or Spacers. So he's less than pleased when he is sent to Solaria, a sparsely populated world where robots do all the work, and humans &quot;toil not, neither do they spin.&quot; He's there to investigate a strange murder -- a scientist named Delmarre was murdered, and his widow Gladia is the only possible suspect. But she seems too ditzy and fluttery to crush a person's skull.When an official is poisoned right in front of Baley, his suspicions are confirmed -- somebody is still murdering, and it may be linked to some touchy political subjects that Delmarre was working on. No human was close enough to kill either man, and no robot was capable of murder. With the assistance of his robot sidekick R. Daneel Olivaw, Lije Baley starts to unravel a mystery that seems to have no suspects...Does a world full of languid, long-lived people waited on by robots sound like paradise? It won't after &quot;Naked Sun,&quot; where such a civilization is enough to drive you nuts with boredom. Asimov did an excellent job with the Solarian civilization, where actually being in the same room as another person is considered an unspeakable intimacy and the world &quot;children&quot; is almost obscene.Since this is all completely foreign to Lije Bailey (who comes from overcrowded Earth), it comes across as alien to the readers as well. It also adds an enticingly weird dimension to his detective work: Bailey has to solve a mystery entirely through communication equipment, and robots keep clearing away evidence. Add some agoraphobia and solid social commentary, and you have a story that is reminiscent of Agatha Christie writing Star Wars.Bailey and Daneel make an excellent team -- there's Bailey's human gut feelings and intuitions into the human mind, coupled with Daneel's cool calm robot logic, and his lack of prejudices. The supporting characters are also nicely done, particularly the mildly neurotic Gladia and the nervous Gruer.Asimov's &quot;Naked Sun&quot; is a tighter, tauter mystery than &quot;Caves of Steel,&quot; with a bizarre civilization and a mystery that seems impossible to figure out. Immensely enjoyable and thought-provoking."},{"Title":"The naked sun.","review":"THE CAVES OF STEEL was, in my humble opinion, an all-time science fiction classic. THE NAKED SUN is the direct sequel and is extremely satisfying, thought be many to be better than the original. Personally, I feel it failed a bit, especially as a mystery. This is still superlative science-fiction writing.This time, Elijah needs to travel to another world, a traumatic challenge to one who's never been outside Earth's \\"caves of steel\\". He is venturesome enough though to want to actually experience the open air and \\"naked sun\\" of another planet and this causes some conflict with android partner, R. Daneel Olivaw, who following the three laws of robots needs to protect the detective from harm.Again, the mystery part of the story owes to the classic \\"locked room mystery\\" subgenre in that the murder is one which appears to be an \\"impossible\\" one. Since the murder occured, though, there is only one apparant person who could possibly have committed it.The Solarians have through their history and their reliance on robots developed a physical aversion to each other, husbands and wives being the only ones who tolerate contact with each other, and Solarian science is working to develop artificial insemination so that even that contact will no longer be necessary.As the detective conducts his investigation, he becomes more involved with his belief that Earth must participate in colonization of other habitable worlds, and so this novel while telling its own story also develops the thread that eventually leads to the author's Empire and Foundation series. I am not sure whether or not Isaac Asimov, at the time that he wrote this novel, had any idea of developing R. Daneel Olivaw into such a pivotal factor as he eventually becomes, but it seems to me that there are slight hints here of the robot's leaning more on his reasoning ability, in spite of the fact that robots are not supposed to have any reasoning ability.Again, after reading this book, I believe one will very much want to continue into Asimov's future history."},{"Title":"The naked sun.","review":"It may be a flight of fancy, but it seems that you can see Asimov as a scientist when you read his novels. Unlike other speculative writers, there is a clear sense of details that ring true to the present day. For instance, the trouble with getting robots to respond to a question reminds me of some of the more comical experiments with intelligent agents.Although the allegorical nature of the Solarians gives the book a somewhat dated feel, it still has that Asimov magic-- combining study of human nature with speculative fiction. A first class author, as always."},{"Title":"The naked sun.","review":"Yet again, Asimov proves that he is indeed THE Science Fiction mastermind. &quot;The Naked Sun&quot; sends detective Elijah Baley into his most challenging case yet. He must lead a successful offworld investigation against impossible odds, which leaves you intrigued every step of the way. The bold R. Daneel, and the sexy Gladia Delmarre add more spice to Lije's ordeal. A true MUST read to all sci-fi fans out there!!!!!"},{"Title":"The naked sun.","review":"Asimov writes a enjoyable blend of science-fiction and mystery. The pace is leisurely, and the novel might seem almost simplistic by today's sci-fi standards. Once you consider that it was published in 1957, the novel takes on an added dimension (and explains some anachronisms like the frequently exclaimed &quot;Jehosaphat&quot;). You can see Asimov's very creative mind at work (the crime itself could only be accomplished through science-fiction) and how shows like &quot;Star Trek&quot; borrow liberally from his work. Be forewarned that Asimov likes to ponder science-fiction concepts a few pages here and there."},{"Title":"The naked sun.","review":"There will always be a soft spot in my heart for Asimov's I ROBOT short story collection and his THE REST OF THE ROBOTS short story collection. But this is my favorite Asimov novel; it is also one of my all-time favorite detective novels, SF or non-SF. It is sort of a sequel to an earlier novel of his: The Caves of Steel. But I like this one a lot better. You don't need to read them both, or read them in order; but it is true that the two novels enrich each other in defining a future allegorical world view, and in highlighting the relationship between the two detectives.If you are one of those people who absolutely must read things in order, I would start with the Positronic Robot short story collections, then take on the novels in order, finishing with the final short story: I ROBOT; THE REST OF THE ROBOTS; THE CAVES OF STEEL; THE NAKED SUN; THE ROBOTS OF DAWN; MIRROR IMAGE. I have not read Mirror Image. I consider The Robots of Dawn the weakest novel in the series. I think Asimov got bored with the series toward the end (while writing Robots of Dawn?) and went on to other projects. When fans wanted more, all he could deliver was a final short story.A human detective: Elijah. His partner Daneel is a robot so perfectly humanoid that other humans, and other robots, think it is human.What keeps me coming back to re-read The Naked Sun is the strongly allegorical presentation, the \\"male bonding\\" between the human detective and the robot detective, the robots (yes, I'm a robot freak), and the awesome detective \\"who-done-it\\" at the center of it all. The detective aspects are not as lyrical as Raymond Chandler nor as breezy as Robert B. Parker, but they are vintage Asimov at the absolute top of his game.In this series Asimov takes neurotic mental quirks, pushes them to their logical extremes, and elegantly builds a future out of them. Elijah has lived his entire life enclosed in tiny habitation boxes of overcrowded Earth; a mob of people pressing in upon him is comforting, while a free open space cripples him with terror. On Solaria, where the detectives go to solve a murder, humans rarely come into actual physical contact; almost all human intercourse is done by \\"viewing\\" which is so \\"lifelike\\" that Elijah at first mistakes it for actually being with another person. On Solaria, with each human residing on a separate estate cared for by an army of robots, the idea of actually being in physical proximity with another person is disgusting.The copyright on this puppy is 1956. Nature versus Nurture. In this future Asimov pushes the limits of Nurture: the people in these novels are the product of their environment. Powerful Spacers versus powerless Earthers. This was state-of-the-art Science Fiction in the Fifties, and it still kicks ass and takes names in 2012. I almost wish another writer would take on this future with a few more \\"authorized\\" sequels. If someone paid me to write one, the moment I came up with a default-plot I would jump in, full-tilt boogie! @hg47Oops!P.S. - that would be Postscript.P.R. - that would be Post Review.On GoodReads I just learned about a 4th novel in this series I was not aware of: Robots and Empire. Asimov's fans demanded, and the dude did deliver. My mistake. @hg47"},{"Title":"The naked sun.","review":"A lot of people don't realize that as famous as Isaac Asimov was as a science fiction writer, he took great pride in writing mysteries, often of short story length. He has several volumes of fascinating short story mysteries.Here, we get a full length mystery, once again staffed by the interesting and entertaining investigative duo of Elijah Bailey and R. Daneel Olivaw, his humaniform robot partner. This time, the murder occurs away from Earth on a \\"Spacer world\\". This particular Spacer world is extreme in that the residents have a phobia for human contact, which provides an odd sort of balance for Bailey's phobia of the great outdoors. The murder is a classic locked door mystery, and the solution is impossible on its face.Since Elijah had so recently solved a Spacer's murder on Earth, and since there are no such investigative skills in a society where murder is unheard of, the Spacers request Elijah as the man to solve this one. Asimov provides us with an interesting look at a society that has gone in completely the opposite direction of his over-crowded Earth cities ... a world where robots do virtually everything for the human residents, while on Earth any robots outside of routine automation are looked upon with threat and suspicion.Asimov took great pride in the internal logic of his mysteries, and this is a good example. \\"The Naked Sun\\" is an entertaining read for fans of both science fiction and mysteries. Although it is not absolutely necessary, I would recommend that you have read \\"The Caves of Steel\\" before tackling this book."},{"Title":"The naked sun.","review":"The Naked Sun is a sequel to The Caves of Steel featuring Elijah Bailey and his robot partner R. Daneel Olivaw.A murder has taken place on the planet Solaria and it's up to Elijah and Daneel to solve it. However, Solaria is not like Earth. In the future the major cities on Earth are covered by huge metal domes and Earth is greatly over-populated. Humans don't look too kindly at robots. Most humans, including Elijah, are agoraphobic (fear open spaces). On Solaria the human population is very small, everyone lives on massive estates and there are thousands of robots for each human. Humans are bred to fear direct human contact so in order to 'view' each other they use complex holographic technology. Robots cater to every human need. This is pretty much Hell for somebody like Elijah but alas he is called into action.I actually liked the plotting in The Naked Sun a bit more than The Caves of Steel. Because the people on Soliaria are the polar opposite of the people on Earth some interesting situations arise. For example, Earth humans are looked at as dirty animals and the thought of even being in the same room as an Earthman is sickening to a Solarian. Elijah, who craves direct human interaction, is forced to live by himself in a massive estate and he quickly becomes fed up with all of the robots trying to cater to every need of his. Elijah also does some 'growing up' in this novel.One of my minor complaints with Caves of Steel is that some plot elements are a bit too convenient, only to keep the mystery alive. There is still a little bit of that in the Naked Sun, but to a lesser degree.I strongly recommend this book, but read Caves of Steel first if you haven't already."},{"Title":"The naked sun.","review":"Isaac Asimov returned to his \\"Robot\\" tales for \\"The Naked Sun,\\" a taut murder mystery wrapped in a heavy sci-fi cloak.

This was the first Asimov book I've read. I enjoy older (50's/60's) science fiction - no profanity, good character development, fairly predictable, but with interesting ideas and ways of looking at human life.That said, I picked up The Naked Sun at a used bookstore not knowing that it was part of a series. I read a couple reviews that complained that the first 50 pages were used to get the new reader up to speed and decided I'd take the risk and read it anyway. I am so glad that I did. I couldn't put it down and finished it in less than a day and a half of intermittent reading. It's basically a classic 1950s style crime novel. Yes, it was a little predictable, but so what.

Can you put it down once you stop? No. Would you be inclined to do so? Not likely. Having written hundreds of books, Asimov had honed his craft down to a tee. There are no lengthy expositions, superfluous descriptions, esoteric metaphors, similes, or other unnecessary literary devices in an Asimov book; simply, there are characters, plot, world-building, and ideas, lots of ideas. If you've read, The Caves of Steel, or any other fiction by Asimov, and liked it, your sure to enjoy this book. as the second book in a trilogy, it felt slightly weaker than Caves, but held its own. Plainclothesman Elijah Baley develops in this book far more than in the previous installment. one thing this tale lacks that the first one had is a sense of urgency and/or danger. Asimov seems to have dialed down the action a bit well cranking up the mystery. But hey - what, exactly, is wrong with that?"},{"Title":"The naked sun.","review":"The Naked Sun by, Isaac Asimov, is a direct sequel toCaves of Steel (Robot City). Once again we see detective Elijah Baley called upon to solve a murder involving a \\"Spacer\\" (a human from an Earth colony on another planet) only this time he has to leave Earth to perform the investigation. He is reunited with his robotic partner, R. Daneel Olivaw although the relationship seems a bit more contentious this time around. The two meet on the planet Solaria where a leading citizen has been murdered with a good old-fashioned blunt instrument. Baley must overcome his fear of open spaces, resistance from the locals to meeting face-to-face, and the seeming impossibility of satisfying all the facts of the case before he can shed light on the mystery.More than just a mystery, Naked Sun is also a social commentary of sorts. I can't say I found this aspect of the novel nearly as compelling as the mystery. Without giving too much away, the people of Solaria live in nearly complete isolation and loathe being in the personal presence of anyone, including a spouse or their own child. While this is plausible in a purely academic way given the scenario that Asimov put it place, it ignores many basic human instincts such as sex drive that are incredibly powerful and highly unlikely to be sublimated so completely. Still, as long you take it with a grain of salt, it is still interesting to read about this other culture.The murder mystery in the book was very well done for the most part. It moves along well, introduces a number of interesting characters, and is suitably puzzling to both Baley and the reader as it unfolds. The ending wasn't quite as tidy as it could have been but I'll say no more about that for fear of spoiling the story for new readers.The Naked Sun is not a perfect novel. The ending was just a bit off and the sociology is more than questionable. But these are quibbles, not crippling flaws. I would certainly recommend this book, though you should read Caves of Steel (and possibly I, Robot) first. If you've read Caves of Steel, and enjoyed it, odds are you'll find a lot to like in this sequel."},{"Title":"The naked sun.","review":"The Naked Sun is a great sequel to Asimov's Caves of Steel. There, we were introduced to Elijah and Daneel as well as the Earth in the 3rd millenium, with its industrialisation, soullessness, pathological confinement in enclosed spaces and a dictatorial intrusion of the bureaucratic machine into every aspect of life imaginable.In this book, a murder occurs in a Spacer world and Elijah is specifically requested for. The murder, they say, is a logical imposibility, as it could only have been done by one person and even that person could not possibly have done it. Reluctantly, Elijah travels to the world of Solaria, where the murder occured and, reunited with Daneel, attempts to solve it in his already well-known style.Considering the contempt of Spaces for all earthlings, his visit to the outer world of Solaria is unprecedented and he has no idea to expect from a culture which diverged from earth's 300 years ago. The result is staggering - a huge planet with only 20,000 inhabitants and several thousand robots per person means unprecedented luxury. Everyone has huge estates, isolated from everyone and life is automated and mechanised to the nth degree. This reflects in the social aspect of life, where *seeing* a person (in the flesh) has become a social taboo, to be avoided as much as humanly possible. Instead, social contact is done through the impersonal, though extremely sophisticated machinery and is called *viewing*. Even a husband and wife (allocated roles in Solaria) rarely see each other, most of the contact done by viewing.And so, without giving away the details of the mystery, Bailey is essentially faced with a thematic connundrum. On the one hand, the Solarians don't have the almost psychotic fear of open spaces and nature that Bailey and other earthlings possess due to existing all their lives in boxes within boxes. But Solarians have lost the other essential aspect of humanity, as Bailey sees what a pathetically isolated, lolly-pop world Solaria is, where most of what we consider meaningful (real interactions, children, family) are either taboo or nonexistent.The book represents a step up from the Caves of Steel which outlined the way people live on earth. For the first time, we can see Asimov's robot-filled universe and the consequences on technology. On Earth, the crowding has ensured that social contact has remained but people have lost their communion with nature and the universe itself. On Solaria, the reverse is true, with plenty of sun and open spaces but no humanity. I really enjoyed this whole take on the world (especially as Bailey learns to see his fear of open spaces for what it is - an arbitrary, unnecessary hinderance).The only problem is that Asimov hammers this thematic point with the subtlety of a Britney Spears outfit. Still, it's interesting. The mystery itself is what has been criticised in otehr reviews and I don't consider it as satisfactory/&quot;perfect&quot; as Caves of Steel, but it's relatively interesting and it just shows that the action was a vehicle towards what Asimov really wanted to say.So, overall, a great book despite its flaws as it'll actually make you think about the values of our society and the direction we *might* be going - unlike many other sci-fi works (including some by Asimov), this one's both entertaining *and* meaningful."},{"Title":"The naked sun.","review":"Anyone who has read Isaac Asimov's classic science fiction masterpiece The Caves of Steel was undoubtedly clamoring for a sequel at the end of the book. The Naked Sun (Asimov would go on to write two more sequels) fulfills the task sufficiently. Although I think that, on the whole, the plot and murder mystery in this book - with less plot twists and turns, false leads, and dead ends - is not as interesting as the one in The Caves of Steel was, it is still thoroughly enjoyable, nonetheless. Granted, the concept of the murder mystery is one of the oldest scenarios in all literature - and was perfected by Conan Doyle, at that - and is, thus, rarely fresh or inventive - indeed, is usually quite stale. This is the real strength of The Naked Sun. This has what is, as far as one could conceivably allow in a murder mystery, a totally original plot. It is strange and intriguing in that the protagonist - and, indeed, the reader - knows nothing, absolutely NOTHING, about the murder. Detectives invariably start out with few clues, but in this he has absolutely none. Another interesting aspect of the book - and the highlight of it, for me - is the world, Solaria, and its inhabitants that Asimov herein describes. They have a truly different and remarkable way of life than that which we may find customary, and Asimov manages to make it believable and highly interesting. These factors combine to make the book interesting and fun to read. It is written in the style of its prequel: fast-paced, exciting, and hard to put down. This is certainly worth reading, if you liked the first one, and I highly reccommend it. For all of this praise, however, I do not find this book to be, on the whole, as good as The Caves of Steel. The Naked Sun, while being an extremely entertaining and fulfilling adventure romp, fails to convey the profundity of the original - indeed, this may stem from the fact that Asimov wrote this book out of incessant demand for a sequel (both from his publisher and his fans) instead of having it arise from pure inspiration. Alas, this is a highly entertaining book that I heartily reccommend to fans of the aforementioned masterpiece."},{"Title":"The naked sun.","review":"This was my first Asimov book. I thought it was very well written. I wasn't sure what to expect going in because I have heard so much about Isaac Asimov. Naked Sun was very entertaining. I must admit that I was sucked into the whodunnit of the book, however. I was intrigued also by the difference in cultures between the eartman and the spacers. It was interesting to see how they reacted to each other. A book like this parallels todays world in which every city has someone who was not born there, who is a sort of outsider and must adjust to the norms of that society or not adhere and pave a path for him or herself. Naked Sun will definately make me read more of Asimov."},{"Title":"The naked sun.","review":"This is the second novel in the Robot series and continues the adventures of Elijah Baley and Daneel Olivaw begun in The Caves of Steel. It's written in much the same style as the first book: engaging, fast-paced, and tough to put down.Baley attempts to solve a mystery on the Outer World of Solaria. Solarians run what many would consider a Utopian society; they live on massive estates in ease and comfort with tons of robots doing all the labor and necessary menial tasks. However, due to the extremely low human population, they never see each other and over the generations have even grown to shun physical human presence! Business is carried out by &quot;viewing&quot; each other through a projection medium. Asimov makes this unusual stigma quite believable and shows us several interesting facets of Solarian life.I just finished reading this last night! The plot is well developed, driven mainly by interviews and questioning. Not as much action as in The Caves of Steel, but there is one tense moment when an attempt is made on Baley's life. Daneel plays less of a role in this book than in the first one; Baley really does most of the work and makes the decisions.The initial solution to the murder mystery isn't as shocking as in the first book. But there's a surprising revelation at the very end! A good read with an obvious hint at a sequel. That's The Robots of Dawn, the next book on my list."},{"Title":"The naked sun.","review":"I read this book even before i read the other Robot detective books and i found this book fascinating! Baley's work in this book is quite great and i loved the story as well as the logic shown.

So I would recommened to read those books in order. the Caves of Steel, the Naked Sun, and the Robots in the Dawn. However the order doesn't really matter. You can enjoy this book without great knowledge about the other Robot books."},{"Title":"The naked sun.","review":"The Naked Sun, continuing the exploits of Elijah Bailey and R.

Another Spacer has been murdered, but not on Earth this time, on the newest colonized Spacer world, Solaria. Solaria is the antithesis of Earth, having a VERY lopsided robot to human ratio, while on Earth, robots are still despised and distrusted. Teaming again with R. Daneel Olivew, his investigative partner from Caves of Steel, Baley must deal with not only his own aversion to the vast robot presence, but the frequent travels through the outdoors, which his agoraphobic mind can scarcely tolerate. In addition is the nature of the Solarians, who have become so isolated from each other as to consider obscene the actual presence of humans. Meeting resistance constantly, from the Solarians and from his own partner, Baley begins to see that the Solarian way is just as bad as the Earth way, where the people are not isolated from each other, but from the galaxy. Eventually, after pursuing several wrong leads, Baley hits upon the truth, but it's not quite as one might expect.

These are doctors, generously sharing their very personal accounts of how they came to discover, albeit reluctantly, the absolute truth of the love and saving grace of a very Jewish Messiah, Jesus of Nazareth.These stories are written by doctors, not writers. That element alone kept the reading pace clear, quick, and thoroughly interesting.I am gentile. I learned a great deal about my Jewish brothers and sisters in Christ. Especially the seemingly insurmountable obstacles placed before the Jewish seeker of Biblical Truth; family, tradition, religion, indifference, investment, etc..I found the input near the end of the book by Ruth Rosen to be fascinating. Her perspective on faith was truly insightful. Her words have helped me articulate what true faith is. Rosen's commentary on Hebrews 11:1 ( A New Testament letter) became revelation for me. I am grateful to her for giving Glory to God by bringing this book to light.Finally; David Brickner's thoughtful rendition, describing the meeting of a desperate but faithful woman and the Christ, made those scriptures in the Gospel of John so much more relevant and meaningful.If you are a believer in God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit you will be encouraged to fight the good fight of faith. If you are gentile and a seeker of absolute truth, you will find insight into the level of courage and surrender you will face if you are sincere in your attempts to grasp it.

This is the first time she's been away from home and everyone's concern is magnified by the fact that Sophie has been seriously ill suffering from renal disease. But recently experimental treatments have improved her condition so that dialysis isn't needed as often as it once was, affording Sophie the opportunity to go away for the weekend at camp.But Sophie doesn't return. The car in which the assistant troup leader and two of the Brownies, including Sophie, were riding, is missing. Janine's ex-husband, Joe and her parents blame Janine. They were not supportive of Sophie going on the trip in the first place. In addition, they are upset that Janine has gone against medical advice to enroll Sophie in the experimental program, despite the fact that it appears to be helping.Lending support to Janine is her friend, Lucas Trowell, a rather mysterious man who is the head gardener at the estate where Janine and her parents live - her parents in the mansion and Janine and Sophie in a small adjacent cottage. Lucas and Janine have become more than friends but have kept their relationship a secret as Janine knows her parents would not approve. In fact, they believe there is somewhat Lucas is hiding. They even think he could be a pedophile since he seems to have such an unusual interest in Sophie. When they find out Janine is actually having a relationship with this man, they become unglued.Joe isn't happy either. He's very close to Janine's parents and side with them in nearly every instance against Janine. He also believes he is still in love with Janine and would like to see them re-marry.Lucas is a mysterious character, that's for sure. Instead of living in his home, he prefers to live in a rather comfortable tree-house adjacent to it. It becomes clear that there is something Lucas is hiding. His comings and goings are rather mysterious, to be sure. One evening when Lucas leaves the search scene to return home, Joe follows. What he discovers only makes him more skeptical.In the woods near the area where young Sophie is missing, another drama is unfolding. Aging movie star Zoe has faked her own death in order to help her daughter Marti escape from prison. She has found a small shanty in the woods and made her own and is waiting for Marti to join her when Sophie appears - dirty, injured, and badly in need of medical treatment. But Zoe is reluctant to get the help she knows Sophie needs, because she needs to protect her own daughter.Diane Chamberlain is a master at creating tense drama and then revealing secrets a little at a time - just enough to keep the reader satisfied while turning the pages at a nearly frantic pace. It was all I could do not to read the end of the book - the tension was so high and I was dying to find out what happened. I am glad I read it in succession like I was supposed to because another secret, one which was very surprising, is revealed near the end of the book - one that will have the reader exclaiming, \\"Wow!\\"The characters are so well-drawn. Janine's skeptical and devious mother is one you just want to take and shake some sense into. All the secondary characters feel as real as the main characters. I particularly liked the character of Joe's friend, Paula, who was a stabilizing force in his life. Chamberlain takes the character of Joe and instead of making him into a villain as the ex-husband, shows him as a sympathetic character who really only has the best intentions regarding his ex-wife and daughter.This is a fabulous story, one that kept me reading into the wee hours of the morning. I absolutely could not put it down and highly recommend this story for lovers of compelling and emotional dramas. The Courage Tree is a true masterpiece of modern American fiction."},{"Title":"COURAGE TREE","review":"In Virginia, a desperate Janine Donahue accepts an alternative medicine to help her dying eight-year-old child Sophie with her kidney disease. Janine already feels guilty over the stillborn death of her child years ago and she believes that her role in the Arabian Peninsula caused the damage to Sophie. When the child seems to have improved by using Herbalina, Janine allows Sophie to go to an overnight Brownie camp over the objections of her parents and her ex-spouse Joe.However, something went wrong as the scout leader, another child, and Janine never make it back to the pick-up point where Sophie waits in a state of panic. The police become involved and Sophie searches for her lost child. Her parents and Joe condemn Janine, who knows the trio plans to force her to give up custody in a court battle. Only the strange Lucas Trowell seems to be on Janine's side. Will they find the lost child in time because Sophie desperately needs her medicine and dialysis now?THE COURAGE TREE is a powerful relationship suspense novel centering on the fear adults feel for their children, especially an ailing child. The story line pulls out all the punches, as Janine with the exception of Lucas feels alone with her parents and Joe piling on the guilt. The subplot involving the aging amazon actress adds little to an already stalwart, poignant drama. Still, Diana Chamberlain shows her abilities with this deep taut thriller.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"COURAGE TREE","review":"The Courage Tree is about love, hope and trust---the kind that so few people truly experience. It's about a young girl who has a chronic illness with a very poor prognosis--end stage renal failure. She is on a non-traditional program of medication that only her mother and a friend support----the rest of the family alienated themselves from the mother because of her decision for the medication. The girl's father also is against this method of treatment. He's struggling with his own emotions. When Sophie doesn't return from a weekend camping trip with the Girl Scouts, everyone becomes part of the &quot;discovery&quot;------of her, of themselves, of each other------and there are several surprises along the way. Diane has a magical way of introducing the many players in the &quot;plot&quot; without confusing anyone. She's also able to weave their lives together, adding some mystery, some mystique and unexpected endings------allowing you to get to know all the characters, to feel their pain, to laugh with them, to smile with them and to be happy for them. I hated to see the book end. I wanted to read more. But then I feel that way every time I read one of Diane Chamberlain's books. She's a master at writing about people-----making the reader feel a part of their lives----as if they're real----making you want to meet them in person. And along the way, you are not bored. There's also a sense of drama and adventure. I truly enjoyed this story."},{"Title":"COURAGE TREE","review":"I am quickly becoming a Diane Chamberlain fan and her latest book is absolutely wonderful! I found that I could not put down the book and needed to finish it before anything else got done! Chamberlain weaves her story with such precision, that one thinks that they know the ending, but WHAM - a surprise is in store for the reader. The suspense skillfully draws the reader in and does not let go until the very end.I am finding that \\"secrets\\" prevail in her books, and they are not revealed until the end, but the reader is kept in suspense until the very last possible moment! Chamberlain combines romance, mystery, thrills and issues of family all interwoven and cleverly revealing.The main character, Janine, is incredibly strong, a maverick, who comes into her own despite her overbearing ex-husband and equally over-bearing and controlling parents. Janine meets Lucas, who shows her how to blossom and to become her own person, and to stop the \\"puppet\\" like behavior she has come to know. Lucas believes in her decision to start an alternative treatment for her daughter, against the wishes of both her ex-husband and her parents.The story will appeal to both men and women, and the suspense of not knowing if Sophie, Janine's critically ill 8-year old daughter, will be found, will have the reader hanging onto every page!The story was every endearing, courageous and filled with the miracle of love conquering all.I highly recommend this book and am most anxious to read all of her previous books!"},{"Title":"COURAGE TREE","review":"The Courage Tree is vintage Diane Chamberlain. Secrets and subplots that are as involving or more so than the main plot. This book has it all. Like other reviewers have noted, Diane has a way of doling out just enough information to make you keep turning the pages long after you're ready to turn in for a good night's sleep.Janine, the mother of critically ill and wise beyond her years Sophie, is constantly battling her parents and ex-husband, Joe over every decision she makes. Janine's parents are hypercritical of her every move and welcome subservient, orphaned Joe into the family as one of their own. After their divorce, Joe still refers to Janine's parents as Mom and Dad. Janine's lover, the mysetrious garderner, Lucas Trowell, accurately describes her parents and ex-husband as the &quot;anti-Jan triad&quot;. When Sophie becomes lost in the woods during a camping trip that this &quot;triad&quot; vehementley opposed Jan's decision to allow Sophie to participate in, all hell breaks loose.In a similarily involving subplot, Zoe, an aging movie star, is camped out in the same woods as Sophie is lost in. She's trying to free her daughter from prison, believing that she was unjustly convicted for a crime that she didn't commit. Zoe's realization of her own mistakes as a mother, coupled with her realization that something is very wrong with her daughter, Marti, makes for compelling reading.Diane ties all of these characters together and makes you care for all of them. By the time you've finished the last page, you're hoping for a sequel, not unusual in a Diane Chamberlain novel.Bottom line, highly reccomended and can't wait for the next book! As someone who has lived in Northern Virginia for many years, albeit reluctantly, Diane captures the region perfectly. She writes convincingly of the beauty of the Shenandoahs, the small town feel of some cities within walking distance of Washington DC. She also captures the contempt for women and children rampant in that state, from the caviliar attitude of the police officer on the scene when Sophie and fellow Brownie, Holly, are discovered missing, to the ever present and real threat of having Janine declared incompetent solely for doing what she believed was in the best interest of her child, regardless of what the majority would have done in Janine's shoes.Bravo Diane!!"},{"Title":"COURAGE TREE","review":"As I was awaiting my library copy of The Courage Tree, I could not wait to begin. The novel starts with great promise - a missing child in need of life-sustaining medical treatment. The Courage Tree captured my attention for the first 200 pages, and then it seemed to just lose its steam.The writing is clear and strong however, certain aspects of the plot were somewhat unbelievable. When there is a missing child a reader expects to feel the loss and intensity however, many of Chamberlain's characters seemed over concerned with their relationships that the missing child was only shadowed.Without revealing the plot, the ending was tied up far too perfectly and far too quickly. The Courage Tree had great promise to be something more than it was. Should you endeavor to read The Courage Tree, know that your expectations may be challenged.As this was the first novel that I have read by Chamberlain, I will give her another try with her latest, 'Cypress Point.'"},{"Title":"COURAGE TREE","review":"the courage tree is a great book i absolutely loved it.

I read a few books by Jodi Picoult and for a change of pace I picked up one by Diane Chamberlain since she has been referred to as the Jodi Picoult of the South. Personally I think she is 10 steps above Jodi and since finding Diane Chamberlain all other authors pale in comparison. The Courage Tree is right up there with The Secret Life of Cee Cee Wilkes. I absolutely LOVED The Courage Tree. I could not put this book down! I got into the charachters right away and there are plenty of unexpected twists and turns which keep you wanting more. I didn't want this book to end! She is one talented author and I can't wait to read her next books!

This is only her second title that I have read, but I was totally impressed! This was such an intriguing story that I would have liked to enjoyed it straight through from beginning to end w/o putting it down, but of course, life's duties got in the way. A charming, but very ill little girl; a deeply involved mother trying an alternative medical treatment for her daughter; a father who doesn't agree; grandparents who don't support the mother's decisions; and a secrative gardener with mysterious actions all combine to make this an unusual story. My only complaint is that the ending was rushed--a few more details would have been wonderful. More titles from this author will definitely find their way into my hands."},{"Title":"COURAGE TREE","review":"I WANTED to like this book. I LOVED \\"the secret life of Cee-Cee Wilkes,\\" but was somewhat disappointed by this particular novel by Diane Chamberlain. The premise is fantastic -- little girl goes missing during a Girl Scout campout, parents who are somewhat divided about the logic of allowing the girl to go find themeselves at odds in the aftermath of her disappearance. That alone would have been enough to make a great story, but it felt like instead of allowing the story to tell itself and focussing on the emotions of the participants involved, Chamberlain just kept piling on more and more coincidental events, so that the plotting took over from the story. There is Zoe, the aging movie actress, who just happens to be hiding out in the SAME woods where Sophie has been lost, along with her daughter Marti, who has been jailed for killing a friend. There is Sophie's mom Janine and her boyfriend, who many already suspect of being a pedophile, a plot involving orphans, being separated at birth, and of course a controversy involving the treatment of Sophie's kidney disease with an herbal remedy, which Janine supports while her ex-husband Joe opposes it. I felt like none of the story lines or the people in the book were sufficiently well-developed, due simply to the sheer volume of events shoveled into the book. It was hard to identify with any particular character, nor ultimately to really be drawn into the story of the search for Sophie. Chamberlains' \\"Cee Cee Wilkes\\" in contrast, was a fantastic story, with highly developed characters and a thrilling conclusion. Read that instead."},{"Title":"COURAGE TREE","review":"I read this book in two days, and I probably would have read it in one day if I didn't have to work. If you like books with twists and turns around every corner then read this book. I found that I came to care about each of the characters, and did not expect many of the surprises revealed throughout the story. Chamberlain is an exceptional story teller. I can't wait to read more of her work."},{"Title":"COURAGE TREE","review":"This is my third book by Diane Chamberlain and the one I liked the most. I do believe that all her books are a great stretch of the imagination, but that's fiction for you. This one was really suspenseful and not as predictable as the others. It's one of those books that you just don't want to put down. I highly recommend it for a fast, easy read with a good story."},{"Title":"COURAGE TREE","review":"Janine Donahue couldn't dissapoint her daughter by telling her she couldn't go on the camping trip with her Brownie troop. After being diagnosed with a rare kidney disease when she was three years old, Sophie is far from a normal eight year old girl. It wasn't until Janine found out about a new study that was happening that she had hope for her daughter. Now she has an eight year old who can eat whatever she wants, smiles all the time, and generally gets to behave like an eight year old girl should. When Sophie doesn't return from the camping trip, her family and herself automatically assume the worst. Soon, Janine is the only one that has hope that Sophie is out there alive. Even the man she loves, doesn't seem to believe that Sophie is alive. It is soon a race against time as Janine fights to save the daughter she loves.I enjoyed The Courage Tree, but didn't like it as much as I thought. Janine's ex-husband, Joe, was portrayed in a selfish light. At first I thought that he would be the 'hero' in the story, but soon read that the only reason he wanted Janine back was because he liked to control her. The way that Janine's parents and Joe ganged up on her was awful, especially since she never stood up to them. Not even by the end of the book. Lucas, Janine's lover, was a tragic character who has secrets of his own. I didn't really like the epilouge either, because I felt that it was unrealistic."},{"Title":"COURAGE TREE","review":"This was my first book by this author and I really enjoyed it.

Well I was very disappointed. First it is not very well written.

Some parts of the book were useful, but overall I did not learn a lot. I would definitely not recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"The Scientist in the Crib: Minds, Brains, And How Children Learn","review":"As an Educator, this book lacks any credibility. Do not buy this book. This is the \\"People's\\" magazine of Early Childhood Development.This disjointed narrative about Socrates, evolution and the current thinking of the day is \\"fact-lite.\\" The \\"Science\\" is completely cherry picked for a predisposition towards some kind of funky evolutionary computer chip ramble. Yes the studies about what an infant seeks, or what motivates a two year old different from a three year old are peppered in the book with concrete examples. But it lacks any kind of reason for it other than human reason dating back to Greek times, with some cherry picking references to some \\"newer\\" philosophers contribution to their new \\"truth.\\"The infant brain is amazing. It is a fired up machine of neurons that is wildly affected most by and safe an loving environment, and then the right stimulus. To not go to that known science is like studying only that part of an iceberg above the water. The last two chapters about what i was hoping was the science of the brain should have been the first two chapters, except there is no real science.

This is the worst early childhood book i have ever read."},{"Title":"The Scientist in the Crib: Minds, Brains, And How Children Learn","review":"This book is definitely not the most well-formulated book I've ever read, but parts of it are really worth the time to read. The first half gives information from research they do with babies, which was absolutely fascinating. In the second half, the chapter on babies' brains was interesting, but the rest of it was kind of a waste of paper, especially the last chapter.The authors are obsessed with scientists (they continuously refer to them as though they are the gods of earth basically), sex (they have pointless sex comments throughout the first half of the book), and evolution (it seems as though after they wrote each chapter, they went back and said, \\"Where are four places we can comment about evolution in this chapter?\\"). Those aspects of the book distract from the focus of learning about how babies and young children think.Overall, I think this is a definite book to at least check out from the library if you're a parent of a young child or if you work with young children."},{"Title":"The Scientist in the Crib: Minds, Brains, And How Children Learn","review":"the most amaizing and surprising book, writtenwith humour and love ; as a physical therapist i am working with small babies,i recommend this book to everybody who has a baby or works withthem."},{"Title":"The Scientist in the Crib: Minds, Brains, And How Children Learn","review":"It seems as though the authors are more interested in name dropping and patting themselves on the back than making the book readable. I found all the outside references distracting and probably unnecessary.

I loved the book because it uses today's technology and research techniques to validate the work done by Dr. Maria Montessori ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO.

However, upon receiving it, I was really disappointed. I found this book to be too dry and technical--i.e., I don't need to know about specific chemicals in the brain... It reads like a research paper, not a practical guide. Needless to say, it was not a pleasure to read--maybe other &quot;scientists&quot; will enjoy reading it, but it's not really geared to the everyday parent (and I have a Master's Degree, so it's not that it was over my head). My advice: If you're looking for practical, everyday information to apply to real life, skip this one."},{"Title":"The Scientist in the Crib: Minds, Brains, And How Children Learn","review":"Don't let the authors' titles fool you into thinking that their book will provide some profound insight into the mind of babies. This is a book for the very young moms to read, something to pass idle time. It is also a book for other Ph.D.'s who have been brainwashed clear of any senses.This book is like a cross between a pseudo-science with prose writing written by hippies. These Ph.D.'s are good at stating the obvious. Their first-grade level research certainly can be supported by what little income provided from selling this book.At their rate of understanding babies world, they'd be lucky if they can produce a worthwhile book 50 years from now."},{"Title":"The Scientist in the Crib: Minds, Brains, And How Children Learn","review":"I bought this with the hope of reading an easy-to-approach book containing the current science on baby development. What I got instead was a book containing a little science and a lot of breathless commentary on how amazing babies, science, and scientists are.If you're a thinking religious person that believes science is a useful tool that does not have all the answers you probably will not enjoy this book. The authors have already come to all the conclusions for you and God has been deliberately scrubbed out (literally--they quote part of the famous Wordsworth poem \\"Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood\\" at the heading of the last chapter, but leave off the final and most significant line, \\"From God who is our Home.\\").On the other hand, if you belong to the \\"science is man's best hope\\" school of thought then you may enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Scientist in the Crib: Minds, Brains, And How Children Learn","review":"This book presents the latest research concerning child development, but does so in an accessible and friendly way. This is not a how-to book, rather containing information about how children learn and develop over time. Chapters include: What Children Learn About People; What Children Learn About Things; What Children Learn About Language; What Scientists Have Learned About Children's Minds; What Scientists Have Learned About Children's Brains.To a small extent the book suffers from the usual dilutory effects of having multiple authors. They also try to be a bit too cute sometimes, but this does not overly detract from the book's success as a layman-friendly introduction to child development research.There is a very useful Notes section, References, and a good Index.My advice, for all it's worth: If you are going to get one book about child development research, get Lise Eliot's 'What's Going On In There?', which is less precious, more extensive, and better organized. If you are going to get two books, add this to your list. I find myself referring back to the former book fairly often, but I do browse through this one occasionally as well."},{"Title":"The Scientist in the Crib: Minds, Brains, And How Children Learn","review":"If you want practical advice on child-rearing, check out Penelope Leach or Dr. Mom. But if you're interested in reading about the latest research in the mental development of infants, this book is absolutely wonderful. It's full of surprising information about how observant and analytical babies are(at less than an hour old, they mimic faces), and gives details about the structure of the experiments used to deduce such information, allowing you to decide for yourself how much weight to give it. Much of the information confirms those of us who have always suspected two day old kids are as intelligent and tuned-in as, say, the typical graduate student -- they just have fewer ways to express it, and less experience to build on.Better yet, the book is written in a thoroughly engaging and often humorous style that possibly owes something to the first named author's brother, the New Yorker writer Adam (or, more likely, both Gopniks inherited the same literary genes).But don't expect pointers on burping technique."},{"Title":"The Scientist in the Crib: Minds, Brains, And How Children Learn","review":"I read this book for a book group and began without much interest. I was caught. This is a beautifully crafted piece of writing. Some of the reviewers seem to be treating it as though it were a manual or reference book for young parents. Rather it is an examination of the status of research into the development of the mind -- research at the trickiest and most preconception-filled level, at the level of the youngest brains -- written for anyone interested in how we learn to perceive and make sense of the world around us. The presentation is enlivened by the authors' own observations. Is there a more accessible analysis and ultimate rejection of the whole nature vs. nurture controversy? A wise and wonderful book I have recommended to friends, and I've been thanked for recommending it. Incidentally, I've recommended it to friends who do not have young children, the hardest to interest in books about young children! The science is formidable when you pause to think about it, yet this remains a humane and accessible book."},{"Title":"The Scientist in the Crib: Minds, Brains, And How Children Learn","review":"I bought this book because, having recently become a father, I wanted to get a better idea of what my baby thinks about and feels from people who make a living studying just that. I also wanted to know how scientists organize and practice the study of infant development; how do you observe an infant's actions and draw information about them based on what they do? (or don't do.) While The Scientist In The Crib is full of a lot of interesting anecdotes, and I certainly wouldn't question the authors' credibility, it is disappointingly organized around very general concepts as opposed to chronology, so that the thread of actual development is difficult to follow from one section to the next. This book really seems more like a series of articles, some more and some less interesting. The chapters examine what children learn about people [chapter 2], things [chapter 3], and then language [chapter 4], and then what scientists have learned about children's minds [chapter 5] and then what scientists have learned about children's brains [chapter 6](the distinction between minds and brains is probably much more meaningful if you're working in the field). There are two different sections entitled 'what newborns know.' I found myself skipping around looking for information relevant to my son and the age that he is now. I suppose if I was not so personally invested in these questions I could examine things in the lofty and generalized manner of this book, but, really, parenting is more a practical than a philosophical pursuit, and a chronological approach would have made the information (and there is a lot) much more accessible and interesting for parents."},{"Title":"The Scientist in the Crib: Minds, Brains, And How Children Learn","review":"As the father of a nine month old boy, I have been enthralled with this book. It is not a &quot;how to&quot; book on helping your child learn, but rather is a readable introduction to the current state of the study of cognitive development of babies. If you don't believe that it is possible to know what a baby is thinking, you will be fascinated at the clever experiments that have been constructed to tease out information from a baby's brain. It is surprising who much we can find out about how babies' brains work, and how much that can teach us about the adult human brain.The tone of the book is chatty, but the content is substantial. The authors discuss the philosophers as well as the scientists who are working in this area. I don't suppose that the average new parent is interested in wading into Chomsky, Ryle or Descartes, but this book actually makes it interesting and compelling.The book is broken down into the acquisition of particular mental skills. The authors thesis is that babies learn using, more or less, the scientific method, forming hypotheses and then testing them emperically. (The title of the book is a clever word play, referring to this theory, while simultaneously demonstrating what adult scientists are learning from their empirical studies.) While this may seem pretensious, the authors actually make a pretty good case for this theory.The acquisition of language deviates somewhat from this general theoretical method, but the authors have some fascinating experimental data to illustrate the way babies actually learn language.In short, this book is highly recommended, not just to new parents, but also to anyone interested in childhood cognitive development or what can be known about the workings of the human brain."},{"Title":"The Scientist in the Crib: Minds, Brains, And How Children Learn","review":"An intelligent book on how babies learn. There are so many books on the topic out there. But so many of them are written in that irritating &quot;case study&quot; style (e.g., Sophie, a perky 18 month old liked to do X. . .&quot;) This book, on the other hand, gets to the point, is written at an adult reading level, and is generally very interesting. I enjoyed reading it, and found the style very refreshing. Further, after reading it, I think I have a better sense of what is going on inside the head of my 9-month old son, and I've been able to apply this information in games and other ways that have been fun for both of us."},{"Title":"The Scientist in the Crib: Minds, Brains, And How Children Learn","review":"This is a fascinating report of research studies that compare the mind of a baby to a computer. The brain is programmed to receive and sort out information from all the senses and to use input from adults and kids to change the program as learning provides new experiences. The authors have done their own research and reviewed other studies about babies and toddlers to back up their analyses of infant learning. Parents and grandparents will be fascinated as they compare the development of young children in their families to the explanations of the infants' &quot;scientific&quot; explorations, classifications, and language learning. You'll find out why everyone talks &quot;motherese&quot; to babies. You'll realize that the kid in the crib is not just lying there waiting for the next diaper or bottle, but is very busy indeed figuring out the world and how it works. A truly fascinating book!"},{"Title":"The Scientist in the Crib: Minds, Brains, And How Children Learn","review":"This book explains current ideas about infants and how and when they learn. It is a well organized with interesting ancedotes and humorous comments sprinkled throughout. Except for the last chapter, which gets rather philosophical, it was a page turner. I still remember their examples (of the first word 'uh-oh' and failure, or of kids confronting a candy box full of pencils). The book strives not to be the standard parenting text which is refreshing. Still, I would have preferred a summary chart of the basic developmental thresholds and the associated ages for those skills.As a young mother of a one year old, I bought this book along with several others on toddler development. It stands out because it is not a 'how-to' parenting book. The authors leave it to the reader to decide how to act on the information. Also, the book describes in some depth how conclusions were arrived at. As a scientist myself I appreciated this, but found their arguments about the similarities between babies and scientists somewhat trite.All in all, one of my top recommendations for parents. There is great information in an unusual, neutral format."},{"Title":"The Scientist in the Crib: Minds, Brains, And How Children Learn","review":"This is an incredible book for the reader with an open mind and a desire to learn. The authors tell us what they have learned and experienced in the field of child development and learning, and they have the credentials to be true experts and terrific sources of knowledge. I found the information they conveyed to be positively fascinating. Some of it I had either already somehow suspected, read about elsewhere, or noticed myself, but there was plenty that also surprised me, as well. It helped to know this information because just about everyone deals with children at some point, and it makes a real difference to know where they are coming from. It is also interesting information, given that WE all were children too.The only thing I found irritating were the humorous comments scattered throughout the book. I would have rather had the information given to me without these comical references (some of which I did not get, therefore did not find funny). I repeatedly found myself trying to ignore these supposedly comical anecdotes and to just pay attention to the data they were trying to convey. I consider myself a pretty funny person, but this was annoying.Other than that, though, this book is GREAT! A wonderful way to increase your knowledge of children and how (and when) they learn."},{"Title":"The Scientist in the Crib: Minds, Brains, And How Children Learn","review":"I'm a mother of six children and thought that I didn't need any more baby books. Then a friend showed me this book and I couldn't put it down. It was the best one I ever read! As a parent, I could see my own children in the book's descriptions. And I laughed at the amusing stories and writing. It's really a terrific way of learning about what your child understands about people, about things, how they learn language, and how experience, including how we parents treat them, affects their brain growth. What a great read, written by these parent-scientists."},{"Title":"The Scientist in the Crib: Minds, Brains, And How Children Learn","review":"This book is a fascinating look at early childhood development. It overthrows many earlier, unresearched notions about children, especially infants, having simplistic minds, and instead explores the amazing complexity of their minds.The book explores many earlier theories, and then explains how various experiments have shown them to be incorrect, and what instead is most likely occurring within the infant or toddler's mind.It covers topics such as language development and aural differentiation, the impact of nurture and the critical need for loving attention during the early childhood years, stages of tool learning, imagination, and even things such as why we don't have memories from when we were two.Throughout it is told with historical fact, examples, and high level results of experiments, making the book interesting, engaging and one filled with information.I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Scientist in the Crib: Minds, Brains, And How Children Learn","review":"Ms. Gopnik is one of our best researchers and also a truly gifted writer.

It's one of those books that reverberates after you've read it--casting everything you experience in a new and lovely light."},{"Title":"The Scientist in the Crib: Minds, Brains, And How Children Learn","review":"As a researcher and a future parent, I had great expectations for this book. In fact, it was recommended to me by a developmental psychologist. I imagined this book to be a careful selection of the most important and striking recent findings from developmental and cognitive psychology research. I had no illusions that this would be a \\"how-to\\" book.However, instead of a scientific review this book is more of a casual story about children - the great learners. Dressed in many comparisons of kids (to scientists, Martians, aliens, etc.) and some funny anecdotes, this volume fails at doing just that - reviewing scientific literature with even a bit of detail that one would want to or could remember. It is instead brutally stripped of actual specific content with regard to any studies mentioned (which I find to be particularly interesting and helpful also to non-researchers). Most arguments are written in a way which is too simplified and thus provide no new knowledge to the reader. Many others sound so obvious that they border on common cliches.I would not recommend this book if you want to learn how to help you child become a better learner or if as a future parent you wish to understand better what is going on in your child's head. This is a light book that may make you lough and can be enjoyed in free time, but do not expect to learn much from it."},{"Title":"The Scientist in the Crib: Minds, Brains, And How Children Learn","review":"This book is fine but outdated.

It has so very much good/useful/valuable information and is presented in such a conversational and entertaining way! It's like having a conversation with these brilliant research scientists during a casual social gathering. I purchased the book to gain insight into the \\"inner world' of my months-old GRAND daughter but learned much, much more not only about her but myself as well! I thoroughly enjoyed this book!"},{"Title":"The Scientist in the Crib: Minds, Brains, And How Children Learn","review":"Anyone who has spent any time with a three-year-old has experienced the all-day barrage of questions--why? why? why?--each answer opening a door to a new string of questions until, finally, the kid falls asleep. Knowledge, explanation, understanding--connections made in the brain--are intensely pleasurable experiences for humans. According to the authors, learning something \\"marks the successful completion of a natural drive.\\" And a three-year-old brain is twice as active as the brain of an adult--building more connections faster as they learn about the world around them. They are both able to learn at an astounding rate and love to do it.Much of this book is concerned with analogies for how babies learn, the central analogy being, as the title suggests, that babies think like scientists. They generate theories for how something works, then test those theories and refine them, generating incredible amounts of knowledge (but fewer spreadsheets). Babies' brains work constantly to make connections, some which will be fruitful and strengthened over time while other, less useful connections will be \\"pruned away\\" as they grow older. That's why it's easier for babies to learn new language than adults. Adults' brains have been hard-wired to understand their native language and in some cases can't even distinguish between two different sounds in a foreign tongue.The most enjoyable part of this book for me was the perfect visual companion to the book at home while reading it--my 7-month-old daughter. I could watch her acting out the different learning processes described in this book--the way she looks to me for a reaction when she encounters something new or surprising, the way she babbles (according to the authors, she's actually mapping sounds to the movements of her mouth), the way she tries different ways of crawling, slowly zeroing in on a technique that's going to propel her to the next stage of freedom.This is not a how-to guidebook. It's more of an explanation of what's going on inside a baby's amazing little head. It addresses some of the current body of knowledge about cognitive development (nature vs nurture, how much babies learn vs what they are born knowing, etc.), but it is actually fairly critical of the genre of \\"baby genius\\" books. To the authors, babies have evolved to be incredible learning machines, and adults have evolved to be incredible teachers, simply by the way we instinctively interact with babies. The most critical thing is that we allow ourselves enough time to spend with our children so that they can learn from us. And as a new father, I'd say that the learning goes both ways."},{"Title":"The Scientist in the Crib: Minds, Brains, And How Children Learn","review":"Not written to entertain but to help explain their research into the thoughts of babies and how they learn.

It was fascinating to read that when babies initially begin to babble, they are able to differentiate all spoken sounds. Then the culture they are living in exerts its influence.\\"Once babies reach the babbling milestone, the universal phase of language production ends. Babies from different cultures, learning different languages, start to make the distinctive noises of their own community sometime between a year and a year and a half. The Chinese baby starts to babble in a way that sounds Chinese. She uses very rapid pitch changes just like adult Chinese speakers. Swedish babies babble in a way that sounds distinctly Swedish, using the rising intonation patterns typical of adult speakers of Swedish.\\"The research described in this book gave good reasons why I am constantly amazed every time I spend time with my grandsons."},{"Title":"The Scientist in the Crib: Minds, Brains, And How Children Learn","review":"An extremely readable overview of infant developmental psychology, this book provides fascinating details of the last thirty years of research on infant minds. The basic organization around three classic problems in epistemology (Other Minds, External Objects, and Language) will particularly appeal to those who took a few philosophy classes in college, but no background in either philosophy or science is necessary to understand and appreciate the work. Much of the book is devoted to summarizing various experiments, with the typical structure being: \\"If you show a three-month old X, she will do Y, but if you show a six-month-old the same X, he will do Z. Therefore we know that babies learn Z during this time period.\\"Several other reviewers have compared The Scientist in the Crib to Lise Eliot's What's Going On In There?, and having read both, I would characterize the difference as follows: The Scientist in the Crib is easily accessible to all readers but does not give much biological information about the brain. What's Going On In There? offers much more detail about neurology, but requires substantially more effort on the reader's part."},{"Title":"The Scientist in the Crib: Minds, Brains, And How Children Learn","review":"To baby watchers all over the world:The brains of babies work in a way that would make good old Popper smile in his grave.

I ended up reading the rest of the book while I was pregnant a year later. I love the authors, as I feel they write well and are some of the leaders in their field. The book is a little repetitive, but their style keeps it from sounding like a textbook, and conveys the wonder and appreciation the researchers have for their work.Several people gave this book one star, complaining essentially that it wasn't a how-to book to tell them how to make their babies smarter. Besides the obvious advice of paying attention to your children and reading them a book now and then, what this research shows is that what we do as parents has been wired into us for the maximal development of our children. There aren't any books out there that you can read which give you a plan for making your child smarter, and if they're telling you that, they're wrong.I feel this book establishes a good frame of reference for understanding where an infant's brain starts out in its development from a fussing ball of arms and legs to something that approximates a human adult in logic and emotion. Many people doubtless still believe that infants come into the world a blank slate, with no knowledge or strategies for learning, and the research presented in this book shows us that's just not so.

It's filled with delightful details about how babies brains develop in relation to nature, nurture, and interaction with the caregivers around them. There is an excellent review of the findings from early researchers such as Piaget and Vigotsky, and lots of description of recent researchers experiments which make a strong case for the power of even the tiniest infant's brain.

The 1930 edition was beautifully printed on top-quality paper in a handsome binding, and did full honour to this the final masterpiece by the Georgian metaphysical poet Lascelles Abercrombie. This long dramatic poem is based on a legend in the Acts of Thomas which tells of an Indian king who dreams of a palace made of souls. The apostle Thomas is sold to him as a slave, reputed to be an architect capable of realizing his dream. Entrusted with a vast sum of money, and with no idea how to proceed, he gives it all to the poor. It is the king's now contented subjects who are revealed to be the palace made of souls. This fable provides a series of vivid episodes that Abercrombie takes over and expands, to express his own moral vision, which, taking as its starting-point the most abject state of mind (isolation, misanthropy and self-disgust), holds out the prospect of liberation through a life of sacrifice and service, leading ultimately to self-transcendence in union with one's kind. The poem contains many descriptions, of symbolic landscapes and the like, that are remarkable for their hard, gem-like brilliance. A modern reader may well find the poem old-fashioned for its date and rather laboured; but it remains the work of a remarkable man with exceptional powers (perhaps not wholly integrated) of intellect and imagination. And any collector of fine editions will appreciate the beauty and quality of this original, limited and signed edition.

It also makes them aware to the damage it may cause to any human being. In simple language, large fonts and nice pictures, fact by fact, this book tells the nature of noise, how it is caused, and the ways to fight it. Children, as we all know, are tomorrow's citizens, and should better be ready to eliminate the growing levels of pollution by every means, like reading such book.

Yup.I thought the most entertaining parts of War Reporting for Cowards are those sections dealing with the Marines he was attached and the war itself. There is a lot of personal history that Ayres includes that may be important, but I found to be distracting. I especially liked Ayres story of his first few minutes at Camp Grizzly. Approached by a young Marine who wants to banter a few lines from Full Metal Jacket, Ayres finally catches on. Truly irreverent but so truly typical of Marines.An easy read, War Reporting for Cowards will give you a view of the war in Iraq not available anywhere else."},{"Title":"War Reporting for Cowards","review":"The author definitely had a tendency to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. He was in New York during 9-11, the anthrax letters got people at his paper working on the same floor as him, and he was embedded with a front line unit in the Iraq invasion.A lot of the book is really how he changes his viewpoint as these events occur. He starts off as someone who is writing about the news but is not really involved. And as these events occur he becomes involved and realizes that we are entering a war and he is on one side of the war.There is discussion about what is happening around him - but it is in the context of how it makes him feel and how it affects him. As he points out, when you are embedded with the troops, you suddenly have a very strong desire to see your troops win every battle - and as easily as possible. Because you want to live.This is a unique view - more on reporting the war than the war itself and it is very well written. The author is also openly critical of himself in many places which again makes it a better book.Really 4-1/2 stars and very hard to put down once you start."},{"Title":"War Reporting for Cowards","review":"I've been reading a bunch of books lately about the Iraqi war, but this one has given me the most personal look at the war. Chris Ayres communicates clearly his ambivalence about the war and reporting from the battlefield. He feels badly for the Iraqis, but he also would rather they be dead than he and his Marine convoy. The better part of the book begins when he becomes a \\"war correspondent\\" and has to make his preparations to go to Iraq. The earlier chapters are Ayres just getting in backstory and it is not as compelling. His descriptions of being at the scene of the 9/11 attacks were real and disturbing. A funny thing about Ayres is he doesn't strike me as someone who should be a reporter. He expresses almost no curiosity about anything. Even when he could see the smoke coming from the World Trade Towers on 9/11, he didn't immediately go the site. He just thought it was an accident, and really had no interest in checking it out. When gathering up his equipment to go to Iraq, he displayed an astonishing amount of ignorance. If I were going to war, I would make sure I had all the right equipment--not in bright colors. The first half of the book was marred by his constant use of this annoying phrase: \\"veal-fattening pen.\\" I counted five times by page 95, twice on page 92--in the same paragraph. He also had a lot of product brand-name dropping: Neutrogena, Sony Vaio, Dolce & Gabbana, etc. Ayres was an unlikely candidate to be a war reporter, but he does his best (while squeezing his eyes shut and screaming) and the last half of the book is a good read."},{"Title":"War Reporting for Cowards","review":"Ayres's basic premise will win over any pacific or Iraq-war-doubter. He's a wimp, a coward, and he doesn't want to go to war (not to mention that he doesn't think he would physically survive war). His \\"wimpiness\\" is what endears even the most skeptical reader to his story. Our narrator doesn't have all (or ANY) of the answers, he's not an activist, and when fired upon by Iraqis, he's darn surprised by his own desire to have them obliterated to save his own hide.Ayres's story is not just about Iraq in 2003. His history starts much earlier, as that of a journalist trying to make a living, that of a NY resident/journalist coping with the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, and that of a New York Times reporter grappling with the reality of anthrax afflicting the very people who work in his office. When I picked up this memoir, I expected to get into the gory details of war, but Ayres educates the reader in the reality that the life of anyone at war in Iraq has a history in 9/11.One of the most-eye opening and heartbreaking moments of the Ayers experience was in finding the drafted members of the Republican Guard who refused to fight and were subsequently executed. Again and again, Ayers faces an enemy that he can't fault for choosing this way of life (or be executed), yet he still wants those bad guys to be killed before they attacked Ayers's convoy.If there is one theme of this memoir, of war as a whole, of the military experience, it is uncertainty. The ground forces faced uncertainty and changes of orders on a moment's notice, of course. Ayers got out of the war on uncertainty--his satellite phone was seized for no reason, and therefore he had no means with which to do his job. When he got his guilt-free release from war, he was nearly killed in random RPG fire on the way out of the county (he was fine in the front lines, though!)."},{"Title":"War Reporting for Cowards","review":"I loved the premise of this book, when it was first described to me: a pampered Fauntleroy-turned-journalist leaves his cushy business reporting post on a lark, for an assignment as an embed with an American Marine unit in the early stages of the Iraqi War. For the most part, the story didn't disappoint. The juxtaposition of Chris Ayres, an admitted hypochondriac, and the gritty scenes of the early stages of combat provided more than a few laugh-out-loud moments. Noteworthy was the tent he bought at a sporting goods store, later discovered as fluorescent yellow with a bulls-eye on top; packing so much gear, including hand cream and moisturizer (his girlfriend asked, \\"Have the marines ever met a metrosexual?\\"), that the wheels on his accompanying luggage rack (!) failed in the Iraqi sand; and struggling at tasks like digging a latrine or making remote phone calls while drowning in sweat and rendered nearly blind by weighty desert gear.One reason War Reporting worked so well is that Ayres so often found himself in the wrong place at the wrong time- great for journalism, horrible for a paranoiac with anxiety issues. He arrived in New York from London just before September 11th; the floor of his office building was targeted with mailed Anthrax spores; and he climbed the professional ladder just in time to be particularly conspicuous for a war assignment. Self-deprecating throughout the book, Ayres admits that his cowardice contributed to his volunteering for Iraq, in that agreeing to the job represented the path of least vocational resistance, and that he felt compelled by a fear of someone else stealing his combat opportunity and succeeding.All told, Ayres was only in combat for a few days, and spent far more time in training and living high on the hog at a plush hotel in Kuwait. Plus, the very hypochondriac qualities at the fore in repeated scenes in the doctor's office also had a way of making the Iraqi scenes seem overdramatic. Ayres only saw about one or two days' worth of fighting, and then he bolted for the safety of home, leaving behind the Marines whom he half-respected, and half-pitied in a smarmy, borderline-condescending way. There wasn't a ton of editorializing in War Reporting, but enough to make you want to remind Ayres that the military was doing him a favor by letting him tag along (and potentially endanger their safety), and not the other way around."},{"Title":"War Reporting for Cowards","review":"Ayres is an unlikely war journalist. He admits to being a coward, to coming from a long line of cowards. And yet, in his quest to further his career he is sent to Iraq. Ayres focuses on his cowardice and much of the book is concerned with back-story demonstrating this cowardice and detailing his evolution from business reporter to was correspondent. Where the book is by far most compelling is the description of his nine days in actual combat. He does an excellent job describing the small details that make war hell. One wishes there was more of this. But, alas, Ayres was only in battle for nine days.This leads me to wonder, no matter how good Ayres is at what he does, why am I reading a book on the War in Iraq from a journalist who wasn't even there for two weeks? In part, the answer lies in Ayres respectable honesty and refreshing lack of an agenda. However, this book left me wishing for more and convinced that there are embeds who have more to tell us about the non-abbreviated experience of war. Still, I would encourage folks to pick up this book. Just realize that this is more a memoir of Chris Ayres than an \\"Iraqi War Book\\"."},{"Title":"War Reporting for Cowards","review":"I loved this book.Chris Ayers's writes an honest book about his fear, hypochondria, and misery as an imbedded journalist in the opening days of the Iraqi war. His self-deprecating humor is often laugh out loud funny, while having a tinge of Everyman. Every honest man.While Ayres's slant is about his admitted cowardice, he is actually quite brave. A real coward wouldn't have gone to Iraq. A brave person feels fear, admits that he is frightened, and then goes forward to do what needs to be done. That is what Ayres does.The lead character of a book should be a changed person by the end of the story. Chris Ayres definitely changed during his short tour with the Marines. It would have been interesting to see how he would have changed had he stayed for six months.This is a good read: informative, educational, and funny. Perhaps most important, it's honest.His disturbing description of standing before the burning Twin Towers on September 11, watching as people leaped to their death and then seeing the subsequent collapse of the buildings, will remain with me for a long time. For sure, the image of the man sitting on the curb reading to his child during all this will be burned in forever.As the author of WARRIORS and the co-author of ON COMBAT, I highly recommend this great read."},{"Title":"War Reporting for Cowards","review":"Chris Ayres teases a lot. It seemed that nearly every chapter ended with a teasing line that never materialized, which caused a big let down when the final climactic moment happened. I appreciate how Chris Ayres keeps his readers in suspense and turning the page, but his approach also created an expectation that the ending was going to be the greatest I'd ever read. Naturally, when that didn't happen I was disappointed. His transformation from a high-maintenance primped and preened L.A. suburbanite to a dirty, jaded, frightened out-of-his-mind, admirer of the common soldier seemed genuine and refreshing, but he kept me waiting for something grand to happen that didn't. The promise of gonzo journalism on the back cover also never materialized, which was disappointing for a fan of the late Hunter Thompson. Overall it's a good read, especially if you're not familiar with the military culture, but I expected more."},{"Title":"War Reporting for Cowards","review":"The image of the war correspondent is well-known. The intrepid reporter ventures fearlessly into combat, dodging bullets and bombs, in order to provide breathless eyewitness reports of front-line action. In the end, the journalist emerges from the dust and debris slightly scuffed, his hair tousled, but eager to do it all again.Then there's Chris Ayres, a reporter for the London Times who didn't really want to go to war and once he was there could hardly wait to get home. Ayres' \\"War Reporting for Cowards\\" offers up a funny and fresh view of war reporting.Ayers gives a down-to-earth accounting of being \\"embedded\\" with the U.S. Marines during the 2003 invasion of Iraq. No mundane detail is spared - he describes the necessity of digging a hole in the absence of a bathroom, the claustrophobic gas masks, the mud and dirt, and the barely concealed hostility of the Marines with whom he was traveling. It's hard to see the glory in this war story.\\"Waking up in a Humvee ... on the front lines of an invasion, is different,\\" Ayers writes. \\"The first thing you notice is the contortion necessary to sleep inside the vehicle: the head dangles inches from the bare metal floor; the right leg is to be found somewhere behind the left ear. The spine feels as though it has been splintered like a cocktail stick. If the war doesn't kill you, sleeping in the Humvee might.\\"Most of the book actually takes place before the war. Ayers was in New York for 9/11 and describes his, again, \\"cowardly\\" reporting that day. Later he moves to Los Angeles to cover celebrities, but is called to embed as the 2003 war approached (he accepts only because he feared to do otherwise would kill his career).Given a list of supplies the military says he will need, he takes an comical shopping trip to an upscale sporting goods store to buy what he needs (he had never camped before). Clearly, he'd prefer to stick to covering celebrities.The book is not without its flaws. Ayers sometimes meanders into social and political commentary that falls flat or is just puzzling. At one point, he writes, \\"We learn from an early age that New York is the Best City in the World, and that to be a New Yorker is something noble and proud.\\" Huh? Who learns that? Certainly no one that I know.Still, these lapses can be skipped over, and as long as Ayers is telling his personal story and offering up his self-deprecating humor, it's worth reading.If you like this sort of book, you might consider \\"This is Your War,\\" by the famous World War II correspondent Ernie Pyle, or the much more serious, \\"The Forever War,\\" by Dexter Filkins, about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan."},{"Title":"War Reporting for Cowards","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed War Reporting for Cowards. I laughed repeatedly. Ayres is a very amusing writer.I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"War Reporting for Cowards","review":"I admire the author's honesty in his warts-and-all description of himself and his reactions to being a barely willing embedded reporter of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. It was easy to identify with him and his perceptions and responses to the situation. At the same time, it is a relatively short story, for his stay ends abruptly fairly early in the campaign. Again I admire the honest recounting of that part of the story but it does make for a rather short main act. The book is padded, as others have noted, with a good deal of material that is at best background to the chapters at the heart of the book. Skip chapters 2 through 7 (about 100 pages) is my advice, unless you are really interested in the early stages of a low-level career in the Rupert Murdoch empire.There are a few incidents in the book that are funny but not they are not particularly novel ones that take you by surprise or make you laugh out loud.It does provide a healthy perspective from which to evaluate the reporting of embedded media in war."},{"Title":"War Reporting for Cowards","review":"A fun and easy read, with a serious side. It may resonate more if you already know a reporter, but if not, you can always adopt Chris Ayres."},{"Title":"War Reporting for Cowards","review":"If you're wanting a good blood and guts war book, you've come to the wrong place. If you're wanting a good read about a young man's battle against himself, you've come to the right place. For those who enjoyed Zach Braff in Garden State, this is a must read.Ayers' telling of the WTC disaster was moving, as was the entire novel.Overall, an excellent read."},{"Title":"War Reporting for Cowards","review":"This effort represents the milking of a nine-day stint to Iraq at the outbreak of the war. Mr. Ayres trucked into Iraq in a Humvee with 3 Marines. He filed five reports from the front. Or maybe it was six. This is a 240 page book on war reporting from Iraq. 240 pages. It takes 180 pages for Mr. Ayres to get to the Iraqi border. By page 220, the war, you realize you are rapidly approaching the end of the book and you have been cheated. The 180 pages of 'filler' are a recounting of all things ironic in Mr. Ayres life that build to the climax of unfortunate and reluctant reporter shipped off to war. Mr. Ayres milks irony to bloody tears.From a literary perspective, Mr. Ayres' writing is professional at least, but hardly inspiring. I found little evidence of the hilarity vouched for in editorials or promotionals and didn't laugh once through the read. Instead I found myself becoming increasingly aggravated that a) chapter after chapter there was no friggin' war reporting in sight, and b) the gist of the humorous consists essentially of Mr. Ayres milking irony to bloody tears.The nine days Mr. Ayres spent in Iraq would have made for an interesting if highly forgettable read in any one of a dozen magazines. This book was a waste of my time and money and should have never been published."},{"Title":"War Reporting for Cowards","review":"The author is as friggin' crazy as the Treadwell guy in Alaska who was eaten by a bear. Which explains why I couldn't put the book down. The center chapters are padded with personal stuff of marginal interest. But the loopy reports from the front, where he was embedded with Marines attacking toward Baghdad, are priceless. What kind of war reporter would admit taking an electric toothbrush? or 20 pair of Calvin Klein boxer shorts?"},{"Title":"War Reporting for Cowards","review":"While it was hard to quell the urge to reach into the pages and slap some sense into this boy (no neon in a war zone! Duh!), the story he tells was very well written, a fast and fun read, and all around worth the time.So often we read war stories from soldiers, reporters, and civilians alike that only talk about the events, or a polished over, mostly forgotten personal experience. The writer wasn't afraid to showcase his cluelessness, and for that the book is fantastic because of it."},{"Title":"War Reporting for Cowards","review":"This book begins with the author's experience as a beginning journalist in England, then details his personal view of 9/11 as an observer near Ground Zero. His time in Los Angeles is funny and wry, as is his gearing up to become a war correspondent. But war is a serious business, even for him, and the second part of the book is a grim accounting of what happens after he is embedded with American troops. When he leaves his assigned unit a few weeks into the war, he feels a sense of incompleteness, and so does the reader. Even for an observer (as journalists must be) the war changes him and hardens him. He's not a coward; just a rational man. I would've given the book 5 stars except that it stirred up ambivalent feelings in me, unrelated to his writing."},{"Title":"War Reporting for Cowards","review":"There is a bit of sitcom-level smugness in celebrity reporter-turned-war correspondent Chris Ayres's account of nine days on the front lines in Iraq. After all, nine days is hardly enough time for a personal transformation regardless of the amount of carnage he witnessed. At the same time, his firsthand experiences provide a vividly personalized stamp on the events we see every day on CNN. In his sometimes comic, sometimes provocative account, he tells how he ended up on the front lines, riding toward Baghdad with three Marines in a Humvee and making palpable the amount of firepower the U.S. troops have to sustain the conflict. The Marines were there not only to safeguard Ayres but also to look for base sites for long-range artillery - hardly a cozy assignment.Embedding journalists with the troops was a new one when Ayres went in 2002, and the press was not enamored with the liability much less the journalistic effectiveness of placing reporters so close to the action. Unlike Ayres, more experienced correspondents who provide most of the news coverage were placed at strategic points around Iraq such as the northern Kurdish area or in Baghdad. The precarious position of traveling side-by-side with the troops is a far riskier move, as was unfortunately seen with the recent injuries sustained by ABC news anchor Bob Woodruff and cameraman Doug Vogt, and from the perspective of military brass, unlikely to yield anything positive other than PR. Because of the constantly mobile front lines, the so-called \\"embeds\\" have turned out to play a valuable role in documenting the progress of the war. Consequently, Ayres lends an unexpectedly bird's-eye view into the perils of combat.On the surface, Ayres seems like the anti-correspondent with no physical prowess or military acumen to get around by his wits. This is the source of most of his comedy as he really oversimplifies his perspective on the war for the sake of gaining reader sympathy. As a self-professed coward, he has been coddled by the intellectual elitism and metrosexual lifestyle of his self-contained milieu. But during his brief adventure, Ayres gets reflective on his own myopic existence and does so by smartly eschewing politics and any examination of whether the war was justified. Instead, he focuses on the absurdity of life on the front lines. As a most unlikely marine, the author is at his most honest when he writes of the soldiers upon whose protection his life depends. It's the journal of an insulated snob brought down to earth by what he has only seen on TV - not overly meaningful but valuable nonetheless."},{"Title":"War Reporting for Cowards","review":"This book has a lot of substance, but is too heavy on confessions of personal foolishness. It has gripping eyewitness accounts of the 9/11 attacks, the Anthrax bio-terror scare, and the US invasion of Iraq. But most of the book is a self-depreciating account of the author's life to date. The war reporting part only starts with chapter 12, and the invasion starts on page 206.Throughout the book, Ayres remains basically non-critical of everything but himself. Concerning the Iraq War, about as close as he gets to giving personal opinions is the following:\\"How was I supposed to feel at this point? Glad that Saddam was going to get his comeuppance and excited by the professional challenge ahead? Or should I have felt moral outrage at the imperial violence about to be visited on Iraq, and pround of my role in exposing the horror of twenty-first-century warfare?To be honest, I didn't feel any of those things.All I felt was an overwhelming concern about my personal safety. And, of course, a tug of guilt over my own selfishness.To my right, a man was smiling at me. I recognized him as a reporter for National Public Radio. 'Hey,\\" he stage-whispered. \\"Ever get the feeling we're cheerleaders on the team bus?\\" He continued smiling.I nodded and continued sipping the dregs of my cappuccino.\\"But then, maybe embedded war reporting doesn't get much better than this anyway."},{"Title":"War Reporting for Cowards","review":"This book is in a light-hearted English tradition of which the most distinguished representative is George MacDonald Fraser's Harry Flashman: the Englishman who willingly admits his terror on the battle-field.Chris is too hard on himself, for he more or (mostly) less chose to be in Iraq in order to not let a friend down, and he (more or mostly less unwillingly) was in \\"at the death\\", the most advanced embedded Times reporter. He spares us Billy Russell posturing as was seen in the Crimea: he spares us Churchill's flatulence. For this alone he deserves a Pulitzer.However, his management at the Times was most irresponsible in even asking him to take the job. Their decisionmaking resembles the way in which Bush and Blair lightheartedly ignored Blix to waltz into the current quagmire, because if there had been grown-ups in charge at the Times instead of vicious children, made so by the corporate brutalization of journalism in the UK, no manager would have considered Chris a candidate for war reporter.They considered his experience on September 11 and in the October 2001 anthrax attack a qualification along with his youth, and they completely failed to READ and UNDERSTAND his texts of the time, which indicated that he was not at all interested in being the next Ernie Pyle.They passed over older and more qualified men because of the vicious, and corporate inspired, ageism of the media today, and in so doing they placed a man, who hadn't really chosen to risk his life, in the line of fire. Chris escaped, narrowly, Daniel Pearl's chosen fate and in my opinion should sue the Times along with his Mum and Dad for mental stress alone.Ayres bugged out because he could, because to him a headline in the Times, which he did get, wasn't worth getting killed. But this means he was never qualified as a war correspondent. That's what a real career is: putting it on the line.Unlike Flashman, who was qualified to be a military man albeit fictional because of a brutal streak revealed in the first Flashman book (in which Flashman behaves abominably and is a truer representative thereby of a brutal Empire), Ayres had no brutal streak, and this is a Good Thing: Wilfred Owen knew that war \\"teaches\\" nothing.Men return to war claiming to have \\"learned\\" great lessons. It has to be stated once and for all that learning takes place at universities, not on battlefields.But like Flashman at Flashman's best, Ayres wanted to stroll along Pall Mall, assuming that's still a fashionable district. Well could he sing, along with WWI soldiers, \\"I don't want to join the Army, I don't want to go to war: I just wants to live in London, on the earnings of an [...]\\".There is nothing wrong with this instinct: as Hegel knew, the Slave, who sees in \\"the sweetness of life\\" something worth preserving, is the motor of history: if we were all Reginald Dyer, Flashy at his worst, or suicidal war correspondents like Russell, Churchill or the Dutchman who Ayres meets, we wouldn't be here: our lives would be nasty, brutal and short.Unfortunately, Ayres appears to have bought into the illusion, popular at the beginning of the war, that the Americans and British were doing the miserable folk of Iraq any good. Hindsight tells us that the invasion made an awful situation worse, and Ayres has failed, upon return from the war, to be anything more than a junior edition of P. J. O'Rourke, that is the man who announces that come what may, his personal comforts are the most important thing on earth and who is willing to light his cheroot on the burning remains.Another man would have figured out how to fix the United States Marines coffee in the abundant spare time which Ayres seems to have had, but as Ayres cheerfully confesses, he was brought up in an era when even more than my generation (which was bad enough) kids in the West were handed their lives on a silver platter in most cases, and who expect retail service from people with the bad taste not to be A level.As it happens, the Marines have to fix Ayres coffee, even as they will when they return to Civvy street.This is the blind spot, the aporia, in almost every article in the journals of *bien-pensance*: each A-level may be viewed as supported, in much the same way as the Edwardian gentleman, by a chain of service. The Edwardian gentleman had a personal relationship with a butler and a chef: today, alienation obscures the relationship but does not destroy it.I fear for Mr. Ayres, because many wars and experiences of war seem from the record to compromise an immune system, metaphorically. If the first experience (whether the first Gulf War, or the first Opium war in Hong Kong) is restrained or comic opera, or if as in Ayres' experience there is a (sensible) bug out parallel to Bush's father's (sensible) 1991 exit, a sort of mass-psychological phenomenon occurs in which there is an auto-immune itch to have another go, and this time do it serious.Ayres crossed a line in American and British society between the sort of people who file stories and the sort of people who serve them at Pret a Manger while worrying about their husbands in the Irish Guards in Basra. And it has long been axiomatic on the clean and well lighted side of the line that it encloses a laager which can't be expanded to include everyone: some must pass their A-levels and some must fail, and a bit later brave shot and shell in heathen lands.Ayres meditates on the strangely primitive look of the artillery used by the Marines despite the large computers used to target. What he sees is that the highest technology, dedicated to a brutal end, is just a war club, but he seems to have buried this insight in the SAME closet \\"real\\" veterans bury their insights, a closet in which demons howl.The British Empire entailed a war continuously somewhere in the world during most of its existence, yet it was supremely, sublimely, and world-historically unnecessary: the loss of America didn't teach Britain the lesson that a free trading partner was in the long run, even in the short run as early as 1820, a better deal as investment capital flowed freely to the Yanks, replacing a two-way trickle that had flowed, like the molasses in which it dealt, through the grasping hands of a few rich men in the East India Company, a mercantilist folly that was to create the Indian Mutiny's preconditions.But, even Saint Bloody George Bloody Orwell thought that absent their Empire, absent market failures tinted red both on the map and in the wells of Amritsar where Indians sought refuge from disciplined and deliberate Lee-Enfield fire in Sir Reggie Dyer's 1919 massacre, Britons would have to work very hard and live on herring and potatoes.The Americans likewise charged into Iraq for a grand market failure, the pricing of oil in dollars, because the thought of walking to work like a loser was as unacceptable as Orwell's subconscious racial memory of a Scandinavian Britain, when Angles and Sassenach were working very hard and living on herring and potatoes in Frisia.But Empire abroad creates Empire at home, including steadily increasing Fundamentalism and its complementary yobbery in London, so that Ayres isn't able to not notice the feral kids who steal his phone.Must we suffer it all again? This illusion of an unreflective journo that he's failed and the real compromising of his moral immune system, which when multiplied through countless male psyches becomes Suez, over and over again? Do we need a resurgent Russia to stop this so-called Great Game in Asia, in which Bedooins must be flattened as collateral damage while we eat at Pret a Manger?"},{"Title":"War Reporting for Cowards","review":"My husband suggested that I read this book because I am not a huge non-fiction reader and I didn't know a lot about what was going on over in Iraq.

I watch the news, but it is always so sad and depressing that I often would rather watch my daughter's TV shows.

The author describes psychoanalyis as a deeply human(e) practice, a practice allied with democratic freedoms and care of the self.

The three authors make it so. These three have done more for the \\"western\\" than perhaps any other, excepting for Ernest Haycox who raised the bar, the level of writing, and made \\"westerns\\" more acceptable to the \\"elite\\" and the critic. But what one must understand about Zane Grey particularly is: He wrote at the exact right time in the exact right way; and that is why he became the most popular and well paid writer of all time. The \\"WEST\\" had just closed; the frontier was considered settled about 1890 or so, and by the early 1900's a nostalgia for the \\"old west\\" had come into fashion, and Zane Grey wrote to that public. Tappan's Burro is his entry in this book, and it was another of his stories to be published in the Ladies Home Journal, 1923. For many it seems amazing that so much of his work was published in the \\"ladies\\" magazines of the time; but if one takes the time to read a Zane Grey novel objectively, one would see how strong and independent many of his heroines really were; and that appealed to women then, and should yet today. His novels are NOT all blood and gore; they are not fist fights and saloon brawls on every other page, but well crafted historically accurate vignettes of life on the western border, whether in the 1870's or the 19 teens or twenties. The Max Brand story, Jargan, is typical Brand with lots of action, some psycho drama, and set in an imaginary west which came only from his mind. Trail to Crazy Man, the Louis L'Amour novella in this book he lengthened a few years later and it became Crossfire Trail, an excellent, excellent book. This version is just as good. Buy this book, it's well worth it. By the way, this is the first in a series of books edited by Jon Tuska featuring Zane Grey, Max Brand, and Louis L'Amour. Look for all of them."},{"Title":"The Return of the Ragpicker","review":"There are many self help books. Og Mandino deserves a special place among the various authors to write on this topic. His message is very clear and practical. It is simple. The world would be a better place and there would be no threats or fears of terrorism. Og Mandino's books should be made compulsory reading in all schools all over the world to make a positive change. Only by hard work and persistence we will be able to make a positive change. It is our duty to be good to ourselves,and the world around us as we are part of the cosmic intelligence whether you accept it and like it or not. The message contained in this book is priceless and has stood the test of time.It is sad to see that we are still waiting and not acting."},{"Title":"The Return of the Ragpicker","review":"I believe that all of Og Mandino's books are excellent. Something in each one to touch, teach, learn. Wonderful writer. great story teller. Inspirational & motivational. Highly recommend all of his books."},{"Title":"The Return of the Ragpicker","review":"This book, and others by Mr. Mandino, have saved my life. This authors unique take on finding the light when the candle has been extinguished is invaluable. I am forever grateful to have been enlightened by his words."},{"Title":"The Return of the Ragpicker","review":"I must admit, I was a bit put off by the self-applauding Mr. Og does in this book. However, I did enjoy the read. And I look forward to reading his other books....preferrably those written before the awards and celebrity-hood."},{"Title":"The Return of the Ragpicker","review":"This is an awesome conclusion to the Simon Potters Gift. I've been irritated by the reviews of others who apparently felt Mr.Og was egotistical. Quite frankly, he's worked hard to help others in his life and feels good about it and he's done it in the eyes of God. These reviewers aren't calling Gold medal olympians &quot;self serving&quot;. This touching conclusion to the Greatest Miracle in the World. If you enjoy Og, you'll enjoy The Return of the Ragpicker. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Return of the Ragpicker","review":"The 4th Og Mandino book I've read and now I'm totally hooked! He is by far my favorite author. His books allow the reader to reach deep inside and find things that they never knew were there. This was probably the best of the 4 that I've read, but I plan to devour them all and hope you will join me.I now find myself constantly asking, Could it be true? Was this truth or fiction? I don't know the answer but I have my own thoughts on the matter. What do you think?It's so nice to read something that is positive and thought provoking such as this book. Once you pick it up, you'll have trouble putting it down, I guarantee! And it's even small enough to take with you wherever you go - just watch the honking horns behind you in that traffic jam when you get so into the story that you forget where you are..."},{"Title":"The Return of the Ragpicker","review":"Great book. Second Og book I have read, and I am looking to read the others"},{"Title":"The Return of the Ragpicker","review":"Five of us in a book club read this book as our selection for the month. We all agreed that this book is nothing but a forum used by Og Mandino for his self-aggrandizement and we would not have read it to the end if it weren't for our planned discussion of the book. This book reveals how materialistic Mandino is and how egotistic he is to use a figure like the ragpicker through whom he could brag to his readers about his awards and wealth. Unfortunately, there was no redeeming value in the book even when one stuck it out to the end. This is the only book I have ever tossed in the trash. It is a waste of time and money. There was no option to rate this book lower than 1 star."},{"Title":"The Return of the Ragpicker","review":"I cite this book, and this book, only, in my book, The Salami Theory, because I wish that each of us would spend more time as a ragpicker. Simon Potter is a mentor and example for all of us. Og Mandino has sold more inspirational books than anyone because he identifies a need, a corresponding truth, and weaves both in the form of a contemporary, easy-reading story. Those who question his ego, must first examine their own. Mandino has become great because he applied the Biblical principal of &quot;he who humbles himself shall become great.&quot; I have benefitted from reading many of Mandino's works. This is the best."},{"Title":"The Return of the Ragpicker","review":"I selected this book for my Book Study group to read. It was hard for me to face them when we met because after reading it, I realized that the book is the ramblings of a very egotistical person and certainly did not provide any (not one) uplifting concept. Fortunately we enjoy discussing life in general so the evening was well spent. We all promised to throw the book in the trash as we left."},{"Title":"The Return of the Ragpicker","review":"I loved the original 'ragpicker' book by Og Mandino -- The Greatest Miracle in the World.' This sequel was written about 10 or 15 years later and something happened to Mr. Mandino in that time! He seemed more interested in telling you about all of his accomplishments, all of his material possessions, etc. than the inspirational message in the original book. Further, he replaced much of the God-based inspiration with politically correct platforms.Just bizarre to me how an author could change that much. I read a couple other reviews from disappointed readers and ignored them. Now I wish I would have believed them.I still love the older Og Mandino books, however, especially the Trilogy, but this one isn't worth the waste of time or money, or worth the disappointment in this author that I've looked up to....read at your own risk."},{"Title":"The Return of the Ragpicker","review":"I have had a hard time not throwing this book away. It is a shameful way to plug your own accomplishments ... using the &quot;notion&quot; that you are having a special relationship with a messenger from God. Simon Potter was merely an avenue for Og Mandino to let the world know he shared company (in the palace)with Imelda Marcos. Of course, Simon Potter witnessed Mr. Og's kind gestures when paying for the &quot;armed guard's&quot; meals as they were protecting such an important man as Og Mandidno. This book is a conversation Og Mandino has with his own self. A book full of Og Mandino being full of himself."},{"Title":"The Return of the Ragpicker","review":"This book was extremely hard to read and appeared to be a bragging platform for the author. The majority of the book is full of the author proclaiming his success through his own words and the words of this mentor. I almost threw the book out the window when reading the passage, \\"Mister Og...Certainly you are no longer motivated by the need for money. I smiled thinking to myself that he already knew so much about me it was a good probability that he also had a good idea of my net worth.\\" Use your time more wisely and find something more worthwhile to read."},{"Title":"The Return of the Ragpicker","review":"Mr. Mandino dilutes his message by using most of his book to tell the reader that he overcame failure to become a great success. He goes on in exquisite detail to enumerate all his great accomplishments and acclaim. Unfortunately most people are not turned on to a message that says, \\"Look at all my awards and how great I am. Read my affirmations for six minutes a day and you too can be wonderful.\\" While he is at this, he lets you know how he stands on gun control, the environment, TV and other political things.I am surprised his affirmations use negative words like \\"not\\". Many consider this an ineffectual way to write affirmations. A positive statement works better on the subconscious.He does come up with some good life concepts at the end of the book. Most of these can be found in the New Testament. I love Mr. Mandino and his earlier books. I have to wonder why he wrote this one in this manner."},{"Title":"The Return of the Ragpicker","review":"As is true of all of Mandino's works, this is truly an outstanding and captivating read ... I read it cover to cover in about two hours and then started over again to digest more deeply all the gems of knowledge revealed within. Another life-changing, magnificent novel in true Mandino fashion!"},{"Title":"The Return of the Ragpicker","review":"Perhaps it's me, but I had to put this down and walk away on page 101. The greatest miracle is that I made it that far. The only thing I learned is that Mandino claims to sell a lot of books. I say \\"claims\\" because this beauty has barely cracked the top 100,000 in sales at Amazon. Whatever. I'm obviously not the brightest bulb as it took me 100 pages to figure out that Simon Potter's only role is to pump the author's ego. No wonder Mandino likes him so much."},{"Title":"The Return of the Ragpicker","review":"Who are you trying to kid, Og? I guess you made a lot of bucks with this one...I know you dug into my pocket. It seems like the bucks are your major interest in all your later books. This is the first book that I kept track (page by page) of how much is self-aggrandizement (55%) or simple filler (20%) or characters out of context (18%) or actually something worth reading (7%). Not recommended for anyone who doesn't have a fetish for finding minute needles lost deep in huge piles of straw."},{"Title":"The Return of the Ragpicker","review":"I enjoyed Mr. Mandino's first effort, _Greatest Salesman in the World_, for substantially different reasons than _Ragpicker_. _Salesman_ was short and to the point and had a clever ending, and the principles were well worth repeating. I read it a few times over and, encouraged, I went to the library and picked up all the Og Mandino books I could find--they were nice and short and if a few were half as good, I could learn a lot in a short time. Self-help books usually give me a temporary boost, but regrettably, after a while Og's oeuvres fell into a certain pattern where my main 'can-do' was that I could write better than this. Person is down in the dumps, person finds inspiration to get out of the dumps, the original source of inspiration dries up, person writes to others how to follow suit before the advice is lost forever. _Ragpicker_ seems to epitomize what can go wrong with a lazy yet prolific writing style.I suppose for practical purposes this is all right; a person can see different yet similar positive messages, and these offset the sorts you get in everyday life. What is not so good is that the style has degenerated terribly, and events begin to parallel Mandino's life, and eventually adulation for Mandino slips in; Mr. Mandino forgets that it is the reader who is supposed to enjoy the book. There are slight drops from _Salesman_ to part II, where Hafid, the Greatest Salesman, starts his own self-help tour for peasants. You see a huge drop in the prequel to _Ragpicker_, _Greatest Miracle in the World_, when an angel-figure dubs Mandino's work a 'hand of God' work with various timeless classics.But in _Ragpicker_ the only originality left is that Og drops in a weird bird to accompany the angel-figure we thought had died in _Miracle_. They then discuss how good Og's descriptions are of his place in Arizona(financed by his business successes, natch) and how the book was a great seller and Og can't believe it's true. There are several rounds of 'Couldn't a done it without you, sport,' a general lamentation of the human condition, and an assurance that More Needs To Be Done(the book holds true to these convictions.) Og then spends a lot of time in equal disbelief over various good and bad events while espousing the need for faith. It's not all self-focused as Og gives some recognition to other people's books that he likes but this makes _Ragpicker_ feel more like an effort at networking and showing the author's in with the right crowd than a book for someone who wants guidance. There are far too many novels that give up on having a plot of their own and collapse into post-modern meta-art, but _Ragpicker_ seems even shabbier.Yet every time I read it, _Ragpicker_ is so laughably fatuous that I find myself cheered up and motivated, laughing while considering the very valid principles discussed--it's easier to work when you're happy, you know. So if Mr. Mandino's intention was, at bottom, to inspire people to do it even at his own expense, a back/forth commute where I read _Miracle_ and then _Ragpicker_ does that. They're both short and facile enough for such quick disposal, and I'm in such a good mood and ideas are buzzing around in my head so fast that things I've put off for months will get done. Their very act of being published encourages me as a writer, in fact. But they are not good literature, and people of a less sardonic bent than myself will find better guidance in _Salesman_."},{"Title":"The Return of the Ragpicker","review":"Read the first book first.

I read it years ago and it was made years before that. In many ways, it should be treated as a Stonewall-era text. Even the title is influenced by Friedan's \\"Feminine Mystique\\" which has been thoroughly criticized by younger feminists. In the \\"Gay Mystique\\", the author talks about his life as a gay man. I read it in one sitting; it's a quick one. He shows that he's proud to be gay without having to bash queens and say trite statements like \\"What I do in bed is my own business.\\" The thing that hit me the most is when he said, \\"Most of my friends are Black and Jewish gay men.\\" He could just be reflecting the demographics of New York City. Still, it spoke to me that he was trying to factor in race and religion into his talk of sexual identity matters. The \\"gay\\" in this title means \\"gay male\\"; some female readers may be bothered by the androcentrism here, but it's reflective of the time in which it was written and I can definitely say this is not a sexist book. For those interested in reading the classic gay rights and gay studies texts, you should try to find this book. (Good luck, btw!)"},{"Title":"The Gay Mystique","review":"I read this book so long, long ago (about 20 years ago), that I don't know if I can really write a review that will do it justice. While the advent of AIDS and changes in society have likely rendered obsolete much of the information in this book written during the early years of \\"gay lib\\", *The Gay Mystique* (written back when the computing power of a primo personal computer such as mine would have filled up an entire high-school gymnasium) should still be an one of the \\"canon\\" books of any gay and lesbian library. This told me exactly what a lost, confused teenage homosexual in a small town needed to about who he was and why, and what his relationship to society was and why. I often wonder what ever happened to this author and whether or \\"the plague\\" got him as it did so many of our brightest and best from the early to mid-70's.

Berg (with the help of his own editor) truly is a genius: he pulls us directly into the story, introducing us to Scribner's Max Perkins at the zenith of his editorial career, then plunges us into his first acquisition -- F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Beautiful and Damned -- before taking us, methodically, through Perkins's life. An intrepid biographer, Berg tells us only what we need to know about Perkins's early life, getting to the good stuff: his discovery of Fitzgerald and Thomas Wolfe and his work with Ernest Hemingway. We also find out about Perkins's work with other remarkable authors, including Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings (The Yearling), S.S. Van Dine (the Philo Vance mysteries), and Arthur Train, creator of the mythical DA Ephraim Tutt. I laughed out loud at the story about how many believed that Tutt existed after the publication of his \\"autobiograhpy,\\" complete with photos.We learn of Perkins's patient relationship with the frustrating Thomas Wolfe, a mammoth talent and physical specimen who could not contain his own enthusiasm. Berg suggests that, as Perkins discovered, Wolfe wasn't writing \\"books,\\" he was writing one book, which would have encompassed thousands of pages if he had not died early -- a profound insight into the heart and soul of a dynamic author.We learn much of Papa Hemingway as well, including some insights into the macho author's home life. Elements of Hemingway's unpublished fiction suggest that the bullfighting fan, fisherman, and big game hunter might have enjoyed switching gender roles in bed with one of his wives.Fitzgerald comes off as one who excelled in being pathetic, a man who suffered desperately with his wife, Zelda, alcohol, and simply living large. Berg gives us a tender portrait of Perkins's greatest find.As with all excellent biographies, Max Perkins: Editor of Genius examines only what made Perkins who he was: the editor of the twentieth century. Perkins preferred to sit on the sidelines, championing his authors. Often, he sits on the sidelines in this book as well, but this only makes sense: he was famous for his work with his more famous authors. It wasn't Max, it was his interaction with these great authors that made him all great.As some reviewers have pointed out, Max would have enjoyed thsi book."},{"Title":"Max Perkins: Editor of Genius","review":"If you are an admirer of F.Scott Fitzgerald, Ring Lardner, Thomas Wolfe, Earnest Hemingway, Marjorie Rawlings; basically any significant American writer of fiction during the first half of this century--buy the book. Here's how I would put it: If those authors could send ONE, just one posthumous request for you to purchase a particular book, &quot;Perkins: Editor of Genius&quot; would be my sincerely expected choice. Why? Because he wasn't just the &quot;editor of genius&quot;: he was their friend. Maybe in some cases like Mr. Wolfe's, the only REAL friend of a lifetime. Fitzgerald wrote in his last years, &quot; Max, you are the only person who has never lost faith in me.&quot; Even after Scott Fitzgerald's too short existence, Max was a warrior for a reputation which he confidently predicted would survive the fads of that time. This is a study for those of us who can only regret never meeting him, a study in accepting the short-comings of others with understanding; and demanding the best from ourselves. Words are cheapened by their use in describing Max, because their cousins are seen so often where the object is so less deserving, but buy the book. Mr Berg paints a wonderous, living picture, whose thousand words I believe venerable Perkins would have approved--if somewhat sheepishly."},{"Title":"Max Perkins: Editor of Genius","review":"Max Perkins was the conductor of the most outstanding literary orchestra ever assembled. He orchestrated each players performance into a sound of America that still plays. The players were from all segments of our society, male, female, protestant, catholic, mid-west, south,east coast, loners, extroverts, introverts, warriors, lovers; a spectrum of background, all from whom Max Perkins could whittle out classic literature. His love of writing and writers was his primary concern; financial success of the book, while important, was not his ultimate priority. There were times he allowed writers to get books out of their system, which he believed might not be successful, because he knew that the writer had to get by that story before they could write their best work. Intuition yes, but absolute understanding of each writers strengths and weaknesses. He gave himself to writing and our country's literary legacy reached it's summit with his stable of writing talents. A.Scott Berg in his own way has written a classic biography about a classic editor who edited classic writers. It was the golden age of writing and editing, a time before television and sales completely dominated the art of language expression."},{"Title":"Max Perkins: Editor of Genius","review":"This is a wonderfully written book, very informative and inspiring for authors, editors, agents and anyone else involved or interested in publishing. Berg does a terrific and subtle job of painting these larger than life characters, allowing their own letters to speak for them. He shows remarkable restraint and good taste and yet has created a book that is enriching and very difficult to put down. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Max Perkins: Editor of Genius","review":"I had a hardcover copy of this book for years, and I let it get away from me. When I found the paperback, I jumped on it and devoured it. What a wonderful friend and editor Perkins was! He had the unerring sense of knowing HOW a story (novels or biographies) should be well-told. A. Scott Berg seems to have followed his advice to the letter. I'm looking forward to reading Berg's other biographies."},{"Title":"Max Perkins: Editor of Genius","review":"I'm a Scott Berg fan, and I bought this book as a vehicle to learn about an important editor and his famous authors. It was what I expected from a Berg book, after reading &quot;Lindbergh.&quot; It contains excellent research and writing and gives an objective telling, although a few too many details for my taste. Scott Berg is my role model as a biographer. What amazed me about the story was how much Max Perkins had to baby his famous writers. I gained respect for him, but not them. There didn't seem to be much happiness in any of these lives."},{"Title":"Max Perkins: Editor of Genius","review":"What greater praise than the fact that I have spent 2 full day and into the night reading this book about a wonderful person who was a friend and confident to so many wonderful writers. I have read biographies of Fitzgerald, Hemingway and Wolfe and I had a paperback on Perkins but it became mislaid. I have read so many of their books and now want read them again as this biography has whetted my appetite.All the wonderful letters that are printed tell so much about these revered writers and tell how much they needed their wonderful editor.Wonderful book!"},{"Title":"Max Perkins: Editor of Genius","review":"Since a class I was taking required the reading of excerpts from this biography, I decided it might be a much better idea to read the entire book. By no means was that a wasted effort! This biography is very well written and opens up new vistas to readers of great fiction from the 20s and 30s.Perkins was the editor for Hemingway, Fitzgerald, and Thomas Wolfe. These are the three which get the bulk of print spent on them. You see that Perkins was much more than an editor and went to great lengths to help these writers discover as much of their potential as possible. He never wanted to credit for these and felt that the editor should always be hidden in the background.Aside from the authors mentioned above, I found that Perkins also assisted authors like Bourjaily, Jones (&quot;From Here to Eternity&quot;), Rawlings (&quot;The Yearling&quot;), and Sherwood Anderson (although there was a bit of a falling out).A. Scott Berg inserts a lot of information into the text, yet it is still very readable. Even in sections when I felt there was more Thomas Wolfe than needed, I still went through the book without wanting to put it down.Even if you are not big into editing, just to hear a &quot;behind-the-scenes&quot; view of some of your favorite authors will make this book worthwhile to you."},{"Title":"Max Perkins: Editor of Genius","review":"Scott Berg has written a wonderful biography on one of the most important men in American literature, Max Perkins. Berg's book is well-written and very entertaining. It is more than a biography of Perkins, it is also a biography of Hemingway, Scott Fiztgerald, and Thomas Wolfe, and a portrait of America during the first half of the 20th century. This is one of those books that I could go on and on about. It is a book that everyone should read."},{"Title":"Max Perkins: Editor of Genius","review":"Shy, sensitive, but extremely loyal to the authors whose works he edited, he not only saved the House of Scribner's from a premature demise, but also redefined the job description of an editor. Without his willingness to show authors how to cut and polish their lumps of coal until they finally emerged as shimmering diamonds, our library shelves would display woeful gaps. I cannot imagine a literary world without the books of F. Scott Fitzgerald, Will James, Arthur Train, Thomas Wolfe, Ernest Hemingway, Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, Ring Lardner, Taylor Caldwell, Alan Paton, the anthology by Professor Copeland of Harvard which formed such an integral part of my youth, &quot;The Copeland Reader,&quot; and so many others."},{"Title":"Max Perkins: Editor of Genius","review":"Scott Berg's biography of Max Perkins is a warm, sparkling account of America's greatest editor in the prewar period, the midwife for works by F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, and Thomas Wolfe in the twenties and thirties, when big-time publishing converged on New York. Berg's book is cunningly organized: the reader steps at once into the rough and tumble of editorial work at Scribner's, leaving Perkins' early life, marriage, and family to be described in concise digressions taken only after we get another satisfying dollop of publishing history. Unhappily, once Perkins has delivered his discoveries to the public, the rest is mostly about their boozy extravagance (Fitzgerald), bullying ego trips (Hemingway), and petulant indiscipline verging on insanity (Wolfe). So even if, for this reason, you stop two-thirds of the way through, your curiosity about this key figure in modern literary history will be very well satisfied."},{"Title":"Max Perkins: Editor of Genius","review":"Scott Berg has rescued from obscurity, &quot;the writer's editor&quot; Max Perkins. Idiosyncratic, compassionate and brilliant, Mr. Perkins edited the writers that taught this century to read. This account is as humane and fascinating as its subject. This book, its author and its subject are enjoyable and (extremely) appreciated."},{"Title":"Max Perkins: Editor of Genius","review":"Maxell Perkins was not only the editor behind the novels of Thomas Wolfe, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Ernest Hemingway, but also each's best friend. Prefering to stay in the background, Perkins brought an infallible sense of structure to each project. He also had the patience of Job, which was necessary when dealing with Wolfe's endless writing, Fitzgerald's endless drinking, and Hemingway's endless bravado. But, Perkins work with the three literary giants was only the tip of the iceberg. He also brought to the fore James Jones's FROM HERE TO ETERNITY, Rawling's THE YEARLING, Taylor Caldwell's DYNASTY OF DEATH and many others. A very readable and informative biography--and as Perkins would have liked it--wonderfully written by A. Scott Berg."},{"Title":"Max Perkins: Editor of Genius","review":"I found this classic in the library the other day and what a treat it was to read. To read--but not to accept. It's a sad but inexorable fact that editors today are more salesmen and paper pushers than shapers of authors. What comes through in Berg's fine biography is that writers like Scott Fitzgerald and Thomas Wolf would likely fall through the cracks if they toiled at the desk now. Although Perkins is best known for his troika (the first two authors mentioned) and Hemingway, I had not known that he was largely responsible for Douglas Southhall Freeman writing his multi-volume history of Robert E. Lee. This superb work is as disciplined and fascinating as its subject."},{"Title":"Max Perkins: Editor of Genius","review":"Berg's work rallies all aspiring authors to the cause of sainthood for Max Perkins...maybe even deification. He tracks Perkins's career vis-a-vis the literary careers of important 20th century American authors. Gives a peek at the largely ignored man behind the curtain...and stands as a monument to his contributions to our literary heritage. A must read for anyone who enjoys books."},{"Title":"Max Perkins: Editor of Genius","review":"Max Perkins was the great editor at Scribners who handled quite a few of the finest writers of the twentieth century, F. Scott Fitzgerad, Hemingway, and Thomas Wolfe being especially noteworthy (and dealt with at length in this biography). One might envy such a man with such a job, but Berg makes it clear that having to deal with the likes of these authors was like walking around with a huge millstone around Max's poor neck. His job was endless and thankless (Wolfe actually betrayed him). You see from the many letters quoted that many of them are blatant pleas for money. Saying that Perkins had to coddle some of these authors like children would be putting it mildly. Berg does an admirable job relaying Perkins's life and hard times. Recommended."},{"Title":"Max Perkins: Editor of Genius","review":"It's a great book full of all kinds of interesting information of the writers Max Perkins started on their ways such as Hemingway, Faulkner, Fitzgerald, Erskind Caldwell."},{"Title":"Max Perkins: Editor of Genius","review":"I got hooked on A.

Scott Berg did an astounding job of it, and I suspect it didn't happen over a few months. Other reviews, (save for one long one and critical one here, that reveal the ending of the book and should be edited to remove that section), do a grand job of reviewing the book."},{"Title":"Max Perkins: Editor of Genius","review":"Max Perkins, Editor of Genius [\\"MPE\\"], A. Scott Berg; E.P. Dutton (1978)On a gloriously deep-blue page within the cover, Berg inscribed his best wishes to a reader... & dated it, \\"March 1980, Santa Barbara.\\" March 1980 was Hell Month. \\"I sure hope this isn't an omen\\" was my uneasy reaction.It wasn't. MPE is splendid. Despite its mistakes, this is a quality work & I'm grateful that this used book surfaced in the Lyrical Ballad. But I wish that editor Tom Congdon had stepped away from his desk to acquire perspective, or had stepped up to the plate with more insight. Almost all of MPE's remarkable deficiencies could have been easily remedied.It's too bloody long. Berg spent altogether too much time detailing the life of Thomas Wolfe (a writer passionately detested by later generations of American high school students) & his bizarre relationship with Perkins. If you like selfish, witless, drunken, mean-spirited & pathologically egotistical writers, this will be your epiphany. Dive in.(Wolfe's index entries run two pages long. Who is the subject of this book - Perkins or Wolfe?)The space wasted on Wolfe could have, instead, been used to include Malcolm Cowley's April 1944 The New Yorker magazine's profile of Max (published three years prior to Perkins's death, resulting in his well-deserved fame, which he had previously spent decades avoiding with \\"pathological self-effacement\\"). And Berg could have spent more time with the other remarkable authors edited by Perkins, such as Marcia Davenport & Marjorie Rawlings.\\"Perkins maintained a public position of silent neutrality, but to special friends such as Scott Fitzgerald & Elizabeth Lemmon, he told all\\" (p. 326).\\"Perkins maintained a silent neutrality, but privately, to Fitzgerald & Lemmon, he told all.\\"The first sentence above is what Congdon left intact. The second is essentially the same information minus the redundancies.Berg has already spent the better part of 40 pages detailing Perkins' relationship with F. Scott Fitzgerald (editor-author) & Elizabeth Lemmon (his lifelong platonic romantic interest). At this point, who needs to be told that they were his \\"special friends\\"?And the context of \\"public position\\" had already been established in the story of Ernest Hemingway getting the drop on Max Eastman in Perkins office, when the media sensationalized the fight in the next day's newspapers. \\"Maintained a strict neutrality\\" is sufficient.Congdon easily could have trimmed Berg's meandering overemphasis on Wolfe & the dishy \\"special friends\\" schlock-tinged reference without harming the book at all, ending up with a taut manuscript of @ 400 pages - the reading of which would have been so much more enjoyable.Also: The photo text-captioning design & print size is a disaster, & most of the photos selected are dreadful (in the group portrait of Max's five daughters, they look like they're witnessing a hanging).In another, I believe that columnist Franklin P. Adams is standing next to Max, his wife Louise Perkins, & Aline Bernstein (Wolfe's crazy married mistress). Adams is unidentified, ignored altogether - despite being the one closest to the camera, the physically largest of the four, & a notable talent in his own right.The \\"baseball manager\\" photo of Elizabeth Lemmon is appalling; the two-page, background-of-black-ink montage of photos & Max's sketches looks like a refrigerator collection of kindergarten crap.And the ending of the book is remarkably inept.James Jones, one of Max's final prot&eacute;g&eacute;s, in the revising of From Here To Eternity discovered that \\"Perkins's writing lessons were making sense. 'Eventually...the concept of a paragraph came to me for the first time. I realized the power I held to raise or lower a reader's emotional level by where I ended a paragraph.' \\"And seven years earlier, Hemingway, one of Max's earliest authors, had come up with \\" the idea of concluding [For Whom The Bell Tolls] with an epilogue.\\"Despite both of these warning beacons in his own book, Berg did not end the story with his understated but moving, \\"As Tom [Wolfe's] deathbed letter to Perkins became his last written words, so did Max's own memorial to Thomas Wolfe become the final words that he edited.\\"It ends, instead, with the emotionally flat & pointless account of the final years of Louise Perkins life as a drunken widow, finally dying by her own inadvertent hand with a lit cigarette that ended up torching her home.Jones's discovery - stated by the author only fourteen pages earlier! - of the power obtained over readers by deciding where a paragraph ends, was then ignored in the crafting of the conclusion of Max Perkins.The demise of Louise Perkins belonged in a next-page epilogue - Hemingway's device - where the subdued tone that had wrecked the ending, would have been, instead, perfectly appropriate. She mattered, but she never truly figures as a central figure in the telling of this story, & only merits inclusion in the second half of the book (due to her increasingly eccentric behavior).(In that vein, anything that didn't pertain to Perkins & his authors should have been either scaled down or altogether jettisoned - just as various \\"excellent\\" sections of Wolfe's promiscuous writing had to be tossed from the massive raw manuscript of Look Homeward Angel, so that the book could be finally published.)But at a deeper level, no editor could have saved \\"iceBerg\\" from his Achilles heel - his emotional remoteness from his material.Wolfe could be charming, but was mostly volatile. Hemingway could make Wolfe look like Little Bo Beep. Aline Bernstein's binges were unforgettable. Yet, the only page on which the volatility & passion of Max's authors, acquaintances, or Max himself can be found was when Marcia Davenport exploded & confronted Wolfe with the truth, of what kind of a person he truly was:\\"I think you're a rat...ungrateful & treacherous. That dedication [to Perkins, in Of Time & the River] was disgusting. It didn't mean devotion to Max, it was just spilling yourself...you have no devotion & no loyalty either. Where would you be without Max & Scribners...?\\"(The odd feeling of having been here before arose, with immediate recall of Rodric Braithwaite's soggy noodle account of the Nazi invasion of Russia & the siege of its capitol in \\"Moscow 1941.\\" The first guy to lose his temper was Stalin, @ 80-100 pages into the story. Surely that could not have been the case.)At any rate, the last page is the telling page. Not only does Louise not belong in the crescendo; the action is flat & lifeless. As the Perkins house blazed, \\"on Sunday, February 21, 1965, firemen were summoned...\\"Firemen are not \\"summoned.\\"They are called by frantic people often in a state of panic. Family members might be trapped in the flames. Firemen, swearing, bolt to the waiting truck. The engine kicks in. The firehouse doors fly open. Then that truck, with sirens blaring & lights flashing, tears down the road at dangerous speeds so that a terrifying fire can be fought to defeat by men who in saving lives may lose their own.*****I'm seldom, if ever, impressed by the endorsements featured on dust jackets, but the following, by Hemingway scholar Carlos Baker, is brilliant.Aside from the beauty of the writing, considering the countless falsehoods printing on other dust jackets, I guarantee you, this is the only one that I will ever quote in its entirety with respect:\\"The anonymity that Maxwell Perkins sought & partly achieved in his lifetime has continued to prevail in the thirty years since his death. This excellent & warm-hearted biography of one of the great literary editors of our time now brings Perkins's career & personality out of the zone of shadows & into clear & revealing light.\\"Mr. Berg has made literally hundreds of fresh discoveries & has woven them into a continuously entertaining & often moving narrative that shows Perkins exactly as he was in his personal life as well as in his association with the many leading American writers whom he discovered & skillfully nurtured into fame & fortune.\\"Almost perfect. But the one phrase that just doesn't belong, in this otherwise entirely deserved tribute to Berg's skill & perseverance, is \\"warm-hearted.\\""},{"Title":"Masked schizophrenia, diagnosis and a unified method of treatment","review":"My first introduction to the diagnosis of Schizophrenia was Dr.Strahl's book on the subject. The concept of a masked form has engendered some counter arguments against the concept. However, aside from labels, this book is packed with very relevant insights relating to this disorder. For example, what today we may refer to as schizo-affective or borderline psychosis, Strahl shows us, how fragile and fragmented the underlying pathology is and why this patient moves from a schizoid position to a full fledged psychosis. Yes, this book details not only the etiology, behavioral traits and symptom picture, but addresses beautifully the challenge to therapists trying to help these patients discover an authentic sense of themselves. \\"Here again\\", Strahl tells us, \\"You are walking a tightrope. You cannot be too passive and you cannot be too active. To learn how to walk this tightrope is probably the most important aspect of treatment\\". The layout of the subject suggests not only a deep familiarity with the research on this disorder, but successful clinical interventions as well. Strahl writes, \\"Without emotional support, the schizophrenic patient feels like a chip of wood floating in a vast stormy ocean where there is no harbor\\". I really appreciate the diagram of the schizo-dynamic mechanisms underlying ambivalence, the major affective component of the disorder which permeates the treatment as well as the patients malfunctioning. Nebulous ego boundaries are cited as a core feature, not only here, but in other works by Otto Kernberg and Harry Sullivan for example. \\"Treatment must be tailor-made in accordance with each patient's most serious and urgent conflicts\\", Strahl tells us. If this is a clinical subject which interests you and you are looking for clarity and depth in understanding these disorders of identity, consider reading this book. It has been a permanent fixture on my shelf for over twenty-five years."},{"Title":"A Preface to History","review":"Gustavson's work is an excellent primer for freshmen struggling through Western Civ or even more experienced students of history in search of a deeper understanding of the historical forces that shape our world. Gustavson examines these forces in each chapter and provides historical examples that bring the ideas into focus. With considerable wit and a sophisticated mind, Gustavson created a work that will stand the test of time...a considerable achievement for a historian."},{"Title":"A Preface to History","review":"Gustavson's book is best read before reading the standard college history texts, because he shows the reader how to think about history and place its diverse events in context. Some chapter titles are \\"The Nature of Social Forces\\", \\"The Institutional Factor\\", \\"Revolution\\", \\"The Bases of Loyalty\\", \\"The Individual in History\\", \\"The Role of Ideas\\", and \\"Power\\". Gustavson's style is light, entertaining, and readable. The content and conclusions are enormously powerful and far-reaching. \\"Revolution\\" should be required reading at the State Department. Buy this book. Pay whaterever you have to to own it. One caution for the modern reader: The book contains no charts, no graphs, and no pictures. Like no other book I've encountered, it does contain a broad context for understanding the past and, consequently, the present and the future."},{"Title":"A Preface to History","review":"Gustavson does a great job of teaching the reader how to study history. While there are more modern thoughts on this topic, Gustavson's book survives a half century of being read and teaching budding historians. If you have a desire to understand how to read a history book, while reading a pretty good one itself (Gustavson has an eclectic mix of historical references)."},{"Title":"A Preface to History","review":"I bought this book and distributed it to my students for the AP History course that I teach. Half of the students quit after the first chapter they were so bored of it and the rest of them read the book but didn't understand where it was going or what the point of it was. I just feel this book was not a good choice to be published and should not be used at all for anything."},{"Title":"Sporting Chance","review":"Heris Serrano, who resigned her Regular Space Service commission after disobeying orders for good reason, chose not to go back when her chance came at the end of Hunting Party. In this trilogy's second volume, Heris is still captain of Lady Cecelia's yacht; but she now has several members of her former crew with her, including the man who couldn't be her lover in the old days.After delivering Prince Gerel home following certain embarrassing events on Seralis, Lady Cecelia orders the Sweet Delight into a redecorating company's drydock. As Heris prepares to oversee the yacht's refitting, she feels great uneasiness about Lady Cecelia's safety. But trouble, when it comes, strikes the unconventional old lady down in one of the places where she should have been safest. The family rebel, who never needed anyone before, lies helpless in a blind, mute, paralyzed body; and the only people who know she's aware inside that body, Heris and two of her employer's young relatives, also know that what felled her wasn't a massive stroke. As her enemies move to lock Lady Cecelia away permanently and take control of her vast holdings, the disgraced ex-RSS officer and two young socialites form a desperate plan.This story works well on all of its several levels. It's a seat-of-the-pants adventure, set in a well-conceived future universe, cast with characters who change in believable ways as a result of their experiences. It also manages to delve into such serious themes as how families behave toward their nonconforming members in time of crisis, how societies treat their disabled citizens, and how fear of aging can stunt - or even warp - not just individuals, but entire cultures. An excellent read!"},{"Title":"Sporting Chance","review":"This is probably one of the most satisfying books in the long series of the Familias. Though the plot unravels a little bit too fast and too easily at the end, the book is packed with action, full with non-related plots that intersect each other anyway.There is also a comforting sense of completion at the book's end, something which is often missing from Elizabeth Moon's books (on her series)."},{"Title":"Sporting Chance","review":"In THE HUNTING CLUB, we were introduced to the character of Heris Serrano, unfairly cashiered fleet officer turned private yacht captain for a rich eccentric who likes riding to hounds. It was not the most stellar of books but it was interesting enough to hold the attention. It also prepares the way for this one and this one IS a very good read.In the previous book, the captain helped to foil a plot in which rich nobility engaged in illicit hunting. It was not the hunting which made it illicit, it was the fact that humans were the quarry. An idiot of a prince had let himself get involved in the hunting and the captain, her employer and a group of unlikely spoiled brats saved the day. In this book, these people who know the prince, realize that there is something wrong with him. He may naturally be a spoiled product of privilege but he was not supposed to be stupid. He is. They have stumbled onto a plot which involved royal intrigue, smuggling, power politics and a fair amount of \\"whodunit\\".What started out as a fair series with nothing really special about it is shaping up to become something more."},{"Title":"Sporting Chance","review":"The first of Elizabeth Moon's Familias Regnant novels, _Hunting Party_, was enjoyable, but the second, _Sporting Chance_, is much better. It was, for want of a fresher word, gripping. It compels reading, it's very exciting, the character are extremely involving, and it has some interesting ideas too. Heris' employer Cecelia has noticed that the Crown Prince appears to have been tampered with: he's acting unusually dull. She tells the King, which turns out to be political folly. Cecelia ends up poisoned in a scary way: she is paralyzed, still conscious but unable to communicate or convince anyone else that she is not a vegetable. She has left Heris her ship in her will: thus Heris becomes a prime suspect. The story follows several threads: Heris takes a secret mission for the King, trying to find the Prince's illegal clones; while Brun and Ronnie, two younger members of the nobility who were &quot;reformed&quot; by Cecelia and Heris in _Hunting Party_, take action to get Cecelia appropriate medical treatment, and Heris' new employee Sirkin deals with a foolish lover who gets her involved in some very dangerous situations. The action is pretty much nonstop, despite much of the story being told from the viewpoint of a paralyzed, incommunicado, individual, and the resolution is solid. My main quibble is that the villains are too too BAD."},{"Title":"Sporting Chance","review":"After breaking up an illegal human-hunting ring run by rich amoral elites, Captain Serrano and Lady Cecelia land a job babysitting the heir of their kingdom's throne. Much like the annoying young people inHunting Party, Prince Gerel behaves in a monumentally stupid and annoying manner. The protagonists analyze his behavior, run tests, and find out the moronic Prince is a moron from an insidious attack via drugs. He's too well genetically engineered to be *that* stupid.Cecelia gets taken out early by the mastermind behind the plot, and half the book is her struggling to retain sanity while tweenage characters from book one (who have now come of age) attempt rescue. Serrano is on the offensive, trying to solve the mystery behind the induced stupidity, while simultaneously fighting legal challenges and the occasional space battle.Book two outshines book one, the focus on elite past-times which don't interest the reader (horseback riding, fox hunting) are toned down and much better integrated with the main plot line (hot air balloon festival). I wasn't fond of how Moon changed Lady Cecelia's character at the end of the novel, and enough is left hanging that you don't get closure without reading book three --Winning Colors. An OK transitional book, comparable to Weber's Honor Harrington, but not what I consider great space opera. The book focuses too much on the wealthy and their quirks, and not enough on the people who they rule (but really exploit). Moon could have spotlighted her world's stance on genetic engineering, but instead ignores it beyond the sci-fi trappings. This makes the book more pulp than substance, and as a reader, I wanted more in this area, both ethically and spiritually. Two and a half stars, rounded up."},{"Title":"Sporting Chance","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the first book in this series, The Hunting Party and was particularly delighted with Moon's choice of a smart and capable 80-year-old woman as a major character. (NOTE: be sure to read Moon's \\"Remnant Population\\" for another outstanding depiction of a strong older woman).This entry in the series as not as satisfying for me since there was little interaction between Lady Cecelia (the old lady who owns the yacht) and Capt. Serrano. Still, there was enough action and character development -- not to mention plain ol' good writing -- to keep the book interesting and enjoyable.However, I had a major disappointment toward the end. SPOILER COMING, SO DON'T READ FURTHER UNLESS YOU'VE FINISHED THE BOOK ........I hated the fact that at the end, Moon suddenly (through the magic of 'rejuv') transformed the 80-year old Cecelia into a 40-ish, red-headed beauty. Granted, better that than a 20-something space-faring bimbo with large breasts, but was it really so horrible to have an elderly woman who looked her age be a central figure? I'll read the third in the series but I can't say I am looking forward to it as much."},{"Title":"Sporting Chance","review":"Elizabeth Moon is a wonderful writer and her books fill a craving.I really enjoy reading her books and when she and Anne McCaffrey put their heads together it get's really astonishing and gratifying what they can come up with."},{"Title":"Sporting Chance","review":"In CAPT Heris Serrano, Ms. Moon has a heroine capable of holding her own with, and maybe ever surpassing, Weber's Honor Harrington. Teamed with Lady Cecelia, CAPT Serrano is a formidable opponent capable of handling any action -- or intrigue -- with aplomb. Dealing with the genetic marvels and monsters of some of the more powerful and unscrupulous of the Familias families gives her plenty of scope for both. This book is essential reading if one is to have a full understanding of some of the complex politics covered in the later Suiza books and, unlike Rules of Engagement, tells a complete story that stands alone. Here's hoping that Ms. Moon brings CAPT Serrano back to center stage soon."},{"Title":"Sporting Chance","review":"The initial pages ramble as the author gathers all the threads begun in 'Hunting Party'. If I hadn't read the two books back to back I would have had to reread the first to know what was going on.

The beautiful New England scenery, the excellent background music which somehow conveys the Civil War period, the fine acting - all make this a very enjoyable rendition.I somewhat reluctantly have withheld the 5th star - possibly unfairly so. I re-read Louisa May Alcott's book just recently. My conclusion was that because the book provides a much more comprehensive development of the lives of the four March daughters, no movie, within its modern time limitations, can really do justice to Alcott's plot. While I liked the portrayal of Professor Bhaer very much in this latest version, I think the movie adaptation made him much more &#34;modern&#34; than the book would allow - more youthful in appearance, more advanced views of culture, a manufactured love scene, etc.But all in all - highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"5 stars!!!!

It is a book everyone should read - and not because they have to, but because they want to."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \\"Little Women\\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature. Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. Louisa May Alcott's best-known novel is a magnificent achievement."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"One of the best books I've ever read.

Although long, it is a wonderful book that I will eventually read again. Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy are four teenage sisters. Throughout the book we see their lives. The father is fighting in the civil war. They are a poor family. But even so they find a way to make the best of life. Meg is proper and ladylike. She simply loves silk dresses. Jo is a tomboy with a temper. She loves to write and although she wants independance and freedom, she also wants to do something for the world and craves respect and honesty. I am most like Jo. I love to write and even though I am not a tomboy I feel that I most identify with her. Beth is a sweet pianist who is a little angel. She is timid and feels that she does not do enough with her life as she mostly stays home with their maid Hannah. When she is on her deathbed she reads a poem by Jo about her and realizes that she made a difference in her older sister's life. THat makes her feel better. Amy is a bit of a snob. She is a talented artist who hates her nose. She says she will marry for money. Laurie is the next door neighbor. He and Jo become best friends. When he asks Jo to marry him she refuses because they are both so independant that it would ruin their relationship as just friends. It breaks his heart. He later marries Amy, who although Laurie does have a lot of money, she also loves him. Marmee is a mix of all four of her daughters. I highly recommend this book. Don't put it down because it is too long. The second half of the book is better. I admit, I felt like punching it when I was at the last 25 pages.

The girls and their mother are very close. Mr. March is away in the Civil War. The book tells of the adventures of the girls as they grow up. It tells of their poverty and how they shouldn't take anything for granted. It shares stories of bad moments in their lives. A teacher hit Amy as a punishment therefore causing and uprising. The girls mother then pulls them out of school. It tells of their love lives and the conflicts between Laurie and the sisters. They also try to find a happy medium of good and bad. They want to be bad and do mischivous things, but need to be the proper ladies that they are expected to be. They spend their lives trying to balance the two ideas. They try to learn the difference between dreams and reality. They dream of a life of riches, where they get everything they want. But in reality, they are not even close. They try, throughout the whole story, to be good sisters to one another. They also try to be good to their mother, since she is struggling while her husband is away. At Christmas, the girls planned on buying eachother and themselves gifts. Later, that changed to buying presents for their mother to show her how much they appreciate her hard work and love. The author, Alcott, portrays they life and society during the civil war superbly. This book is good for boys and girls of all ages because everyone can learn something from it, wether its about love, lust, money, pride, education, or anything else. This book shows us the reality of life. It deserves all five stars, if not more."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"How can you not love this tale of 4 sisters struggling to have a normal life despite a father away fighting in the Civil War and diminished means because of his absence? Jo is a feminist of whom Susan B. Anthony would be proud. Poor Beth is so good and easy to love that her illness is heart-breaking. Meg is strong and practical. And Amy, well, you have to love her despite her vanity and selfishness. Of course, Marmee is the tie that binds this family together. So many wonderful movie adaptations of this beloved novel have been produced, including the very faithful one starring Winona Ryder, but, really, one should read this novel to totally immerse themselves in the lives of the March girls. If you love the movie, do yourself the favor of reading this book. Read it to your young daughter, or buy your 4th, 5th, or 6th grader her very own copy to treasure."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"zzzzz zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz z z zzzzzzzzzzz zzzzzzzzzzzz z z zzzzzzzzzzzz zzz z z z z z z z z zz"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I have loved this story since I was a little girl.

I decided to re-read it and I am glad I did. So much fiction today is lacking in plot, character development, and thought, in short, this is good literature. This is one of the best books around for people of all ages. I so appreciate that the March family experienced the joys and pains of everyday living and handled both with dignity, spirit, and a genuine love for each other. Even though poor, the March family rose above it. So many lessons are taught in this book that young people, particularly, could benefit from reading it. I will add this to my reading list of books that I read every couple of years!"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I managed somehow to never read this book as a youngster but corrected that when I was in my 20s. Since it had been so many years (about 30) and I was getting ready to readMarchby Geraldine Brooks, I wanted to go back and re-read this first novel.As many other reviewers have said, this story starts off quite slowly and I was initially disappointed. It wasn't the book I remembered. Deciding to stick with it, I kept going and it picked up steam as it went along becoming the book I enjoyed previously.I wonder how young girls react to this now when \\"The Hunger Games\\" and \\"Gossip Girl\\" seem to be the norm and are so vastly different from this. The early stages are sugary sweet and there is quite a bit of preaching on religion and morals throughout that might make the younger ones roll their eyes a bit. While it has largely aged well, it must be read for the time period in which it was written.I am very glad I re-read it as an adult."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This book serves better as a decoration piece than one you want to spend time passing around to friends.

The book is in many ways timeless and worth the time taken to read it."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little Women was first published in 1868 as two volumes and was an instant success. The novel concerns the lives and loves of four sisters growing up during the American Civil War. Beautiful Meg, tomboy Jo, serene Beth, and selfish Amy are based on Alcott's own experiences with her three sisters.Little Women has such a sweet feel to it. The characters are all so real, each with their own personalities that jump off the page. They make you care deeply about what happens to them. It's lovely to see how they struggle with their own and each other's flaws.Little women is overall a wonderful classic. If you can look past the preachy-ness that the book has at times you will find that you enjoy a simple story about women, sisters, friendships and life."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"i have never read books like i am reading them now. i was never good (fast) at it and that frustrated me. recently i saw a list of books that a friend read (it was one of those notes on facebook). i hadn't read but maybe 2 or 3 of them, the list was about 100 books long. she had read more than 50% of them! the note was about the books you've read as a child where you copy the list and put an \\"x\\" next to the ones that you've read. so i noted a few and looked in goodwill and such for cheap books on the list. i have found many and read many since! i had two copies of little women also but i hadn't started it. when i got a tablet pc i got the kindle app and have not put the thing down since! it's like a game because it is digital and the pages are much shorter than in a paper book so i feel like i am reading faster. and...most of the classics are free!!!so this book is wonderful! it is great! i can't wait to start little men and jo's boys!"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Read the book, watched the movie and read the book again.

This is a marvelous story. It concentrates on these four little women with their dad off fighting in the war and the March family going poor. Alcott incorporates the feelings of each of the little women as the story progresses. She wrote a great story with such great detail with each of the women. During the coarse of the story, Alcott uses many literary devices in her writing, but there are a few that are more immanent to the reader.Louisa Alcott uses a combination of two literary terms, an understatement and figure of speech. Josephine March constantly uses the phrase, \\"Christopher Columbus\\" during the coarse of the story. She usually uses this phrase when something marvelous or great happens. In the story, Jo is invited to visit the ill Mr. Laurie. When he shows her the house and invites her for tea, Jo uses \\"Christopher Columbus\\" when she sees the great and luxurious music room. She really means how marvelous and great the room was. People around her may not know what she is talking about, but Jo surely does.Louisa Alcott also uses the literary device, foreshadowing. She does this when Jo comes home from town one day with Laurie. Jo comes running up to her house and there was Meg talking with John. Jo gets jealous and mad because she doesn't want Meg to fall in love with him and marry him. Then that means she will have to move out and the four little March sisters will down to three and Jo does not want that. So as Jo, Meg, John, and Laurie are talking, Beth comes home from town. All of a sudden, Jo grabs Beth and gives Beth a hug and says, \\"Beth you are never going to leave. You are going to be the one to keep the family together.\\" With Jo saying that, it foreshadows that something bad is going to happen to Beth and surely something does. Beth dies from Scarlet fever that she got from the baby she was taking care of. Jo was of course devastated with the death and lost of poor Beth. Before Beth dies, she confronts Jo in the attic to talk her. They talk about her (Beth) dieing and leaving Jo. As Jo is crying, Beth starts doing a soliloquy in which she makes a long speech with Jo about dieing. She talks about how she will always be with her and how much Jo means to her. She also says how she is not scared and how what is happening is what is the right thing. With her relationship with Beth, Jo is later inspired to write a novel to be published about her Beth.Finally, Alcott uses all of the characteristics in a character. For instance, Jo is a great example of a static character; she never changes through out the coarse of the story. At the beginning, Jo loves to write and wants one of her stories published. At the end, she still loves writing, but at the end, her story My Beth is published. Laurie is a good example of a dynamic character. At the beginning, he falls in love with Jo, but as he confesses his love to her and her hand in marriage, she turns him down. Then as he is visiting Europe, he meets up with Amy and things just click and he starts having feelings for Amy. Later they get married, but Jo and Laurie still stay the best of friends just as they were before. Examples of flat characters are Demi and Daisy because they are only described as the twins of Meg and John. Beth is an example of a round character because she is a very quiet but very virtuous. She does nothing but try to please others. She adores music and plays the piano very well. She seems like a real person that some one would know from school. These are just a few examples, but there are many other characters that fit the description of each of these.Little Women by Louisa May Alcott is a great book. No matter how old or young a reader they maybe, they would enjoy it. It is a book for all ages. Alcott words the novel as though it is a true story happening to real people. Readers can relate to the events in the story and can relate to the feelings of the characters. This book may be a classic, but it is still enjoyed by many. Little Women is a novel that will never fade away and will continue to be read by others for as long as time can tell. Now that is fantastic novel."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"The main reason I loved Little Women is that it displayed so many different personalities within one family. Meg, being the oldest, was more refined and mature than her sisters. She always felt as if she had to set a good example for the younger siblings. Jo was the daydreamer and had strong ambitions to become a writer. Jo, according to the story, is the one who wrote this book. She was the tomboy who always wanted to have fun. Beth was the quiet sister. She was always listening to the other girl's problems and giving advice. Amy was the youngest sister, and to be quite frank, was just plain spoiled! She always got what she wanted and in the process took many things that could easily hurt Jo. Going to Europe was one of Jo's dreams. Whe Jo finally thought she was going to get to go, her aunt asked Amy. Instead of refusing to go and offering her spot to Jo, Amy accepted her aunt's offer immediately. The book Little Women is not just a story about four different girls growing into women; it is a tale of friendship, family, and belonging. It shows how four ppeople can have a huge impact on each other's lives and on the lives of many others."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \\"Little Women\\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature. Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly.

There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today.

Aside from a few typographical errors in the Kindle version, this book is an excellent e-book freebie.

It may well be considered a literary classic, although I still don't consider it a must-read for every young girl."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I think Little Women is best read at a younger age. As an adult, I can see the important lessons in regard to friendship, family and finding your place in the world even when it goes against the norm. I appreciate the simple tone and wording that would make this book an easy read for a middle school child. And in the end, the book is ultimately a coming of age story that would be better suited for someone much younger than myself.Reading the book as an adult, I found it hard to get into. It went from slow and meandering in the beginning to an almost break-neck pace towards the end. It was heavy on description and the characters weren't all that deep. I know it's a classic and people love these girls, but they seemed very two dimensional to me. Each had her very own set of traits and none seemed to share a trait with another as sisters would. While that could allow for each character to be her own person and made it easy to distinguish one from the next, it didn't seem real.A wonderful book for children, but the experience doesn't justify a reading as an adult. I'm glad to have read it to try to understand the perpetual love people have for it, it wasn't something I enjoyed enough to ever want to read again.

I was thrilled to find it at my library, because everyone told me that I should read it. This unique story shows how the March sisters deal with problems together.

The four girls, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy, form a tight bond as they deal with frienships, money, marriages, and much more, during the civil war, when their father is away. When their mother, &quot;Marmee&quot; goes to help their sick father, they struggle to find any help for Amy, who is dreadfully ill with the scarlet fever. This, and many more problems fill their lives, and they learn to live a better life as they mature and grow strong within each other.

Then someone recommended Louisa May Alcott to me so I gave it another shot, but by the end I was truly wondering why Little Women had become such a classic. I found that the first half was lacking in plot - when I looked back on it I realized that I had spent at least a couple hours reading about a ball, a sickness, and a bad dinner - and that the second half had far too much plot. The first part was very hung up on morality and sometimes felt too pious, although Marmee was a remarkably enlightened woman. The characters, especially Meg, didn't feel distinct and realistic throughout the second half; I felt like the three years that had passed distanced me from the characters. Attempting to jam three romances, a death, and a storyline involving Jo's writing into the second part only made things feel more detached. As for the aforesaid romances, I tried desperately to find the emotional reasoning behind Jo's choice and came up empty handed. The one thing that saved this book was the simple language and writing; I found it easy to read.In short, I'm sure that this book appeals to some, but I didn't like at 7 and I don't like it now. I definitely agree with the people that recommended Anne of Green Gables instead - it and its sequels are great books."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I never read the book in this form, but did read it many years ago.

I think before you buy books, you should try to know the book and the child fairly well beforehand, in terms of what you think they would like. I know that many kids will dislike a book which many others like (like you today, perhaps). Considering the caveat I said, I'd consider buying it."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little Women is very like The Brady Bunch. In its time, everybody knew it was sugary-sweet and unrealistic. (Including, and especially, Alcott.) It still dared to tackle subjects previously taboo. (For Little Women, it was daring to show girls with personalities, for Brady Bunch, it was new to show blended families.)The world was never like this--even Alcott's own life was not. She idealized a miserable childhood into something that would sell: a noble, genteel poverty that conveniently appeals to today's nostalgiacs. If you enjoy that, great. Just keep some perspective.Belongs in classes studying how literature has changed."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"My mother, an avid reader, always introduced books to me and &quot;Little Women&quot; is one of them.

It simply isn't my cup of tea because I don't really related to four proper ladies during the 1800s who all eventually got married off and produced offspring, including Jo, who was supposed to be &quot;tomboyish&quot; and independent-minded. Additionally, it may be a little too cloyingly sentimental for me to stomach. But however, if it is a good, well-written book with inspiring characters, especially women living in the 19th century, then I guess I'd recommand it to anyone who would like it nevertheless."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little women are the perfect compliment to little men.

While asleep, I have been known to shout out loud to people in my life who are hard-of-hearing; speak French; throw punches; laugh; and carry on lengthy one-sided conversations. Throughout these dramas, I am treated to Technicolor images playing on the back of my eyelids.At one point in my life, a friend suggested I talk with a psychologist who was well-known for her expertise in deciphering dreams. To be honest, I was pretty skeptical. It sounded like either fortune-telling, or a waste of my time, or perhaps both. Talking with this woman, however, turned out to be incredibly helpful. She did not tell me about myself, my life, or my dreams: instead, as the best guides do, she gave me the tools to find my own insights.Surely, this is what our best writers and most influential teachers have done for us, as well. When people write a good story, or help us to interpret those stories, they are offering us a new set of glasses to try on - a set of glasses through which we may catch a different way of looking at ourselves and our world. These glasses, whether they are labeled \\"Marxist\\", \\"Christian\\", \\"Feminist\\", \\"Jungian\\", or what-have-you, may give us deeper insight into parts of our own personality, or they may give us a view of a part of the world we've never even considered.In the case of the above-mentioned psychologist, she suggested I look at each object or person in my dream and see it as a representation of ...ME. So, the ugly couch is me; the thunderstorm in the background is me; the broken teapot is me, as is the table it is sitting on .... This may not help me understand every aspect of my dreams, nor every dream I have, but it is a great starting point. I have also found this to be true in my personal reading. Even if the purpose of reading a certain book is to learn about something completely foreign to you, it helps to get a foothold by finding a familiar aspect, something to which you can relate.Recently, I started reading Louisa May Alcott's \\"Little Women\\". This lovely little book is, unfortunately, one of many of the \\"classics\\" that I have never read. Despite the fact that I love to read, I do find \\"The Canon\\" (capitals completely intentional) rather daunting. I was surprised, then, to find myself wholly sucked in to what could be criticized as a overly simple, moralizing story, written too long ago to be relevant, in words which may now seem stilted. What could Jo, Amy, Beth, and Meg have to say to a modern woman, more than 130 years later? Why, as I devour the pages of their story, do I feel such love and sympathy for them?And then, I realize, in the clarity of thought that often comes as I put down a book for the night and just before sleep takes me, that these characters are ... ME. Scholars and historians who have studied the life and writings of Louisa May Alcott attest to the autobiographical aspects of \\"Little Women\\", and how Louisa created the character of \\"Jo\\" to represent herself. As I am reading, I sympathize with Jo - her stubbornness, her tomboyish ways, her fierce loyalty to her sisters and her family, her writing, her bossiness. So, at first, I say, \\"I am Jo.\\" But then I realize I relate to Beth, too, especially as members of her family protect her, with her perhaps overly sensitive heart, and her health problems. And - admit it, ladies, even the toughest among us - who doesn't want, in some corner of her soul, to be \\"petted\\" and admired at times, like the little princess Amy wants to be; or to be the nurturer, older sister, eventual wife and mother, Meg. And, hey, guys, who knew that \\"Little Women\\" might be a better guide to understanding the females in your life than anything contemporary pop psychologists are writing?And so, with the help of this classic, I have touched base with parts of myself I haven't acknowledged in a while. The way symbols and themes and people may show up in your dreams, though you haven't consciously thought of them for a long time. This is why the great stories truly last.Author of \\"Hobo Finds A Home\\" editor \\"Of A Predatory Heart\\""},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This book is okay but it is DEFINETLY not the best. Meg, Jo, Beth and Amys' father has gone to war and they all have their own problems. Meg suffers from her own vanity, Jo suffers from her temper, Beth is in danger of dying and Amy suffers injustice at school.I don't reccomend this book to boys, but it might be good to some girls."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This book, Little Women by Louisa May Alcott was boring. I did not enjoy her style of writing at all. Another factor that lead to me not liking this book is that it was from the 1800's. Young teens like me are not into these types of boring \\"1800's\\" books. This book was a torture to read. You might ask, \\"what was going through your mind as you were reading this book?\\" Well, to all of those people out there, my answer is \\"boring!\\" Louisa explained everything that was going on... only a little bit too much. I would recommend this book to anyone who has a mature mind and enjoys reading classic style books."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"\\"Little Women\\", written by Louisa May Alcott, is about four sisters, Jo March who is fifteen-years-old, Meg March who is the oldest, Beth March who is thirteen-years-old, and Amy March who is the youngest by twelve-years-old, who live in England with their mother, Marmee. They are poor, and their mother mostly does the working, while their father is out fighting in war, but help out by working little jobs outside of helping in the house. The four sisters go through so much in life, but they don't care much about what others think because they are happy that they were blessed with a father and a mother who love them very much, and they always got each other.\\"Little Women\\" is an amazing book that I recommend to anyone. It teaches people a life lesson, and shows how a person with less fortune lives throughout their lives. As I read this book, so many emotions went through my head, I found myself crying, happy, and wanting to read the book continuously without stopping. This book was originally written in 1868, it being the first novel book that she has ever written. Louis May Alcott was born in the year of 1832 in Massachusetts. She was the second daughter to Bronson Alcott and Abigail May. She had three sisters, Anna, Elizabeth, and Abby. When Louisa was about ten years, her and her family moved to Harvard, Massachusetts. On a hillside farm they planned to establish a model community, Fruitlands, making use of no animal products or labor except, as Abigail Alcott observed, for that of women. She and her small daughters struggled to keep household and farm going while the men went about the countryside philosophizing. In a few months quarrels erupted, and winter weather saw the end of the experiment. The only lasting product of Fruitlands was Louisa's reminiscence, \\"Transcendental Wild Oats.\\" Her and her family moved to Concord and for the next three years lived across the road from Emerson in a house they called Hillside, a relatively happy period preserved in the first chapters of Little Women. Closeness to the Emerson family was important to Louisa. Her first book, Flower Fables, 1854, was written for Ellen Emerson, whose father she idolized. Years later Alcott told Emerson about her early romance. \\"He was much amused,\\" she wrote, \\"and begged for his letters, kindly saying he felt honored to be so worshipped. The letters were burnt long ago, but Emerson remained my 'Master,' while he lived, doing more for me,--as for many another--than he knew, by the simple beauty of his life, the truth and wisdom of his books, the example of a great, good man.\\" In these years, Louisa \\"got religion,\\" as she later put it. Running in the Concord woods early one fall morning, she stopped to see the sunshine over the meadows. \\"A very strange and solemn feeling came over me as I stood there,\\" she wrote in her journal, \\"with no sound but the rustle of the pines, no one near me, and the sun so glorious, as for me alone. It seemed as if I felt God as I never did before, and I prayed in my heart that I might keep that happy sense of nearness all my life\\" (Louis May Alcott). On March 1, 1888, Louisa visited her father for the last time. \\"I am going up,\\" he said. \\"Come with me.\\" \\"Oh, I wish I could,\\" she replied. Bronson Alcott died on March 4, and Louisa May Alcott on March 6. She was buried in Sleepy Hollow cemetery in Concord. Her grave bears a Civil War veteran's marker. Throughout her life, she was successful, writing books about inspirational families and people. She was a great person in general as well, leaving a great memory of a wonderful woman who was loving and caring"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I can't remember if I ever finished this book in high school. If I did, I didn't appreciate it as much as I did now - many, many years later :DIt's a lesson on good manners and right conduct, on faith, on family relationships, parenthood, sisterhood, brotherhood, friendship, neighborliness, courtship, marriage, child-rearing, dreams, frustrations , life itself - all found in the saga of the March sisters from when they were teeners and tweeners through their adulthood. I have highlighted quite a number of lines in this book that I would have shared if not for space limitation. The message is timeless - if we would all have the sense and character that was instilled in the March sisters; if all families were to see and act on its role as the most elemental unit in society(but the most important nonetheless), this world would be a better place for all of humankind."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Unfortunately, I just couldn't embrace this book. However, I also couldn't give it less than three stars because it is such a time tested classic and I could understand why generations of readers have adored it. For me, personally, I found it too feminine and sentimental. The narrative was laced with morals and the romantic and flowery language was tedious. The characters were well developed, though some were more sympathetic than others. As a writer, I had a natural affinity towards Jo, and how could any reader not be fond of gentle Beth. Meg doesn't become interesting until she becomes a mother and I never felt much depth in Amy. Of course Marmee was full of sage advice, Laurie was quite a rascal, and Professor Bhaer was the epitome of kindness. While I did care about what happened to the March family and I was pleased with the conclusion, I didn't feel devotion to the book itself because I'm just not the type of romantic individual who can identify with such feminine notions."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I purchased this audio book to introduce my 10 year old daughter to Little Women. We began listening to it while driving on a seven hour trip. We found that while the story can still engage a modern reader, this version of the audio book was not well delivered. The recording is just a bit flat. The reader sounds like the schoolteacher from Little House on the Prairie. The production does not deliver on the emotional aspect that underlies the text. Maybe we've been spoiled by superb audio-book readers like Jim Dale. But I found this recording a bit disappointing. My daughter finished by book from a print copy rather than continue to listen."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I read this book as a kid, and loved it. However after reading this version I realized that I had read a shortened version. I'm so glad I took the time to re-read such a wonderful book. The longer version is definitely better.This should be required reading for junior high students as there are many life lessons contained in this terrific story."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect from this book. I aquired the audiobook version from audible and listened to it in my car with my seven year old son. I really didn't expect for him to like it and though he never seemed to pay attention to it - however he always knew what was going on and was quite upset that the ending didn't play out the way he wanted. Apparently my little 7 year old boy who revels in dirt and climbing trees is a closet romantic and expected a wedding - no matter that the characters were a bit too young to get married.The short summary - We follow the March family, 4 dutiful daughters and their mother through the period of time that their father is away at war (I believe he's a chaplain). They befriend their neighbors and go through several trials, all learning to be better people through it all.It doesn't sound very exciting does it? Well it's not exciting in the shootem up explosion type way - but it is very engaging and endearing. Many people argue that this book has lost it's luster since the girls spend time sewing, studying and functioning in rather \\"old fashioned\\" ways. Some have even complained of the overtly religious overtones. I personally though it was a wonderful story of four young girls learning each in their own way - that life can be hard, life can be heartbreaking, death is very real, but then so is love, friendship and joy. Some argue that Mrs. March is an unattainable visiage of a \\"perfect mother\\" however I argue that we see her only through her daughters' eyes - and that every mother is on a pedestal in the eyes of their daughters. We don't know if the moments when she is out of site, she is sobbing at her loneliness or having bouts of internal rage at the behavior of her children. She simply projects and outward calm, which most mothers attempt to keep in front of their children.There is a certain beauty to this story, each of the girls has their own personal battle to fight within themselves and we watch as they find ways to overcome, either their envy, their vanity, their selfishness - some turn to friendship, others to prayer. I have to admit that I too had hoped for the ending that my little son wanted - even though I knew it was silly to wish for two young people to end up together, but who knows what the future holds for them after the last page of the book.The simple fact that a little seven year old ADHD boy was able to love and care about the people in this story, and to have hopes for them - shows the power of the writing contained within. I highly recommend this book - even to those who are not into \\"romance\\" or \\"period literature.\\""},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little Women is a story about four sisters who live with their mother. I thought it was a great story because it is really easy to figure out what they are doing in a jiff. The best part of this book is that it shows the characters have feelings and emotions that are throughtout the whole story. The story explains to me what it was like to live back in the older days. Yet to me this book seems new. If I could say who represents me most,it is Jo. Jo is a great reader and it comes in handy when she meets a boy named Laurie. Laurie is a rich kid who ends up being like family to these sisters. This story really reminds of how life is sometimes. Will you find out what happens to these sisters? Read Little Women and get into the story. I think the best rating for this book is four and a half stars. It needed a little more happiness towards the end. But still take the risk and read Little Women."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I bought this book as a gift to impress the receiver.

It looked to me then that it was a girlie book, but I still enjoyed it very much. I think I read it twice. Although the story is very sentimental and it has many morals, it is an extraordinary portrait of life in Northeast US during and after the Civil War. It was still very much a protestant, puritanical society, starting to modernize but still very provincial. The characters are well-rounded, alive and real, and the stories are amusing. It has no specific plot. It is the story of the March family, and it starts when the father is away, fighting on the North's side. The Marches are a respectable and educated family, but they're not wealthy, so the book depicts the troubles and efforts of the four girls, their little successes and disappointments. If you like the first part, you will also like the other three novels, although this is the best."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"little women was one of the best books ive read. the girls meg, jo, beth, and amy all have their own personallity which add to the humor and the saddness of the book. laurie( thier next door neighbor and jo's best friend) is a wonderful, giving guy who is trying to win the heart of one of the sisters but you will have to read the book to find out which one. overall i give it five stars."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"&quot;Little Women&quot; was one of the best books I have ever read, and I am no stanger to the literary world, not to mention Victorian-era classics such as this. Never have I read a book that better deserved the title, &quot;classic.&quot;This is the moving story of the 4 March sisters, each strong in their own accounts and weak in others. It shows us their trials in life and leaves us with a sense of belonging to their world.I think that this book is more important now than ever, because of the strong feminist attitude expressed by the family as a whole. Though the recent film treatment of the book is probably the definitive screen treatment, it could never capture the sense of beauty that the book did, or develop the characters as well.I was only 15 when I read this book, but I consider it to be one of my all-time favorites even still.I would not recommend this book to ANYONE, but anyone with an appetite to learn and an appreciation for life in general (or lack thereof) should find this book a reminder that despite wealth, poverty, sadness, happiness, death, and all other aspects of life that may separate us, we are all human, and the one thing that keeps us us together is love. -Ben, age 16"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I'm 52 years old and remember well reading this as a kid, and loving it.

I've read other editions of Little Women and don't remember the word don't being used so poorly throughout the novel as it was in this edition.

Precisely why I decided to pick it up again at age 24 is unknown to me, but the reread was well worth it.Alcott tells the story of the four March sisters--Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy--as they grow into young women. Each girl has her faults, and they struggle to overcome them. They also must face the consequences of the family's poverty as well as separation from their father, who is serving with the Union Army during the Civil War. The book is told in episodic fashion, with many chapters acting almost as short stories complete with crisis and resolution. The sisters act appropriately for their time as well as display the sibling rivalries and affection present in most families.Reading Little Women as an adult, I realized just how moralizing it is. The March girls learn important lessons from nearly every event in the book. Beth is elevated to near-sainthood even before she becomes ill. But, other than the preaching, I found Little Women to be a thoroughly enjoyable read. I might just pick up Little Men again one of these days."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I like the book Little Women because it tought me I dont need money to be happy.

The story revolves around the home life of four close sisters and two strong, moral parents. As Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy grow up, their adventures and mishaps provide examples for any reader of all ages. As they grow up, they struggle with many ideas. First, they are constantly troubled by the necessity of being good, even when they want to be bad. Second, as they grow up, they confront different types of relationships with boys. Friendship turns into love and vice versa, making a strong theme of gender relations. The girls also struggle with the ideas of motherhood, sisterhood, pride, education, and marraige. Finally, two of the most important ideas in the novel are dreams and work. The girls spend their childhoods and adult lives trying to balance the two and fulfill both necessities. Also, throughout the book, society is explained, the harsh winters are described, and the profound work ethic of the people is portrayed to give the reader a strong sense of what it was like to be living during the 19th century. The book gives the reader some mportant guidance to people in similar circumstances in their adolescent years. The novel motivates positive decision making, looks past materialism, teaches morales, and shows us the importance of real happiness."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This hardbound book by Louisa May Alcott is a MUST for anyone wanting a truly \\"good\\" book for their child or themselves to read.

First of all, there's the wonderful story of the March family in the years during and after the Civil War, as the 4 daughters -- Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy -- grow to womanhood, experiencing joy and overcoming obstacles and tragedy. This edition stays true to the language and grammar used in the original. I have read versions of the novel in which the girls' grammar is cleaned up for them!In addition, the introduction by Susan Cheever is first-rate; it is neither too long or too short, and she beautifully ties it to her own experience without being cloying.Another reason why I so highly recommend this edition is because there is a glossary at the back to explain some of the obscure (to modern readers) terms and obsolete slang. Also, there's a nice essay/review by G.K. Chesterson, who warmly praises Alcott's book."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"The book Little Women is a heart-warming story. It is one I would read more than once. I dont see how anyone could not like it,exept maybe boys. I chose it because I had seen the movie and i heard that the book was one you can't go your life without reading,so I went to my school library and checked it out.This book is about four sisters growing up during the 1800's. They are faced with many challenges they must overcome. These things bring them closer and closer. During the war their father must leave for war as a chaplain. While he is there he gets injured and Marmee (the girls mother) has to go take care of him. The girls must help there mother out by taking care of themselves. The girls have to deal with many other things such as losing people they love, getting married,saying goodbye, and falling in love.My favorite character was Marmee I liked her because she was so loving and hardworking. Through the many difficult trials in life she remained strong. When I grow up I hope I can be like that,I don't want to tell you anymore i want to let you read the other things yourself. I hope you don't have anywhere to be because once you start reading this book you can't put it down.

It is the story of a family of four girls, Meg, Jo, Beth, Amy, their friend Laurie, and their search for their &quot;castles in the air.&quot; The girls go through life trying to follow the example of their good and generous parents. They correct their faults by listening to, learning from, and teaching each other and the people around them. Each person chooses a different path to try and get their wishes or &quot;castles in the air,&quot; as the four March girls call them. The eldest sister, Meg, wishes for first a house full of luxurious things and a lot of money. She then also would like a good husband and healthy children. By the end of part one of the book, Meg is well on her way to getting her wish. However, her priorities seem to switch places. Beth is the &quot;pet&quot; of the family and she deserves it. She is a shy, sweet girl who only opens up to those she trusts. She is the third child and is very attatched to her older sister Jo. Beth's castle in the air is only to live quietly and to take care of those around her. God grants her wish.Amy is the youngest March sister. She has artistic talent and so understandably her wish is to be an artist. Amy tries her best to improve herself and be a lady of society. Her hard work and good sense reward her in the end. Jo is the second eldest sister and the most unique. She doesn't care what others think, except for her family and a few special friends. Jo is stubborn, quick-tempered, and blunt. However, she is also kind, forgiving, and full of passion. She learns her lessons the hard way, but tries to catch others and save them the fall. Jo's dream is to support herself and her family by doing what she loves best, writing.Laurie, or Teddy as Jo calls him, is the neighbor and life long friend. The girls, especially Jo, teach him to get over his bashfulness and help him to grow into a fine young man. He struggles, but this is a hopeful book, and he wins his battle. He also wishes to love and be loved by one of the March sisters. All of the charachters do end up getting their castles in the air. It is very enjoyable to read how their wishes change throughout the book. Little Women is a fantastic novel. It is full of smart lessons and important morals. I especially enjoy how the story tells the difference between loving someone and being in love with someone. I like how the book is hopeful and am inspired to try and correct my faults and go out in search for my own &quot;castles in the air.&quot;"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I was in the middle of Meg and John's first real dinner together since their babies were born and all of a sudden the story switched to Laurie and Amy. Pages 383-430 were missing from my book! Quite a disappointment. I would recommend a better quality book from a publisher who won't leave out 47 pages."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"What's not to like about the March girls? I read this when I was too young to appreciate it and have read it over and over again all my life. The heart of America. Buy it. Keep it. Treasure it."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"If I could give it 10 stars, I would. As someone who never had a sister, I closed this book wishing dearly that I had. Following the trials of the four March sisters was something that I didn't want to stop when the book ended. It was overall, a book of good will and good nature, full of people who are struggling to find themselves and ending up in places they never quite suspected by the end. But what I found most astonishing about Alcott's characters was how I found a little bit of myself in each one.What I found most fascinating was the culture of the mid-1800s- learning what was proper and not proper, and being astonished at just how much women's roles have changed since then.The book is a very quick and easy read, perfect for young people and adults alike. I was literally absorbed into this story, much like I was with the movie version starring Winona Ryder that was so perfectly cast and faithful to the book, I should hope that all filmmakers are as kind to the literature on which they are based.I highly, HIGHLY recommend Little Women!"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This story takes place mostly at the March's house and the Laurence house which is important because it gives the reader an idea of how the each live and helps the reader understand them better.This book is mostly about four sisters named Margaret, Josephine, Elizabeth and Amy March,their mother Marmee March, Theodore Laurence, Mr. Laurence, they are always helping each other and others in need and are happy the way they are and will always be friends, are always thoughtful, truthful, and use manners even when talking to each other and others and even though they have very few money they still enjoy their lives and Mr.Laurence enjoys the company of them at his house, even though the Laurence's are wealthy the girls him and his grandson the same way they treat each other with respect and tells about their lives.In my opinion this is the best book I've Ever read ! I think this is an educational book because it teaches that money isn't everything that's better to be happy the way you are and you don't need money to be happy and you can be happy by helping people and that you should respect elders and others.I would recommend this book because it's educational and a good book to read when bored or just want to read a book or read an interesting book."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I've read this book several times and it just gets better and better.

As a nearly 50-year-old woman, I thought I would find it childish and boring, but instead I was in turns fascinated, intrigued and charmed. Accounts of everyday life as lived in the time of the Civil War in Concord, Massachusetts were every bit as fascinating as Pride and Prejudice. In particular, it was intriguing to hear how women spent their time forever mending clothes, cooking and cleaning. The explanations of how young women were expected to act toward the opposite sex were interesting, too. I also caught glimpses of myself, very young, reading the book for the first time. There were actually passages that I distinctly remember reading, for instance, I know I identified completely with Jo, who preferred to spend her time reading and writing, didn't want to cut her hair, and who wanted to simply be \\"one of the boys.\\" This is one novel I will be passing along to my two young nieces, as a piece of Americana that will never go out of style."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I bought this book for my girls and we all love it!!Hours of good reading.

As each of them wants to persue a different goal in life the love and loyalty keeps them together. A book that is worth reading even though its so long!"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"The first part of &quot;Little Women&quot; is an innocent portrait of girlhood (at a time when 16-year-olds, could still be girls without any hurry to grow up). Each March girl has her own burden to carry, trial to overcome, and castle in the air to wish and work for. Meg has to keep her head from being turned by rich friends who dress her up in their finery at their &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; and make her feel ashamed for coming from a poor family. Beth has to overcome her fear of crotchety Mr. Laurence so that she may enter the &quot;Palace Beautiful.&quot; Amy has to pass through the &quot;Valley of Humiliation,&quot; and learn to humbly admit her wrong. Jo has to subdue &quot;Apollyon&quot; (the &quot;Dark Angel&quot; in abridged versions), swallow her pride and learn to forgive and forget the destruction of her most prized possession.Of course, every step of the way, Marmee gives counsel, comfort and encouragement; and their neighbor Laurie adds fun and mischief like only a boy--and an honorary brother--can.Louisa May Alcott constantly alludes to &quot;The Pilgrim's Progress&quot; by John Bunyan. She also has an entire chapter that sees the March girls impersonate characters in a Charles Dickens novel. Yet none of this is above the heads of young readers, who can take each episode in the March girls' play in stride. Children's fun is universally understood.I am never tired of rereading this part.The second half of the novel (which is actually &quot;Good Wives&quot;, the sequel of the original &quot;Little Women&quot;) is very different. More serious, it shows the girls growing up and getting married--or passing on to another world. If Book 1 told stories of the golden morning and afternoon of childhood, Book 2 has stories of the dark night of maturity. Despite its funny and light-hearted parts, the bittersweet thought that childhood is now far away lingers in the air. (After Book 2, &quot;Little Men&quot; was a relief--proof that the sun always rises on the next generation of children.)There are few classics I consider as timeless as Louisa May Alcott's novels about the March family."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Hi I;m Amanda. In 1999...my grandma said I'd enjoy the book Little Women. Did I ever! It's my favorite book in the world. It's about a loving family, with four girls.

The story is about 4 girls growing up with their mom. Their father is not there because he is at war. Their names are Joe( main character) Amy, Beth, and Meg. Beth struggles from a disease and is usually not well, so her family must care for her when she is in need. Joe, the main character wants to be a writer but must put that a side when her sister is sick. Amy is the youngest, she trys to help Beth but is sent away because they fear she will get sick also.

Once he sent a carriage to transfer the girls mom to their father because he is ill. Lorie ends up marrying one of the girls, but I won't tell you who. This book is one of the best books that I have read. So I suggest you read it."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"While this book is often relegated to \\"girl's fiction\\", Little Women should be read by anyone interested in American literature and history. Little Women is based on Alcott's life at home with her sisters, mother and father, but is in no way a biography. She transforms personal disappointment and loss into a story of close family love, personal growth, moral duty and fulfillment.The writing is humorous, sentimental, a bit moralistic (which was the style at the time--the height of the religious revival in America.) The characters are true--because they were taken from Louisa's own sisters and parents. \\"Laurie\\" may be David Thoreau, a neighbor for whom Alcott may have had an unrequited love.This is one of my favorite novels. I loved it as a child and I love it still."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This is my favorites. This book is about four sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy. These sisters are very differnt. Meg, who dreams of having a husband and a family. Jo, who is a tomboy and who dreams of being a published writer. Beth, who is nice and sweet and loves to play the piano. Amy, who is vain and a good artist. Everytime I read this book, I cry. If you have or do read this book you know why. A very touching story."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This is a really great book! If you haven't read it yet, READ IT TODAY!!! It's a great book that reads all too quickly. It's very strongly emotioned,so just about the only people I wouldn't recommend it to are people who are ashamed to cry! Other than that,I think it's the perfect book for anyone above the fourth grade level!!! It's got all the ups and downs of a great roller coaster;except sometimes the cars collide on this roller coaster, and you don't know whether to laugh hysterically, or to ball your eyes out! Among other things, I loved the characters! They were very well written and easy to relate to. The best thing about this book (to me, anyway)is that it's about life. It's about how it feels to grow up, to be a woman, and to deal with more hardships than I can count! It's better than any soap opera or movie, so what are you doing just sitting there on your computer?!? Log off, shut down and read!!!"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"MAY17,2001YES, I HAVE READ lITTLE WOMEN.

It is one of the most wonderful books of it's times."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This book is great! I love it and would even say that it is my favorite book. It is a charming story about 4 sisters, Meg (Margaret), Jo (Josephine), Beth( Elisabeth), and Amy. The book includes the truth about real life. It's not perfect and the author, Louisa May Alcott, understands that and therefore includes some tribulations throughout the lives of these charming girls. The book is set around the 1800s and includes all the prides,joys, fashions and styles of this time. I recomend that you read it.

Really lovely!!!!"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This is a heartwarming tale of four sisters growing up in their mother's house in (I believe) New England. We follow the girls through their teens and into marriage and (in some cases) motherhood. Obviously intended mainly for young women, this is not a book to buy for your brother or boyfriend. It is, however, a fascinating look at life in another era, before everything got complicated. I was just as devastated as any of the characters were when tragedy struck. This novel is followed by Little Men, in which Jo and her new husband open a home for runaway boys, and Good Wives, in which the sisters are all grown up and married. You won't regret taking a trip back in time and watching the girls fall in love, lean on each other and learn what life is about"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"It was such a pleasure to meet the sisters as they were created by the aurthor. At first you feel like it was written to teach young girls their morals, but it is so much more. Ms Alcott's reflections on relationships still hold true today.

In fact, it actually helps you to get closer to the era."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I read this book when I was a little girl and I love it as much now as I did then.

This is a definite must read!"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"A timeless tale that has a special place in all of our hearts, Little Women. The magical story of four girls having adventures while they lay in wait for their father to come home from the Civil War. In this tale, Meg, the eldest, marries Mr. John Brooke, Teddy's tutor, and has the life she always wanted, like her mother. Meg moved down he road from her family, and had twins, Demijohn and Daisy, becoming the model mother she always wanted to be. After Jo had \\"scorned\\" Teddy's love for her, Teddy went off to Europe to sulk. Around that time, Beth was getting weaker. With all this stress, Jo went away to New York. There, she met Professor Bhaer. She fell in love with him as he helped her to cultivate her writings, helping her to write a book based on her childhood. He promised her that he would help her get it published. Beth was getting sicker and sicker, so Jo went home to help Beth. Beth died in Jo's arms. Professor Bhaer came to the March's doorstep to give Jo her published book. He asked Jo to marry him, she said yes. When Aunt March died, Jo inherited her plantation. She realized, I love boys, why not fill this house with boys that she would grow to love. So the plantation became \\"Jo's School for boys.\\" The rooms were filled with the boys that she loved very much. Amy went abroad with Aunt March to help cultivate her art. There she met the crabby, snobbish, horrid side of Teddy that had come out because of Jo's answer. The more time they spent together in Europe, the more time they got to grow to love each other. They were married in Europe and Amy got the wealth and prominence she longed for as a child. This book is a wonderful tale for all. We all should read this book in our life. It belongs in our lives.This book had very detailed characters. Teddy is so detailed in the book, and you can actually hear them talking and his point of view on things. When Teddy got in a fight with Mr. Laurence, his grandfather, about going to college, he was so mad that when Jo meekly knocked on his door, he fired a mean insult and threatened to hurt his grandfather if he knocked one more time. Amy, at times, can be very nice in the story, but other times she was lying to make herself seem bigger than she was, and would even the score pretty well. When Jo, Teddy, Meg, and John Brooke went to the theater, Amy begged and pleaded to go, but Jo was firm, when she said no, she meant no. As they were leaving, Amy yelled at the top of her lungs to Jo, and said, I will get you back! (Not the exact words) When they came back from the theater, Jo wanted to write, but she could not find her book. She asked around, and then saw Amy watching the fire burn her book! Jo started yelling that she hated her and never wanted to talk to Amy ever again. Amy never even said she was sorry. Jo gets very fired up when something bad happens to one of her friends or family. When Amy was in school, she got in trouble, and the teacher struck her hand, and she had to stand up in front of the whole class, humiliated. When Jo heard about this, she was yelling, writing nasty letters, and was thinking about go down there and giving that teacher a piece of his mind.This story was very realistic. When Meg received John Brooke's invitation to wed, she refuses. Again and again, John asks, but she still says no. Rich, snobby Aunt March \\"overhears\\" and commends Meg for making such a decision, because John is dirt poor and money is one of the things that makes marriage run smoothly. Meg is appalled that Aunt March would say that. Aunt March also said that if she didn't marry in wealth, she would be cut out of her will. Meg tells Aunt March off, and tells her that John is a kind; caring, man and He would love her whether she was dirt poor or a princess. Then she realizes that she does love John, and she accepts the invitation to wed. Jo was asked to wed by Teddy, but she said no. The reason she said no was because they would always fight, like they did, with both of their tempers, they would never have a calm, cool, and collected argument, and they would never be really happy. Of course, Teddy did not understand at the time, but what Jo was trying to say was that she didn't want to be trapped in an unhappy marriage. Lastly, when Professor Bhaer proposed to Jo, He told her that his hands were empty. That meant that he would not have any money and could never buy the things that she would like. She replied, that his hands weren't empty anymore, and then she put her hands in his. This meant that she didn't care whether he had money or not, as long as he loved her, for she never cared about money, social status, or new clothes. She just loved Professor Bhaer.This book was very long. I loved this book, but she kept explaining every single little detail. When Beth died, she didn't just die, she died with an expression on her face. An expression that showed that she was content and ready to die, because she knew that there was nothing that the doctor could do. An expression that sent Jo into crying uncontrollably when Jo died. An expression to make Hannah, the Marches \\"live in cook\\", into sobbing while she was cooking, and saying \\"Too young, she was too young. She had so much strength left. See what I mean? When Amy burned Jo's book she was writing, Jo kept thinking about it, which made her even madder. When Jo and Teddy went ice staking on the pond, Amy came, but Jo and Teddy ignored her. Then, Amy fell under the ice. After that, Jo beat herself up over being mean to Amy, she even thought about either running away, or being Amy's eternal servant. When Jo was apologizing to Amy, tears were flowing and flowing down her face, and, one half of the chapter was about Jo regretting ever being mad at her. During the book, Demi, Meg's son, would get out of the bed during the night to be with his mother. John would not allow this, so every time he got up, John would take him back to his room, talk to him about why he should not get up and pop his bottom. This would go on for pages and pages without any progress. Finally, he stopped.This book is for everybody. I suggest for those to have the patience to read a book this long, I quite enjoyed it for it was a challenge; to read it and meditate on the lessons it shows usB. Rimando"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I have a very special place in my heart for this book, & not only because I really learned to LOVE reading as I enjoyed this book for the first time, but also because of its characters & heart-warming story. It truly is a coming of age tale of the March sisters & their unbreakable bond through all of the tough times that life places before us.In my opinion, this book was very relateable with situations that many of us as readers have encountered. For me, it was very nice to see such a close-knit family who loves each other so much, as opposed to the broken family homes turning up in novels so often today. (And don't get me wrong, I know how important it is to portray the 'broken' homes too-I come from one myself.)Another reason why I loved this book was because of the warm & endearing bond that the March sisters shared. I never had a sister & having the chance to peek into such a relationship between these sisters was very much so enjoyable for me.This novel is well-written & has obviously withstood the test of time for it is just as well-loved now as it was five, ten, or twenty years ago!"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"When i was sixteen, my favorite book in the world was little women. i identified very much with jo march, a tomboyish girl who loves to read, go for \\"larks\\" with her best friend (the neighbor, a boy named laurie), has a short temper and dreams of one day becoming a published author.i longed for the companionship jo had with her three sisters, the short \\"romance\\" and the longterm firendship she had with laurie, her sucess as a writer, and finally, her romance with the german, Professor Bhear.this book is comical, witty, and has a wonder and warm sense of family life for those of us who hunger and thirst for love and belonging."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This book is a classic favorite, especially for girls from the age of about 11-14 (depending of the reading level of the girl). Its made all the better for this age set because there are sequels- \\"Little Men\\" and \\"Jo's Boys\\" which continue the saga of the March sisters. The lives of these girls is related in an exciting way- sometimes gently moralizing (19th century middle class Protestant Christian values), sometimes sad, sometimes innocently romantic. The book is a good gift for any young girl who likes historical fiction, and has always been a treasured hand-me down in our family."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I first read this book when I was 29 years old, and I was really quite amazed. I was inspired to pick it up after seeing the opera \\"Little Women\\" by Mark Adamo, and I have to say that the book is really quite a lot better (and different, to my way of thinking) than the opera.Rather than being a ponderous, dull book, this was actually quite a good read. It's straightforward, making it accessible to kids, but it held my interest as well. There's not really a single well-defined plot, but rather a series of episodes in the characters' lives over several years, with a few common threads running through them.This is the type of book I would like my children to read someday (boys or girls!). Besides the obvious emphasis on family life, a very important underlying theme is an emphasis on virtue. In each \\"episode\\", the girls (and the boys too) learn something, \\"build character\\", or increase in virtue in some way, and the lessons they learn carry through the rest of the book. I found that incredibly refreshing in our post-modern age! (Contrast with the common notion today that \\"personality\\" is a rather privileged, self-defined thing, and challenges or obstacles must be negotiated so that the character can basically maintain his or her own unique identity, warts and all). Also an important theme in the book is finding our role in service to others - that we do not live simply according to our own whims and fancies. Sometimes we have duties in life that may seem unpleasant, but it is in the performance of said duties that we find fulfillment.*spoiler warning*Another common theme that I see running through this is that, through their marriages, each of the characters is given the opportunity to become a better person. So while we might wonder wistfully at what may have been with Laurie that Jo, in the end it is Amy that allows Laurie to grow into a virtuous and responsible man, and the Professor that allows Jo to move beyond her own self-interest. Similarly, Meg and John have a positive effect on each other, despite various trials.Perhaps this all sounds very old fashioned. The book is very clearly grounded in 19th Century Christian values. But a look at this book suggests that such notions are still very relevant today!"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"My God-mother gave me this book. After chapter one, I was hooked, but since I'm not usually into the \\"classics\\", I was quite surprised at how much I liked it. I read this book in about 3 or 4 days. It's a must read.

I read it in my 20s and enjoyed it as much inn my 40s. Rarely do I reread any books, but L.W. is timeless annd a wonderful escape from modern daily life. Each character is unique and special and believable.Each entertwined story is as interesting as the next, you truly don't wish the story to end.Again, if you've never read a 19th century classic before, Little Women will grab and hold you throughout the entire book.L.W. is appropriate for all ages and especially &#34;tweens&#34; may receive a positive lesson in ambitions and decorum by enjkoying the way life was for their ancestors 150 years ago.This is an all-aroud 5-Star book any age girl won't want to put down.."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I loved that each of these characters had faults, recognized them and worked through the entire novel to grow and essentially conquer those faults.

It's still the fiesty, independent Jo I admired, so I enjoyed reading this version. There were some formatting issues, such as many paragraphs being completely indented, but that's formatting, not content."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little Women is the first novel by Louisa May Alcott, written in 1868, and the first of the Little Women series. The story involves the four March sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy, their mother, Marmee, their neighbour, Laurie and his tutor, Mr Brooke, and is set at the time of the Civil War. Their father, Mr March, is away ministering at the war and his absence looms large for the family, whose circumstances are much reduced due to an unwise investment some years ago. Mrs March works dispensing charity to the poor and those affected by the war and does her best to hold together her family; sixteen-year-old Meg, who remembers how is was when they were better off and loves fine things, works as a governess, teaching the King girls; fifteen-year-old Jo, a budding writer, is employed as a companion for the formidable Aunt March; shy, thirteen-year-old Beth, the musical sister, helps at home while eleven-year-old wilful Amy, whose vocation is art, attends school. While the first chapter introduces a family that seem sickeningly good, each character soon enough becomes human, flawed and likeable for their individual faults and charms. As the war, penury and scarlet fever impact on their lives, each of the March girls has her own trials, faces challenges, learns lessons about vanity, selfishness, anger, change and love from the events of life and matures during the course of the twelve months over which the novel is set. The lessons may seem simplistic, but perhaps these were simpler times. After some time ago reading March, the excellent novel by Geraldine Brooks about the absent March father, I resolved to reread this novel. With only the vaguest of memories of the last reading, the plot and characters seemed relatively fresh. This very enjoyable and thought-provoking read now spurs me on to read Good Wives, and back to reread March."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I was skeptical about reading such a feminine book but after a few chapters I was hooked. The characters have such depth and they bare all their trouble with a kind of strength that you'd never expect from young women. All the girls are tremendously well developed, and the story touches on nearly every vice and nearly ever virtue.It's a tremendous story of love and growth that I would recommend to any one. The relationships between characters are complicated and multifaceted: making the girls seem so real you'd expect to meet them on the street."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This was one of my favorite novels as a child. I just recently read it again and it was still a wonderful and entertaining book. It is still one of my favorites!"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Okay, so I know it published in 2 parts. This book all to books together. P.S. watch the movie after. (read it for 5th grade)"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"They did a great job formatting this classic! It reads easily, there are no typos that I have found yet and of course the book itself is... well... a classic! The story is one of a kind. One of those stories you can read over and over again."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I really liked Little Women... the only problem was that in some parts the book got a little boring and wordy. I read this book as a school assignment, and had to read it in one week. I'm eleven, so it wasn't too hard to finish it before the due date ,but it was really good, and some of the parts in the book made it worth it. I liked Jo the best because she was really tomboyish, which was nice and different from all the other characters. For all of the people who read Little Women I recommend reading The Diary of Anne Frank, because it.... well, actually it doesn't really have to do with Little Women at all. I guess it's just a really good book. The part I liked most in Little Women was when, at the end, everyone got married and was happy! Well, almost everyone. Beth didn't."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I read Little Women as a girl and loved it so I was excited to have the opportunity to review an audio production of the book. However, I was quite surprised when the audio book abruptly ended in the middle of the story. I discovered that Little Women was originally two volumes: Little Women and Good Wives. They were first published together as one book titled Little Women in 1880. Most versions of Little Women published today are both volumes together in one book. This audio recording is just the first volume. Because what most people read as Little Women is actually both volumes, I feel like there should have been some indication on the box somewhere that this audio book does not include the second volume.(I don't want to spoil it for anyone who may not have read it yet so I'll say this - remember the Friends episode when Rachel convinces Joey to read Little Women? And he has to put the book in the freezer because of one particularly sad part? This audiobook ends before that sad part happens.)Even though this book was written more than one-hundred years ago, it still has relevance today. I think that the four March girls and Marmee have some good lessons to teach young girls that are timeless. Reading it now as a mother myself, I marveled at Marmee's patience and wisdom. I could learn a lot from her! I was very impressed at how independent and free-thinking the girls and their mother were given the time period the book was written in and took place. (Of course, Louisa May Alcott was a Unitarian so I shouldn't have been surprised at that.)Lorelei King narrated this audio book. I thought she did a great job for the most part. The two voices I didn't like were Beth and Amy's. I thought Beth's was too breathy and Amy's was too babyish - they didn't sound realistic to me. Overall, I enjoyed this audio production. My biggest complaint is that it left unexpectedly hanging at the end."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"A classic I always enjoy reading. Such an endearing story. Timeless characters that you love to come visit again and again."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This book had such an impact on me as a kid, it was fun to re-read it. I love the Jo character and really identify with her. I think it's interesting that even though it was set in the past, the concerns of the girls are very similar to those of people today. While each person wanted something different in life, they were all things I could identify with. It may be a classic, but the writing is still easy to read in current times. It moves quickly and I can see why it continues to be popular. If you haven't read this one, read it!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The way the sisters lives turned out was way different than they thought but they still lives happily."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"A very early reader, I received a copy of \\"Little Women\\" at age 7. From the very first time I read this lovely book, I fancied myself as Jo, and so thoroughly identified with her that even through all the succeeding decades and thousands of other books read, this book will remain one of my top five favourite books because of her. I read and reread this book sitting in a big apple tree in my parent's back yard, laying on the grass on a summer's day, and under the sheets with a flashlight I now suspect my parents knew I had stashed under my bed.In an age of easily digested and mass-produced books with weak characters and plot, \\"Little Women\\" is a stand-out that resists the passage of time for its exemplary characters, theme of family unity, and love on so many different levels (friendship, familial, true love, and romantic love).Readers today might find the writing and occasional chirpiness of the March sisters when faced with their poverty a bit difficult to relate to, but knowing stories of how my own mother and sisters faced the Depression and then WWII in the UK made me realise from an early age that trying to find things to rejoice in is essential to surviving tragedy and loss on a personal level.The March sisters encapsulate female society in most countries even now, and are well-written individual characters, each with a different goal they wish to fulfil in life. The girls do not become career women, and their parents do preach the importance of family life and sacrifice, however, each one does what was expected of young girls at that time. Jo's daring in writing a sensationalist \\"man's\\" story and insisting on payment commensurate with a man was unheard of in those days and when one considers that women are still underpaid, it makes Jo's triumph still relative today. Amy's goal of being comfortably well-off is eventually tempered by her own personal sorrow at the poor health of her own little Beth, Meg wants to be a mother and wife, and she learns not to overachieve, and Beth who overcomes pathological shyness through her altruism and empathy for others and which leads to her death is still inspirational today.My suggestion is that if you have a daughter, sister, granddaughter or friend, take turns reading it. It will improve your vocabulary, make you smile, and dear Beth's stoicism will bring a tear to your eye."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little Women was one of my favorite books as a young adult.

It was sad and happy ,and very funny I think that it was a well written book"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"The story Little Women by Louisa May Alcott, is a wonderful and amusing story about a family, mainly four sisters learning as they grow. Together they have many good and bad experiences, but all of them they will never forget. It is perfect for young adults, especially &quot;Little Women&quot; who are growing up, because of the experiences it deals with. With every turn of the page, there is a new adventure to be found. The book is so brilliantly put together that you won't even want to put it down. There are new situations and lessons to be learned after each chapter. The story relates it's situations to some that actually happen in everyday life. For example, the way Amy wants to look perfect all the time, and the way Jo acts like a tomboy. Through all the obstacles in the girls' lives, they always stick together working everything out, and never giving up. This story is a perfect example of how family's should love each other and not give up on anything."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"In the senior class of the &quot;Great Books&quot; program at the college I attended, one of the weekly speakers asked how many of the women had read Little Women. Nearly all of the women in the class raised their hands. Then she asked how many men had read it. One man raised his hand - the chair of the English department! That was when I decided to read this book, and it has become one of my all-time favorites! I would recommend this book to everyone - men and women, young or old."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I loved the book. I thought that Louisa May Alcott did anoutstanding job describing Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. I likedthe book also because it described a family in poverty, andshowed the whole picture, not just the good nor just the bad.I loved the book because all four of the girls get to go fromyoung ladies to women, and they all are allowed to marryfor love, and they're not forced to marry. I cried at the partwhere Beth died of Scarlet Fever. But other than that sadpart the rest of the book was great"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \\"Little Women\\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature. Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. Louisa May Alcott's best-known novel is a magnificent achievement."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"It takes a real man, who is secure in his manhood, to admit to reading a book like Little Women. I am such a man. A few months ago I read Pride and Prejudice, although to be fully honest, the reason I read it was so that I'd appreciate Pride & Prejudice and Zombies more. There are certain books that I feel should be read by everyone. This is one of them. It's classic literature and has stood the test of time.That being said, I can't say that I particularly enjoyed reading it. Was I on the edge of my seat wondering if Meg would learn how to make fresh jam or not to spend her husband's earnings on frivolous things? No. Did I cry when Beth was on death's doorstep with Scarlet Fever? Not quite. Was my heart warmed when Jo sold her hair to help with the family's finances while their dad was away at war? Please. Nevertheless, it's an excellently written book. I can see why it's considered a classic. But before I'd be able to read another book like this, say Jane Eyre or something, I'd need to read 25 or so books for pleasure."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"The book starts out with four teenagers, tells the story of them growing, until the four girls become little women. The four girls have very different personalities. While they are growing, many things happen to them. Here are four explanations of the four little women:The oldest and probally the most important to talk about is Meg. She loves to play with her sisters and to take care of them. She gets married (first) to Mr. Brooke the tudor.The second oldest is one year younger than Meg, named Josephine. She is a tomboy whom is a very great author. She is feircly independant, and likes people to call her 'Jo'.The second youngest is Beth. She is a little girl with a very shy personality, and loves music. (By the way, I was suprised of the fate to one of the girls...)The most young of the children is Amy. She is a very selfish, prissy, bossy, and artistic. She is the third person who marries, and she marrys \\"the Laurence boy\\". She complains to many people that her nose is flat."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"You know the story. If you don't, many of these other reviewers have done the job for me. For me, this is my most favorite book in all of American literature. Growing up, I had a friend who was just like Beth and everytime I re-read this book, I remember my childhood adventures with Beth. The fictional Beth in \\"Little Women\\" was as much of a friend as my other friend, too.I cannot recommend this book enough. If you haven't read it -- you must read it."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little Women is, to put it simply, an great book. Any young woman with the slightest interest in reading would certainly be able to identify with at least one of the four unique sisters, and as I child I was fascinated by the predicaments and adventures of their lives- and convinced that I was in love with Laurie, their charming yet complex \\"boy next door.\\" This story has not lost its charm because of its powerful illustration of female (obviously, sisterly in particular) relationships, as Alcott emphasizes their commitment to each other even as they grow in separate directions and face adversity. There's a reason why it became a classic...don't pass it up."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"If recommending a classic novel to someone who wants to read examples of good writing, no recommendation would be complete without the addition of Little Women, and the four March sisters; Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. It is a story about the devotion of these four young sisters to each other, to their family, and to their friends. No matter what the age, all of us must learn to endure the obstacles that life will throw us. So it is in this story. Although originally written in 1898, this novel transcends time. Alcott weaves the story of these sisters as they search for love, security, peace, and happiness. \\"Christmas won't be Christmas without any presents,\\" grumbled Jo, lying on the rug. So begins this richly written story. Even if you have seen the movie, do try reading this beautiful classic. Perhaps we can learn a thing or two from a classic writer.It transcends all time. It doesn't matter if the time frame is the late 1800's; good writing is good writing, which should lead to good reading. Louisa May Alcott was so ahead of her time in writing about spirited, independent women in a time when it was not fashionable to be so. If you liked this book, you may want to refer to other books by Alcott, but I still believe this is by far her best."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little women is a book for all ages. I have read this book numerous times and highly recommend it. It was the first book I bought my 8 year old daughter to read. That was two years ago, and she has read it twice. Its a great book to share with young girls. It has mystery and romance on a level that young girls can understand and women can relate to."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This book is a very interesting, realistic story. The different situations that these four girls go through are both heartwarming, sad, and interesting. I recommend that every person should read this book."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little Women was an amazing book that pretty much kept me reading the entire time. I was first attracted to the book because of the obvious factor: the youngest and most rebellious had the same name as me! I first read the children's edition to get the main idea of the story, then bought the original novel and read that. I was captivated by Alcott's style of writing and subtle-ness at important parts of the story so that the reader can decide for themselves what was about to or already has happened.I would suggest this book to anyone because it inspired me and I hope it will inspire somebody else."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"When it's cold outside, they huddle together. When they are sad, they are sad together. When they are poor, they work through it together. They are always there for each other. Little Women, by Louisa May Alcott was published on September 30, 1868. Even though that was over 100 years ago, it still captures the heart and attention of the majority of its readers. After their father was shipped off to war, Jo, Meg, Amy and Beth March lived with their mother, or \\"Marmee\\" as they normally called her. They lived a life together, and although they never seemed to have enough of anything, they almost always got along. They were very few moments when they didn't. The daughters are fairly creative and act out plays that Jo wrote by herself in her free time. None of them were old enough to work yet, so the family struggled together to stay together. At one point the March family was having so much financial trouble that Jo decides she has to do something for the family. She was very dedicated to keeping their family together. She must have felt that since they had so little to begin with, losing anything more would be unbearable. Jo went out and sold her beautiful long brown hair in order to earn money for the family. Back then, long hair was everything, so for her to cut it so drastically was a huge deal. Jo wants nothing more than for her family to be happy. This book doesn't really remind me of any other books. In most books, family problems and arguments are normal occurrences. However, in this book, family came first all the time. I think it should be that way, but realistically, that is not how most families work. Other books I have read are not very determined to show the bond a family maintains by spending time with each other. Also, I didn't like the way they kept their opinions to themselves during this story. I think that people are very open with their feelings, especially towards family members, but in this book they weren't. Even with the drawbacks I have mentioned about this book, I would still recommend it to everyone. It has a great storyline. I think it will make a place in your heart that will never close up."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This is the best version of Little Women that I have ever read. It is the complete and unabridged version and the reader can tell that there's a difference. The story centers around four sisters Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy who are growing up during the Civil War. Add one loving mother, Marmee, the boy next door, Laurie, his tutor, John Brooke, and Friedrich Baher, a German professor and you have the best book of all time!"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I had to read this book for a high school English project. I thought the book was very informative. Im a very picky reader and I can not read a book with boring spots, but i can assure you this book was good. I found no boring spots. I didn't wanna put the book down, event after event, it kept on coming. I encourage you to read this book whether your 14 years old or 60 years old. It teaches good moral values."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little Women by Louisa May Alcott should be read by middle schoolers because it shows great moral values. For example they respected thier mother greatly.Also when in need they helped one another. Jo sold her beautiful long locks of hair for a train ticket so her mother could visit her wounded father. Another example of maturity was when Beth knew she was dying she handled it in an adult way. The young ladies in Little Women should be called Not so Little Women because they &quot;came of age&quot; in this book."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"The book Little Women is truley a literature classic. This book reflects on the lives of the fictional March family as Yankees during the Civil War. While Mr. March is away fighting in the war, Mrs. March and her four daughters Margaret, 16, Josephine, 15, Elizabeth, 13, and Amy, 12 (Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy)must learn to cope while their nation is at war. The four girls must learn many lessons in life and grow up to be fine women even during hard times. The girls have many adventures and meet Laurie, a true friend for life,and share many good times together. The girls begin to marry when they face the loss of one of their sisters and their aunt. However, in true March fashion, they get through the difficult times and focus on the successes in life. This book is truley inspirational and makes you think about how you can become a better person through sharing the experiences of these girls. At times this book could run on, so that is why i rated it 4 stars, not 5. However, this book still is great and a timeless classic and Louisa May Alcott did a fine job with the book.

The movies don't do it justice."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This is a one beautiful book to read ,the beauty of the book is that it has so many central charecters and each one holds his and her grounds completely.Amy is a wonderful girl ,who keeps the string of happiness in the family,but its the Mrs. march who is the driving force in the book."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Alcott's novel recounting the lives of the March family is aremarkable book reflective of her own unusual upbringing (the Marchesare all modeled after her real-life family, from her artistic sister May to her scholarly father). The story is written episodically, making for ideal bedtime reading, and is filled with lessons of early feminism, transcendtal theories, and the advanced ideas of the Civil War era that Alcott absorbed from her father.I've read this book for a decade, and only recently made a trip to the Alcott house in Boston. What a wonderful way to come back to a book that shaped my life and ideas of independence."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Much to my delight I read this book after a semester of boring classes and this was the PERFECT distraction. Even as an adult (almost there anyway), I could identify with nearly all of the March sisters, moved to tears and laughter throughout the whole book. I recommend Little Women to everyone especially young girls - you will absolutely treasure this book. Another reviewer said it best - this book will make you late!"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This is one of the most touching tales ever written, a classic. It is also one of the best books, along with Leah's Way and the Red Tent, ever written about women. You know it's a great book when it can still be read with the same joy that has thrilled readers for decades and decades. This book never gets old, and it will inspire future generations and generations. I wish more contemporary books strove for this kind of permanancy."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This book is just as much fun to read at the age of 33 as it is at 13. I laughed out loud and stifled sobs throughout the book as we watch the four March girls - Jo, Meg, Amy and Beth - turn from young girls to young wives. As I read, I worried that that description sounded a bit boring although it really is an entertaining book. Then it dawned on me that, as each chapter is a small vignette from the progress of their lives, this is a lot like watching Little House on the Prairie. This would be an exceptional book to read to children and is quite enjoyable for women of all ages to read for themselves.It was a bit of a blow when reading the afterword to find that Louisa Alcott did not like the book. She had been pressured into writing it by her publisher and regarded it as \\"moral pap for the young\\", calling the first part \\"The Pathetic Family\\" and writing an alternative second part she called \\"Happy Women\\" in which the sisters flourished in professional careers in a community of spinsters. \\"Good Wives\\" obviously won out and I can't say that I am not happy about that.One thing the book and the afterword did do is awaken an interest in Louisa May Alcott herself. This might be a wonderful place to start on a women's study given the disparity between the work produced and the authors ideals.Whether you are interested in reading it for sheer enjoyment or as a \\"jumping off point\\" for broader studies, you will enjoy the book. It is almost impossible not to."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This is a wonderful little book -a definite GREAT BUY! My wonderful mother read this to me and my brothers and sisters and we thought it was SUPERB!!!! This is an excellent price too!

There is a lot of love through out this book. You will meet in the beginning four young ladies and get to see what it was like for them to grow up during the war. While reading this book you will meet Amy, Meg, Beth and Jo. You will get to take adventures with Jo and see what it was like for her to br a tomboy, a writer, and an older sister. I love this book because it shows love and pasion within this one little family of five. If you enjoy reading Little Women, two other books also written by Louisa May Alcott are, Little Men and Jo's Boys."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"the book little women by Louisa May Alcott was a great read and i thought the writing style was very easy to read it kept you interested through out the whole book. i recommend this book to anyone with alittle sense of how young girls are and how they are when they are growning up and even some of the hardships that young girls go through."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little Women was a significantly written book with strong character relationships and character personalities. The book is about the life of a small American family that is facing hardships and trials during the Civil War. It deals with holding on when things around you are failing and time is so precious. I recommend this book, and its sequels, to any person that likes fun, adventurous, and love stories that have to deal with the love of your friends family.Jo, Amy, Meg, and Beth are four sisters that care for each other very much. They are all very optimistic, and that helps them to stand their teenage years without their father and through many other hardships. They have a mother that loves them, Laurie a good friend, and Mr. Laurence a kind old man, to take care of them. All of the characters are very well rounded and have strong family ties within the book. Jo is wild and outgoing; she wants freedom but also respect. Beth is shy and very musical. Amy is only interested in pretty things in the beginning but soon grows up. Meg is friendly and tries to be helpful.The girls are all very upset when their father goes to fight in the war. They do their tasks willfully, but they begin to dwadle. Days become long and hard for the girls until Jo gets up the courage to ask Laurie if he would like to play. They all soon become good friends. However, being in the time that are, things go to terribly wrong . . .Little Woman is a wonderful book. I believe that everone should take some time to read it."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little Women captures the heart of four young girls as they deal with a changing world, growing up, and the harsh realities of the Civil War. Set in New England, the story captures the essence of sisterhood and finding things to occupy the time in days when there was little money or entertainment provided.Written by Louisa May Alcott, the story retells the childhood of Alcott and the ways that strong family values helped hold the family together during tough times. The story tells of how the family followed the transcendentalist theories which emphasized always perfecting oneself. The girls all struggle to find their place in the world and their own personal perfections throughout life.Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy all struggle with where the days of childhood end and the days of being a Woman begin. Each girl tries to discover her calling and her gifts that she will present to the world. Whether an artist, a writer, or whatever life calls them to be, each of them have dreams of growing up and making their mark on life and the world.The family seems to overcome all obstacles handed to them. Whether their father is away at war, money is hard to come by, or illness plagues the family, they always seem to get through it. They get through it with the love and support of each other.This classic novel reaches out to audiences of all ages. It touches the hearts of all who have ever loved, lost, struggled, and overcome obstacles in life."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little Women, in my opinion, is the best book ever written. It tells the story of a family living in poverty, but are much richer in love than any family I know of. There are four sisters who love each other very much, but are often quarreling as sisters do. I have read and reread this story about 25 times and every time I find it as delightful as before and I am always finding new parts that I either missed or forgotten before. I recommend this book to everyone who likes classics. Also all women who have sisters will really appreciate the trials that these four have."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Louisa May Alcott's 'Little Women' is one of the most captivating and heartfelt stories I have ever read. This is the story of four sisters, living at an unstable time in American history, who learn to overcome poverty and selfish wants to become mature and accomplished women.

The March sisters will win their way into your mind and heart, and their story is one you will not soon forget."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little Women By Louisa May Alcott is a remarkable book that every young women should read. This book takes you through the obstacles and adventures four young sisters face, it summarizes the strength and spirit that comes from a powerful bond of love. As you read the book you will feel the pain and happiness that the sisters go through. The book teaches you wonderful lessons as you read through it."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"A book of happiness and sadness, ups and down of our lives. This a light-hearted story, however Beth's death makes it a really sad story. Any one who read it once will want to read it many many times more."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"You will not believe the feeling you will get after you read this book.

Of great hopes and tragedies. A story someone has to read till the end."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Louisa May Alcott's book, Little Women, does a great job of showing how five women and a lot of love can make it through anything.The plot of this book is adventurous. With every new chapter, there is an exciting new thing about to happen. Every chapter has a story involving one of the characters. As one chapter comes to a close, you can't wait to see what new adventure lies ahead.The best audience for this book would be women. Since the book is about a mother and her four girls, women enjoy it immensely. Teenage girls may also enjoy this book. The girls in the story are all in their teens, so it is easy for teenage girls to relate to. If you are younger than a junior high student, I wouldn't recommend this book.Other similar books are: Little Men and Jo's Boys. In fact you can buy these books in a set of three. They are all written by Louisa May Alcott, and they follow right after the one before. If you enjoyed Little Women, I would definitely recommend reading the other two. The style of writing in these three books is very much the same. If you wanted to know more about what happens to the family after Little Women was finished, then you would definitely want to check these two out.The themes and lessons in Little Women really go straight to the heart. Every chapter has it's own little lesson to be learned. The book as a whole has a great theme. This book gives hope to many readers and brings families closer. Mrs. March along with her four girls prove they can handle anything. The family is very close and each person portrays a different personality. They stick together through the good and the bad. The bond that this family shares makes others families want the same. Through every trial that life throws as them, they stick together and prove they can handle anything."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little Women is one of the best books I've ever read. It's about more than just living to please and getting married, it's a guide for life if you read it right! It definitely holds an honored spot on my bookshelf and it never gets old no matter how many times I read it!"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"All of Alcott's books are not only fantastic from the outside, but from the inside as well.Ken Landgraf's drawings are well produced,done intricately with lots of detail.

I just couldn't put it down. I also think if you like Little Women you should read Jo's Boys. I liked that book because Jo was my favorite character. Take my advice and read both Little Women and Jo's Boys."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I have read Little Women nearly every year since childhood. This book, as well as Anne of Green Gables, are in my opinion among the best literature about girlhood. As I pass through each stage in my life, I find that I understand one of the girls a little more and see more and more of the universality of its theme. Someone once said that Little Women shows how when you are young, all possibilities seem to stand open before you but as you make choices in life one by one other doors close to you. I plan to pass this book on to my daughters."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"That was one of the best books I've ever read.

All of my sisters had read it but me and I wanted a little fun reading it was great funny, sad, and a great ending"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"First, this is not a review of any abridged version of the book. That book is garbage, and you should not buy it, regardless of the illustrations.Second, why is this book good? It's not particularly well written, for example. And there aren't a lot of deeper layers. Yet somehow it is good; but not just good. It's great. One of the great early American novels. So I guess it is the story itself, that of the timeless March sisters. Applicable to every family, every girl, and maybe every childhood. First fantasies, first loves, and first disappointments.One of the things I like most about this book is the unpleasant turns it takes regardless of the reader's wishes -- thus reflecting life itself. We want Beth to recover, but she does not. We want Jo and Laurie to marry, but that doesn't happen. Or at least for neither to be complete without the other. But again, no. Life does not cohere like that, and neither does this story. The dead remain stark dead and the \\"true loves\\" find other loves that they ultimately find truer. And that is striking; very realistic, very wonderful. Also probably why this story works better than Little Men, which was not based as much on reality.Some postscript notes: the earlier parts of the book are best, before we become depressed by the dual disappointments. It peaks when it tells about Beth's final days, that poor, gentle soul. I'm pretty hardened, but that got to even me -- well, a little, anyway."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I wish I grew up with this book, but I just read it now and I adore it. Louisa May Alcott has a wonderful voice, the characters are such relatable girls that they feel like dear friends, and the strong message of Christianity is an important theme. I believe every girl should read this book."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This book is an old favorite love the old movie and loved re reading about simpler times comforting and enjoyable easy reading with some funny times Happy sad and is good to get lost in am sight impaired and have not long had my Kindle It is fantastic amozon have been great and easy to use This book was one of my first and I am really enjoying the story of The March Family their ups and down and will look forward to reading the next in the series"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I still love this wholesome entertaining book written in the days when everyone was raised to be considerate and polite. A must read!"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This was delightful! I have wanted to read this book for many years and finally got to it, and I am SO glad! It is a wonderful story, full of charming characters, emotions, and situations which are amazingly relevant to todays world. I was truly surprised at how much the various situations in the book written nearly 150 years ago mimmick the same situations of today. For example, I laughed at the March girls getting ready to go to a dance, with all of their primping and preparations, burning their hair with a curling iron, etc. I could easily remember my own primping for school dances and picture my daughter and her friends getting ready for theirs. I was afraid that the language used might be quite stuffy or antiquated, given it is quite old, but didnt find that to be the case. I thought it amusing how often Alcott says they will have a \\"capital time\\". Obviously, the use of this phrase has not stood the test of time, but then again I wonder which phrases we use now will die with time too. The family goes through joys, troubles, and near tragedy, just as in real life. I cried when Beth was ill. I laughed at many of their antics. I loved the kind and quite manner of Mr. Bhaer. Laurie is such a treat and gives a nice balance to the girls. This is by far the best book I've read this year, and after reading it I only wish I would have read it sooner. I wanted the story to go on. I loved it!"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This book really makes you think about what you would do in their place. I have not finished this book but it is a great book to read but unless you have a mind that can understand Shakespeare at least a little bit you might need to take it slow and reread a LOT. trust me i have to do it ALL THE TIME! it makes the reading slower but overall this is a magical book that will show you the truth of friendship."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"The download was very quick!

I enjoyed how the author managed to make the book readable to people of all ages even though it was about children. Also, I approved of the theme-- the satisfaction that simple virtues can bring, even if you must sacrifice greater ambition to acheive it. At least, that is the message I took from this book. Additionally, Beth's character and death were beautifully and compellingly written. The one problem I had with the book was the style of narration; it was written in first person with the author referring to herself. This made it hard for me to lose myself in the story, as I kept getting dragged back to reality by the author herself mentioning how the story was a story. This was annoying, to say the least. All in all, I recommend this book, as it becomes even more relevent in today's pleasure-loving mindset, as the characters do their duties wholeheartedly. A good, homelike, virtuous book."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Great classic read. I enjoyed this book decades ago when I was in high school, but enjoyed it even more this time. I love, love, love my Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus - didn't think I would enjoy it as much as I do.

A good balance between superfluous writing and practical observation of women in that era.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I read this classic when I was a kid. Now my kids have all read it. Easy enough for a child to read and be entertained, yet it stretches their skills a bit. It's also written well and has enough complexity to appeal to adults as too.

The Barnes&Noble edition at their store is only about $10 and it's hardcover, you get the exact same words, PLUS ~ introduction, time-line, short bio of author, end-notes, and even questions and comments at the end about the novel... although I really love this painting on the Signet Classic paperback edition, the painting on this one is \\"Home Sweet Home\\"."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I quite enjoyed the book. Although it's long, I think it captures many readers because so many events happen, and so randomly.Little Women is the American classic tale about Margaret (Meg), Josephine (Jo), Beth (Elizabeth), and Amy growing up during the Civil War, with their mother, who they affectionately call \\"Marmee\\". Their father is off in battle, and while the girls are unhappy about being poor, they learn that they don't need that much to be happy.Meg is the eldest, at 16 at the start of the story. She has lovely dark hair, and is sensible and pretty. Jo is a regular tomboy who loves to write, and at one point cuts off her chestnut locks to help get money for her father. Beth doesn't have much of a physical description, but is very kind and sweet. Now Amy, who I don't like too much, has golden blond hair and blue eyes.This book was nice, but it rather focused too much on who's pretty and who's not. Laurie was a delightful character that added a lot to the book, however.I liked the chapters about Demi and Daisy, but I really didn't like the part when Jo dismissed Laurie, for I think they would have been perfect together. I also hated that selfish Amy went off and left poor Jo in misery so she could have a good time, AND stole Laurie away.While the outcome of the book is rather disappointing, this is truly a timeless tale of love and poverty, of life and death, and all the while very amusing."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I bought this edition of Little Women for my niece. I chose this edition because the product description mentions margin notes that provide a historical perspective. There are no margin notes! You get the great, classic story, of course, but the description is inaccurate. There are several illustrations, but be warned that the margin notes do not exist."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"When I started reading this to my children, I had to read ahead. Soon I had finished reading it to me, but not to them! My oldest has since read it. I liked this book so much better than Little Men and Jo's Boys. Girls coming of age really strike a chord with me. I wish I'd discovered these as a girl!I would highly recommend this classic for girls and women alike. The stories are engaging enough for boys as well, if they can get past the title. :) It definitely belongs on my list of my 10 favorite children's books of all time."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Girls of all ages should read this book and come back to read it again as women.

For my recent (14th) birthday, my 16 year old brother gave me Little Women. I read it, and it took me a while, but it was totally worth it. Occasionally, I would have to re-read sections. But that helped me to understand it, which payed off in the long run. If you're thinking of purchasing this book, a word of advise: Go for it!"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Oooh, I have for years wanted to read Little Women by Louisa May Alcott, and I finally got the chance. This book is so amazing, you actually learn to love each one of the characters, yes, even that selfish and smoiled 'Lady' Amy March. The story focuses on four charming yound ladies, Margaret 'Meg', Josephine 'Jo', Elizabeth, 'Beth' (Who by the way is my favorite) and Amy March, these girls are tought several and important lessons, some softly and some a little more harshly by one of their greatest teachers, their mother, Mrs. March, called sweetly by the girls as \\"Marmee\\".The story begins, slowly and happily in what seems like a perfect world, even if Father is away at war. The sisters make new friends, attend elegant parties, and each find small adventures of their own, at home, at school and everywhere. Of course, things change, dark days come along, Meg is falling in love with Mr. Brooke, Laurie's (The Marches' neighboor) tutor and Jo fears that her sister might soon leave them, and poor shy, sweet Beth gets the scarlet fever, who at the end has very serious and sad consequences.There are happy and sad moments in this wonderful masterpiece, and I recommend anyone to read and enjoy them as much as I did."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I am a young girl myself like this book very much because it gives girls like myself something to read that is not inappropriate. I really like this book because it gives me a look into how girls lives were when this book was written. Little Women is about the March family and their trials while Mr. March is at war. There are four girls Meg,Jo,Beth and Amy who expirence growing up in a society where you are judged by how much money you have.

I think that is why I rated okay instead of one star higher. The older language does make it a little longer of a read, not as easy to just read through. A great moral story, especially when you are or have gone through those moments in your own life. There is a little of everything for every girl/woman.

Unfortunately whoever published this version left it full of spelling and punctuation mistakes! I can't believe it's sold like this. Didn't someone edit it???Very dissatisfied and will be returing it."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I can't say I regret reading this book, since I did enjoy the descriptions of day to day life during a period of time in the U.S. (Civil War era) in which most writings of or about the time, focused on the war. Also, it is a classic and it's always fun to finally read something you've heard about for years. I have not seen the Winona Ryder movie version, but I'd like to, just to see how it compares to the book.Alcott's writing is provincial and preachy, though, and I thought her characters were two dimensional at most. I can't help imagining Marmee as a statue of the virgin Mary, with a frozen little smile on her face as she peers down on her children scattered around her. And Dad (what was his name?)! An image doesn't even form in my head about him. Jo rejecting Laurie is an interesting twist, but disappointing, especially when she falls for an old stodgy absent minded professor. Laurie was the only character given human qualities, and I couldn't help liking his grandfather, too. Beth was just unreal, and Meg was annoyingly subservient (I know, that was how things were back then). And how many times did her characters blush? If there was anything the sisters had in common, it was the propensity to change colors at the slightest whim. Otherwise, their qualities seemed mutually exclusive which, as another reviewer pointed out, doesn't seem realistic for sisters.To be fair, I realize this was written for a younger crowd than me, so I should not have expected edginess or depth. So there are my 3 stars."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"this is my favorite book of all time, one I re-read every year around Christmas time - nothing will ever be able to compare, even Pride and Prejudice (which is also one of my favorites).Little Women was originally written in two volumes: Little Women and then Good Wives; today these two books are combined, so will be my review... ((this may be a bit long of a review so bare with me - there is just soo much to cover in this book))Loosely based off of her own life, Alcott presents a story about four women who grow both individually and together as a family during times of trouble, turbulence, and peace. Each sister has their own hopes and dreams, and each sister finds their place in the world only after discovering heartache, pain, love, and loss. Jo, who is loud, rambunctious, hard headed and impatient, finds solace through her writing. She struggles greatly to find peace within her self and accept herself as she is. Meg, the oldest remembers a time when the March family was revered and was not in financial hardships, making it hard for her to accept life as is, all the while being kind and understanding to her young sisters. Beth, the quite and timid sister, who is always kind and sees the good in everyone and everything, desires nothing more than to remain at home with her family and dolls. Amy, the youngest of the sisters, is constantly concerned with how prime and proper she should look, act, and speak, but remains true to her character.Laurie, the boy next door, finds himself a home he never expected in the March household as he finds it hard to live up to his grandfather's expectations of him. He is seen as an older brother to all the sisters, never faulting in his devotion to them, that is until his feelings for Jo grow into something more. However, Jo is unable to see Laurie and he wishes and her desire to find her place in the world is never greater.You really see the divide between childhood and adulthood when each of the sisters go their own way: Meg gets married, Beth remains at home, Amy travels abroad to Europe, and Jo goes to New York (Laurie is also left to his own devices, first going off to college and then working for his grandfather in Europe). It is only when tragedy hits the sisters, are they all able to come back together, as new adult women.While this novel is filled with girls knitting, needlepoint, and darning (which were expected of women of the time), it goes much deeper than that. Alcott presents the constant struggle that many women had, and even many women of today, between their loyalties to their family as well as to theirselves, and trying to find a balance between the two. This is a wonderful novel that can teach anyone many different lessons about life and love and family."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"this is my favorite book of all time, one I re-read every year around Christmas time - nothing will ever be able to compare, even Pride and Prejudice (which is also one of my favorites).Little Women was originally written in two volumes: Little Women and then Good Wives; today these two books are combined, so will be my review...

The story of four sisters - Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy and their trials, tribulations, joys, and life with their beloved mother Marmee appeals on so many levels. These young ladies go through so much, and bear it all stoically, especially with their father being away during the Civil War.Jo, the protagonist in this story is a strong-willed, independent-minded young woman and the character that appeals to me the most. She chafes against the strictures imposed against the women of her time, and struggles with her losses whilst trying to establish herself as a writer. The themes in this novel are varied - poverty, family, friendships, grief, and female emancipation and are deftly dealt with. This will always be a classic and one I hope to share with my own young daughter in the near future."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I read this book for the first time 25 years ago. It was one of my favorite books as a child. Each of the girls is an amazing charactrer with her own strengths.I love this book as much today a I did when I first read it. There are no formatting issues with the kindle version and you can't beat the price!!A fantastic read that showcases the strength that is woman."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"i had heard of this book back in school... i am 27 yrs old now and read it for the 1st time and let me say i have no idea how i let this book slip for so long. it a wonderful story and i will always remember it. it a must read for all girls of any age. so glad i finally read it. would give more than 5 stars if i could."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Near the end of the nineteenth century, a family with four girls is growing up in \\"genteel poverty;\\" their lives derive much strength and goodness from the example and teaching of their loving parents. They are the March family, and they consist of Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy, guided by their loving \\"Marmee\\" while their father is away in the war.We first meet the \\"little women\\" when the older two are in their teens and the younger two are approaching those adolescent years. We follow their progress as they learn life's lessons via their beloved \\"Pilgrim's Progress.\\" We see their faith tested, and the goodness they strive for is elusive--especially for Jo and Amy.ThroughoutLittle Women (Signet Classics), we observe the warmth and nurturing they receive and which others long for but never achieve.I first read this book as a child; in fact, I read it over and over, until some of the more memorable moments were so completely ingrained that they became part of who I was at that time in my life.Now, many years later, I reread it, wondering what I would think and feel about this book. Would my own experiences in those interim years somehow change the story for me? Would my love of this book lessen because I am in a different place now? Well, I am happy to report that I read and achieved each milestone with the March family, all over again, with joy and delight; I remembered and celebrated those moments, almost as if I were reading them for the first time, yet with the extra special glow that comes from reexamining a beautiful treasure from the past.This adventure in reading was well worth it. Next I will be rereading some of the other Alcott books, knowing that I will surely enjoy them (again) as well.I am awarding this wonderful book five stars."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Somehow I missied this classic growing up and only downloaded it as I was looking for something to read with substance that was free. What a lovely tale. Definitely on my list of alltime favorites. I am now inspired to peruse more \\"great classics\\" I passed over in favor of NYT bestsellers in the past. Thank you Amazon."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Despite the Jessie Wilcox Smith illustrations on the front and back covers, I was very disappointed to discover that the artist's color plates that so perfectly capture the characters and events in this American literary classic, were omitted from this edition. Intending to give it as a gift, I ordered this book because I was under the impression that it had the famous Jessie Wilcox Smith pictures. What a disappointment!"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"How to review a beloved classic such as Little Women? I have been considering this question since finishing the book a few days ago.Hailed as one of the best books written for children, Little Women has stood the test of time and is still read by many today, clearing showing that most love this book...however, I did not enjoy it that much. This brings us to the difficulty in reviewing, as book critics, schoolteachers, and children the world over disagree with me.The writing is beautiful with descriptions of the girls, their home, and their lives..but I didn't really relate to any of the characters, even Beth or Jo, which would be the two most memorable of all the girls. I also wasn't caught up in the plot and found it easy to walk away from the book for days at a time.I would still recommend this novel as it gives a glimpse into another time and is an important piece of classic literature, but just don't expect it to be too riveting."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I've read \\"Little Women\\" several times through the years - the first time when I was about 10 years old I guess, and always enjoyed it.The story is simple and sweet, but I think it still carries a strong message about the strength in the bonds of women. Progressive for the time, Alcott presents in the March women different \\"types\\" - Meg, the pretty, domestic one; Jo, the tomboyish, independent rebel; Beth, the too-good-for-this-world moral angel; Amy, the flighty, spoiled, bratty princess - at least at first; and then Marmee, the redeemed wild child who is now their strength and moral compass. The men, while not maligned are almost incidental, serving as props to highlight the different personalities of the women.The characters are wonderfully developed, as we see them grow through the years. The setting is very well described - you can \\"see\\" the gardens and rooms. And again, having been written for young women, the writing is easy to read and follow, if a bit long-winded. Despite Jo's detailed character development, I feel her love story was rushed and not developed enough - as opposed to those of Meg and Amy. I imagine her relationship with Bhaer is delved into more in the sequel \\"Little Men\\", which I haven't read yet.Although I like the book very much I think it suffers in comparison with Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". Even though the time frame of \\"Little Women\\" - during and after the Civil War - is almost 100 years later than \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" - late 18th century/early 19th century - I think Austen's classic feels more relevant.I definitely recommend \\"Little Women\\" to everyone, not just pre-teen and teen girls. It's a beautiful, well-told and surprisingly progressive story."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I first read this book when I was in third grade. I was about halfway through the book when I had to fling it across the room from me in utter horror. Eventually, the pull of the book was too strong: I picked it up, finished it, and sulked for a week. And ever since then, whenever I try to reread it, I end up tossing it across the room, screaming, pulling my hair: the characters just get under your skin. You *care* about what happens to them.The little women are Meg, Jo, Amy, and Beth. They have flaws, just like real people: Meg is vain, Jo is boyish, and Amy is a bit of a brat. Beth is utterly angelic, and can do no wrong. But while these may sound like pasted on personalities, they're not. Over the course of such a long book, you become deeply attached to the characters, and get to know and love them.The story centers primarily around tomboyish Jo. She is constantly getting into scrapes, but is dedicated to her family and goes to great lengths to prove it. It's a growing up story: we follow Jo from a carefree girl who whistles and runs outside to a wife who would give everything for her husband.Now for the bad: Louisa May Alcott is fond of injecting moral lessons into every chapter. That might have been nice in the 1800s, but now, it can seem a bit cloying. That said, the stories themselves are enjoyable enough if you can get past the morality.Further, this book offers some of the most emotionally dissatisfying scenes I've ever read. Hence me throwing the book across the room. I don't want to spoil it for you; you'll know it when you get to it. And you'll be as upset as I was. So be prepared.Overall, Little Women is a good family story with realistic characters. Young girls will probably enjoy it the most, but I think anyone can get something out of it."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I must have read LITTLE WOMEN when I was about ten years old, yet, it is one of those exceptional examples of literature that stays with you years after you've first come to know the March sisters, their trials, triumphs, joys and sorrow. This beautiful book truly captures the strength of family, the courage one must exercise in the face of great adversity and the wisdom we are lucky to acquire if we get through it in one piece. Jo March is the epitome of the irrerepressible, hot-headed and adventurous tomboy. Her character was actually based on the personality of the author, Louisa May Alcott. Meg is the eldest and the most traditionally-minded, Beth is the more retiring, shy and selfless one and Amy is the selfish and strategic one. Together, they all are devoted to and have great respect for their mother, Marmee March, and await the arrival of their father who is serving as a chaplain for the Union Army.LITTLE WOMEN is the first book in a series chronicling the lives of these intriguing and well-developed characters. Even more than one hundred years later, this book still presents timeless themes of friendship, courage, dedication, faith and determination. It's not difficult to see why this story was retold so many times in film."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This version of Little Women is only half the book, the cover says complete and unabridged but that is not true. It is not complete; it is only Part 1, which is very disappointing when you're expecting the whole book.I have nothing against the story, that is not why I rated this product low, I just thought people should know its not all of the story and have to be disappointed."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I just love this book!!YOU should READ THIS BOOK"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I had the great pleasure of reading the book \\"Little Women,\\" written by Louisa May Alcott, a story of real experiences and new feelings one experiences through the miracles of family and letting life take it's course; to live it to it's fullest. The March family is a true loving family who is as tightly woven as an old pair of blue jeans. In fact, they have as many stories to tell as old jeans that have been worn by so many. The March family had some hard times, but even burning of each others manuscripts can't put holes in their pockets. I believe this story is worth reading, because Louisa May Alcott defines si wekk in words how a family like the Marches can use their abilities for good and to learn a little more about life's true meaning. When I read this book I can see their life like I was a curious on-looker peering from behind a bookcase. I have become friends with these characters, and feel as if I had been a part of their noveled life. I became so engrossed in \\"Little Women,\\" when it was time for the light to go off I just realized that in fact I was not touring Europe with the Carroll's, I was laying on my old lumpy mattress with sleep nipping expectantly at my eyelids. To be truthful, the books I had been reading, such as \\"Babysitters Club\\" or \\"Vampires Don't Wear Polka Dots\\" hadn't been keeping me up so late that my light bulb flickered off with a sputter.There are not any faults in this wonderful story that my peering from behind the shelf could notice. It was as if Alcott wrote about her own real life and saw it from all her family's point of view.This book may be sad in some parts, but the blue jeans threads held it together. This was so inspirational to me I decided I should be a Beth or Jo. Maybe even a Meg or Amy. This book isn't just entertainment for the young (or even old) person's mind, but it is a lesson written to fit 400 pages. It can teach you about life, I recommend it greatly.I will not give away the ending, but here is the summary: a dear family holds on to each other through thick and thin, and with their friend's help they still are a family. The family gets smaller then bigger, and the book ends with one sentence, \\"Oh my girls, however long you may live, I never can wish you a greater happiness than this,\\" and this is where I end."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Alcott's 'Little Women' is delightful and heartwarming, ever since I started reading it at 10 years old. The novel never fails to show me how we all make mistakes, we all fail, and we all triumph. Some of my friends have told me the book is boring, slow-paced, and idealistic. Little Women is simply about a family facing trials during the Civil War, and every chapter presents a fresh situation with a good deal of humor too. Alcott's style allows you to feel you are one of the March family, and her development of all characters is fantastic. Her details and dialogue allow the story to flow smoothly, and I've learned a lot from this great piece of American literature. I never tire of reading Little Women. It's that wonderful."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I'm writing this review, not to tell you the classic story of Little Women, but to strongly advise you to buy this beautiful hardcover. I was amazed to find this very one on Amazon, because my mom gave me this version 23 years ago, for Christmas! I'd already read Little Women at least twice before she gave me this book. The pictures and layout of the book drew me in to read that book countless more times! Even now, I glance through the illustrations and remember how they enhanced my numerous readings. This is the perfect gift for a 10 year old girl (that was the age I received this), because she will keep it forever!"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I think the title of this book is wrong. They are women, but they aren't little. They are very mature for their ages. Beth is 13, almost like me, but she acts like she is Meg's age and above. Amy is a little whiner. She dislikes her nose and loves to paint. Jo is a dreamer. She has all the dreams of writing and such. Meg is the oldest. She has a job as a governess for two little kids. Little Women is a great book, although it gets a little lengthy."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I admit...I watched the movie so much to the point where I can recite it word for word. It is one of the best. Just to let you know it is the one that has the cast of: Susan Sarandon, Clair Danes, Kirsten Dunst, and Winona Ryder.The book was so lovely. It naturally has a lot more detail and happenings than the movie. Oh I loved it. It is a great classic. And it is deffinately in my top five."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little Women, a classic novel written by Louisa May Alcott, is about four girls coming of age during the Civil War. It tells of the lessons they learn and how love conquers all. Even though I had seen the movie before I read the book, I found the book to be intriguing, romantic and kept me hooked from the beginning. The one aspect of this book I did not care for was how the author described relationships or objects, which went on for sometimes pages at a time. That was the only downside, beside it being over 750 pages and not letting me read any other books for a month.Otherwise, this was an excellent novel that I will remember and keep as one of my treasured books; it has taught me many lessons that I will remember always."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"The book Little Women, is about four sisters, Meg March,Jo March, Beth March, and Amy March, and their mom Marmee.

The most important lesson Marmee teaches her daughters is love,and how to overcome their hardships.They achieved these things by through God, and the love of each other.Meg was the oldest at age sixteen.

Its story of family love, loyalty, fun, daily life experiences, and sacrifice in difficult times is an inspiration to all readers. It is one of my favorite youthful reading memories!..."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"The book, Little Women, written by Louisa May Alcott, is the most captivating book I have ever read. I watched, and fell in love with the movie, but I never realized how much more I would get out of it, by reading the book. The famous saying, \\"Money can't buy you happiness\\", really shows through in this book. Living in the 1800's, during the Civil War, and very little money, the March family shows what little things can make you happy.At the beginning of the book, the four daughters are introduced, but as you continue reading, you become apart of their lives. Alcott really has a way of bringing out each character, and making them so strong and powerful. Meg, who is very mature and grown up, thinks about getting married and taking care of children. Jo, is the tomboy and doesn't seem to take anything seriously. Beth is the most selfless, and is always willing to do anything to help others. Young Amy tries so hard to be perfect and loved by society, but is spoilt and selfish. The March family is faced with many trials and tribulations, and fight so hard to overcome them, especially the death of a loved one. Through everything that they go through, they stay positive, and continue to follow their dreams.Reading this book, helped me to find the importance of family. No matter what happened to this family, they were always able to turn to each other for love and support. This is how I want to be able to live my life. Not to be poor, but to have such a strong bond within my family.I have read this book once, and I plan on reading it many times over, and hopefully passing it on to my daughter when she is old enough to read and understand it. I recommend this book to any women, whether they are young or old. I hope that whoever does choose this book, apreciates it as much as I did, and always will."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"With these four girls growing up together many other girls can easily relate to many of the simple problems that they encounter even though this takes place so long ago. From hair, dances, boys, and growing up. Little Women is a timeless classic that all are sure to enjoy forever!"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little Women is a period piece no mistake. I recall being quite mystified by certain aspects when I first read it at twelve. If the Marches are so poor how come they have a maid? (today household help is a luxury, back then it was a necessity. One woman simply could *not* run a home alone) What's so awful about having to work for a living? (middle and upper class girls were supposed to be supported in idleness by their fathers until marriage, having a job was quite declasse) I was fascinated by the idea of school being optional, (No public schools back then, and no truancy laws) and I'd never heard of 'Pilgrims Progress'.Yet dispite the increasing alieness of 19th century life most young girls fall in love with Little Women at some point in their development and I was no exception. I think it is character of Jo who captivates us. It is with her, restless and unconventional, that most of us modern girls identify not with goody-goody Meg, or pathetically saintly Beth or spoiled Amy."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Growing up in the March house is no easy task.

I recommend this to people who havea love of mischief and a spirt for adventure.I learned as you grow up that there aredifficult and humorous times in life."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Like the previous reviewer, I was surprised to find that he book I had been occasionally rereading for over 50 years was NOT the original novel. My own copy, much loved and well thumbed, has been with me since I was a ten year old. I bought the Kindle version just to have it in my portable library, since I thought I knew it almost by heart. To my surprise, when I started looking it over, I found that the book was not the same at all. My original copy must have been &#34;modernized&#34; at some point. All of the familiar passages were there, but there was a great deal that I didn't remember reading before. Some of that was a specifically Victorian kind of moralizing, but there was also some expansion of the story.. I'm not sure that I would have appreciated it all when I was younger, but I found it a delight to read now, as an example of a book of its times. Now I'm going to download the rest of the Alcott catalogue and see how it compares to the books I thought were the originals when I read them many years ago. This was still an exemplary book. It will always be one of the classics."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I am a 14-year-old girl and just got around to reading Little Women about a year ago. It is a great American classic written by Louisa May Alcott. It is about the four March sisters: Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy. They live in New England during the Civil War. They are poor, but they try to make the best of it as they grow and learn. We follow them through good times and bad as they, with help from Marmee and Laurie (their next-door neighbor), bear their own unique burdens. Meg's is poverty, Jo's is her temper, Beth's burden is not being able to play on a piano, and Amy's is her unaristocratic nose. (as funny as that sounds) You'll fall in love with Jo's oddities just as much as with Beth's gentil manners. It is a great book that everyone should read!"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I was so, so looking forward to reading \\"Little Women\\" to my daughter, so she could be caught up in it as I was at an early age. I particularly chose the \\"Whole Story\\" edition because of its broad margins, easy-to-scan pages, and charming illustrations and margin notes that add historical texture to the story.Imagine my shock to discover that at the end of THIS edition, Jo has not written a book, Amy has not gone off to Europe, Professor Baer has not made an appearance of any kind and....you'll never believe this....Beth is still carrying on a conversation (I'm trying not to spoil the plot of the real thing here).That's because, apparently, \\"Little Women\\" was initially published in two parts (\\"Little Women\\" and \\"Good Wives\\"), which are generally published as the same book. Whole Story has chosen to stop at the half-way point, so much of the story you remember, loved, cried, and laughed over is just not here.Imagine getting only the first half of Tom Sawyer...leave him stranded on the island forever!I feel completely conned. It's a five-star story - make that maybe even a seven-star story - but it's a one-star edition."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I bought this perennial favorite to add to my barely-started collection of these tiny Collector's Library books (sadly, B&N; discontinued publication of these). I love that it's small and hardcover- perfect for traveling- especially for long hours on the plane or whatnot.I was a bit disappointed to find that this book contains only part I of Little Women, ending with Chapter 23 (\\"Aunt March Settles the Question\\"). It does not have Good Wives (aka part 2 of Little Women). Luckily, I have what I call my \\"home copy\\" of the book which has both parts...so I don't feel like I've made a mistake in purchasing this one. But I thought I'd let you know this book only features part I so that you know what to expect!"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \\"Little Women\\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature. Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. Louisa May Alcott's best-known novel is a magnificent achievement."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Please don't misunderstand me...I am NOT disparaging the original story of Little Women. The one star rating is for this particular edition of the book. I have loved this book all my life and having worn out my childhood copy, was hoping to get a new one. An UNABRIDGED copy!! This is not the original...words and whole phrases have been changed and added to this copy! If you, like I was, are looking for an original, untouched, UNABRIDGED copy of Little Women then bypass this edition!! I cannot even begin to tell you how disappointed I was!! I will be returning this copy and continue my search for a REAL copy of Little Women that hasn't had words changed, modernized, or \\"dumbed down\\"!!"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Sure the story is great (as it would be with any version) and this version does have the nice print and book mark, however, the advertising suggested to me, at least, that there would be several illustrations. There were none except silly chests with each little woman's name engraved on them at the start of each chapter.Do not select this book if you are looking for an *illustrated* version. The Illustrated Junior Library version is well illustrated and at least as high quality a printing.By the way, read the sales copy above to see how misleading it is. Just for that reason, consumers should eschew this version, and Amazon should have them change it."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"As an unabridged edition, all of Alcott's words are there. The narrator, Sandra Burr, takes us through the classic work in a style that takes the listener inside the story. Voices for the different characters are all created, but never in a melodramatic fashion. Listening to the story is like watching a fine and faithful production"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"When people ask me how I became such an avid reader, my answer is because I read Little Women in High School. This timeless classic of four sister growing up during the Civil War is my all time favorite book and I do not even know how many times I have read it. I treasure my copy of this book and it is one I could never part with.Little Women is a coming of age story about four sisters Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy, and it always amazed me how Marmee would sit back and let them learn life's lessons and always find the right words to say to each of them afterward. Family values and morals as well are hard lessons to teach but through love and understanding they all learn.Jo is my favorite character, she is so vibrant and full of life and the character based on Louisa May Alcott herself. My favorite movie version of this movie is the 1933 version with Katherine Hepburn as Jo, she truly captured Jo's spirit.This story has been read by many generations and I'm sure that there will be many more generations enjoying the story of Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy for many many years to come."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Having not read Little Women in many decades, I was drawn back to the book by my love of visiting the Alcott family home, Orchard House, in Concord, Massachusetts. I plan to re-visit that wonderful home and want to refresh my recollections of Little Women before doing so. By the way, if you have a chance to visit Orchard House, I strongly recommend that you do. Your sense of Little Women will expand.As I re-read these delightful pages, I found myself comparing Little Women to Pride and Prejudice, that outstanding work that captures human psychology so well. The comparison made me see new depths in Little Women that convince me that Little Women is by far the stronger work.But my biggest reaction was how modern the views in the book are. Women should have education, access to opportunities to develop their interests and marriage to men who will complement them. People should be concerned about each other and help one another, lest any person's life be harmed or feelings hurt in the process.I also noticed how complete a community of loving women can be within the same family.The writing style is beautifully spare. The key point of a chapter may turn on two or three words. And then, everything changes in the twinkling of an eye.Being a long book, Ms. Alcott has plenty of chances to develop her characters and she does so beautifully . . . allowing Meg, Jo, Beth, Amy and Laurie to grow and change as they age.I also came to appreciate more the scope of the book, taking the young women from teenage years through the first few years of marriage. It's a time period that few books consider. Usually, it's all over when the marriage happens. I like this approach better.Should you read Little Women? Does the sun rise in the East?If you haven't read Little Women, you've missed great role models for how to be a parent, spouse and child.Here's the story in a nutshell: During the Civil War, Mr. March is away serving as a chaplain in the Union army. Mrs. March (Marmee) and her four daughters are at home in the cold north making do on small income with the help of one servant, Hannah. As the story opens, the March family is facing a frugal Christmas. But events soon take an unexpected turn and their hearts are filled with gladness. Jo makes an unexpected and most humorous acquaintance of the Laurence boy (Theodore, known as Laurie) who lives next door with old Mr. Laurance, his grandfather. The two families draw upon one another for strength and friendships grow. Illness intercedes making the two families even more dependent on one another. One by one, the children move into adulthood, deal with their romantic feelings and form their alliances.The characters of each child are quite different, allowing Ms. Alcott to explore the contrasts by putting them together in various private and social occasions. Meg is beautiful and much admired. She should attract many suitors. Jo is energetic, self-absorbed and talented in writing (the character closest to Ms. Alcott herself). Beth is very kind and yet fragile. Amy is the social climber in the family . . . and the pet. Laurie has an artistic temperament, but finds himself expected to play an heir's role.You'll long remember with delight the stories of their thespian performances, games, dances and social visits. Although the book makes up a wonderfully detailed novel, the chapters are written almost as stand-alone short stories that pack a powerful punch in their modeling of good behavior.What a joy!"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"You should read this book because it is really exciting. It is about 4 girls and their rich next door neighbour Lauire. The girls miss their Dad who is away at war. Although the family is poor they are happy. Beth (the second youngest) catches a disease and her sisters care for her. At the end, Christmas is very special because their father comes home from war. I think only girls should read this book."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little Women is a good book overall. There are enjoyable, funny, romantic and sad parts in the book, but sometimes it was too detailed and descriptive. I did like the closeness of the family shown throughout the book through good times and bad. I like how they all learn about life while they're growing up together. I would probably have to read it again to fully understand it and get all that it has to offer.I also like the richness of the characters. Jo, the tom-boy, Meg, the pretty, mature one, Beth, the sweet, shy one, and Amy the artistic, prim and proper one. They are fun characters to read about along with Laurie, Marmee, Aunt March, and others.I definatly think this is a good novel to read because it is a classic and it would be a good one to read to learn more about the time period.I just wish it wasn't so long."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"The book is the coming-of-age story of four sisters. In a very precise way, their lives together are documented in accordance with the times - of what's expected of them as women and what contradictions arise and also social situations that demand attention to several of the sisters.The characters are almost unreal - they're so exaggerated that one cannot help to relate SOMEHOW although weakly to any of them. Even the trials and tribulations warrant a very soft feel to them. I found myself emotionally detached to most of the situations and was scanning after near half of the reading and I feel as if I had gotten just as much out of it as I had previously.If you're going to read it, be a 7 or 8 year old girl learning the value of friendship and family and other kindly things that involve morals, love, and adaptation to change.Otherwise, read Anne of Green Gables instead. It offers just as much and more... esp. with entertaining situations that as compared to the reviewed are so much more the delightful."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Please note that I am rating this particular edition of the novel.

Then there's the little women: sixteen-year-old Meg, who is pretty and mature; free-spirited, fiery Jo, who is determined to become a famous writer; timid Beth, who always puts others before herself; and young Amy with her artistic tastes and airs. There's also the March's lonely neighbor, Theodre Laurence (Laurie), who befriends the girls and supplements their experiences and family.MY REVIEW: This heartwarming story about four sisters growing up during the Civil War visits upon themes of family, transcendence, sincerity, and duty. In a novel based upon her own family and experiences, Louisa May Alcott chronicles the first of three books about the March family, which is the universal story of the family unit and the self in the face of the world: how each lives and how happiness prevails in morality and truth.Alcott's novel caters to all audiences, regardless of age and gender. As a children's book, as it is often placed, Little Women serves as a record of the coming-of-age of four girls as: Amy bears injustice at school, Jo struggles with personal, literary, and romantic issues, Meg faces society and Vanity Fair, and as life threats Beth's solitude. As a piece of classic literature, Little Women serves testimony to the emerging conscious and individual. It's impossible to resist the gentle lessons and the charming, dimensional characters that stimulate the reader to the same awakening and discovery of value."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This book is fantastic. I first read it in fifth grade and it still brings tears to my eyes and a smile to my face every time I read it. It stars the March sisters; Jo a tom boy writer who scribbles away and is a strong willed free spirit, while Beth is a sweet girl who never says a mean word to anyone, Meg is the motherly oldest and Amy is the childish youngest who must be surrounded by pretty things.

It is an utterly splendid story :)"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This is now my favorite book! The struggles that the whole family goes through touches me. It reveals how sorrowful and joyous a person can be in a matter of time. Happiness doesn't come with your wealth or belongings, but with your family and friends. I can relate to the girls in the different situations. The story made me laugh and made me cry! I would say it is by far better than the movies. The use of detail and description is beautifully done.

She think it's so dreadful to be poor."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I read this book first some twenty years ago. It was our high-school text book. I did not realise it then that the book we were reading was an abridged version .. that ends with the father returning home to his family. All through the years I've had vivid reminiscences of what I had read in the book .. the four daughters, the guy next door, the dinner party, Beth falling ill, day-dreaming .. for real life seemed to live in every page of that novel (like the dessert with a pinch of salt) and I could identify myself being in a similar situation almost every day.It wasn't until later, much later, that I realised that Louisa May Alcott's original novel ended very differently then I could have ever imagined. I happened to read the unabridged version a few months ago and it came as a big shock to me to realise that Beth had passed away. It was so sad. I wept. All these vivid characters had lived in my memory for all these years. They were an epitome of a caring family. It had ended all so well twenty years ago. And now, all of a sudden, brute reality struck. One sister was dead and the guy next door was torn between two sisters.Now that the ending has finally sunk in, I'd say that this novel is one of hope .. not of marriage alone as one reader points out. HOPE. This is what keeps us all alive. We all dream that one day we'll achieve something .. peace, prosperity, happiness .. and this novel reinforces that sentiment and can be rightly dedicated to &quot;those who dare to dream&quot;.Read this novel if you feel like saying &quot;If only ...&quot; and it's gonna make you say &quot;I will ...&quot;."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"this is a book filled with tons of adventures"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I am nine years old and read Little Women recently. This book is very poetic. I like the way the four girls are each interested in different things; for example Meg is very motherly, Jo is a tomboy and loves to write and do plays, Beth is shy and thoughtful and Amy is good at art and is very concieted. Some parts did go a little slow. It's very realistic because the girls do have some fights and act very much like sisters. Their father is at war and they are not very wealthy, but throughout the book they learn that they love eachother and have good times without money. They realize that without a lot of money they are really very lucky and also realize that there are others with money that don't have as much family love as they do. I think you will really enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"EVERYBODY has to read this book. It's like the best book in the world. I read it, than every girl in my class read it. That's good news. But the boys really didn't have an excuse not to read it. I thought the story was perfect.

This book, as well as Anne of Green Gables, are in my opinion among the best literature about girlhood. As I pass through each stage in my life, I find that I understand one of the girls a little more and see more and more of the universality of its theme. Someone once said that Little Women shows how when you are young, all possibilities seem to stand open before you but as you make choices in life one by one other doors close to you.

I grade it 5 stars. This is a girl but one who is a tomboy. But that is my opinon. Most people love it but I did not"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This is a book that I'd heard about all of my life, so I figured I ought to finally read it. Unfortunately, it is truly miserable. I would have given up on it about halfway through, but our internet died for a few days so I wasn't able to download anything else from the library.To be fair, the book was written for prepubescent girls, and I am (at the time of this writing) a 38-year-old man. But I have to believe that even the target audience - in this generation at least - would find it a slog.This book features the March family - primarily Mrs. March and her four daughters, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. It describes the daily joys and travails of these mid-19th century New England women. Unfortunately, nothing much happens to them. Trivial events - such as a disastrous meal, or a picnic lunch are the subjects of full chapters. The girls mostly sew, do their chores, play outside, eat, and sleep. The book is full of moral lessons, admonishing us all to be selfless, good, pure, and true. Some of these morals are timeless, and good behavior is something we can all aspire to. But the lessons are delivered with as much subtlety as a sledgehammer, in such a cloying way, and with so many superlatives as to make you want to stick a finger down your throat.The book also has lessons that are not (thank God) timeless. Three out of four of the little women who feature in this book have interesting talents: Jo writes, Amy draws, and Beth plays music. Each initially aspires to do something great with her talent, but these dreams are summarily squashed. By the end of the book, and with the admonition that \\"talent isn't genius\\", Alcott has impressed upon her audience that such dreams are almost always fanciful. The lesson seems to be: harbor such dreams at a young age if you must - - but in the end, you'll be much happier if you get married, have kids, live puritanically, and take care of your husband. I just can't get behind that."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This was a very good transaction.

Also, as I learnt some years ago in my teachingdays, this is not a book to be used in the classroom. It is best savedfor long winter days, when reading a chapter can be a daily visit withappealing friends.Much of it is way too puritanical for mytaste. Daughters cannot so much as have their rare good breakfast onChristmas Day, and presents need to be sacrificed because how can oneenjoy oneself when soldiers are not? But the characters are oftenvivid, and the relationships between the sisters are quiterealistic.That said, it does tend to be a winner. The very youngtend to focus on the fun parts rather than the New Englandcongregationalist preaching ... don't spoil it for them, at the youngage, by telling them just why the Alcotts, on whom this work wasbased, were the &quot;poor&quot; outcasts in the wealthyneighbourhood. END"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I hate to say it but this is a book designed primarily for women. I am a male and I would have to refrain from calling it a classic as it failed to cross the sexual divide. The characters are well developed and undoubtedly you care for the four children and their mother especially. The girl's lovers are unfortunately less developed as characters and they come across as prissy men. The plot is overlong and unexciting. Is there even a plot? However the plot of Emma was also non-existant but the writing had an edge to it that dismissed any boredom. Unfortunately boredom can creep in while reading this tale. The death of one main character seemed to drag on and on and on... Am I the only person in the world who rejoiced upon reading that the girl had passed on. &quot;About bloody time!&quot; I cried.

This book would be classified as a young adult.Little Women is the strory of three sisters. It shows the trials a girl can face as she grows up into a women. The book is filled with romance, trouble, revenge and many other domestic problems.I have read many books that are similar to Little Women. The Old-fashioned Girl, is another delightful story with a similar genre. It is also by Louisa May Alcott.I really enjoyed the book. I love Alcott's style of writng. You are really able to connect with each of the charcters. I found the strongest connection between Jo and myself. She is an independent women. She and likes to be philosophical. We are very much alike in these ways. &quot; Jo is our Literary fellow.&quot; This was said about Jo form her sister Meg. The whole March family thought Jo was the greatest authoress that ever did live. I to would love to get such praise for my writings.However good this book may be it does have its drawbacks. I feel there could have been several things omitted. I would recommend this book for those who enjoy stories about women who in their own little ways try to make their world better."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"One of the novels that I have read this summer was \\" LITTLE WOMEN\\" by Louisa May Alcott. The characters in this book are Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. These girls and their mother are poor. Their father is also in the navy so he can't come home to see his family. I really liked this book because it shows that kids should be more greatful to their parents an d that you can never get everything that you want if your parnets don't have the money. One thing that I about the book was how the author declared that those girls' father was in the navy. I liked that she wrote that because it matches up to the fact that their family is poor.If i had to tell the author what to improve about the book is that she should maybe give more information ab out the mother and the housekeeper that lives with them. I would recommend this book to all the people that I know because it shows that people should be greatful about what they have and that they should respect the people that take care of them. I really enjoyed reading this book."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This timeless children's classic is read and enjoyed by many adults as well as children. Unlike most classics considered children's works today, Little Women was intended for an audience of children. It takes place during the Civil War and the years following, and narrates the story of 4 girls as they grow up, including their friends and their family. Louisa May Alcott based this work in large part on her family, although many of the events are born totally of her imagination. Jo is based on Louisa May; Meg is based on her older sister Anna; Beth is based on her younger sister Elizabeth, or Lizzie; and Amy is based on her youngest sister May. Because the character Jo is based on the author herself, she is the most well defined character in the book and the one most children identify with. A tomboy, a writer, and quite determined, Jo is the central figure in the book and most events center around her growing up, but all of the other girls get special attention in stories particularly about them from time to time.There is a great sense of morality in the work, but it is never treated in a 'preachy' manner. Values and morals are taught and absorbed by the reader as the girls learn them through various trials, some funny, some sorrowful, some frustrating. There is likewise a very strong emphasis on God. Much of the first half of the book centers around concepts found in the Puritan work, Pilgrim's Progress, by John Bunyan. The girls are often pointed by their mother toward God and placing their trust in Him and seeking His aid in various situations. Louisa May Alcott was also a transcendentalist and her family was close friends with Emerson, Thoreau, and Hawthorne. Because of this, there is a sense of joy found in nature as well as respect. In addition, Louisa May was an avid feminist in her day, although not in the sense of feminist that many think of today. She believed that women should not be barred from admission in the workforce, or limited to work as seamstresses or governesses, nor should marriage be their only avenue of insuring a stable and secure future. She did not get married, but did raise her sister May's daughter after May died. Little Women is definitely not anti-marriage, but some of the characters dream of becoming well-known in their favorite fields; also, some of the characters speak about how the only way they can insure a positive, pleasant future is by marrying well, which is later rejected in a way that asserts that women should be able to choose marriage freely for love, not for position or money and likewise free to choose not to marry.This book is well loved by so many. It spurs many children on to become strong readers for life and the childhood copy of Little Women will become worn from much loved reading. This book will be loved by most girls, but boys will enjoy it as well. Jo's tomboyish behavior and the neighbor boy, Laurie's presence will attract the attention of boys. It makes a great choice for bedtime reading with chapters of perfect length to read one per night and short enough that if begged by the kids, you can read two. In addition to Little Women, it would also be beneficial to read a biography of Louisa May Alcott.I strongly recommend an unabridged version. Don't miss out on the well-known sequels Little Men and Jo's Boys."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Rosemary R.ISBN:1-4027-1236-7I would recommend this book to anyone because of it's amazing qualities and meanings. The characters just all around have great qualities and are so loveable. It's a nice life story to read about. The genre is like a biography but not quite. It's a great old fashion book to read and shows the true meaning of family. It's a sure attention grabber!

When I was in junior high, my mom and grandmother recommended I read it, but it sounded so dorky and old fashioned that I never gave it a try. Even my best friend whom I considered \\"cool\\" told me how great it was, but I didn't believe her. I saw the 1998 movie when I was about 22 and that led me to finally read the book. I was surprised that the book was even better than the movie. I think this should be on teen's summer reading lists. Even though it was written a long time ago, it is definitely still relavant."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"As I began the first chapter of this book, I thought I had made a mistake in purchaing it. It started off kind of \\"goody-goody\\" sounding and written for young adults. But I gave it a chance, and it paid off. As I got further into the book, I was hooked. I fell in love with the characters and kept turning the page to see what would happen next. It's a classic story for every woman. I enjoyed it so much I bought it for my 8-year-old cousin.The story is essentially about 4 sisters as they grow up. Each sister is unique, with different ideas and priorities. \\"Watching\\" them grow up through out the book is entertaining and heart-warming."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but &quot;Little Women&quot; retains a special place in the heart of American literature. Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of &quot;Little Women&quot; come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, &quot;poor little rich boy&quot; Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to &quot;Little Women.&quot; Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- &quot;scribbling&quot; down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But &quot;Little Women&quot; is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as &quot;heartwarming&quot; stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the &quot;perfect little homemaker&quot; image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.&quot;Little Women&quot; is one of those rare period novels that is still relevant, funny, and heartbreaking today. Fun, sweet, and a beautiful experience."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little Women is a charming story that transports back in time and tells the story of the March family. It follows the trials and triumps of the close-knit family living in the Civil War era. The four March sisters manage, although fequently challenged, to remain close throughout time. From the very first chapter the unique character traits arise pretty, proper, and mature Meg, tomboy Jo who loves to read and write, shy and caring Beth who loves music and animals, and vain Amy with an artistic talent. They are as different as sisters can be, but their strong personalities bring them closer together. The family is held together by the loving parents who are devoted and fair. The parents work to mold their daughters into responsible young women by teaching them morality and love. It is very much a coming of age story, each girl striving to become a good woman, and tying to let go of their past. Even though it was written over a hundred years ago, modern readers can still relate to the story. The girls still fight, they serch for love, they deal with loss, they struugle with poverty and fitting in. The story teaches great morals that are as important now as they were when the book was written. The book teaches the value of family, the importance of self-improvement, and the truth that love can withstand all. It is a plot that will involve the reader, a book that you will not be able to put down. By the end of the novel you will feel like you know the Marchs personally and will want to read it all over again. This story has passed the test of time and is a beloved peice of literature that brings people together. It is a tale that has touched countless generations, and will continue to do so for many more."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Some books transcend the time in which they were written, because the truths they contain are simply timeless. Such is \\"Little Women,\\" a simple tale of four sisters in rural New England during the time of the Civil War.Yes, they wear long skirts, and yes, one is NOT seen at a ball without white gloves, and yes, there are horse-drawn carriages. But Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy March are as modern in their simple desire to be themselves as any teen living in today's techno world. The hurdles the girls face seem tougher than the hurdles of today, but are they really? Meg, the oldest, is not the saint she appears. She secretly misses the money her family once had, and desperately wants to \\"fit in\\" with the in-crowd, in this case, the high-society milieu that has rejected the Marches because they are poor. She also wants to find a nice man and get married. Not so very different...Jo (Louisa May Alcott's fictional persona)constantly flies in the face of convention, finding the restrictions of being a woman in her time almost unbearable. A feminist long before there was a hint of such a thing, Jo wants to dress like a boy, have the freedom that men do, and think for herself. She largely succeeds.Amy is the 19th-century version of \\"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun.\\" She wears a clothespin on her nose each night so it will \\"turn up\\" and look pretty. She hoards her small pittance of an allowance so she can buy herself small trinkets. She is beautiful, selfish, but lovable deep inside.Beth, modeled after Alcott's real-life sister, truly IS a saint--and is martyred for it, having caught scarlet fever from a destitute family whose baby she tried to nurse back to health.All four girls struggle to live their lives while their father, a chaplain, is away at the War, and their mother is forced to do menial work to keep everybody fed. Family values are preached and preached again, but Alcott's \\"marmee,\\" the mother, is too human to be obnoxious. And the lessons of helping one another, living a good life, and making appropriate choices are not lost on the girls--or the reader.This is the perfect tale to read to your daughter, and I recommend the book before any movies (there are several wonderful film versions; my favorite remains the one that stars Katharine Hepburn as a simply fabulous Jo). To my way of thinking, \\"Little Women\\" is part of growing up. And deservedly so."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"In researching whether or not this is \\"half a book\\" I found the following information: Alcott wrote a second part, which was published in 1869. Both parts were called Little Women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy. Part II picks up three years after the events in the last chapter of the first part Little Women (\\"Aunt March Settles The Question\\"). In 1880, the two parts were combined into one volume, and have been published as such in the United States ever since. In the UK, the second part was published under the title Good Wives, though Alcott had no part in the decision.So, I guess you could say this is half a book but only in the U.S.I do have a problem with Amazon's search engine not being able to find this book. Maybe because they don't stock it?"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Not sure what I can add that other previous reviewers haven't already added except to say I liked it too!

Presenting an idealized view of life beginning in Civil War era New England, it gives a glimpse into the world of their class and time.

They are faced with many challenges they must overcome bringing them closer and closer. Little Women brings the trials and tribulations of young people dealing with family crises, the mending of broken hearts, and the death of a loved one. The four sisters of the March family, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy manage to live their lives willingly, and interesting lives despite their father at war and the lack of money the family has. The closeness bondage of the sisters intrigues you as you read through the long, but exhilarating book. The love that the March family share is remarkable and leads to my jealousy due to the childhood I grew up without siblings. Marmee March is the mother of the family and holds the family together. She displays infinite wisdom in dealing with her daughters and also shows unlimited patience with an exceptionally charitable nature. Marmee also diligently teaches them the lessons they need to achieve a happiness that will carry them through their adult life.The story of these sisters describes Meg's joys and mishaps as a young wife and mother, Jo's struggle to become a writer, Beth's tragedy, and Amy's artistic pursuits and unexpected romance. Meg, the oldest, is somewhat vain and does not like the poverty status she has to live. She dreams of having money to spend on beautiful clothes and live like the rich society girls that have become her friends. Jo is the second oldest, and is the tomboy growing into maturity with a quick temper. She is always quick to chastise her inner self and live the values that Marmee has taught her. Her main goal in life is to be a writer and she spends endless time pursuing this goal. Beth is the quiet, very shy, child who is third oldest who strives to help the less fortunate in any way she can portraying herself as an angel. Amy is the youngest, who is quite selfish and spoiled. Her desire in life is to be an artist in which she diligently looks for the beauty in the world around her to paint on canvas and dreams of painting in Paris. Alcott portrays the characters that make them come to life as you read and the thrill you have that lures you into reading more and more. This book leads you to realize what family love is."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little women is a timeless masterpiece in which Louisa May Alcott describes the lives and adventures of four sisters coming of age during the Civil War. Alcott shows the trials and tribulations of young people dealing with the death of a loved one, family crises, and the mending of broken hearts. Readers today are still inspired by the lessons taught by Marmee on how to be a good person and how to achieve happiness in life.Marmee (Mrs. March) is the mother of the family and the glue that holds them together. She displays infinite wisdom in dealing with her daughters and also shows unlimited patience with an exceptionally charitable nature. Her main goal in life is to be a pleasing wife and secure the happiness of her dauthers. She diligently teachs them the lessons they need to achieve a happiness that will carry them through their adult life.In reading this novel it gives the reader a glimpse into what its like for women growing up in the 1800's. Readers today remain inspired by Meg's devotion to her family, Jo's commitment to her writing, and Beth's willingness to help the ones she loves. Meg is the oldest sister. She is plump and beautiful with a sweet temper and very motherly. She appears to be somewhat vain and does not like the poverty status she is reduced to living. She dreams of having money to spend on beautiful clothes and live like the rich society girls that have become her friends. She fights a constant battle with her feelings even into married life but comes to the realization that she will be content with what she has rather than spend her life wishing for a wealth she will never achieve. Jo is the next oldest and the main herione. She is very much the tomboy growing into maturity with a quick temper. She is always quick to chastise her inner self and live the values that Marmee has taught her. Her main goal in life is to be a writer and she spends endless time pursuing this goal. Jo's personality is real and evokes sympathy from the reader in her attempts of trying to fit into a society that she doesn't relate to and falls short of those expectations. Jo's quick temper proves to be a constant battle for her but she diligently battles her demons while being consumed with self doubt. She works very hard to be a good and pleasing child to her parents. I feel her character most resembles the author's life. Alcott goes to great lengths to paint a picture of Jo's character giving great detail and attention to explaining her because she most likely understands her the best. She is very self sacrificing and has a strong maternal instinct to her younger sister, Beth. After the death of her sister Jo tries to become her sister in an attempt to hold on to her. This was her way of keeping Beth close to her but she soon realizes that given her rebel nature it will not work. Beth is the quiet, very shy, child who is third oldest. Throughout the first half of the book I wanted her to blossom and mature to become a personality that would equal her sisters. This never happened as she always seemed to be content with her state of life and wrapped herself up in her cats and dolls while tending to the minute details of the house trying to make it as happy as possible. If this was her allotment in life she achieved it very well. I thought of her as a little angel. Amy is the youngest, being quite selfish and spoiled. Her desire in life is to be an artist in which she diligently looks for the beauty in the world around her to paint on canvas. Amy is, however, to be admired for her persistence in dealing with the elite society and striving to rise out of her poverty stricken life which she accomplishes by marrying Laurie, the rich boy next door. But instead of just enjoying her wealth the couple decides to use that wealth to help the less fortunate.Little Women serves as a reminder of just how fragile life and feelings can be. Alcott breathes life and existence into the characters that makes them come to life on the pages before you. The reader feels as if they are a part of the family. I had feelings of joy when they succeeded and sorrow when they didn't. When Beth was very sick I could sympathize with Jo and I also wanted deperately for her to recover.Alcott does not profess openly any political or religious beliefs but the story has undertones of the beginning of the women's rights movement and it suppports religious beliefs of the Quakers while promoting the ideals of married life. Quakers in those days believed that divine relation was immediate and individual; all persons may perceive the word of God in their soul. It recognizes the presence of human evil and works to eradicate as much as possible. The girls definitely followed these beliefs. When Meg was having marital problems after her twins were born it was Marmee that told her, \\"A woman's happiest kingdom is her home, her highest honor the art of ruling it not as a queen but as a wise wife and mother.\\" In the end Jo inherits the estate of her rich aunt. Prior to this time in history women were not allowed ownership of property and centainly not the right to vote. A woman was discourged from concerning themselves about politics. But Marmee gently suggests to Meg this may be a way for her and her husband to reconnect. This would also explain why the book is more self-centered on the characters than the realities of the era which are not brought into focus.I would not read the book again but I did feel it was worth reading the first time and I am glad I did. I would very much recommend it to anyone searching for a book that you could relate to the characters and can't help care about them"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"There's a reason why some books like Little Women manage to live on for years and years after it's been written and that is simply because they're wonderful, timeless stories. Little Women is definitely one of them. I still to do this day consider it one of my favorite books, as my tattered copy will prove. You can't help but fall in love with the main characters as you get to know them so well over the length of this book. While I must admit that each time I reread it I hope and pray that by some miracle Jo won't refuse Teddy, I always finish it happy that I was able to be a part of the March's little world. It's a wonderful book for young girls as the lessons to be learned in it are numerous. Read it with your daughter and you won't regret it."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I'm so glad to see that the cover and illustrations for the hardback version of LITTLE WOMEN have stayed the same; this book (along with Frances Hodgson Burnett's A LITTLE PRINCESS) were staples of bedtime reading when I was growing up, and as I became an avid reader on my own later on, LITTLE WOMEN revealed more layers to me. Some people think of it as old fashioned, when actually the novel was considered unconventional in its time, focusing as it does on what is -- for the first half of the book, anyway -- a single parent home made up entirely of women. The girls in this story are DOERS, and their lack of funds don't hold them back from attempting things. (In fact, it pushes them to be imaginative, as when Jo ruins her gloves with lemonade and can't go to a dance, so Meg lends her one of her own clean ones to wear and they both carry a stained one. Genius, Meg.) The second half of the story, especially, has scenes of tender drama, which is one of the reasons the material has been adapted to the screen so successfully and repeatedly over the years. (Was there a dry eye in the house when Winona Ryder came across Claire Dane's dusty childhood trunk in the attic and ran her hands across it?) The bond that the March sisters share is extremely moving, and like all good drama, it's based in recognizable human emotion. I've always been at sea when my gay friends report that they've &quot;come out&quot; to their brothers or sisters. Aren't siblings the people you walked to school with for years, the people whose diaries you shared or broke into, the people you ran away from home with for an afternoon? How could they not know you to begin with? LITTLE WOMEN is primarily about that bond, and it's a great, malleable dramatic subject."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Have you ever had the life of poverty?Having your father away in the Civil War not knowing when he'll back?Or waking up on Christmas morning not having any presents?Well, you soon know how it feels in the great book Little Women.

Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. Louisa May Alcott's best-known novel is a magnificent achievement."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"THis book was delivered in the condition promised (Brand new and shrink-wrapped). Great price too!Thanks."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"After reading some of the 1 star reviews on this book, I know that some people might not like it because of how nice and perfect and possibly unrealistic the family is. While I have no problem with this viewpoint, I think otherwise. When I read this book, it's sort of like taking a break from the awful lives people live in this time period. It feels nice to just sit back and relax and imagine how nice life would be if, even though there may be arguements, they are small and unimportant compared to the hapiness that you can share with people. Yeah, that might have sounded pretty cheezy, but it's still nice to read some books like that."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"i read books called little women in my school library and i thought the were sieres so there must be a lot of different versions i cant wait to read this even though im only 11 i heared great things about this book and i loved the ones i read in the library i just love to read and i love old books i think its cool to learn that really thats acatally how people lived then and then there were these lucky ones it toght mehow unfair life was and sometimes still is"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I inherited my mother's copy of \\"Little Women\\" when I was young, but always had a bit of trouble reading it. It wasn't until many years later that I noticed the words: \\"modern abridged edition\\" on the cover, and realized on comparison with the full text that my version had been all but chopped to pieces. No wonder I didn't understand anything!So it was a little odd settling down with the proper version of Lousia May Alcott's most famous book, knowing the basic structure of the story, but now having the chance to read it in its entirety. Ironically, Alcott wrote \\"Little Women\\" solely at her publisher's request for \\"a book for girls\\", with Alcott herself writing for purely monetary reasons and with no expectations whatsoever at to how popular it would become. Basing the March family on the Alcotts and her own experiences, Alcott's novel sold two thousand copies (the entire print run) in just one month. Requests for a sequel were inevitable, and so \\"Good Wives\\" was written, a story that is usually combined with \\"Little Women\\" in most copies available today.Quite episodic in nature, the story itself is rather straightforward, concerning four sisters dealing with the family's poverty and their own adolescence whilst their father is fighting in the Civil War. Ultimately the story, not counting the two later sequelsLittle MenandJo's Boys, covers a twenty year span, as Jo (the unofficial protagonist) grows from a fifteen year old to a thirty-five year old. The four girls are more or less counterparts of Alcott and her own sisters, and the author presents four distinct personalities to the reader: Meg, the motherly eldest, who struggles the most with poverty; Jo the tomboyish book-lover (an almost autobiographical portrayal of Alcott herself) who harbors ambitions of becoming a writer; Beth, the angelic and shy homebody; and Amy, the youngest: spoilt, pretty, and artistic.Alongside the girls are a range of supporting characters, including their mother (called \\"Marmee\\" by the girls; a name that is often pronounced phonetically, though in keeping with the New England accents of the time, it would have been pronounced \\"Mommy\\"), the housekeeper Hannah, sharp-tongued Aunt March, and a range of possible suitors for the girls, including their next door neighbor, the mischievous Laurie.It is the relationship between the sisters as well as their bonds with parents, friends and lovers that is the true heart of the book, and it is Alcott's ability to write with realism, wit, and understanding that made \\"Little Women\\" so distinctive, particularly for its time. That Jo was not an idealized heroine, but quite literally the girl next door; and that the girls did not deal with melodramatic adventures, but rather the day-to-day trials of ordinary life, was quite an innovation in the mid 19th century. When the story opens just before Christmas, each of the girls receives a present of John Bunyan'sPilgrim's Progress, a story that is often alluded as the girls learn to master themselves through facing the various obstacles in life.Each girl has their flaws as well as their virtues, and each struggle with their foibles as they grow: Jo's literary ambition, Meg's experiences with the ups and downs of marriage and motherhood, Beth's struggle with her failing health, and Amy's growing maturity and attempts to overcome her desire for marry for money. Though in many ways Amy is the only one who doesn't seem to grow as much as the other girls; that is we are *told* of a change, but do not *see* it in a particularly vivid way. By the end of the story, she seems a little too perfect, and the fact that she ends up marrying a very wealthy man doesn't do much for the \\"marry for love, not money\\" tract.On the one hand, it is rewarding to see the girls overcome their faults and become wiser, more contented young women, yet at the same time, it is their flaws that make them such loveable characters in the first place. At the end of part one, in which Mr March looks at Jo and says: \\"I see a young lady who pins her collar straight, laces her boots neatly, and neither whistles, talks slang, nor lies on the rug as she used to do,\\" one can't help but be slightly disappointed at the change.Another bad side-effect is the fact that Alcott can often slip into sentimentality and moralizing (something she apologizes for a couple of times in the text itself: \\"I dare say my reader has fallen asleep during this little homily\\"). Being written as a \\"girl's book\\", which were naturally meant to extol womanly virtues, it's only expected that some sermonizing would be present. But often they're completely unnecessary, particularly in the earliest chapters in which the girls learn a valuable lesson, only for Marmee to reiterate what's obviously just been learnt. Though the sincerity of the girls is inspirational, the preaching gets on one's nerves.As strange as it may seem by today's standards, \\"Little Women\\" was considered a revolutionary novel in regards to the feminist movement of the age. In a time when women were still expected to be subservient and obedient, Alcott created female characters that were not wilting flowers nor passive damsels in distress, but realistic women who were each deeply flawed in their own way, with their own dreams, goals and ambitions. Likewise, although the girls eventually marry, Alcott is careful to give them husbands that are complimentary to their natures, and with whom the girls often have disagreements with (some of the best and funniest chapters involve the tiffs between Meg and her husband John). In this case, marriage does not come at the end of the story, but the middle, and there is no such thing as a \\"perfect happy ending\\" - only life in all its joys and disappointments.Of course, despite all this, there may still be some dissonance between the book's values and a contemporary audience. Meg is ultimately expected to be a good little housekeeper, and any discord in the household is naturally placed on her shoulders. Despite her ambition to become a writer (and the hope that she'll one day write a famous novel, which she eventually does in \\"Jo's Boys\\"), Jo ends this particular tale as the mistress of a boy's school, married to a much older man. Amy goes to Europe with the desire to become a famous artist, but on being confronted with the splendors of Rome, realizes that she's aiming too high and instead choosing to focus on helping other people realize their goals (though to be fair, Laurie comes to the same conclusion in regards to his music). In all cases, romantic love trumps ambition, and though there's certainly nothing wrong or invaluable about being a loving wife and mother, they are deemed incompatible with having a career; something that may not sit well with today's \\"have it all\\" readers.There are certainly some mixed messages at work in the book, perhaps born out of Alcott's own uncertainty over the issue. A feminist herself, Alcott remained a self-described \\"literary spinster\\" throughout her life, but although she tells us that for Jo: \\"To be independent, and earn the praise of those she loved, were the dearest wishes of her heart,\\" she also has Marmee, that font of wisdom, tell us that: \\"To be loved and chosen by a good man is the best and sweetest thing which can happen to a woman.\\" Yet it is in these seeming contradictions between the freedom of a career and the warmth of a family, (as well as the rewards to be found in both of them) that the interest in \\"Little Women\\" lies.But possibly the one aspect of the book that sparks the most debate is the relationship between Laurie and Jo. Throughout the course of \\"Little Women\\" the two best friends seem destined for one another, sharing the same interests and fun-loving spirits...but as it turned out, Alcott had other plans for them. After the immense popularity of \\"Little Women\\" Alcott was inundated with letters from young readers who requested a sequel, simply because they wanted to see Jo and Laurie get married. Alcott was disappointed with what we call \\"shipping\\" today, but which Alcott herself termed \\"lovering\\", writing in her journal:\\"I don't like sequels, but publishers are very perverse and won't let authors have their way, so my little women must grow up and be married off in a very stupid style.\\" In a letter to her friend, she expressed her frustration with the mindset of her readers, all of whom were simply interested in: \\"who the little women marry, as if that was the only end and aim in a woman's life.\\" She went on to say: \\"I won't marry Jo to Laurie to please anyone...Jo should have remained a literary spinster, but so many enthusiastic young ladies wrote to me clamorously demanding that she should marry Laurie, or somebody, that I didn't dare refuse and out of perversity went and made a funny match for her. I expect vials of wrath to be poured upon my head, but rather enjoy the prospect.\\"So if you were upset at the fact that Laurie and Jo didn't end up together, then you can blame the scores of female fan \\"shippers\\" of the early 19th century, who wrote in so many letters to Alcott asking when the two of them would marry that she eventually wrote something else out of spite. Later in \\"Jo's Boys\\", the character of Nan plays out Alcott's original plans for Jo: as a female character who has no interest in marriage, but rather forges out a successful career and happy, independent life for herself.The popularity and endurance of \\"Little Women\\" speaks for itself. Although the title may naturally imply that it is only for girls, Alcott has some very astute things to say about gender relationships, and male readers may discover a thing or two about the opposite sex (boys, have you ever wondered what girls get up to behind closed doors? This may be set over one hundred years ago, but the essentials haven't changed). In any case, Alcott's general wit and warmth makes this a book that is accessible to a wide range of readers - it would be a shame for the title to prejudice readers against it when there's so much to be learnt and enjoyed from it."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Every Christmas, I enjoy watching various versions of \\"Little Women\\" on video. My favorite is the latest one starring Susan Sarandon, Winona Ryder, and Christian Bale . . . lovely, true to the spirit of the original work, and the scene depicting the death of Beth (played to perfection by Claire Danes) breaks my heart, no matter how many times I see it. AS FOR THE BOOK . . . it is dated and preachy and quaint for the modern reader, no doubt; still, it is easy to see why the work has endured through the years. All the universal themes of family togetherness (and the pain of separation), self-sacrifice, faith, joy, love, and hope in times of war and deprivation and hardship (what family today with a loved one in a war zone could not relate to the March family of 1861?) -- we recognize ourselves in the book despite the Victorian mannerisms and concerns, and the sometimes stiff dialogue Alcott produced. I know I read it years ago, but I've forgotten so much detail (or perhaps the movies have dulled my recollection of the book, which is quite likely) that it seems almost a first reading.

When Beth died, tears poured down my mother's face and into the stew. Even though I am 62 now, I still remember how Jo gave me the desire to be a writer with a passion that still burns today.

I finished reading it a few weeks ago and already feel the urge to read it again. Alcott's novel presents subtle yet astute viewpoints regarding the tension between the traditional domestic roles of females and the push for women's rights which was beginning in the mid-1800s. Pay close atttention to the character of Beth to see Alcott's view on how overly-domestic women fair in the modern/changing world. I will say, though, that the ending seemed very forced, almost contrived.Also, Amazon suggests that 9-12 is a good age to read this book...maybe that was true 50 years ago, when society read more and was more literate in general, but for today, I would personally suggest 12-14 as the perfect age to read this book (for average readers)."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I'd read this book 60 years ago and had forgotten how beautifully it was written.

She later revised some of Jo's colorful language and use of slang as well as altered the appearance of Laurie and Marmie in order to appease the disgruntled \\"contemporary\\" public (who apparently didn't approve of foreign-looking men or stout women). In 1880, she published an edited version along with the Part 2 (Little Wives) that is included in most modern Little Women books. So, actually, The Whole Story uses the absolute original story. It has wonderful information on the era sprinkled throughout and a plethora of photographs and illustrations which is the hallmark of the Whole Story unabridged editions of classics. While I do wish The Whole Story series would release Little Wives (separately)...this version is definitely worth buying in conjunction with an ordinary unabridged book that includes the Part 2. That's what I did. I treasure all of the Whole Story series books...they're absolutely phenomenal -- if you're lucky enough to find them.I do think that Amazon should reorganize their lumping together of reviews for classics spanning various editions.

But, I selected this book to read outloud to a woman in a nursing residence who cannot see good enough to read herself. Her hearing is also an issue. Therefore, I read loudly. The errors in spelling make the flow of reading aloud difficult. Otherwise, it gets the point across. My mom read this book to me when I was little, and therefore wanted to share it."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I have loved this book since I was a little girl. My favorite character will always be Jo March. As you read you can just visualize her strong will. I cried when she didn't marry Larie, but she truly loved the professor. The book reminds me of growing up and the relationship with my sisters. A must read!"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This was actually the first book that I read on the kindle available for my phone and I was slightly skeptical.

In the case of Little Woman, there are pictures of fashion, carriages, sample segments of newspaper, information on Pilgrim's Progress (a play put on by the girls), etc. Sometimes it made a section of the text more clear; other times it just added color to the story. A very worthy choice for your library."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I would have rated this book a 5, except the author played with me the whole time, when all I wanted was for her to get down to the point.

I read it first when I was quite young, but even now as I reread it, I never tire of it. Parents, you should buy this for your daughters.

It is wonderful."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little women is nice because Alcott wants to make the world a better place so she tells about a family that goes through hard times and good times.

I loved reading it and I'm sure anyone who takes the time to read it will be just as touched as I along as many others were. This is a great book to read and share with those who you love.

It has humour and warmth writtn into it. A Great book. Really a must-read. If there was a 6 stars mark i would have given it to Little Women:)"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This book is my favorite of Mrs. Alcott's. It's wonderfully done; extremely descriptive. It is realistic, with ups and downs. Each character has its own personality; nothing has ever been like it before, in all my almost 13 years. It really takes you back in time, as if you are really there. My favorite character was Beth; I cried really hard when she died!! Jo was creative; Beth was a darling; Amy was prissy; Meg was vain. I liked how Beth was close to her cats, and I also liked how she \\"took in\\" rejected dolls. I also loved the fact that Jo was a writer, because that's what I am; I just LOVE to write stories, especially about horses. I recomend this book to any old fashioned girl like me."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Have you ever thought about what it would be like to live during the Cicil War? Little women, by Louisa May Alcott is a sterling example of this. In Little Women, there's a family of seven. Marmee(the mom);Meg, Joe, Beth, and Amy(sisters), a maid, and the father who is a chaplain in the Civil War. The sisters are good friends until their handsome neighbor Teddy moves in with his grandfather. Then they start vying each other for his attention. Through all this, there are fires, dances, family problems, etc. Towards the end one of the sisters dies from scarlet fever.Little Women is a book written for middle to high scholl students. The language it is written in, and some of the things that happen would confuse elementary. It;s a very good book for sisters, friends, etc because it teaches you not to become jealous.Little Women can be both sad and humorous at times. Throughout the story the dialouge switches back in forth. For example, when Amy was talking to Joe she said \\"You like Teddy, You like Teddy\\". Then in the same paragraph it talks about there father. At sometimes the girls are happy with each other, while sometimes they are angry. For a chapter at the end it's very sad when one of the sisters dies.The content of the book is very good. It goes back and forth from fictional stories from the civil war to non-fictional stories. A lot of the places in the book are real to. For examole, Virginia. The book teaches a very good moral. Not just for sisters but for anybody. It teaches you not to get jealous, and yearn for things others have or want.If you want to read a fictional story about sisters set in the Civil War, then this book is for you!!"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I just finished reading Louisa May Alcott's Little Women and I thought it was okay. Some of the problems that she wrote about I would not have to worry about today. One problem that I wouldn't have to worry about would be having a good dress to wear to a party,like Jo had to. Not many girls wear a lot of dresses to parties. Some parts of the book were better than others,like when all the girls pitched in money to buy a present for their Mom instead of themselves. Louisa May Alcott also wrote the book kind of like a sequal to Little Women called Little Men,if you would like to know what happens with Jo."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"The story of these four girls and their experiences growing up is one that all readers can relate to. I have read the book multiple times, and each time I do I discover a new thing about these vivacious girls. I would especially recommend this book to anyone with sisters because the relationships between the four sisters is the main focus of the book."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This was the first book I have ever read by Lousia. Through the years I have read ALL her other books but this one remains my favorite. If you read it you will understand why it is a classic!!!"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I have read Little Women nearly annually since I was 8 years old. The story never ceases to amaze me. As a youngster, I related to the tomboy Jo. As a new wife, I laughed out loud at Meg's attempts to make jam. Although I know it is going to happen, I never fail to cry when Beth's &quot;tide goes out easily&quot;. Now that loss has touched my life as an adult, the story becomes even more poignant. I gave this book as a gift to my oldest &quot;little woman&quot; in the hopes she loves this book as much as me."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I read Little Women many times as a pre-teen. I would re-read and cry over the passage where Laurie comes home married to Amy. Now, 25 years later, I recently decided to read it again. It is even better now, reading it with an adult's perspective. The characters are so deeply developed, their Christian faith plays a big role in their lives, the wives they become.....it is even better than I remembered and I'm not even sure why it is considered children's literature. Good for all ages!"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I really like this book, I have really liked every thing I\`'ve read by Louisa may Alcott, I would also suggest reading eight cousins and rose in bloom, and an old fashioned girl"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I think this book is a touching story of a mother and her kids trying to live happy romance and more.

I can't believe I haven't changed my mind about that. It is stunning in that it has so many words I had to look up. Such a shame that novelists today are discouraged to use such language. It is easy enough to read and I would imagine it would be a great one to read to young girls piecemeal on holidays. I really enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"A truly heart warming story. Even if you want to give up pretty please with cherries, sprinkles and every thing sweet. I suggest you keep this story in your heart forever. Read it over and over again. It is on the list of my favorite books. Every one in the world would love it, but if you don\`t like it your crazy and need to love it with all your heart and respect."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little Women by Louisa May Alcott is a (boring) fiction book about the four March Girls- Meg, Amy, Jo and Beth, who I can never tell apart. They are poor and their father is at war,and they have all sorts of, um, not really adventures, but you get the point. Well, it tells about their daily lives- not that interesting. Alcott devotes whole chapters to something as trivial as making dinner- and doesn't make it even that interesting. In the end, they are all happy and married with kids, thus giving the message to reach true happiness the ultimate goal must be marriage- not.I can't believe Alcott managed to write 647 pages of this- it was so dang boring! Of course, it had its interesting moments, but for the most part, I can't believe I'm alive, writing this review. Overall, this book hasn't affected me much- just another book.Plot- boringEnding- pretty satisfying, especially because it's the endingFlow- I still don't know which character is which, and the book went from, say, a tea party, to a dinner, and back to the tea party; confusing!Would I buy this book- I already did, but it was free (meh heh heh)Would I reread this book- NO!Bottom line: Must I say it again? BORING!"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"its a great classic novel that teaches many morals and values in the life of a family. it might have a long exposition which you have to patiently wait to get over with. an all age book"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I loved this book!

I was not too excited about having to take this 'American Culture' class, and on top of it being assigned to read this lame book, Little Women. Oh, but how wrong and narrow-minded I was, as this turned out to be my all-time favorite book! We were only assigned to read the first part, but I loved it so much I let my other classes slide to read part two. If you're not too sure about this book, throw your doubt out the window and read it!"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I consider the book Little Women a five star book because it is a well educational story of 4 young ladies that grow up to be women. They learned how to be women by taking care of themselves when there mother left to go help there father since he got sick while fighting in World War 2. Beth got scarlet fever. She was very sick and they sent a telegram to the mother. The mother came home and Beth got better. A few days later the Mr. Lawerence boy brought home a sepcial surpirse...the father. He came home just in time before Beth got sick again. Soon after she died. Amy went off to Europe with her Aunt March and Mr.Lawerence and the boy Mr.Lawerence were there.

They all celebrated and lived happily ever after."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Meg Jo Beth and Amy could be alive today They are the kind of people you care what happens to them and though some of the values are old fashioned the girls were probably modern for their day"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little Women is one of the best books I've ever read. I like the TV show &quot;Little Men&quot; so my mom suggested I read the &quot;beginning of the story.&quot; I was reluctant at first, but once I got into it I couldn't put it down! I like how all of the 4 sisters were close to eachother. Amy really got on my nerves because she was so snobby and ladylike, but all of the other characters were interesting. It is definitely one I'll read again."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Most people either hate or love Salinger's novel because they either relate to it or they don't; Little Women was a novel in the same way. If my 53 year old dad read this, he would not have appreciated it as much as 19 year old me, who loves Jo and Beth the most because they struck a chord in my heart. Alcott, more than any other author, invites you warmly to sit on the couch with the Marches as they laugh, cry, think, and charm you right into their home and their lives. I was a silent cousin while reading this novel, and I still think Jo and Laurie should be together. Feminists, put your guards down because this book is not about submission or female inferiority, it is about overcoming everything with love, both for males and females. Don't watch the movie EVER. You'd strip away all the justice of Alcott's classic by watching the Cliff Notes."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This book is by far the most compelling book of the century. This book shows the struggles and hardships of four girls and the people around them. Throughout the book, there are many difficult situation that the girls have to overcome. If you haven't read this book, you really should because it redefines our modern day concepts of family life and love."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Many people think diferently from me about the point the author wanted to put across in her writing. I think that the author wanted us to see the struggle that everyday life can be for the rich and poor alike.I also thought that she potrayed the girls as wanting to be good, becuase she wanted us to realize that deep down inside of all of us there is a part that wants to do its best."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little Women is a great book for anyone to read! It is a tear-jerker but at the same time it a laugh-out -loud great book. What is everyone waiting for ? Get up and read this great book!"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I'm not usually the type of person who likes to read, but when I started reading &quot;Little Women&quot;, I could not stop. I read for hours a day, often with a flashlight in the middle of the night. I cryed when they cryed, and laughed when they laughed. I felt as if the March sisters were my own, and Marmee was my second mother. As I read, I would loose myself into a world filled with love, warmth, tragedy, and hope. I have two sisters of my own, and as I read, I realized how special they are to me. The book inspired me to be a better person. I recomend this book to any woman, young or old, for the chronicles of the March family are not just a story, but a lesson in the true meaning of life;love."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I was introduced to LITTLE WOMEN at the age of 12 or 13. I have read it scores of times since and loved it unceasingly. I have cried with the March sisters, shared their joys, their tragedies, rejoiced in their triumphs, and laughed at their mishaps. This book captured me as a child and has never let me go. I treasure it and would wish every person could have a chance to read it and treasure it also."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I decided to reread Little Women before reading the Pulitzer Prize-winning March by Geraldine Brook, which is written from the viewpoint of the family's father, off serving as a Chaplain during the Civil War.As always happens, as I read a favorite children's book as an adult, I find things that I love to be reminded of, but also notice how many life messages simply slipped past me during the early reading. There are some great life lessons about marriage and relationships, especially after a child is added to the mix, for example.There were certainly aspects of the book that come across a bit too sweet and cloying, but those are balanced by the images of a young girl Jo (and her mother Marmee) stepping out a bit from the controlling and limiting expectations on women of the time.I read the book now from the viewpoint of a military spouse who has also watched my husband deploy into a war zone. I also do many workshops for military spouses dealing with the current deployments so I know what they deal with. My first reaction was that the March family and mother especially had it pretty good in comparison. They have a fulltime maid Hannah for one thing, something that any military spouse would give a lot to have! But many of the emotions, thoughts and fears of current military spouses are matched in this book (and even more so in March).All in all a great read, a nice view into a totally different time in our history -- now I want to watch the movie again!Kathie Hightower, coauthor of Help!

The print is quite small, due to the book's small size, but the binding is nice for a four dollar book, and my younger sister (for whom I purchased the book) is enjoying her forays into the innocent fun-filled world of Jo, Meg, Beth and Amy. Classic values of modesty, honesty, kindness and love meet challenges such as poverty, death and war, and the March sisters discover that love and faith can overcome even great obstacles. A book every young girl should read!!"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I was looking for an unabridged copy of Little Women, with only Louisa May Alcott's name as authoress.

This edition only goes up to the chapter titled \\"Aunt March Settles the Question.\\" This is because this is the Chrysalis, which is a UK company. In general, the UK publishes Louisa May Alcott's books separately as \\"Little Women\\" and \\"Good Wives.\\" However, in the US both parts of the story have usually been published as one volume entitled \\"Little Women.\\"Otherwise, the story is wonderful and follows four girls in their trials and tribulations. Certainly one can read this book only and get a good story. However, parents who are getting this for their children should also look into purchasing \\"Good Wives\\" or at least getting a US version with both books included. The book is printed on thicker paper than typical paperbacks and has interior color illustrations (watercolor, I think). This book is nicely put together--just remember that the story continues in \\"Good Wives\\"."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"i loved this book soooooo much. i read it 5 times. it still never gets old. i first read it when i was 7. now im 12. istill recomend it to everyone who asks me for a book idea. i give it 5 stars"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"\\"Little Women\\" by Louisa May Alcot fills my heart with suspense, love and joy. Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy go through what any young women goes through: excitment, heartbreak, and acceptance of life.

Any young women would appreciate the girls for their comitment, and love for the world they take role in. I find the story of Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy a page turner, and I can visualize every segment of the heroic tale."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little Women is without doubt the very best book I have ever read. I first picked it up about a year ago in a bookstore when |I was bored, which pretty unusual because I can usually always find something to read.It was the name that caught my eye. I had read a biography of Louisa May Alcott in a Social Studies textbook, and I knew about this book. But I had never read it.It was a small, thick copy in Scholastic Classics Edition. I opened it and the first sentence got mee hooked, about how tomboyish, bookworm Jo March wishes she had presents for Christmas.And then, I read on and on. I learned about grownup, sweet Meg, shy and music-loving Beth, and artistic, pretty Amy. 'But of course I had to leave that bookstore. But my very nice aunt bought the book for me.In that edition the book was 560 pages long, and I finished it in less than three days.This terrific book of love, laughter, friendship, and family is sure to charm everyone who takes the time and patience to read its thick volume. But, believe me, it's WORTH IT!!!"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I read Little Women recently and I would probably reccommend it to anyone that is okay with a sad, romantic book. The main character is Jo, a tomboy growing up in the late 19th century. It is Jo's story as she becomes an adult, and I think it is a great coming-of-age book for both boys and girls. (Girls would probably enjoy it a little more than boys.) Either way, it's a great book and you should read it as soon as you get your hands on it."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"A timeless tale that has a special place in all of our hearts, Little Women. The magical story of four girls having adventures while they lay in wait for their father to come home from the Civil War. In this tale, Meg, the eldest, marries Mr. John Brooke, Teddy's tutor, and has the life she always wanted, like her mother. Meg moved down he road from her family, and had twins, Demijohn and Daisy, becoming the model mother she always wanted to be. After Jo had \\"scorned\\" Teddy's love for her, Teddy went off to Europe to sulk. Around that time, Beth was getting weaker. With all this stress, Jo went away to New York. There, she met Professor Bhaer. She fell in love with him as he helped her to cultivate her writings, helping her to write a book based on her childhood. He promised her that he would help her get it published. Beth was getting sicker and sicker, so Jo went home to help Beth. Beth died in Jo's arms. Professor Bhaer came to the March's doorstep to give Jo her published book. He asked Jo to marry him, she said yes. When Aunt March died, Jo inherited her plantation. She realized, I love boys, why not fill this house with boys that she would grow to love. So the plantation became \\"Jo's School for boys.\\" The rooms were filled with the boys that she loved very much. Amy went abroad with Aunt March to help cultivate her art. There she met the crabby, snobbish, horrid side of Teddy that had come out because of Jo's answer. The more time they spent together in Europe, the more time they got to grow to love each other. They were married in Europe and Amy got the wealth and prominence she longed for as a child. This book is a wonderful tale for all. We all should read this book in our life. It belongs in our lives.This book had very detailed characters. Teddy is so detailed in the book, and you can actually hear them talking and his point of view on things. When Teddy got in a fight with Mr. Laurence, his grandfather, about going to college, he was so mad that when Jo meekly knocked on his door, he fired a mean insult and threatened to hurt his grandfather if he knocked one more time. Amy, at times, can be very nice in the story, but other times she was lying to make herself seem bigger than she was, and would even the score pretty well. When Jo, Teddy, Meg, and John Brooke went to the theater, Amy begged and pleaded to go, but Jo was firm, when she said no, she meant no. As they were leaving, Amy yelled at the top of her lungs to Jo, and said, I will get you back! (Not the exact words) When they came back from the theater, Jo wanted to write, but she could not find her book. She asked around, and then saw Amy watching the fire burn her book! Jo started yelling that she hated her and never wanted to talk to Amy ever again. Amy never even said she was sorry. Jo gets very fired up when something bad happens to one of her friends or family. When Amy was in school, she got in trouble, and the teacher struck her hand, and she had to stand up in front of the whole class, humiliated. When Jo heard about this, she was yelling, writing nasty letters, and was thinking about go down there and giving that teacher a piece of his mind.This story was very realistic. When Meg received John Brooke's invitation to wed, she refuses. Again and again, John asks, but she still says no. Rich, snobby Aunt March \\"overhears\\" and commends Meg for making such a decision, because John is dirt poor and money is one of the things that makes marriage run smoothly. Meg is appalled that Aunt March would say that. Aunt March also said that if she didn't marry in wealth, she would be cut out of her will. Meg tells Aunt March off, and tells her that John is a kind; caring, man and He would love her whether she was dirt poor or a princess. Then she realizes that she does love John, and she accepts the invitation to wed. Jo was asked to wed by Teddy, but she said no. The reason she said no was because they would always fight, like they did, with both of their tempers, they would never have a calm, cool, and collected argument, and they would never be really happy. Of course, Teddy did not understand at the time, but what Jo was trying to say was that she didn't want to be trapped in an unhappy marriage. Lastly, when Professor Bhaer proposed to Jo, He told her that his hands were empty. That meant that he would not have any money and could never buy the things that she would like. She replied, that his hands weren't empty anymore, and then she put her hands in his. This meant that she didn't care whether he had money or not, as long as he loved her, for she never cared about money, social status, or new clothes. She just loved Professor Bhaer.This book was very long. I loved this book, but she kept explaining every single little detail. When Beth died, she didn't just die, she died with an expression on her face. An expression that showed that she was content and ready to die, because she knew that there was nothing that the doctor could do. An expression that sent Jo into crying uncontrollably when Jo died. An expression to make Hannah, the Marches \\"live in cook\\", into sobbing while she was cooking, and saying \\"Too young, she was too young. She had so much strength left. See what I mean? When Amy burned Jo's book she was writing, Jo kept thinking about it, which made her even madder. When Jo and Teddy went ice staking on the pond, Amy came, but Jo and Teddy ignored her. Then, Amy fell under the ice. After that, Jo beat herself up over being mean to Amy, she even thought about either running away, or being Amy's eternal servant. When Jo was apologizing to Amy, tears were flowing and flowing down her face, and, one half of the chapter was about Jo regretting ever being mad at her. During the book, Demi, Meg's son, would get out of the bed during the night to be with his mother. John would not allow this, so every time he got up, John would take him back to his room, talk to him about why he should not get up and pop his bottom. This would go on for pages and pages without any progress. Finally, he stopped.This book is for everybody. I suggest for those to have the patience to read a book this long, I quite enjoyed it for it was a challenge; to read it and meditate on the lessons it shows usB. Rimando"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I first read Louisa May Alcott's \\"Little Women\\" the summer between 4th and 5th grades. I was absolutely riveted by the story and characters and clearly remember sitting on the porch steps, my nose in the book. I cried when I reached the conclusion, because I was afraid that I had just read the best book in the world, and that I would never find anything else as good. The local librarian convinced me otherwise. I cannot recommend this novel highly enough - for people of all ages. It will always have a special place in my heart.Ms. Alcott writes about four young women, living in New England, during a period of much strife in America - the Civil War. They are self sufficient, creative and well educated, and each chooses a different life path, traditional and non. Considering the period when the book was written, the author's views on opportunities open to females, restricted though they were by society, is refreshing and liberating. Of course, this was not my focus as a nine year-old. The novel is long, but that never bothered me as a young girl, or much later when I reread it. I didn't want the story to end, actually.Sisters Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy March and their beloved Marmee, (who offers her daughters guidance, comfort and unconditional love), learn to live in genteel poverty while their father, a doctor, is away treating wounded soldiers. This beautifully written classic, chronicles the girls' adolescence through womanhood, with all their trial, tribulations, and joys.Much of the novel focuses on Jo, the second daughter, and a gifted writer. She is very much a tomboy, and an avid reader who writes plays which the girls act-out with delight and exuberance. When they meet their new next-door neighbor, the wealthy, lonely Theodore Laurence, (called Laurie), they befriend him and invite him to become the only male member of their exclusive theater ensemble. Laurie becomes an important person in all of their lives, and the March family in his. Margaret, (Meg), the oldest, is quite lovely - a young woman with traditional values and tastes. Sensitive Elizabeth, (Beth), is the most fragile sister -quiet, caring and timid. And Amy, the youngest, is a gifted artist, with a tremendous sense of self-importance.Together they cope with their father's absence and their fear for his safety, severe illness in the family, a death, lack of money precluding many of life's small luxuries, romance, love, marriage and many glorious adventures. In the second part of the novel, Meg marries, Jo's writing becomes a priority, as does Amy's art. During a time of impoverishment, they learn how good it feels to give to those who are much needier than themselves. This aspect of the book is very moving. Ms Alcott brings her characters to life on the page. All of them, even minor personages, are extremely well developed.\\"Little Women\\" was first published in two parts in 1868 and 1869. The author drew from her own childhood experiences to dramatize the lives of the March family. The character \\"Marmee\\" is based on her own mother, Abigail May, (Abba), Alcott, whom she described as having: \\"A great heart that was home for all.\\" Like Marmee, Abba was loving and passionate about women's rights, temperance, and abolition. A truly compelling and wise novel!JANA"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Louisa May Alcott's novel, Little Women, is truly a classic story of family love. The novel chronicles the life of the four March sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy, during the time of the civil war.Each girl has her own unique characteristics and traits which Ms. Alcott does a brilliant job bringing each of them to life. Meg, the oldest, womanly, beautiful and proper; Jo, the author and tomboy; Beth, the frail gentle caring soul; and Amy, the youngest, the vain artist.Each of the girls lean on each other for support while their father is away at war and their mother taking care of the sick. The girls entertain each other by putting on plays in their attic that Jo has written. The girls also befriend their neighbor, Laurie, who falls in love with Jo.Throughout the years the girls experience Meg's courtship and marriage to Laurie's tutor, John; Beth's sickness and brush with death; Amy's venture overseas to study and travel with Aunt March; and Jo's travel to New York to \\"escape\\" and further her passion for writing. It is there that Jo meets Fridrich.This classic novel of home, family and love, inspired by the author's own life, will linger in your heart long after you have turned the last page."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \\"Little Women\\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature. Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.Sure, usually classics are hard to read.

There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today.

I enjoyed the book alot.Read about Meg, the pretty and mature one, Jo, the tomboy, Beth, frail and quiet, and Amy, the spoiled and confident one. You can relate the these &quot;little women&quot; as you read.But don't forget loving Marmee, fun and lovable Teddy, and mysterious but caring Mr. Lawrence.I devoured every page of the book. I read almost 100 pages each day! The only part I found somewhat boring were the chapters about Jo in New York. Well the letters were a bit boring.There are so many memorable moments in this book: Meg's vanity fair, Jo's haircut, Amy's punishment and humiliation at school, Beth's sickness, the birth of Daisy and Demi, and Jo's school. Read this book to be transported to the world of little women."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Why give your child an adaptation of a classic?The original book IS a classic because it's that good, but it's not intended to be an easy reader. There are lots of references to Dickens, 19th century schools of thought and people and places of the times.You can read the real book young-- I read it in 6th grade, and it's still one of my faves.But your child will not get it until they are much older, not matter how gifted they are!!!!!!!!!!!!An adaptation is not the answer. It's like feeding your child a pint of spaghetti sauce that has been drowned in a quart of water--the original is there, but the flavor is gone. And so it the nutrition!!!There are plenty of books your child will enjoy and RELATE to. Wait to read the real thing. Or if you really insist on exposing them to the story before they can read it, let them see one of the film versions first--they were all pretty good."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"The story line is quite excellent, I love the words the Louisa uses!

Why? Because we can always relate to the characters.My 12-year-old daughter, who is a modern child of the modern world, loves the book as much as her mom. We like to talk about the characters, analyze their behavior and choices.i don't agree when people says this book tells the girls to become housewives. It does not. Sadly, those were still the times when women did not have many choices, but it did not stop them following their dreams (especially Jo).This book also teaches us to be grateful for the opportunities we have today--the ones that the little women did not have."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I am so glad knowing that I have books such as this to read and enjoy.

And then I want to say to aaman or whatever your name is, come on. Really? Did you have to write TWO reviews on how bad this book was?

I remembering hearing about it a little when I was younger and thinking it was fluffy boring stuff, but I love this book! It is now one of my favorites, right up there at the top with the Lord of the Rings trilogy and A Tale of Two Cities! Alcott's writing is not stiff or formal, but rather personable and believable. I fell in love with the March sisters and laughed at their idiosyncrasies and cried at their heartaches (I did!). There are even a couple parts in the book, relating to managing anger and nurturing marriage, that spoke deeply to me and have helped me in my personal life. Even the poetry \\"written\\" by the March sisters in different parts of the book are amazing.This is a must-read! It is also an easy read.

The way Ms. Alcott developed these characters made me fall in love with them and think about them even when I wasn't actively reading the book. Once finished, I found myself wondering what happend next to the characters and how they lived the rest of their lives. Not something I usually think about after finishing a story. Beautiful book and beautifully written."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This story is about 4 sisters living in the mid 1800, somewhere near Washington, Philly, or NY. It chronicles their life from puberty to adulthood and is a warmhearted tale about love and loss. I found it funny, the customs of courtship especially and laughed out loud often.The story is driven by a very lively dialogue, making it a quick read. The Characters are well developed, but as a history buff, I missed the events of the outside world, war, prejudice, politics... Though it does tell of the morals, customs, and decorum of the times in detail.A great book for girls and women. It illustrates how much the roles of women have changed. Written by Alcott in the time in which she lived, and I believe that her Character Jo may have been modeled on her own experience as a woman and a author."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I had put off reading this for several decades, imagining it to be overly-girly and saccharine.

Little Women leaches lessons, and tells a thoughtful story of a family who comes close to losing everything but manages to live happily and love each other no matter what. Some tragic things happen, but the March family definitely cares about everyone that comes into their lives and stays strong even while the man of the house is fighting in the Civil War.

Jo, Meg, Amy, and Beth show us all of the mountains a girl could encounter.Meg, the oldest is strong and beautiful. Beth, slowly washing away like a wave upon the sand. Amy, the youngest and fiercest, would marry for wealth. Jo, fits in her own category. These historical \\"little women\\" are an inspiration.In my eyes the girls should be read by all.

Most of us are well aware of the actual story, so I shalln't address it other than to say that it was quite well written and an attention grabber, with a couple of slow parts. This book is a gift. It came quickly from Amazon. It is a 300ish page hardback with moderate sized text. It is quality material, pages and binding. It is well worth the price. I recommend reading this book for all children, \\"growing\\" empathy for the opposite sex for boys as well as providing models for girls. It is an essential addition to the libraries of children's depts of public libraries, elementary and junior high schools, and a supplemental text for undergraduate courses in Victorian literature.

A MUST-read!"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"very timely delivery. got for granddaughter and know she will love it. every young girl should read this book."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"My first actual introduction to Little Women came from watching the Winona Ryder version of the film on a snowy, beautiful day in New England during my sophmore year of high school. I immediately fell in love with the movie and tracked down the book in my library. I read a few pages of it, couldn't get into it, and brought it back to school unread. And that was that (sadly this happened with a few classics that weren't required of me). I ultimately decided that I should give Little Women another shot due to my love of the film. I'm so glad I did.Okay, sure some of the views in this book (one being that a woman's worth was determined on how well she kept house) did prick my feminist nerves a little bit, but I did keep in mind that this was a wildly different time than the one I live in now. The book was a bit on the preachy side, but Little Women had such a humble and homey feel to it that I really didn't mind being preached at most of the time.Now, on to The Little Women...I was endeared by all of the characters in this book (Marmee, Hannah, etc.), but of course I was mostly endeared by the little women (and Laurie). I just loved Meg, Beth, Jo, and Amy (to some extent, at least). My favorite was definitely Jo. She was just so strong, independent, and marched to the beat of her own drum. And I adored her relationship with Laurie. When I finished the film, I remember thinking (HUGE SPOILER FOR THE END HERE) \\"Laurie ends up with Amy?!??!? What a rip-off!\\" Even while reading the book, I kept hoping that I would turn the page and Jo would end up with Laurie.On the one hand, I thought that Jo and Laurie were perfect for each other, but on the other hand, I loved that they had such a strong friendship that not even unrequited love could ruin it. However, I still don't like that Laurie ended up with Amy. Out of all the sisters, she was the one I was least endeared by. I would've loved nothing more than to drop her down a peg or two (or six). However, nothing can be done about it at this point. The fact that I'm so into whom should end up with whom just shows how attached I am to Little Women. (END OF SPOILER)So, I absolutely loved and adored Little Women. I found it to be one of those classics that's just incredibly easy to read that even those whom don't have much experience in reading classics (like me) can understand the language without much difficulty. Little Women was just an adorable and sweet book that I know I'm going to re-read this book for years to come."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"My mom encouraged me to read this story when I was 11. It was a bit too mature for me then, but I enjoyed it so much at 13. I identified with both Jo and Beth. I noticed Jo's literary bent and Beth's inherent shyness in myself.My British mom owned two volumes of Alcott's story--Little Women and Little Wives (sometimes known as Good Wives). Little Wives or Good Wives is simply Little Women, Part II in the U.S. As a young girl, I preferred the story of the girls before they married. As I grew older, I appreciated Part II or Little Wives so much more.I didn't often re-read the entire books. I had my favorite chapters. I just loved the chapter--Experiments--when Marmee permits the girls to enjoy the first week of their summer vacation with no household chores. It ends with them all thoroughly fed up with their life of leisure. Jo especially feels the need for work and gives a dinner party with disastrous results.Another favorite chapter of mine was when Meg goes to \\"Vanity Fair,\\" a weekend of frivolity at her wealthy friend's home ending in a ball where the rich girls lend her a gown to replace her old torn one. With the help of makeup and frills, they make her into someone quite different, taking away from some of the freshness and innocence she still possessed at 17. This is the night when she overhears a couple of old biddies talking about how good it would be for the March family if Meg could manage to marry the wealthy Laurence boy (Laurie). They were convinced that Mrs. March had her plans for the two.But Alcott made it very clear that Marmee was quite a different sort of mother--she wanted nothing but happiness and love for her daughters, and she didn't believe that a great deal of money was necessary in order to be happy.The moral lessons in this book abound. The sickness and death of Beth are looked upon as life experiences more than terrible tragedies, and death is seen as a beginning to a new life. Beth talks about how she'll miss Jo even in \\"heaven,\\" and Jo says after Beth's passing, \\"We must thank God that Beth is well at last.\\"Meg thumbs her nose at cranky, wealthy Aunt March when the older woman says that should Meg marry her financially-strapped suitor, John Brooke, that she'll inherit none of her money. She lets her know in no uncertain terms that love means far more to her than money.Jo gives up writing her \\"potboilers\\"--the violent, mawkish thrillers that her German professor friend hates and instead pens a touching story about her sister, Beth, and wins his approval and a marriage proposal. She has already turned down Laurie's proposal because she realizes that although she loves her \\"boy\\" as a friend that she needs something different in a husband.So there are many lessons, but I never felt as a child that I was reading a book of sermons. I felt as though I were reading about real people and I learned to care about them. I loved all of it--the fashion talk--the way Meg and Amy cared so much about style and how Jo would carry a lemonade-stained glove crumpled up in her hand and wear a gown that had fireplace burns on the back of the skirt and just laugh and enjoy herself.I read all the Alcott books to my daughter when she was ten. When I read the final words of Jo's Boys, \\"Let the curtain fall forever on the March family,\\" the tears rolled down her face. I remember just a while after I had given birth to my daughter thinking, \\"Oh, wonderful, I'm going to share Little Women with her--what a joy!\\""},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I read this as a young girl and love it even today.

Even as an adult, this is still a wonderful, touching story, and is a refreshing breath of fresh air in a world that's become increasingly jaded."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"\\"Christmas won't be Christmas without any presents.\\"Everyone is no doubt familiar this opening line. It comes from Little Women, the beloved classic of the four young March girls. Meet sixteen-year-old Meg, the plump and matronly oldest sister; Jo, the awkward and rambunctious tomboy; Amy, the spoiled and artistic blond; and Beth, the quiet and reserved youngest sister. With their father away at war, the girls grow up under the watchful eye of Marmee.Of course, the March family is not perfect, which is why we love them. Meg succumbs to vanity a party when she borrows a dress that is far too stiff with a train that is far too long. She also fears during dances that her earrings will fall off. Jo refuses to forgive her sister Amy for an act of vengeance, until a skating disaster reunites them. Amy receives the strap at school for ignoring a rule about candy. And Beth loses a beloved bird during a disastrous week when the girls experiment with idleness. Even the one who most often instills moral guidance, Mrs. March, admits that it's taken her over forty years to only partially cure her anger.While the entire family is creative, Jo is the writer amongst them. This is my main reason for liking her best. We're both always reading. Jo likes to receive books as presents, is most attracted to homes where the owners have libraries, and typically cites examples from literature to prove her points. We're also both always writing. Jo writes plays and contributes news to the family newsletter. She loves sharing stories about what happens in her life. I also most identify with her habit of getting herself into scrapes.Despite the absence of their father, the family is close knit. The Marches sing together. They help the needy, even to the point of giving up their Christmas breakfast to help a starving family. Not being rich themselves, they produce their own plays and a family newspaper for entertainment. Under the moral direction of their mother, they also learn many life lessons. I embraced many of the principles myself such as refusing to let the sun go down on my anger. Little Women continues to be one of my favorite girl books."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This is a coming of age tale chonicling the lives of the March Sisters. Jo March being the real main character. If you have enjoyed the movie. Then you will love the book as it does continue past where the movies left off. With a loving mother and a father off to war the girls find themselves working, living and laughing. ITs an amazing book."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This classic novel is a must read for everyone. I found it to be well written and most entertaining. Isn't it wonderful that we live in an age where books can be stored on a computer. Amazon.com is better than a bricks and morter bookstore, if you ask me."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I just finished reading this book and I liked it a lot. The first three quarters of Little Women were amazing, couldn't stop reading. The last quarter was slow. I had to skip a chapter or two to keep from dozing off, but the ending was very nice."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"From the very first time I read Little Women (at about age 9) it immediately and firmly established itself as one of my ultimate-favorite-forever books. As a young girl I took immediately to Jo, and from that moment on wanted to become a writer. I remember even attempting to write a story about girls using the same formal, slightly-affected-19th century style as Alcott (blushing). I soon outgrew that, but the desire to be a writer never left and even still hasn't quite died in me, although life has gotten in the way and I doubt that I will ever write a book.Yes, Little Women is old-fashioned, sometimes affected and often moralistic -- particularly in the first half -- with a strong emphasis throughout on \\"being good\\" and Marmee turning practically every event in their lives into a teachable (lecturing) moment for her daughters. And yet, for all that it remains firmly ensconed as not just one of my favorites, but as my ultimate comfort read. There is just something so warm and soothing about this sweet, sentimental and often funny story of a close-knit family in simpler times and its gentle but insightful look at many aspects of human nature.And now thanks to this wonderful audio version (which I have listened to twice already -- I can't even count the number of times I've read a printed version) I have a new way to enjoy this much-loved classic. Recorded Books always uses excellent narrators, and Barbara Caruso is no exception.Now if I could only get my hands on audio versions of Little Men and Jo's Boys, so I could once again enjoy those favorites, also...."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I read this book when I was very young and I was surprised to find it held up as well for me as it did when I reread it. Although the religious undertones are pronounced, the story still draws you in -- you want to know what happens to these girls and their world is very vividly created.Like many free Kindle books, there are multiple typos. However, it didn't really detract from the reading experience for me."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I have just re-read \\"Little Women\\" and found it even more intriguing then the first time I read it as a preteen. As I enter my 40s, I am thoroughly enjoying reading the books that kept me enthralled endless nights. I hope that the person who left the bad review does not give up on the \\"classics\\", and that they will find one that sticks with them forever. There really are some that follow a more predictable path and have that happy ending s/he is looking for. I plan on introducing this edition to my soon to be eight year old as she explores the new world of reading."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"My grandma really likes this book and I've wanted to read it for a long time. I finally did one day when I saw it on my friend's bookshelf and asked to borrow it (to which, of course, she agreed; we exchange books as often as we exchange words). I read it in a week and when I finished it I thought, I should have read this years ago!! I went to the library the same day I found out there were sequels. Perhaps the conversations are a little too long; and some of the old mannerisms hard to understand, but stick it out for the whole thing and you won't be sorry! And one more thing -- read it even if you're an adult or a boy. It isn't just for twelve-year-old girls (excuse the fact that this was written by one); and it isn't about sisters making calls and gossiping. It's about life and growing up and everyone on the planet should read it!Now I hope I've made my point; I have to go to the library now to get Little Men."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little Women has been an endearing classic since its publication, and it has touched the hearts of many people. However, many reviews already comment on the story, and I only wish to comment on a particular edition, particularly the Penguin classics one. Not only does it have a beautiful cover illustration of the four sisters, it has plenty of end notes printed in the back for a better understanding of the text. Although Alcott's language is not convoluted in any way, the culture the four sisters lived in is very different from ours, and thus there are some idioms or expressions that are now archaic. The notes help explain such terms very well. There was some confusion about one of the editions not having both parts, but rest assured, Penguins includes both parts of the story. Furthermore, the introduction states that this particular edition contains no altercations or editing that some later texts contain, and is presented as Alcott originally intended. Sadly, this edition has no illustrations besides the one on the front cover, and thus may not be the most ideal edition for children. However, Penguins is the perfect edition for those seeking a lovely copy and a fantastic read. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"In Little Women, you will meet the March sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth & Amy who live with their mother, Marmee, and their maid Hannah, during the Civil War. The first half of the novel takes place while their father is away, serving in the war. Each sister has a distinct personality, a reader, an artist, a musician, the quiet one. You will get to know this family in touching little stories of their daily life. Each chapter seems to set up a moral lesson for the reader to learn. We also meet a wonderful set of neighbors, Mr. Laurence and his nephew \\"Laurie\\" who quickly find a place as part of the March family.The second half of the novel, focuses on the girls as they leave their childhood and begin their journey into adult life. Lessons of friendship, family, and love are covered as we join the characters through the ups and downs of life, good times and bad. It seems that Louisa May Alcott used her own family as the basis for the stories in Little Women, basing the character Jo on herself. It is amazing how though the book was written in the late 1800's, so many things about humans remain the same. The foundations of life that are important in friendships, family & love don't change through time, as Alcott has shared with us. This is a book that young and old can read and appreciate."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \\"Little Women\\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature. Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. Louisa May Alcott's best-known novel is a magnificent achievement."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"The book is a classic and the price was unbeatable. If you're looking for a fairly easy read with elements of wholesomeness, love, and fun then this would be a great book for you.

The descriptions of the girls and their friends are missing, as are descriptions of their clothes, home, etc. Alcott herself wrote (ch. 1), \\"...young readers like to know 'how people look.'\\" I question the decision to leave out the descriptive passages as they are some of the most interesting writing, especially to younger readers."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I read this book when I was 12 years old. I had to read it for school-it was a desperate last choice for the required reading. Boy, didn't I see this coming! It took a while, I will offer that (I eventually had only read half by the test.) But it changed my life. I model myself after Marmee, the loving and kind mother. This book taught me to have self respect and hold myself with dignity. I taught me to be polite and respectable. Throughout the turmoil of adolescene, with kids growing up to model pop culture icons and growing up too fast, with sex and drugs littering the road to adulthood, I held myself like a lady. Thank you, library, for having little selection. This book changed my life. Everyone has to read it. After that book, I read more classics, and let me tell you they are lovely. I mean this with all my heart, when I say that Little Women is the purest, realest, lovliest novel I have ever known. Thank you, Louisa.

I love all of Louisa May Alcott's books dearly, and I seem to keep coming back to this one. Who cannot laugh with the Alcott sisters when Jo burns Meg's hair off? Who cannot shed at least a few tears when sweet, gentle Beth dies? Whose heart cannot be ripped apart in agony when Jo rejects Laurie's declaration of love for her? This book is a masterpiece. It's a role model - an encourager. To the person who said that the Marches were the &quot;perfect&quot; family - I dearly hope to have a family as good as they when I grow up. I feel like the Marches are my family! Read the book.

This \\"Deluxe Edition\\" is a disgusting display of...I don't know what. The cover has nothing to do with the story. Cartoon scribbles of girls with pimples?

And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today.

Through many things the girls never forget what is important, their family. The book progresses as the girls grow older and it is a great novel. My friends know I'm a fast reader but they took one look at it and told me that it looked so boring that they bet me it would take me weeks to finish. Boy were they surprized when I was on the first page a week later, they said &quot;told yah so&quot; and I said that they were wrong and I was rereading it! I became so ingrossed in it that they accutually let me tell them what it was about and they hate reading. They still haven't read it but thats their loss!"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I chose to read Little Women for my 6th grade English book report because I had heard that it was a really great book as well as a great American novel. I am 12 years old and really love to read. I have to say that this book was very challenging, with a lot of new words, but it was worth the extra time and effort.Right from the start you see the four main characters, who are sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy along with Mrs. March (Marmee) working together to get through the hardship of being without their father, Mr. March, who is off to war. The way the family cares about each other and people who are even less fortunate than they are is really a great lesson. There are funny parts, sad parts and really unexpected turns to this story.I really enjoyed getting know all the characters and REALLY loved Jo! Everyone who has read this book says that I'm a lot like her. I think anyone who reads this book will have fun seeing which girl they most are like. I thought all of them had really great personalities, most of the time...just like me.I really enjoyed the book more than the movie (the Katherine Hepburn one) because the book is loaded with details and I was able to picture the people and the scenes in my mind better (in my opinion) than the movie did. So DON'T skip the book and just watch the movie!!This book is really long, so make sure you're up for the challenge. But if you want a way to pass a rainy day (or even a snowy one), this is one of the greatest books to curl up with."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I've only read it fifty or more times. At one time in my life I read it through and started right over again at the end. I could recite large portions of it, as well as the table of contents.I first read this when I was about eight. I didn't understand it at all. Re-read it when I was a few years older and couldn't live without it. My grandma sent me a copy which I later replaced with a better one (the old version of the Children's Classics series) and I passed my first copy on to another LW admirer.I've always enjoyed this book. I remember being thrilled when I was fifteen like Jo is at the beginning of the book. I always liked Jo best... because I felt I was very like her. I've always liked to write. But then the artist in Amy appealed to me as well. I always loved Beth also and her dolls and cats. Meg was the only one I never felt I could relate to... later on though I re-read the book after a long absence from it and Meg's character seemed much more interesting. There's a charming supporting cast in these pages too... Laurie, John, and the Bhaer... Hannah... Aunt March...I like the Pilgrim's Progress theme of the first half of the book. I think it's so nice that these were four girls who really wanted to do right... and went to the right place for help - the little Books Mother gave them under their pillows... There is humour and sadness here, much reality, and plenty of charm. I always appreciated the simple but profound style of Louisa May Alcott - it bears up under so many readings very well. It's been about a year since I last read it... I think it's time to pull it off the shelf again.I get a strange feeling that this review is a bit scattered. But if you've gotten the idea that I love and recommend this book, it serves its purpose."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"If you've never read this book, you simply have to! Women of all ages can and will relate to the follies of the little women. From burnt hair to boy troubles to feeling stupid and made into a fool, we've all been there and experienced it in some form or another. My favorite chapter is actually the first one (Though I can recite any passage from any chapter of the book word for word.) A Merry Christmas introduces us to the characters and show the unity and support in American families during the Civil War. Dark Days has you feeling the worst is around the corner, but then some sun peeks through the ice encrusted tree limbs. And though The Valley of Shadow brings about darker days yet, good things come of them, and in the end, life is beautiful! It doesn't matter what your usual style of reading material is, this is by far the greatest work ever published. I have this particular copy and there are about four or five exquisite full color drawings inside and some truly magnificent sketches, aslo. Don't even consider waiting one more second to pick this one up, whether you're a long time fan who's been looking for the perfect copy or a new reader, trust me when I say you will want this one longer than any library in the country will allow it out. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I'm sure there are plenty of reviews on the actual story, so I'll just comment on this particular edition of Little Women. I'm referring to the Grosset & Dunlap Illustrated Junior Library edition. I found this at a local Borders and was immediately attracted to the cover illustration. This is a beautiful book. There are many illustrations throughout the book, both in color and in back and white (the majority are in black and white).When I looked it up on Amazon, I was a little hesitant about buying this book because I had read reviews stating that it only contained the first half of the story (288 pages). The book I bought (at Borders) contains the entire story (643 pages). So, if you like the appearance of this particular edition, but are put off by the lack of the second half, it is available with the complete story. Just be careful when making your selection."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This was one of my favorite books as a child -- and even now, the chapter \\"Dark Days\\" (and other parts, too!) make me cry. I NOW find the character of the mother (\\"Marmee\\") and her constant moralizing annoying; but it's still a great book. And little girls still read it and weep over it (I volunteer in schools and meet a lot of kids).I think this is because the characters of the girls and Laurie are so real and the book has so much more heart than many things published now; but who knows? At different times in my life, I've liked each of the sisters (except Meg) the best and think this is quite common though most of us first like Jo. At any rate, I believe in the characters and find the book touching...even when I'm annoyed by Marmee! I just ignore her moralizing as I probably would have tried to do in real life if she had been my mother.Two facts: If you visit Boston, you can go to Concord and see one of the houses where Louisa May Alcott lived -- it's now a museum and furnished as it would have been in her day. And the conversation in my novel BLOW OUT THE MOON about Litle Women, Jo, and Amy is one of the things that happened in real life just as it does in the book."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"The first time I read Louisa May Alcott's Little Women, I fell in love with the story. Little Women is the story of four girls that were coming of age during the civil war. Each of the girls, all sisters, has different personality traits and characteristics that are developed throughout the book. Meg, the oldest, is the sensible sister, while Jo is hot-headed and independent. Beth is musical and Amy, the youngest, is the more material of the four. The girls grew up in a very close family and strived to support each other in their dreams. But Jo, the second-born, has a difficult time seeing all of them growing up and leaving home. She wants things to remain the same, always. Change is inevitable, however, and throughout the book, the girls' love for each other is strong, as they face different challenges and joys of growing up. They keep their strong sense of family... I thoroughly enjoyed reading Little Women. It has been awhile since I was able to sit down and read a book I so love. Louisa May Alcott's character, Meg, did not hold much interest for me... Amy, the baby of the family, was too materialistic for my taste. The character I related to the most was Jo. I do not know if it is because I am like her, or if it was her spunk that I really liked. I loved to see the blossoming love Laurie had for Jo... I think that Louisa May Alcott did a wonderful job in writing Little Women. I could relate to the book and with how the four sisters were at home with their mother and their father was off doing military things. I grew up with a father in the Navy and he was gone a lot. My mom, brother and I had to take care of things while he was gone. Life goes on even if the whole family is not together.I fell in love with the Little Women at a young age and I hope to read this book to my children as they get older... This is a great book for teaching these things to children."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"A timeless tale of four sisters struggling their way through life during the Civil War. I have read this book more times than I can count, and I still love it. Once I pick it up I can't put it down, lost in this seemingly fantasy world, which was actually quite true more than 100 years ago.My favorite thing about Little Women has to be the characters. Jo, the day-dreaming tomboy, Meg, pretty and proper, Beth, the quiet sweetheart, and little Amy, our artist, who always tried to grow up too fast. Then of course there's Laurie, the tall fun-loving boy-next-door, and so many other fabulous personalities (Aunt March, Fredrick Bauer, Hannah, Marmie, etc.) that I couldn't possibly name them all.This book is one that I think everyone absolutely MUST read some time in their life, for it teaches moral values that should be used by people of all ages. I also reccommend Little Men and Jo's Boys to follow it up."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \\"Little Women\\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature. Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home.

None have captured the hearts and minds of the feminine creature as has this famed American author. Whether the reader desires a realistic period piece or a touching story about life, love, death and the human condition, Alcott covers all the bases. Few women can come away from &quot;Little Women&quot; without having made a connection to the personalities which transcend the constraints of the time the novels reflects. Jo is every author's heroine. Beth, our picture of healthy mind, healthy soul, and healthy spirituality. Meg is the mother-to-be in us all, and Amy the ill-tempered blossom who grows to the beautiful woman (inside and out) that we all dream we are. Classic novels are more than artillery for our educational arsenal, they are explorations of ourselves. &quot;Little Women&quot; does not disappoint to be all that and much more."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Louisa May Alcott weaves a wonderful and touching tale about the March sisters:Amy,Meg,Beth and Jo.The way she describes it,tells the story,has a touch of old-fashioned charm in it,taking one back to the days of long gowns,bonnets,rich lords and ladies and the such.The four sisters' personalities are also vividly described in Louisa Alcott's eyes."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This story is very interesting and good.It talks about alot of different things, like sorrows, mishaps, love, etc.I especcially like Jo."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"a very nice story. you can read it as many times as you want. it is always fresh."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I really loved this book.

Them living in poverty being angry about not having all of the things that they wnat, and them doing good for others by giving them their Christmas breakfast. Sisters will always argue, but they learned to love each other in spite of the things that made them mad. Each of them had something that they had a passion for and they loved each others work. They all loved to read the stories that Jowrote, and tey loved to hear about all of the parties that Meg attended, and listen to the music that Beth played, and Admire the pictures that Amy drew.

Nor is the theme concerned with the &quot;tension between social responsibility &amp; individual and artistic freedom&quot; except in the fevered dreams of academic collectivists obsessed with &quot;group identities&quot; who have instigated more cultural disintegration then anyone since the anarchist 60's by eroding all Individual Responsibility &amp; intellectual standards.

There was absolutely no humor and I frankly didn't care what happened to the very unreal characters. The four sisters were too different to be actually related and Beth was too much of an angel. At the end of the novel, I did not find that I was attached to any of the characters.The book did not give me any emotional satisfaction and there were too many plots going at once.However, I will give some points to the quality of the plot. It was very realistic and surprising. Set during and after the Civil War, the March sisters(Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy)struggle to grow up and, if not conquer, at least suppress their worst faults.In short: This is an okay book, but I would never reread it.Recommended instead: Anne of Green Gables series(characters are much more satisfying)"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"The words are so crowded.

What a disappointment. I couldn't even read the whole thing. I only read the first 176 pages out of 470, so if the last half is better than the first half, I wouldn't know. Thank you to other reviewers for giving me the major plot points. I skimmed a few of those and that was enough for me. I didn't want to spend any more of my time reading what I felt was a boring book. I liked three characters, Jo, Laurie and Beth, but again not enough to want to read the rest of the book. It was too syrupy sweet with the mother teaching her girls values such as helping those less fortunate than yourself, control your temper, work hard, be polite etc. These are nice values, and this might be more desirable for a parent to read to young daughters. Although be aware that there are a couple of deaths of main characters. For me, this book was not good enough. I want entertainment, creativity, surprise, unexpected events and interesting characters. I prefer books like Twilight and Harry Potter for young adults and myself.Data:There is no sexual content which makes it appropriate for children. Setting: 1860s the North during the civil war.

Poor Ms. Alcott's stories have fallen on the sword of the sparkling fast-paced prose of the likes of J.K. Rowling and the modern poetic stories of such authors as Alice Walker. Little Women is the story of four New England daughters of a father away fighting in the American Civil War. Illustrating their bravery and spirit, coming of age, romances and tragedies, I remember happily losing myself in their story, but now find the language so ponderous that it is impossible to re-read.

I purchased this for my spouse as a gift and she adores it."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Louisa May Alcott's LITTLE WOMEN is a classic novel about the four March daughters, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy, who live in New England at the time of the American Civil War. The book was originally published in two parts in 1868 and 1869; the first part concerns the girls while their father is away serving as a Union chaplain and the family is suffering financial hardship; the second half follows the girls as they marry, encounter tragedy and celebrate love. I recently read LITTLE WOMEN in the Sterling edition to my ten-year old daughter.The story holds up quite well 150 years after first publication. The first half is more accessible to pre-teen children. It isn't quite as reflective as the second half, which ponders more the trials of life. Understandably, the challenges of courtship and of married life aren't perhaps so compelling a topic for the pre-teen set. Moreover, the second part gravitates towards the melodramatic; it doesn't always ring true. The first half, on the other hand, engages the reader by deftly defining the attributes of each of the sisters: Meg, the responsible one; Beth, the sensitive one; Jo, the tom-boyish writer; and Amy, the girly-girl artist. The strong bonds between the girls are developed in the first half, and more just seems to happen, especially since their wealthy next-door neighbor Laurie, a friendly boy who is equal parts good hearted and playful, is an object of endless fascination to them. It's not surprising that children's adaptations focus more on the first half of the book.As one might expect, the novel does engage in moralizing. Each one of the children has to overcome defects in her character; Jo, for instance, is hot tempered. The lessons are just obvious enough to young readers, though they might be a little hackneyed for the modern adult reader. However that may be, one can be assured that the book promotes traditional family values. It is also refreshingly progressive--for a nineteenth-century novel--on the role of women in society; the daughters are not expected to set aside their personal goals for their husbands. Jo, for instance, tells her husband-to-be, \\"I have my duty also, and my work. I couldn't enjoy myself if I neglected them even for you...\\" (p. 509).The Sterling editions are well priced and nicely produced. They have decent bindings, generally good if spare illustrations (the illustrations in this volume are especially spare), and include a ribbon for marking one's place. These editions would make a nice addition to a child's library."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"i love this book every thing about it i don't think i would read it very fast but i read it in 4 days i couldn't put it down my favorite is Laurie he is so funny and sweet, and Jo is so sweet but tries not to act like it i could go on and on.

Thewarmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and fun little anecdotes of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel New England poverty with their Marmee, while their father is away in the Civil War. The girls don't let lack of money hamper their fun and happiness. But their world starts to expand when Jo befriends \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, and soon he and his tutor are almost a part of their family.Along with him, the girls encounter many of the bumps of growing up -- the destruction of Jo's treasured writing, romps with wealthier pals, Amy's expulsion from school, and Meg's reluctant first romance. But their lives are turned upside-down when Beth contracts scarlet fever, and they receive news that their father has been seriously injured -- and these crises threaten to destroy the heart of their family.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding -- if not to her dream guy, then to her love. But while time has mellowed and matured the Little Women, it hasn't lessened the capacity for conflict and unintentional comedy -- particularly with the now-attractive Amy, whose attempts to pursue art, culture and the appearance of wealthy sophistication usually go horribly wrong.But the platonic friendship between Laurie and Jo is shattered when he admits his true feelings to her... and gets rejected. Distraught, he goes to Europe, as does Amy with crusty old Aunt March. And left in New England, Jo is faced with the question of what her life has in store, despite Beth's picturesquely poor health. Her new job as a governess leads her to put her treasured stories into print... leading her to love and her future.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women\\" -- and since the March girls really are like the girls next door, this doesn't exactly come as a shock. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays a post-\\"blood and thunder\\" Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.And it does. Alcott's writing is a warm, smooth string of interconnected stories, some of them quiet and some peppered with silly jokes, moments of tragedy, poetry, and unintentional humiliation (\\"Salt instead of sugar. And the cream is sour\\"). Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.The best part of this book is the March girls themselves -- they have flaws and strengths, ambitions and dreams that never quite turn out as they expect. And their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster, or Meg's makeover at a rich friend's house -- have the feeling of authenticity.Lovable Jo is the quintessential tomboy -- rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and while Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, by her teens she's almost as likable as Jo.It must be admitted that Beth is not quite as endearing -- she's canonized with the 19th-century approach to the deceased, and so is continuously sweet, loving and understanding. But Laurie makes up for this: a wealthy, artistic, passionate young man who goes through all the growing pains, as he tries to be worthy of the girl he adores. Don't worry, things turn out all right for him.\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today.

Jo, Meg, Amy, and Beth show us all of the mountains a girl could encounter.Meg, the oldest is strong and beautiful. Beth, slowly washing away like a wave upon the sand. Amy, the youngest and fiercest, would marry for wealth. Jo, fits in her own category. These historical \\"little women\\" are an inspiration.In my eyes the girls should be read by all. The second I began reading this miraculous piece of work my fingers began to cramp for they were turning the pages of my book much quicker than I had predicted. The friendships and relationships this book has to offer are so much fun to read about, especially anybody who has been a 12 year old girl.Louisa May Alcott uses a wonderful narrative voice to tell the story. She also has very good character development in the beginning she shows you Meg, Amy, Beth, and Jo; you can practically feel the wind rushing through your hair as you gallantly stride in and out of the pages.The work of this incredible author, Louisa May Alcott, is truly inspiring, those of you who want to read a flawless book sprint to your local library or bookstore and pick up a copy of Little Women."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, from her \\"blood and thunder\\" tales to heartwarming novels about teens growing up.But there's something special about \\"Little Women,\\" a fictionalized account of her own family's growing pins.

If you area fan of this piece, or would like to read it for the first time, I wouldhighly reccommend this edition. I would not, however, read theintroduction until after the text itself has been read, since, as a rule,intorductions usually give something away (often times even quoting fromthe book itself) &amp; this one is no exception. However, this edition offersa marvelous set of endnotes which help the reader to better understandsome unfamiliar terms.Most importantly, however, is the fact that Showalter has chosen topresent Alcott's novel, IN ITS ORIGINAL FORM. The chapters have beenrenumbered to maintain coherence, however, every word is true to theoriginal. It may not be known (as I did not know myself until I happenedupon this edition purely by accident) that there are two editions ofLittle Women currently in print. The second being altered slightly, asper a publisher's request (to remove certain slang and change somelanguage to what was considered more proper). This edition contains theORIGINAL text, as Alcott intended it, &amp; the majority of versions I haveseen contain the altered version, making the original wording very hardto find, indeed.I would definitely reccommend that anyone interested in this bookpurchase this edition, you won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"My mom bought me the book, Little Women, quite a few years ago. I'm a book worm and proud to admit it, but I didn't get around to reading this classic novel until a few weeks ago. I'm not sure why I put it off for so long, but I'm glad I didn't wait any longer. This a beautiful and rich tale that takes us to the past, where a whole different world awaits to be explored. Little Women is a must read!Little Women is the perfect story for the truly romantic person. Not just romance in the sense of love, but in the classical sense. Something being historical, timely, and good hearted. Little Women is full of the virtue and lessons that we try to find in our daily life. At the end, the reader is engulfed in happiness and satisfaction. Though not a deep, philosophical work, it provides its own morals, brought out in a way that can be enjoyed from generation to generation.The story centers around the lives of the 4 March sisters: Jo (Josephine), Meg (Margaret), Beth (Elizabeth), and Amy. Each sister possesses a unique personality with their mother as their link and loving companion. In the early part of this Louisa May Alcott novel, Mr. March is away at war and his daughters show concern for his welfare. It is said that Alcott didn't know what to do with the father's character so she wrote him as being gone to war. A genius solution to a literary block! Anyway, the story centers around the trials and tribulations of each girl and the family, as a whole. The family is poor, but still live to do good...or try to be good at least. Though it seems unrealistic that the family should be in bliss even in poverty, Alcott brings the fantasy level to ground level by portraying the girls as being a little selfish. With all the beautiful clothes and delicate manners, who could blame them for getting carried away with vanity. However, we also experience what lessons the girls have learned and appreciate their honesty. The family is not always going through pleasant situations, but take a share in heartache and loss, as every family does.In a time when modesty is not exactly a trend, Little Women sets a bar all on its own. It will warm your heart, even if you've already read the novel four hundred times. So, take some time out of your day to read the exhilarating trials of the \\"Little Women\\"."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I did not think that I would enjoy this book. After years of avoiding this paragon of femenine literature, I finally gave in and read it, and I'm glad that I did. This book is great. The author's use of language, the way that she writes is a pure pleasure to read. She also has her finger on the pulse of human character; I'm sure that is one reason this book is regarded as a classic. The characters experiences seem genuine and are truly touching. But for one glaring miss on the emotions of one character, I think the book is flawless and stands as a wonderful exposition on character and human relationships. I rate the book 4 and 1/2 stars, and would wholeheartedly recommend it to all the men out there that shy away from &quot;women's literature.&quot;"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Because of the reviews, I almost didn't read this book because I thought it must really be best suited for young teens. I'm so glad I bought it anyway. I found the characters so endearing and the story so full of emotion that this became one of my favorite books. I'm not sure many guys I know would care for it, but I can't imagine a female of any age not loving it."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Before I read this book, I thought that magic and spells and imaginary books were the best. Then my mom told me I should read this book because I was going to love it. And she was totally right. The good thing about this book is that it is real. I have to admit it: I fell in love with the real characters. This book shows that life can be great with love. Louisa transmits feelings, and reading this book you feel happiness, sadness, and lots of stuff. My mom told me that she even cried when she read the book. The characters will become your imaginary friends and I'm sure that, after reading this book, you will see life in another way. In a few words: I love this book and I'm sure you will love it too."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"\\"Little Women\\" is like the best vanilla ice cream-simple, sweet, pure, and something that always seems good, no matter what else you read (or eat!). As most of you know, \\"Little Women\\" is the chronicle of the four March sisters (Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy) and their family, as they grow up in 1860's New England. Part autobiography, it is easy to see why it has become the classic it is.Sure, the \\"slang\\" is noticeably dated, the writing style is definitely \\"1800's\\", but the characters are what really makes this book great. Louisa May Alcott's chatty, graceful writing style is the epitome of warmth, and it definitely helps the characters to \\"come-alive.\\" Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy themselves are portrayed honestly, and the reader feels just like they are having a visit with the March as they read about Jo's highstrung good nature, Amy's hilarious \\"airs\\" and worries about her \\"un-Grecian\\" nose, Beth's good-as-gold sweetness, and Meg's gentle womanliness. The girls' struggles with poverty are gradually overcome throughout the book, and Marmee (as the girls call their mother) is a timeless beacon of love and lessons for the girls to take refuge in.\\"Little Women\\" is divided into two parts-I find the first to be (generally) slightly more well-written, and the second sometimes to be a little too long-winded and descriptive (the extensive descriptions and place names that chronicle Amy's European adventure are sometimes meaningless and boring to the reader). However, it is worth \\"plowing through\\" some less-than-choice chapters, for the end is pure gold, and the conclusion shows all of the sisters happy with their lives and reinforces the loving bonds of the March family.\\"Little Women\\" is truly a book that will make you laugh and cry. I would suggest that you be at least 12 before you read this alone (I usually don't give age ranges for books, but slight wordiness and some very involved passages are reason for it this time). Still, when confronted with the sheer warmth, honesty, and human emotion that come from the pages of \\"Little Women\\", it is easy to forgive some small faults."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I saw the movie first, but then I couldn't understand English(accent) as I do now. Then my sister bought this book, and I just found myself intrested in the first page of the book!!!!!Its about 4 sisters Meg, Jo, Beth,and Amy. It warms your heart when the sisters sit together near the fire and read the letter from their father, and when Jo cuts her hair. You laugh when Jo and Laurie meet their 1st time and talks funnily. You cry when their marmee have to go to their daddy, &amp; especially when Beth dies. You get angry when Amy burns Jo's precious dairy. And you will feel bad when Jo refuses Laurie and wish she hadnt done that. I still now wish Jo married Teddy. Meg is happy with John and I'm happy for her, also for Amy. But the sad part, I think is how Jo loves Beth and is ready to give her whole life for Beth. Mr. Bhaer and Jo gets married and .....read LITTLE MEN!!!!!!

I soon picked up the book after that and could not put it down. It was wonderful! This is a story of four sisters facing the hardships of a nation at war, finding love, losing family, and having to grow up. This is a must read for every young woman as well as adults who will be able to appreciate this story all over again."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little Women was a classic,but it wasn't as good as I thought it would be. It was interesting, I'll give it that, but it didn't have the key things that a good piece of literature should have.It was set in New England and told the lives,sometimes dull lives, of the four March girls. Their hardships,sorrows, and happy times is what this book is all about. Desciption is really good in Little Women. When the girls' father goes to war, the girls and their mother wait for a lette, that would never come. Overall, 3 stars is all this book gets, nothing more nothing less. Remember there are always two sides to a loved classic book; it may be loved by some but disliked by others."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I remember first reading &quot;LW&quot; when I was in 5th grade.

It really was a &quot;progressive&quot;book for it's time in that these girls had ambitions beyond just getting married, is about following your bliss,doingwhat makes you happy and living your life to the fullest.
